Have you ever received an email
from an unknown source

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
informing you of great news?

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re a grand prize winner!

Just click on the link
to receive your prize.”

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe it was a phone call.

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The person says they have exciting news.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’ve just won something of value.

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But hurry!

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Limited time only!”

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All you have to do
is provide your personal information.

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sadly, the great and exciting news

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually doesn’t turn out
as presented, does it?

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This highlights that no matter the form
or method that we receive it,

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much of the news and information
we’re given today

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misleads, misinforms,

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often leaves us disappointed.

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:56.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our world is just saturated with bad news.

00:00:56.243 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even just watching the local news
can leave us feeling anxious, depressed

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even fearful.

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s no wonder that when people
actually do receive good news,

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re often skeptical,

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feeling that if something
seems too good to be true,

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it probably is.

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that it’s actually wise

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be cautious about the news we believe.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:27.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it also tells us that there is news
—good news—

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can trust.

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to turn with me, please,
in your Bibles to the book of Mark.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Mark chapter 1,

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the words of Mark 1:14, 15

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it reads:

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now after John was arrested,
Jesus went into Galilee,

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“preaching the good news of God and saying:

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:55.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The appointed time has been fulfilled,

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the Kingdom of God has drawn near.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Repent,

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith in the good news.’”

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have faith in the good news.”

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the theme of our discussion.

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To better understand Jesus’ words,

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to answer three questions.

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:21.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, What is the good news?

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Why can we have faith in it?

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, How can we build such faith?

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing the answers to these questions
will help us to have faith in the good news

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fill our life with real purpose.

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:41.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s address our first question.

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What specifically is the “good news”
that Jesus was referring to?

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go back to the Bible,
this time to the book of Luke.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Luke chapter 8,

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice Luke 8:1:

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shortly afterward he traveled from city
to city and from village to village,

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“preaching and declaring the good news
of the Kingdom of God.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Twelve were with him.”

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was that “good news”
that Jesus preached?

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse states: “The good news

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:25.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Kingdom of God.”

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:28.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So an important aspect of the good news

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the message about God’s Kingdom.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This Kingdom is a real government in heaven

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:38.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a heavenly King and earthly subjects.

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ earthly life as a grown man

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:43.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was devoted to preaching
and declaring God’s Kingdom

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the only solution to man’s problems.

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did he do it?

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the simplest of tools

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his mouth and his feet.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, he walked tirelessly
from city to city and village to village

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:03.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—hundreds of miles on dusty roads,
even without food at times,

00:04:03.722 --> 00:04:07.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to share this message with others.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even taught his disciples this good news

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could share
and extend the good news

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:16.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well beyond the cities and villages
that Jesus reached.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you might be wondering,

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:24.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why should this good news
that Jesus preached about 2,000 years ago

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be of interest to us today?’

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because the message of the good news
that Jesus taught

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:33.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
promises future blessings

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:37.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for obedient humans living
under the rulership of God’s Kingdom.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that affects all mankind today.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That affects you and me.

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:46.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these blessings will touch
every facet of life.

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a few examples.

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with our physical health.

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:56.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 33,

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:05.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read
the first part of verse 24.

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:09.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 33:24:

00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:15.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, that’s such a simple statement,

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:23.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can you just process what that means?

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To never again say or hear someone say:

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m sick,”

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:35.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t feel well,”

00:05:35.272 --> 00:05:38.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Something is not right with me.”

00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think of the millions

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have suffered illness
because of the pandemic,

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:49.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the millions that are coping
with a disability,

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then all the diseases

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the diseases that are common,

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the diseases that are rare,

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:03.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones that are life-threatening,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chronic, debilitating,

00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:10.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the diseases where you look
fine on the outside

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:14.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inside it’s a day-to-day struggle.

00:06:16.188 --> 00:06:19.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, under God’s Kingdom, all of it

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:22.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all disabilities, all diseases,
all health problems—

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will no longer plague mankind.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will all be a thing of the past.

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:32.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just to show you how wonderful this is
—how far reaching this blessing will be—

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:35.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we don’t have
a disease or disability,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of what your life
would be like right now

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:42.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just didn’t hurt.

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, right now, it hurts
if we stand too long;

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it hurts if we sit too long;
it hurts if we walk too long

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:52.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if we sleep too long.

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:56.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to be pain free

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:58.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know that each day

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re just going to feel better and better,

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:05.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t that good news?

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, so much is going
to be accomplished from this promise:

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:13.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[No one] will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:18.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider another blessing.

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:21.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a family head,
we know it’s a priority for you

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:26.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for your family
and keep a roof over their heads.

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:30.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it a struggle to make ends meet?

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:33.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How often do you worry about having a job

00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:36.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or keeping your job?

00:07:36.018 --> 00:07:40.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just think of how you’ll feel
when these words become a reality.

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:44.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still in the book of Isaiah,
this time Isaiah chapter 65,

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:50.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note verses 21 and 22:

00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will build houses and live in them,

00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:00.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:03.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:09.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:14.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:17.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the blessing?

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:21.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will be homeless or unemployed.

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:22.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you note?

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:25.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nowhere in these verses do we see the words

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:28.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rent” or “lease.”

00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under this Kingdom arrangement, you see,
we’re going to experience

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the full joy of ownership.

00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:38.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that?

00:08:38.413 --> 00:08:42.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine the satisfaction
—the dignity—

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:46.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from living in a home
you personally built

00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then working with your hands
for the direct benefit of your family?

00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:54.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good feeling, isn’t it?

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:56.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, if you’re planting
your own vineyard,

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:59.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, that’s an indication
of another blessing

00:08:59.643 --> 00:09:02.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an abundance of food.

00:09:02.813 --> 00:09:04.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes this quite beautifully.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:07.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to the book of Psalms,

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 72nd Psalm,

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:20.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note Psalm 72:16:

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:26.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.

00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:31.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon,

00:09:31.758 --> 00:09:36.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the cities people will blossom
like the vegetation of the earth.”

00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:40.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve all seen heartbreaking pictures

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:44.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of neglected and starving children.

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:49.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve likely seen the increasing number
of food lines during this pandemic.

00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:51.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you see, under God’s government,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no one will be without sufficient food
or undernourished.

00:09:55.907 --> 00:10:00.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poverty and food shortages will be gone.

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:04.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful word picture
this verse gives us

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:07.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how the ground will produce abundantly!

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:12.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be as if grain were growing
along the sides of a mountain

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:15.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clear to the top and overflowing.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we have so many wonderful blessings
to look forward to.

00:10:20.223 --> 00:10:23.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for this next blessing,

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:25.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God will use his creative powers

00:10:25.729 --> 00:10:29.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do one of the most wonderful works
of all time.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:32.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to the book of Isaiah,

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:37.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time Isaiah 25:8.

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:47.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Isaiah 25:8

00:10:49.085 --> 00:10:51.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there we’re told:

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:54.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will swallow up death forever,

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:59.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:04.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The reproach of his people
he will take away from all the earth,

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:07.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah himself has spoken it.”

00:11:08.813 --> 00:11:13.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, some may consider this
to be the best news of all.

00:11:13.026 --> 00:11:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it is going to be

00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:19.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when “death will be no more,”
removed forever!

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:24.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If any of us have ever had
someone close to us

00:11:24.412 --> 00:11:26.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taken away by death,

00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:30.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know the emptiness, the anguish,

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:34.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the painful scars that death leaves behind.

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:36.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s something that affects all of us.

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:39.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just think, how many memorial services

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have you attended in this pandemic?

00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:45.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, for some,
it’s just too painful to think about.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother made the statement; he said:

00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:52.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t even look forward
to Saturdays anymore.

00:11:52.107 --> 00:11:56.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that Saturdays have been set aside
for funeral and memorial services.”

00:11:57.654 --> 00:11:59.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can relate to that, can’t we?

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:01.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see what the Bible says?

00:12:01.783 --> 00:12:05.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that God
is going to “swallow up death forever.”

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when something is swallowed,
it’s gone—destroyed.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:14.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is going to be a time to rejoice.

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:16.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the good news doesn’t stop there

00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:20.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because not only is Jehovah
going to put an end to death

00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:23.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also note what he does next.

00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:26.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look over in chapter 26, this time verse 19.

00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:30.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Your dead will live.

00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:33.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My corpses will rise up.

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:36.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Awake and shout joyfully,
you residents in the dust!

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For your dew is as the dew of the morning,

00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:44.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the earth will let
those powerless in death come to life.”

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we’re talking about the resurrection.

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:54.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dead loved ones will return to life.

00:12:54.085 --> 00:12:56.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you note the expression there:

00:12:56.254 --> 00:13:00.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Awake and shout joyfully.”

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:02.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was interesting
that <i>The New English Bible</i>

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:04.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quotes this as saying:

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:07.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They that sleep in the earth

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:10.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will awake and shout for joy.”

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:13.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doesn’t that nicely describe
how right now

00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:17.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our dead loved ones are just sleeping?

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:22.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just like an infant is protected
within its mother’s womb,

00:13:22.614 --> 00:13:26.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dead are
in the safest situation imaginable,

00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:29.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perfectly preserved and protected

00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:32.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within Jehovah’s memory.

00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:36.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in God’s due time,
they will be brought back to life.

00:13:36.211 --> 00:13:38.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can be there.

00:13:38.213 --> 00:13:41.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be there to warmly welcome them

00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:45.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like a newborn is greeted
by a loving, waiting family

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so many tremendous blessings.

00:13:49.474 --> 00:13:51.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these blessings that we’ve considered,

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is just a small sampling
of the good news.

00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:58.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s so much more
that this Kingdom will accomplish.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Psalm 46:9,
war will cease to exist.

00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:05.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Revelation 11:18,

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:08.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anyone and anything that dirties the earth,

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:12.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pollutes the air and water,
or kills off the earth’s wildlife,

00:14:12.205 --> 00:14:15.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God promises that he will “bring to ruin

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:19.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those [who ruin, or pollute,] the earth.”

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve established the answer
to our first question,

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the good news?

00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:31.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news is the news of God’s Kingdom,

00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:34.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this heavenly government that will rule

00:14:34.227 --> 00:14:37.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provide tremendous blessings
to obedient mankind.

00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:43.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with all these wonderful promises
in store for mankind,

00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:47.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you think of any better news
that you’d like to receive?

00:14:47.323 --> 00:14:52.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t you agree that these promises
are worth investigating?

00:14:52.162 --> 00:14:54.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed they are.

00:14:54.581 --> 00:14:57.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s the challenge:

00:14:57.208 --> 00:15:00.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The idea of living forever
under such wonderful conditions

00:15:00.754 --> 00:15:03.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might be difficult for some to comprehend,

00:15:03.757 --> 00:15:08.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with what life is like
right now at present.

00:15:09.387 --> 00:15:12.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what if those that hear this good news

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are skeptical?

00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:16.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if they feel,

00:15:16.853 --> 00:15:19.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If it seems too good to be true,

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:21.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it probably is’?

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:28.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address this
by answering our second question,

00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:32.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we have faith in the good news?

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:34.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, why can we firmly believe

00:15:34.996 --> 00:15:39.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all the things we’ve just considered,
all these promises from God, are true

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:42.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be fulfilled?

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:47.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just like any news,
or information, that we receive,

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:52.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the credibility all starts
with the Source, doesn’t it?

00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:56.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news comes
from Jehovah God himself.

00:15:56.518 --> 00:15:59.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s note what the Bible says about him.

00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:02.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Titus,

00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:05.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Titus chapter 1,

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read

00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Titus 1:1, 2:

00:16:14.994 --> 00:16:19.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul, a slave of God
and an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:22.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the faith of God’s chosen ones

00:16:22.168 --> 00:16:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the accurate knowledge of the truth
that is according to godly devotion

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is based on a hope
of the everlasting life

00:16:29.133 --> 00:16:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God, who cannot lie,

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
promised long ago.”

00:16:36.474 --> 00:16:40.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can be certain
that these promises will be fulfilled

00:16:40.812 --> 00:16:45.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Bible tells us
we have a basis for hope,

00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “God, who cannot lie,”

00:16:48.903 --> 00:16:51.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the one who made these promises.

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:56.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what exactly does this mean?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s illustrate it this way.

00:16:59.163 --> 00:17:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever asked a friend to meet you
or pick you up to go somewhere,

00:17:03.918 --> 00:17:06.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your friend says: “Oh, no problem.

00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be there at 7:00.”

00:17:08.047 --> 00:17:10.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as he says it,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you already know he’s not coming until 7:30,

00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even 8:00.

00:17:16.097 --> 00:17:19.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all seem to have that friend, don’t we?

00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do we know this about our friend?

00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:25.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likely it’s because of his past record.

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:29.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, if our friend,
although well-intentioned,

00:17:29.027 --> 00:17:31.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a pattern of being late,

00:17:31.362 --> 00:17:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s given us a basis

00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:37.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to question his promise.

00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:40.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, as humans,
we’re all imperfect.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is our record of works

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:46.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forms a basis for our credibility.

00:17:48.087 --> 00:17:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we elevate this to our Almighty God.

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:54.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to Jehovah,

00:17:54.802 --> 00:17:58.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Source of the good news,
the one “who cannot lie,”

00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:01.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, if we examine his record, we’ll see

00:18:01.184 --> 00:18:04.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has given us a basis to trust him.

00:18:04.604 --> 00:18:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a perfect record
of fulfilling his promises;

00:18:07.815 --> 00:18:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they come true 100 percent of the time.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not
just the general prophecy itself;

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:21.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s the accurate details as well.

00:18:22.747 --> 00:18:25.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the prophet Isaiah foretold

00:18:25.792 --> 00:18:30.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the mighty city of Babylon
would be destroyed.

00:18:30.296 --> 00:18:35.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he went into detail
of exactly how the city would be defeated

00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:40.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from the river being dried up
to the gates being left wide open.

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:42.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even named the one
who was going to overthrow Babylon

00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:46.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 200 years before it happened.

00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And history confirms
that every detail of this prophecy

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was fulfilled.

00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:55.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was even prophesied that Babylon
would become piles of stone

00:18:55.947 --> 00:18:58.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “never [again] be inhabited.”

00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:02.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that stands true down to this day.

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is just one
of a number of prophecies.

00:19:06.749 --> 00:19:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when we take the time
to investigate, we find other prophecies

00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:14.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the number of years
when the land of Judah would be desolate,

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:16.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exact year when the Messiah would come,

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he would be born, what he would do,

00:19:18.886 --> 00:19:21.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he would die and be raised from the dead

00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all fulfilled exactly as foretold.

00:19:28.062 --> 00:19:31.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fact that so many Bible prophecies

00:19:31.649 --> 00:19:33.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have already come true

00:19:33.651 --> 00:19:36.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows that we can trust

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:39.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the Bible says about the future.

00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another reason
we can have faith in the good news.

00:19:44.912 --> 00:19:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to our Bibles,
this time to Matthew chapter 9.

00:19:52.754 --> 00:19:57.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Matthew chapter 9, note verse 35:

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jesus set out on a tour
of all the cities and villages,

00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:08.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teaching in their synagogues and preaching
the good news of the Kingdom

00:20:08.436 --> 00:20:13.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and curing every sort of disease
and every sort of infirmity.”

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:16.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you recall, earlier we discussed
the efforts Jesus put forth

00:20:16.277 --> 00:20:18.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to declare the good news.

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:22.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we see that as he went
to those cities and villages,

00:20:22.075 --> 00:20:25.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only did he preach but,
empowered by God,

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he performed miracles

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:32.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prove the credibility of the good news.

00:20:32.043 --> 00:20:36.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of those miracles
were witnessed by thousands

00:20:36.756 --> 00:20:41.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point where they cannot be denied
even by his opposers.

00:20:42.553 --> 00:20:44.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to this point,

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve established what the good news is
—the news regarding God’s Kingdom—

00:20:49.393 --> 00:20:54.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we’ve answered
why we can have faith in the good news.

00:20:54.398 --> 00:20:58.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Source of the good news is Jehovah,

00:20:58.277 --> 00:21:00.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a God “who cannot lie”

00:21:00.363 --> 00:21:04.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who has a perfect track record
of keeping his promises.

00:21:04.826 --> 00:21:09.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then God’s Son, Jesus Christ,
who as King of God’s Kingdom

00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:12.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
solidified that evidence
during his time on the earth

00:21:12.917 --> 00:21:17.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by demonstrating the power
to cure disease and infirmity.

00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:23.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, there are millions of people
from a variety of backgrounds

00:21:23.094 --> 00:21:27.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have taken the time to investigate
the promises of God’s Kingdom.

00:21:27.765 --> 00:21:30.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have found them to be true,

00:21:30.017 --> 00:21:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have benefited from the good news.

00:21:33.396 --> 00:21:35.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has improved their lives now

00:21:35.398 --> 00:21:38.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given them a solid hope for the future.

00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:41.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to watch the following video,

00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:45.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as you do,
note how some have benefited

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the good news.

00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:57.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear and war were normal in my home country.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had many questions:

00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:02.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do young people have to die?

00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:04.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do my children have to go through this?

00:22:05.511 --> 00:22:07.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
God did not create us to make war.

00:22:07.722 --> 00:22:10.308 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The priests in my church always said,

00:22:10.308 --> 00:22:12.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is God’s will.”

00:22:13.853 --> 00:22:16.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being on the run was dreadful.

00:22:16.022 --> 00:22:18.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than once,
I thought we were going to die.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:20.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, we arrived in Germany,

00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:24.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was convinced that the priests there
could give me some answers.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to several different churches

00:22:28.117 --> 00:22:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but no answers.

00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:33.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept telling them:
“I’m looking for something.

00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:37.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what it is,
but I didn’t find it here with you.”

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I thought
I was searching for something

00:22:40.504 --> 00:22:42.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no one could give me.

00:22:44.383 --> 00:22:46.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, 

00:22:46.302 --> 00:22:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a German woman approached me,
speaking in Arabic.

00:22:49.138 --> 00:22:51.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was amazing for me.

00:22:51.557 --> 00:22:54.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had a good opinion
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:22:54.727 --> 00:22:57.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t think
I could learn anything from her,

00:22:57.772 --> 00:22:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I gave her a chance.

00:23:00.358 --> 00:23:05.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave me logical answers
to all of my questions.

00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:12.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my home country, there are
multiple religious groups and nationalities

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who hate and fight each other.

00:23:15.623 --> 00:23:18.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:23:18.876 --> 00:23:22.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen that all people
can live in peace with each other

00:23:22.088 --> 00:23:25.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they get to know our Father in heaven.

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:28.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives love and peace.

00:23:28.135 --> 00:23:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, I found what I had been looking for.

00:23:39.438 --> 00:23:42.441 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I lived a life without rules.

00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:44.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to get drunk,

00:23:44.443 --> 00:23:48.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked a lot,
and I became a compulsive gambler.

00:23:48.614 --> 00:23:52.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My behavior was a complete disaster.

00:23:52.994 --> 00:23:55.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife wanted to separate from me.

00:23:57.498 --> 00:24:00.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a horrible time.

00:24:00.126 --> 00:24:04.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife started studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember being doubtful

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very doubtful.

00:24:09.385 --> 00:24:13.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was one thing
that started to make me think.

00:24:13.931 --> 00:24:18.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both my wife and my children
looked more peaceful,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more joyful, happier.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I even accepted a Bible study.

00:24:26.694 --> 00:24:31.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize that Jehovah
loves each one of us as an individual.

00:24:31.532 --> 00:24:34.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gave me real hope for the future.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I was studying in the Bible

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:39.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to understand

00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:43.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doing Jehovah’s will
is in our best interests.

00:24:45.212 --> 00:24:48.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really helped me to quit my bad habits,

00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:51.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
treat my family better,

00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show due respect to my wife.

00:24:55.264 --> 00:24:58.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah hadn’t searched for me,

00:24:58.934 --> 00:25:00.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I hadn’t come to know him,

00:25:00.936 --> 00:25:03.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would no longer be a family.

00:25:05.024 --> 00:25:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today we are, indeed, a happy family,

00:25:08.444 --> 00:25:11.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a united family

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—united more than ever.

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:19.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle.

00:25:23.667 --> 00:25:26.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address our final question,

00:25:26.921 --> 00:25:31.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you and I
build faith in the good news?

00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:35.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that just like our sister
in the video,

00:25:35.096 --> 00:25:37.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have gone through situations in our life

00:25:37.598 --> 00:25:40.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that leave us searching for answers.

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:42.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our search might provide us

00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:47.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with incorrect or misinformed information
about God.

00:25:47.858 --> 00:25:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up again,
How can we know?

00:25:52.321 --> 00:25:56.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be sure of what to believe?

00:25:56.325 --> 00:25:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible gives us the answer.

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:01.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hebrews.

00:26:03.874 --> 00:26:07.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And note what is stated at Hebrews chapter 11

00:26:09.255 --> 00:26:11.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 1.

00:26:13.384 --> 00:26:15.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:

00:26:15.386 --> 00:26:19.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:26:19.723 --> 00:26:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the evident demonstration of realities

00:26:23.185 --> 00:26:25.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not seen.”

00:26:25.646 --> 00:26:30.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you note the footnote there
for “evident demonstration”;

00:26:30.234 --> 00:26:34.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “convincing evidence.”

00:26:34.613 --> 00:26:39.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that helps us to see
that real faith is not gullible.

00:26:39.577 --> 00:26:44.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like with the scammers
and misinformation we spoke of earlier,

00:26:44.081 --> 00:26:47.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, we don’t believe what we hear
just because it sounds good.

00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:48.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:52.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the footnote says, there should be
“convincing evidence”

00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:56.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of things that are not seen and are yet real.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:27:01.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to illustrate this, a child may ask,

00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:05.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How do we know that air exists?”

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:07.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can’t say: “Well, it just does.

00:27:07.188 --> 00:27:08.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how it works.”

00:27:08.772 --> 00:27:09.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:27:09.648 --> 00:27:12.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, likely we’d have
to help the child to reason

00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:15.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the evidence that exists
—right?—

00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:18.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his ability to breathe air in and out,

00:27:18.782 --> 00:27:22.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the effects of the wind, and so forth.

00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:26.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once the child is convinced
of the evidence,

00:27:26.457 --> 00:27:30.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can now accept the existence

00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:32.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is invisible to him

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in this case, the air.

00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:39.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is how our faith has to be.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:44.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to be based
on solid convincing evidence.

00:27:46.143 --> 00:27:50.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide
have faith in the good news.

00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:53.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have made an examination
of the Bible’s promises,

00:27:53.901 --> 00:27:56.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’ve seen the evidence for themselves.

00:27:56.487 --> 00:27:59.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like our brother in the video,
we’ve also seen

00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:02.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the good news
has not only improved our lives

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:07.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it shows us evidence
of Jehovah’s love for us as well.

00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:11.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who are listening to this program
may be newly acquainted

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:14.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:17.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d like to tell you
that we are so happy

00:28:17.007 --> 00:28:19.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you took the time to attend.

00:28:19.593 --> 00:28:22.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that you too may have questions

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you need answers—truthful answers.

00:28:27.643 --> 00:28:31.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, give Jehovah’s Witnesses a chance.

00:28:31.855 --> 00:28:36.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give them a chance to help you find
those answers in the Bible.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you associate with them,

00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how they have come
to believe the good news

00:28:40.656 --> 00:28:42.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why they have faith in it.

00:28:42.741 --> 00:28:45.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as your faith grows,
you’ll come to appreciate

00:28:45.786 --> 00:28:48.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how important this message is.

00:28:48.831 --> 00:28:52.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will move you to make
any needed changes in your life.

00:28:52.126 --> 00:28:55.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of the joy
and happiness you feel,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, you will be excited, right?

00:28:57.339 --> 00:29:00.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to share
what you have learned with others.

00:29:00.134 --> 00:29:02.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s good, for doing so

00:29:02.553 --> 00:29:05.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will reinforce Bible truth in your own mind.

00:29:07.391 --> 00:29:10.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from all that we’ve discussed,

00:29:10.644 --> 00:29:12.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we conclude?

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have faith in the good news,

00:29:16.275 --> 00:29:20.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are firmly convinced
that everything Jehovah says is true

00:29:20.738 --> 00:29:23.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be fulfilled.

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:26.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the way we live our lives
will demonstrate that.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:30.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this world that is saturated
with so much bad news,

00:29:30.748 --> 00:29:33.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how thankful we are that we have a God

00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:36.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that not only provides us
with a basis to trust his good news

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:40.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even shows evidence
of his care and concern

00:29:40.507 --> 00:29:42.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us as individuals!

00:29:42.843 --> 00:29:46.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This good news is not too good to be true.

00:29:46.138 --> 00:29:47.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is real.

00:29:47.306 --> 00:29:50.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a reality that is soon to come.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:56.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may all of us have faith in the good news.

00:29:56.148 --> 00:29:58.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we draw close to God,

00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:02.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we experience firsthand Jehovah’s love

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:04.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he rewards all those

00:30:04.448 --> 00:30:07.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who earnestly seek him in faith.

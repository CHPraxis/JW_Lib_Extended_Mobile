Does something exist
because you believe it does?

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does something not exist
simply because you don’t believe in it?

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truth is based on evidence.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what kind of evidence convinces you
that something exists?

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We believe in many things we can’t see

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—air, wind, atoms, electricity,
gravity, time.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we believe in things we can’t hear

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—galaxies, dog whistles, microorganisms.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also believe in things we can’t feel,

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as our brain
or the rotation of the earth.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What convinces you?

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The effects
—effects that you can see, hear,

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel, and measure—

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the testimony
from those who know the facts.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidence
—evidence is the basis for faith.

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many people don’t believe
that God exists.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their lack of faith can affect us.

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, our faith is under attack.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will remind us
of our reasons for faith

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will help us to strengthen our faith.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll consider why we have faith
in God’s existence,

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his Word, in his moral standards,

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his love.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:34.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, why is faith in God’s existence
important?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Ephesians chapter 2,

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice how the apostle Paul describes
Christians in Ephesus

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they knew the true God.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 2:1 reads:

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Furthermore, God made you alive,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though you were dead
in your trespasses and sins.”

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 12 continues:

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time you were without Christ,

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“alienated from the state of Israel,

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“strangers to the covenants of the promise;

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you had no hope
and were without God in the world.”

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:19.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same was true for us.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But faith in the existence of the Creator

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has given our lives meaning and purpose.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has unlocked the answers
to such questions as,

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why does the universe exist?’
and ‘What does the future hold?’

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, there are people
who shy away from such questions,

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:40.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that the answers are just beyond us.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even teach that there is no purpose,

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no ultimate meaning in life.

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:47.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where does that leave them?

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without reliable guidance.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, notice what Psalm 111:10

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaches us about the effect of our faith.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:03.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 111:10 says:

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the beginning of wisdom.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those observing his orders

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“show good insight.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His praise endures forever.”

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, clear thinking
and practical application of knowledge

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begin with regarding the Creator with awe

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and profound respect.

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:31.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as indicated in the very next verse,

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:33.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this makes us happier people.

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we need to safeguard our faith.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:39.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the foundation
for our relationship with God,

00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:44.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basis for our hope,
the key to our future.

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:46.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s remind ourselves

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:50.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we can have faith in God’s existence.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to the chapter of the Bible
that defines faith

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews chapter 11.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:1 tells us

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faith is the convincing evidence

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “realities that are not seen.”

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:11.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what would be an example of that?

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Hebrews 11:3.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “By faith we perceive

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the systems of things
were put in order by God’s word,

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that what is seen has come into existence

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from things that are not visible.”

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The systems of things”

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what might be some of those systems?

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:41.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could this include our solar system

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the galactic system that it’s a part of—

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the smaller cycles
that occur within our solar system?

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:53.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about our earth’s atmosphere,
which protects us from the sun’s harmful rays

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time allowing the entry
of essential heat and light.

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:00.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think what would happen to us

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:04.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were it not for our atmosphere’s
protective shield.

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:06.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d burn up in seconds.

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:10.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And besides blocking out harmful rays,

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:13.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the atmosphere,
along with earth’s magnetic field,

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also absorbs much of the debris
that flies through space.

00:05:17.713 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By faith, we perceive that these “systems”

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were put in order by God’s word.

00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:28.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or think about the earth’s amazing cycles.

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine what would happen
if a city’s water supply

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s fresh air, it’s water—

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were disrupted and the sewers were blocked?

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:44.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would be
the quality of life in that city?

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, our planet is a closed system.

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:52.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clean air and water
are not shipped in from outer space.

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:55.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Waste matter is not rocketed out.

00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how does the earth
remain healthy and habitable?

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The water cycle,

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:06.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the carbon and oxygen cycles,
and the nitrogen cycle

00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:11.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are all tuned precisely to sustain life.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this doesn’t mean that we can be
careless stewards of our planet.

00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what remarkable systems!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And much more could be said

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the earth’s perfect location
in our solar system

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:26.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about the planet’s perfect orbit, tilt,

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:29.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rotational speed, an unusual moon,

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:33.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about our solar system’s perfect position
in the Milky Way.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:37.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are all of these precise locations
and elegant measurements

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the result of blind chance

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or of purposeful design?

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:46.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:51.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note yet another example
of how the order evident in creation

00:06:51.431 --> 00:06:55.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly points to an all-wise Creator.

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:02.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:06.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, each individual cell

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a marvel of design and organization.

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside our cells,

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
biological processes signal specific proteins

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble themselves into tracks

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called microtubules.

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tiny molecular machines called kinesins

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:28.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then transport various components

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to different parts of the cell

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:34.599 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by “walking” along the tracks.

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:39.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From microscopic proteins

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:45.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enormous galaxies,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our organized universe abounds

00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:52.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with examples of elegant design.

00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:03.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you strengthen your faith
in God’s existence?

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider three things that we can do.

00:08:06.673 --> 00:08:10.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Romans chapter 1.

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we consider examples like these,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s power and wisdom,

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:18.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t that make us wonder,

00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:20.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How could anyone deny the evidence

00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:23.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an intelligent and loving Designer?’

00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:25.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 1:18 indicates

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:30.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that such denial
requires suppressing the truth.

00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:31.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:08:31.698 --> 00:08:35.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice what it says at Romans 1:19:

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:41.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because what may be known about God

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:44.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is clearly evident

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:48.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[clearly evident] among them,

00:08:48.006 --> 00:08:50.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God made it clear to them.”

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 20 says:
“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:57.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the world’s creation onward,

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:00.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are perceived
by the things made,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even his eternal power and Godship,

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they
[namely those who suppress the truth]

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are inexcusable.”

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:13.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s existence and his qualities

00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:17.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were apparent the moment
mankind first appeared on earth.

00:09:17.869 --> 00:09:19.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the evidence has only become clearer

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the passage of time
and the advancement of technology

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enables us to discover
what God has done.

00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first way that we strengthen
our faith in God’s existence

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:34.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—through study and meditation—

00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:36.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditating on the evidence.

00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:38.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to help us with this,

00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:43.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find an abundance of published material
about creation on jw.org,

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:48.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we find brochures,
articles in the series “Was It Designed?”

00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:51.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and interviews with scientists.

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:54.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second way that we strengthen our faith

00:09:54.114 --> 00:09:57.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by earnestly praying for more faith.

00:09:57.701 --> 00:10:00.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said, as recorded at Luke 11:13,

00:10:00.328 --> 00:10:04.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘God will give his holy spirit
to those asking him for it,’

00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:08.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and part of that spirit’s fruitage is faith.

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:12.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, we strengthen our faith
by building the faith of others.

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:18.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By drawing attention to the evidence
that supports the truth.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, patiently build
the faith of your children.

00:10:21.683 --> 00:10:25.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they have doubts,
address them promptly, kindly, calmly.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t dismiss their questions,
and don’t get upset.

00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be glad they asked.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows they care,
and they want to understand.

00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:35.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept the challenge; present the evidence.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for it together
“when you sit in your house . . .

00:10:38.241 --> 00:10:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you walk on the road . . .
when you lie down and when you get up.”

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note what strengthens the faith

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:49.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one of our brothers who is a scientist.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:53.089 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As a mechanical design educator,

00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:54.716 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I view even natural things

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:56.718 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from a design perspective.

00:10:56.718 --> 00:11:01.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mechanical design considers not only
the individual components of a machine

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:04.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how they interact.

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:07.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From this viewpoint, human vision

00:11:07.103 --> 00:11:10.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a magnificent example of design.

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:15.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a single eye,
the cornea, the iris, and the lens

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The light-sensitive cells of the retina,
called photoreceptors,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produce nerve signals.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:30.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are transmitted by the optic nerve
to the brain,

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:33.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they are processed
to produce a perceived image.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now just imagine

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the multiplied complexity

00:11:37.634 --> 00:11:39.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when two eyes interact.

00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:43.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly mind-boggling is

00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:48.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the amount of information
being constantly processed

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:51.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more than 130 million retinal receptors

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then transmitted
through the 1.2 million nerve fibers

00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:57.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the optic nerve to the brain.

00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:01.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, the sheer complexity

00:12:01.116 --> 00:12:04.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how all these components
flawlessly interact

00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is evidence of a superior Designer.

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:10.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some disagree.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They propose that the eye evolved

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:15.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a light-sensitive patch
in some ancestral creature

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:18.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through small random changes.

00:12:18.842 --> 00:12:22.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the proposed process unrealistic.

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:24.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike design,

00:12:24.598 --> 00:12:28.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is unplanned and without a goal.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:31.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are asked to imagine that a complex system

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can develop without direction,

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:38.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while in the natural world
things tend to become disorganized.

00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:41.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But consider something
even more mind-boggling:

00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:44.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design of the eye,
the optic nerve, and the brain

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they function and interact

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:50.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are completely documented in our DNA.

00:12:50.248 --> 00:12:54.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, our DNA
contains all the instructions

00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for building an entire human body.

00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While science relies

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:02.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only on physical explanations,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many individual scientists reason

00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:07.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highly ordered natural systems

00:13:07.098 --> 00:13:09.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are evidence of a Designer.

00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:12.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My personal conclusion is

00:13:12.145 --> 00:13:14.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is a God who is revealed

00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:17.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the magnificent designs of nature.

00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:24.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does faith in God’s existence benefit us?

00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having genuine faith in the loving,
intelligent Designer of this universe

00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:32.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives our lives meaning and purpose.

00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:37.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That faith is the basis for obedience
to Jehovah’s righteous standards

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—standards that benefit us.

00:13:39.547 --> 00:13:43.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we don’t fear the future,
because faith gives us hope.

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:48.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t fear death,
because our hope is in the Source of life.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy we are that Jehovah has provided

00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:54.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
abundant evidence that he exists!

00:13:54.646 --> 00:13:59.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, are there facets
of Jehovah’s personality

00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:03.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we couldn’t fully comprehend
from a study of creation alone?

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:04.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for this we need to study
his inspired Word.

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:12.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen
our faith in God’s Word?

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:15.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay careful attention
to Brother Mark Noumair,

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:17.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:20.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he now presents
the next talk of this symposium,

00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:24.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Word.”

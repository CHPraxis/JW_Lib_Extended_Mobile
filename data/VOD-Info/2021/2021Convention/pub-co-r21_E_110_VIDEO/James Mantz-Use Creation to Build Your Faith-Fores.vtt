What would we do without forests?

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forests help to sustain
our supply of fresh water,

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they purify the air,

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forests convert carbon dioxide

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into life-sustaining oxygen.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, forests are vital to our existence.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, scientists warn
that we’re in danger of losing

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this precious resource.

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This causes some people to wonder

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:34.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether God cares
about what’s happening to the forest.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may even ask, ‘Will the loss of forests

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affect God’s ability to fulfill his promise
to make the earth a paradise?’

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer to that question

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is absolutely not!

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has everything under control.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will strengthen your faith

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Designer of the forest.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trees can grow very strong

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and withstand powerful forces.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if they didn’t decompose after they die,

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:25.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trees and leaves would pile up

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their nutrients locked away inside.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:30.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, they do decompose.

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:32.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most animals cannot eat
fallen wood and leaves,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but fungi can.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They break down the dead plant tissues,

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making them softer.

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beetles and termites

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bore through the wood,
exposing more surface area

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spreading the fungi inside,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which soften it further
so that other insects

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:04.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can enjoy the feast.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earthworms aerate the soil

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pull nutrients down
where they can be used by other plants.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Decomposers have been called

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the unsung heroes of the natural world.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They recycle organic matter
so that it is available

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support new life.

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through this process,

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:39.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made it possible for us
to enjoy earth’s lush beauty

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—generation after generation.

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the fields
and everything in them rejoice.

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:51.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the same time let all the trees

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:53.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the forest shout joyfully.”

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:00.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing!

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:04.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you ever look at a forest
in the same way again?

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about what the decomposition
and recycling of organic matter

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means for us and our future.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those beetles, termites, and earthworms

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the unsung heroes of the natural world—

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:23.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will keep on doing their job
throughout eternity.

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect for a moment:

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah had the wisdom to create forests

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can replenish themselves,

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely he knows how to undo the damage

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:39.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that man has done to the earth.

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:45.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hasn’t revealed all the details
of how he is going to restore the earth,

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can be confident
that he will fulfill his promise

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make “all things new.”

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Psalm 37:10, 11, 29.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture contains a promise

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:04.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding man and the earth.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:10, 11, 29

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reads:

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just a little while longer,
and the wicked will be no more;

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:20.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will look at where they were,
and they will not be there.

00:04:20.197 --> 00:04:23.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will find exquisite delight

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:29.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the abundance of peace.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:35.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will live forever on it.”

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How reassuring!

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:40.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who are righteous and meek

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be on the earth forever,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that earth will be a paradise.

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are at least two requirements

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah to accomplish this.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s already taken care
of the first requirement.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:59.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw proof of that in the video.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:01.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created the forest

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:05.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an amazing rejuvenation system.

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:09.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in spite of man’s prolonged misuse
of the forest,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has already put in place

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mechanism to undo

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the damage that man has done.

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:22.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t the marvelous design of the forest

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:27.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build your faith in Jehovah’s promise
of a paradise?

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:30.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second requirement
to make the earth a paradise

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:32.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is described in verse 10

00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:35.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Psalm 37 that we just read.

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:42.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the wicked will be no more.”

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:46.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only will Jehovah undo
the damage that men have done

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will also remove
the source of the problem.

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:53.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greedy men who exploit and misuse

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this precious resource will be gone.

00:05:57.044 --> 00:06:00.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we have no reason to fear

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that humans will continue to ruin the earth

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:07.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it reaches the point of no return.

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows what is going on.

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:13.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Revelation chapter 11,

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:16.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 18.

00:06:16.563 --> 00:06:20.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture assures us
that Jehovah cares about our planet

00:06:20.776 --> 00:06:23.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is his planet,

00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:25.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it confirms

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:30.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is going to hold men accountable
for their actions.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 11:18 says:

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:38.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the nations became wrathful,
and your own wrath came,

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the appointed time came
for the dead to be judged

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to reward your slaves the prophets
and the holy ones

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those fearing your name,
the small and the great,

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:53.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to bring to ruin

00:06:53.016 --> 00:06:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those ruining the earth.”

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is not going to let wicked men

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:04.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ruin his beautiful creation.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing can stop Jehovah

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:10.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from carrying out his purpose for the earth.

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our examination of the forest
has strengthened our faith

00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will accomplish
everything that he has in mind to do.

00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:24.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words of faithful Job
reflect our conviction

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:26.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that promise will come true.

00:07:26.383 --> 00:07:29.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As recorded at Job 42:2,

00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:32.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job was moved to declare regarding Jehovah:

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:36.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that you are able
to do all things

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:40.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that nothing you have in mind to do

00:07:40.397 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is impossible for you.”

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:46.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah have in mind to do?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing is to transform the earth
into a paradise

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with rich, abundant forests

00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:58.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—forests that will continue to help sustain
our supply of fresh water,

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:00.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to purify our air,

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:05.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:07.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The video that we just watched

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:11.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quoted Psalm 96:12, which declares:

00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:15.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let all the trees of the forest
shout joyfully.”

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By their very existence,
forests praise their Creator.

00:08:21.104 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can add our joyful shouts of praise

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:26.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those of the forest.

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, may we continue to use creation

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build our faith,

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:36.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if we do that,

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:40.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will see
the restored life-sustaining forests

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bring happiness to perfect humans

00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:47.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise to their Creator, Jehovah,
forever.

00:08:48.507 --> 00:08:51.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Leonard Myers,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:55.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

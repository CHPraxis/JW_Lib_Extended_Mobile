As humans,

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are designed with the ability
to imitate what we see and hear.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn to talk by imitating
the language and accent of our parents.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we grew up,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we probably also adopted the attitudes
and actions of people we associated with.

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the example of others
can have a powerful influence on us.

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, more than ever,

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to copy good examples of faith.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we are living in a time
when our faith will be tested in many ways.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But note what we will have to do.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you, please, 
to turn with me to the book of Jude,

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow along as we read

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 20 in the book of Jude.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But you, beloved ones,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“build yourselves up on your most holy faith,

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pray with holy spirit.”

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help understand this verse,

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of what a homeowner might do

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he knows
a really bad storm is approaching.

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, he will take steps to build up, 
or strengthen, his home

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from repairing cracks in the foundation

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:25.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reinforcing the doors, walls, and windows.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar manner,

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and I must take steps to build up,
or strengthen, our faith

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can protect ourselves
against the onslaught of tests

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trials we are likely to face.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice, Jude said that we must

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue ‘building ourselves up
on our most holy faith,’

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are the Christian teachings
found in God’s Word.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we study God’s Word
and pray for his help,

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:58.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can gain strength
by learning from the examples set

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by different Bible characters.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is so much that can be learned
from the examples of those in ancient times.

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:10.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each talk of this symposium
will highlight ways

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can imitate the faith
of Jehovah’s loyal servants of the past

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reject the course of faithless ones.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:23.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by examining the example of Abel.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:28.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was one of the first humans, 
the fourth, in fact, to exist on earth.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes Abel as a righteous man.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He built up a record 
of living according to Jehovah’s standards,

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:41.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his family, however, did not.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are well familiar with his parents,
 Adam and Eve.

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They both rebelled against Jehovah.

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his older brother, Cain,
well, he was not a positive role model.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible described Cain 
as one whose “own works were wicked.”

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you think about that:

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at Adam, Eve, and Cain,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:07.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who all displayed a lack of faith in Jehovah,

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you imagine what that family dynamic

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have been like for faithful Abel?

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tension, hostility,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resentment, lack of spiritual discussions

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—do you think Abel’s faith was tested?

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, it was.

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, our faith may
likewise be tested by the actions

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who choose not to serve Jehovah.

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you 
to watch the following reenactment.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you do, 
note how a sister’s faith is tested.

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:47.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I arrived in a new city
during the rainy season.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It rained all day every day
for a whole month.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
there were only three publishers there.

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first sister I met
was my new pioneer partner.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first,
I felt as if the people in this territory

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoke a different language.

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I tried to talk to some people
about the Bible, they did not like it

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:09.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some were even afraid of these new ideas.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When government officials

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:15.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
noticed that we had shared
some tracts with the people,

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began to watch us
and followed us for about three months.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt overwhelmed by all of this
and became very anxious.

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had few return visits
or opportunities to speak about Jehovah.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt lost.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do or where to go.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often wondered,
‘Father, why did you send me here?’

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:40.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like I had gone
from being on a mountain peak

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:43.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the bottom of a deep valley.

00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our sister adjusted
to her new circumstances,

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:51.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you note how her trials made her feel?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anxious, lost, and overwhelmed.

00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve experienced similar feelings

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when dealing with tests of your faith.

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can Abel’s 
example of faith help you and me?

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s notice what he did.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hebrews,

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:17.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read Hebrews chapter 11

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 4.

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:24.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:

00:05:24.094 --> 00:05:27.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Abel offered God

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:29.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a sacrifice of greater worth
 than that of Cain,

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:31.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through that faith

00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he received the witness
 that he was righteous,

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for God approved his gifts, 
and although he died,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he still speaks through his faith.”

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel built strong faith in Jehovah,

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though those around him failed to do so.

00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three steps that he took.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First:

00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel took time to ponder spiritual matters.

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:03.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:08.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he no doubt discerned
Jehovah’s love and wisdom in creation.

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:12.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a shepherd, perhaps he looked 
at his sheep and recognized

00:06:12.184 --> 00:06:15.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they needed someone
to guide and protect them.

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Abel likely discerned that as humans,

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too need someone to guide and protect us

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:25.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—someone far wiser
and more powerful than any human.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second step:

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:34.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel prayed and acted on what he learned.

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:37.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though his knowledge was limited,

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:41.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was enough
—enough for him to act in faith.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt Abel appealed to Jehovah
in prayer to accept his sacrifice,

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah approved his gift.

00:06:50.472 --> 00:06:53.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel demonstrated his faith so powerfully.

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:55.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note in verse 4, it tells us

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:59.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his example still “speaks” to us today?

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:05.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, we may feel that we
don’t have enough knowledge or experience

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to demonstrate faith like Abel.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s OK.

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:11.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t have to be an obstacle.

00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:16.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah, and make the most
of the knowledge that you do have.

00:07:16.373 --> 00:07:20.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Act in faith, and Jehovah will help you.

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third step:

00:07:24.006 --> 00:07:28.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel remained steadfast when under trial.

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:32.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t let the actions
of his family affect his faith,

00:07:32.514 --> 00:07:36.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can’t let the actions
of others affect ours.

00:07:36.018 --> 00:07:40.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must never allow something 
that another person says or does

00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:44.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make us feel ashamed
of being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:46.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be ready.

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:49.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be quick to identify yourself
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:53.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help to build and fortify your faith.

00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:59.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also learn
from the bad example set by Cain.

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Genesis 4:6, 7,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah warns Cain about his attitude,

00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he urges him to turn to doing good.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:10.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just like his faithless parents,

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:15.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cain determined that he 
knew what was best for himself,

00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:18.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his actions
led to the murder of his brother.

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:23.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may go through situations where, 
because of imperfection,

00:08:23.482 --> 00:08:26.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t always use the best judgment

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:29.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it causes us
to develop a negative attitude.

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:34.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the matter
is brought to our attention,

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will we respond?

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:40.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, let’s not imitate
the faithless example of Cain.

00:08:40.749 --> 00:08:44.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s not feel
that we always know what’s best.

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:49.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s see that warning
as a loving tap on the shoulder

00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our heavenly Father

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow it to readjust our thinking
so that we can build our faith

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:58.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and preserve our relationship with him.

00:08:59.893 --> 00:09:02.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s now go back to our sister.

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:07.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following reenactment,
note how she imitates Abel’s faith.

00:09:10.362 --> 00:09:12.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I studied the Bible

00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:15.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah
cared for his servants in the past.

00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read how Jehovah
told Jacob throughout his life:

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:22.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will be with you wherever you go.’

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:26.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pictured Jehovah
telling me the same thing:

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:27.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry.

00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:31.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just go,
and I will always be there to help you.’

00:09:31.216 --> 00:09:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged him to help me

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be balanced, to feel peace,
and to have courage

00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:38.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go out in the ministry.

00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:43.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Jehovah helped me 
to find a very good Bible student.

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:47.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an absolutely wonderful
and unexpected gift from Jehovah.

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:51.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our small group joins
congregation meetings through the Internet.

00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:54.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This arrangement is a valuable source
of spiritual food for me.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get together for meals
and association as well.

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The experiences on JW Broadcasting®

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make me feel that I am not alone.

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:07.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I always smile
and wave goodbye at the end.

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:09.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderful to be here.

00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:16.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how our sister
built up her faith in Jehovah?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She imitated Abel’s example, 
and she followed those steps.

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:24.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first step: 
She pondered on spiritual matters.

00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:28.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She studied the Bible to see how Jehovah
cared for his servants in the past,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then she applied
what she learned to her situation.

00:10:33.487 --> 00:10:35.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, the second step:

00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:39.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She prayed and acted on what she learned.

00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:44.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her prayer was that Jehovah help her
to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:48.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have courage to go into the ministry.

00:10:48.126 --> 00:10:50.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she acted in faith.

00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite the challenges in the ministry,

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took the third step:

00:10:56.384 --> 00:11:00.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She remained steadfast under trial.

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:02.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She persevered and was blessed with a study.

00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:07.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she reinforced her faith
by joining in congregation meetings

00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:10.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and benefiting from the wholesome
association of the brotherhood.

00:11:11.733 --> 00:11:13.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result?

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed her efforts.

00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:19.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you and I follow these steps,

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will bless our efforts as well.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By utilizing this tremendous gift
Jehovah has given us

00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:30.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the power of example—
you and I can imitate Abel.

00:11:30.877 --> 00:11:33.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we build and fortify our faith,

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:38.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will weather any storm of adversity
that comes our way.

00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:43.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gary Breaux, 
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless
—Enoch, Not Lamech.”

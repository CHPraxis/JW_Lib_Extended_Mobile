This convention program will be translated

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into more than 450 languages.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work is supported
by branch offices around the globe.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us has
an opportunity to show appreciation

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the spiritual blessings
we have received in our own language.

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way we can do this
is by making voluntary gifts

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with our circumstances.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Donations can be made online

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at donate.jw.org.

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old, we face tests of faith.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Changing circumstances
can bring new challenges.

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:03.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we meet
each test with unwavering faith?

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to put yourself in the scene

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you watch the drama

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith—Part I.</i>

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My king.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
General.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve starved them out,

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:48.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehoiachin still refuses to meet.

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Negotiations don’t concern me, General,

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but your incompetence does.

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finish it,

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you’ll not find me as forgiving as the gods.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:01.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my king.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Because you did not obey my words,

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘all this land will be reduced to ruins,

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and this land and its inhabitants

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will have to serve the king of Babylon

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 70 years.’

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where have you been?

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s almost sundown!

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Jeremiah was speaking today, and I, uh

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I stopped by the temple on the way home.

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re almost ready.

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:09.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were at the temple again today.

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to look with appreciation upon his temple.”

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have something for you

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:38.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can always have Jehovah’s words with you.

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:40.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Papa.

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong?

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to happen to us?

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:59.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What always happens to Jehovah’s faithful servants.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have no fear, Jehovah is our shield.

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dinner’s ready.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see our old neighbor at all?

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I didn’t see him at all today.

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of strange,

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw our neighbor Eli the other day.

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:35.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eli is always getting into trouble.

00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:39.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing.

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:42.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Son, pick a psalm.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:45.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light and my salvation.”

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:48.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always choose that one.

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:52.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hushim.

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and my salvation.

00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:03.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whom should I fear?”

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:44.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:49.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay and play?

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to go with Papa.

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:54.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come back, do you want to play Noah’s ark?

00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:55.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:56.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who will you be?

00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be a lion.

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:02.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:06:02.674 --> 00:06:06.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I’ll be an elephant.

00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:18.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoiachin has surrendered!

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:20.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoiachin has surrendered!

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:22.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Household of Eber, tribe of Judah,

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:23.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open up at once!

00:06:23.987 --> 00:06:25.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you outside! Now!

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:27.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s happened. They’re here.

00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:29.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gather your things.

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:30.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to go.

00:06:30.202 --> 00:06:31.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go?

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go where?

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t live here anymore.

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:44.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hushim, grab our bags.

00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:31.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hate this place!

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go inside.

00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up! 

00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four—outside!

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Check the back room.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the order of the king, you are coming with us.

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:26.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, of the tribe of Judah—

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:33.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will receive training

00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:36.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the house of the great King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is my family.

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:43.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Princes and nobles belong in the palace.

00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:47.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not a prince; he’s just a boy.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:53.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:56.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, I will go if it’s a servant you seek.

00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:58.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! I’m taking the boy.

00:09:58.034 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 Wait!

00:10:01.246 --> 00:10:05.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we say goodbye?

00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:09.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it quick.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong, my son.

00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:30.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:38.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mishael.

00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:40.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you seen anyone else?

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:42.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You didn’t think we’d let you come here alone, did you?

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:44.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azariah!

00:11:44.849 --> 00:11:46.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hananiah!

00:11:47.102 --> 00:11:48.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Chislon and Ahitub.

00:11:48.853 --> 00:11:49.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:51.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move along.

00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:56.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where are we going?

00:11:56.987 --> 00:11:58.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The palace, I guess.

00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:00.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like Joseph in Pharaoh’s house?

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:03.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like Joseph in the dungeon.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t seem so bad to me.

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:06.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chislon, look!

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t say something, I will.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:17.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:18.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move!

00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:21.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back again sometime.

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:46.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the Jewish boys that Ashpenaz summoned.

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:33.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been chosen

00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:35.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are wise,

00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:39.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you are lacking.

00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:43.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will learn our writing

00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:46.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our language.

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:51.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be given new names,

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:58.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the end of three years,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will serve the great King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:07.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today,

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:09.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are foreigners

00:14:13.498 --> 00:14:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—tomorrow, the gods willing,

00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:19.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylonians.

00:15:00.044 --> 00:15:02.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meshach.

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:04.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look like a Meshach.

00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:09.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new names sound like their gods.

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:11.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New names, new language—

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon they’ll want us to worship their gods.

00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Calm down.

00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:18.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father had idols, and he worshipped Jehovah.

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the same city I did?

00:15:22.776 --> 00:15:25.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the center of the world.

00:15:25.403 --> 00:15:27.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll even eat from the king’s table.

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:32.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do Babylonians eat?

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:41.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His servants are given only the best.

00:15:50.553 --> 00:15:52.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t eat from this food.

00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:54.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s unclean.

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:56.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a problem?

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:03.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our, uh, our God

00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:05.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t allow us to eat such foods.

00:16:09.072 --> 00:16:11.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 You fear your God?

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:14.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:19.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I am afraid of my lord the king,

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:23.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has assigned your food and drink.

00:16:25.713 --> 00:16:29.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He insists on these selections

00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain your strength and vitality.

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:36.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if he should see you

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking worse in appearance

00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the other youths?

00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:44.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would make me guilty before the king.

00:16:48.194 --> 00:16:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must obey the king.

00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:54.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So must you

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you!

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:06.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When dinner is served, I expect you to be hungry.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t speak for us!

00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:34.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right.

00:17:34.741 --> 00:17:36.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can make your own choice.

00:17:36.784 --> 00:17:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Didn’t you hear him?

00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:39.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have a choice.

00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:42.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a new land with new laws.

00:17:44.208 --> 00:17:46.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what if some of the food is unbled?

00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:50.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just food!

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:52.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah commanded us not to eat blood.

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:53.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s your interpretation.

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:58.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not eat . . . any blood at all.”

00:17:58.848 --> 00:18:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s to interpret in that?

00:18:00.975 --> 00:18:03.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we should all take a moment and pray.

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:04.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here.

00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:09.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in Israel.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:15.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in Babylon now.

00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you believe that Jehovah is here too?

00:18:21.162 --> 00:18:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah said that we’re his witnesses.

00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:27.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will people say about Jehovah

00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:29.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we give in and break his laws?

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:32.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your meal is ready.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear me?

00:19:00.201 --> 00:19:01.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:19:01.661 --> 00:19:04.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we eat those foods, we’ll disobey our God.

00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:07.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to starve?

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not,

00:19:10.211 --> 00:19:13.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but He forbids us from eating blood

00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:16.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and food that he calls “unclean.”

00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, test your servants for ten days,

00:19:19.762 --> 00:19:22.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let us be given some vegetables to eat

00:19:22.974 --> 00:19:25.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and water to drink.

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:28.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vegetables?

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just give us ten days.

00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:37.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then deal with your servants

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to what you see.

00:19:57.383 --> 00:19:59.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten days.

00:20:02.889 --> 00:20:05.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go, thanks to Jehovah.

00:20:16.277 --> 00:20:20.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to try this meat. It’s amazing!

00:20:27.747 --> 00:20:29.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you seen anything like this before?

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! Really!

00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! Oh, wow!

00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:10.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:20.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ashpenaz has summoned you.

00:22:40.338 --> 00:22:42.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, these young men are of royal . . .

00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:44.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know who they are.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been watching you

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you.

00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:10.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t bow to our idols,

00:23:11.077 --> 00:23:14.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pray only to your God,

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you are not eating our foods.

00:23:20.878 --> 00:23:23.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They insisted that their God would not . . .

00:23:23.089 --> 00:23:25.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somehow,

00:23:25.633 --> 00:23:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you look healthier than the others. 

00:23:30.763 --> 00:23:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue giving them the diet they’ve requested.

00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:41.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Belteshazzar,

00:23:48.781 --> 00:23:50.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your future is bright.

00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:54.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t waste it.

00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring in the next group.

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:28.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The total rations would be fifteen <i>kurru,</i>

00:24:28.946 --> 00:24:30.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two <i>p</i><i>ā</i><i>nu,</i>

00:24:30.406 --> 00:24:32.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and five <i>s</i><i>ūtu.</i>

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:35.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Correct.

00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:39.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much interest

00:24:39.957 --> 00:24:42.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may a merchant charge on money and grain?

00:24:46.547 --> 00:24:49.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be 40 percent, my lord.

00:24:49.091 --> 00:24:51.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty percent?

00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you learned only to be a thief

00:24:53.596 --> 00:24:55.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the past three years?

00:24:56.349 --> 00:24:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you, Meshach?

00:24:58.434 --> 00:25:00.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rate is 20 percent.

00:25:01.103 --> 00:25:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good.

00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:08.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which star of Enlil is brightest

00:25:08.527 --> 00:25:10.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Urgula constellation?

00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:24.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know?

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the Lugal star.

00:25:27.338 --> 00:25:29.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Impressive.

00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:32.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a tower that is high

00:25:32.176 --> 00:25:34.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, nonetheless, has no shade.

00:25:35.221 --> 00:25:38.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:25:40.142 --> 00:25:41.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your ziggurat?

00:25:43.187 --> 00:25:44.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hopeless.

00:25:50.986 --> 00:25:52.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can solve the riddle?

00:25:53.697 --> 00:25:55.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is sunlight, my lord.

00:25:56.492 --> 00:25:58.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Correct.

00:25:58.577 --> 00:26:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wise men teach that the gods

00:26:00.329 --> 00:26:03.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are responsible for everything.

00:26:04.458 --> 00:26:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that’s so,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do the good suffer and the evil prosper?

00:26:11.674 --> 00:26:13.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one has been able to answer . . .

00:26:22.685 --> 00:26:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you say, O king,

00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:27.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the wise do not always have the food,

00:26:27.731 --> 00:26:31.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nor do the intelligent always have the riches,

00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nor do those with knowledge always have success,

00:26:34.864 --> 00:26:38.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because time and unexpected events

00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:40.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overtake them all.’

00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:44.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who wrote those words?

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon.

00:26:47.918 --> 00:26:49.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Famed for his wisdom.

00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:54.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But its source was his God,

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God, Jehovah.

00:27:01.182 --> 00:27:02.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take them away.

00:27:05.686 --> 00:27:07.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When should we return?

00:27:07.271 --> 00:27:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You won’t!

00:27:09.732 --> 00:27:11.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to your families.

00:27:13.694 --> 00:27:15.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve proven worthless.

00:27:16.614 --> 00:27:20.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar, no—not the four of you.

00:27:22.912 --> 00:27:24.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have more to discuss.

00:27:31.629 --> 00:27:33.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know your God,

00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:35.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ve proven to be ten times better

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than any priest or conjurer that I’ve met.

00:27:41.096 --> 00:27:42.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ashpenaz will arrange

00:27:42.681 --> 00:27:45.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to serve in the palace with my wise men.

00:27:46.685 --> 00:27:49.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe your gifts were wasted in Jerusalem,

00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:51.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here they will be put to use.

00:28:11.835 --> 00:28:15.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The victory in Jerusalem is complete.

00:28:16.507 --> 00:28:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our forces are now preparing to besiege Tyre.

00:28:20.678 --> 00:28:22.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They should remember what happened to Zedekiah.

00:28:25.391 --> 00:28:27.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gods are with us!

00:28:41.949 --> 00:28:44.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerah,

00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:45.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is it?

00:28:45.869 --> 00:28:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about Jerusalem.

00:29:11.687 --> 00:29:13.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you going?

00:29:13.314 --> 00:29:15.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see my family.

00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:39.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year, we’ve had to make do.

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:51.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:19.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, eat.

00:30:27.805 --> 00:30:30.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 What’s wrong?

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:33.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jerusalem.

00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:41.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tore down the walls;

00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:43.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they torched its towers.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many died.

00:30:54.707 --> 00:30:59.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they burned down Jehovah’s house!

00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:05.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why didn’t our people listen?

00:31:08.595 --> 00:31:10.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they think Jehovah couldn’t see

00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:12.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they were doing?

00:31:13.016 --> 00:31:16.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as our temple existed,

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:18.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our people had hope.

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:26.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as Jehovah exists,

00:31:26.655 --> 00:31:28.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have hope.

00:31:30.284 --> 00:31:33.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he’s rejected us

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of our unrighteousness.

00:31:38.792 --> 00:31:40.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hasn’t

00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:42.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not everyone.

00:31:43.172 --> 00:31:45.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told Ezekiel

00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:49.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in his eyes you

00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:54.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are as righteous as Noah

00:31:54.391 --> 00:31:56.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Job.

00:32:00.314 --> 00:32:02.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that?

00:32:04.193 --> 00:32:05.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did.

00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:15.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah cares so much,

00:32:15.996 --> 00:32:18.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why are we in exile? 

00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:26.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t we go home?

00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:28.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t we be together?

00:32:29.426 --> 00:32:31.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are home, Son.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have all the answers.

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:57.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be blessed.

00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:54.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men!

00:33:57.347 --> 00:34:01.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a dream,

00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m agitated.

00:34:03.478 --> 00:34:05.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to know what I dreamed.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:34:07.482 --> 00:34:08.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Relate the dream to your servants.

00:34:08.817 --> 00:34:10.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will tell the interpretation.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:34:11.737 --> 00:34:13.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t make the dream known to me

00:34:13.363 --> 00:34:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the interpretation,

00:34:15.365 --> 00:34:16.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be dismembered,

00:34:16.992 --> 00:34:19.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your houses will be turned into public latrines.

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:24.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you do tell me the dream

00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:26.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the interpretation,

00:34:26.043 --> 00:34:29.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive gifts and a reward

00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:31.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and great honor.

00:34:32.674 --> 00:34:33.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got to buy some time

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can consult the spirits.

00:34:34.885 --> 00:34:36.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scrolls will tell you what the dreams say.

00:34:36.887 --> 00:34:38.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to come up with a plan.

00:34:38.597 --> 00:34:40.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to tell him the dream!

00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:41.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one has ever asked this before.

00:34:43.018 --> 00:34:44.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we do it?

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:45.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we do?

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you can buy us some time,

00:34:47.189 --> 00:34:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can consult the spirits.

00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve agreed to tell me something false

00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:55.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deceitful until the situation changes.

00:34:55.656 --> 00:34:57.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deceitful?

00:34:57.115 --> 00:34:58.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deceitful!

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:02.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is not a man on earth

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:04.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can do what the king demands.

00:35:04.164 --> 00:35:05.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What the king is asking is difficult.

00:35:05.874 --> 00:35:09.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one exists who could tell this to the king except

00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:11.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except the gods.

00:35:22.557 --> 00:35:24.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arioch,

00:35:24.518 --> 00:35:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seize them!

00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:28.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down!

00:35:28.146 --> 00:35:28.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down!

00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:29.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kill them!

00:35:31.024 --> 00:35:32.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men!

00:35:32.192 --> 00:35:33.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry!

00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:34.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go, go, go!

00:35:34.736 --> 00:35:37.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the order of the king, round them up!

00:35:40.617 --> 00:35:41.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerah.

00:35:41.618 --> 00:35:42.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re in danger.

00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:43.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? What happened?

00:35:43.578 --> 00:35:44.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t hear everything,

00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:46.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the wise men angered the king.

00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:48.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone is to be executed by dawn.

00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:51.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah here.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll try to learn more.

00:35:57.759 --> 00:36:01.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes—Chaldean, Egyptian, Jewish

00:36:01.304 --> 00:36:03.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all the wise men.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arioch?

00:36:07.811 --> 00:36:11.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar, you shouldn’t be here.

00:36:11.148 --> 00:36:13.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is there such a harsh order from the king?

00:36:13.734 --> 00:36:15.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a dream,

00:36:15.777 --> 00:36:17.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:36:19.781 --> 00:36:20.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flee now!

00:36:20.782 --> 00:36:23.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you escape before dawn, you might survive.

00:36:35.005 --> 00:36:38.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me why I asked for them

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you haven’t brought them?

00:36:40.552 --> 00:36:42.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why aren’t the gods talking to them?

00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:47.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want them and all of their families brought here.

00:36:47.267 --> 00:36:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to look into the whites of their eyes

00:36:51.521 --> 00:36:53.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask them why.

00:37:03.658 --> 00:37:06.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hang them without their skins!

00:37:07.871 --> 00:37:10.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the gods look down on their flesh,

00:37:10.207 --> 00:37:12.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then throw their bodies in the Euphrates.

00:37:12.584 --> 00:37:13.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ashpenaz.

00:37:15.629 --> 00:37:18.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What good are wise men without wisdom?

00:37:19.674 --> 00:37:21.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing here?

00:37:21.218 --> 00:37:22.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to speak with the king.

00:37:22.552 --> 00:37:24.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to go!

00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:26.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, let me speak with him!

00:37:29.893 --> 00:37:33.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, this is Belteshazzar.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king,

00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:40.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:37:40.779 --> 00:37:43.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:37:45.742 --> 00:37:48.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, where is your God? Where?

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe that he—

00:37:53.041 --> 00:37:56.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that he will reveal it to me.

00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:58.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, give me time.

00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:06.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have until morning.

00:38:07.347 --> 00:38:09.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do what?

00:38:09.474 --> 00:38:11.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reveal the dream to the king.

00:38:15.981 --> 00:38:17.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how much of the dream

00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:19.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has Jehovah revealed to you?

00:38:20.277 --> 00:38:22.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, nothing yet.

00:38:25.073 --> 00:38:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah revealed

00:38:27.617 --> 00:38:31.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would interpret it, right?

00:38:32.205 --> 00:38:33.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not exactly.

00:38:33.748 --> 00:38:34.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:37.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you know this is even going to happen?

00:38:39.254 --> 00:38:41.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can’t be sure.

00:38:41.298 --> 00:38:42.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d better be sure!

00:38:43.758 --> 00:38:45.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name is at stake.

00:38:45.844 --> 00:38:47.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he reveals the dream,

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:49.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it proves that he’s the true God!

00:38:49.347 --> 00:38:50.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If?

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:02.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to help?

00:39:06.364 --> 00:39:07.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray.

00:39:07.407 --> 00:39:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that Jehovah have mercy on us.

00:39:19.794 --> 00:39:21.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah,

00:39:23.006 --> 00:39:25.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely you didn’t bring us here just to die.

00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will people say?

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We told them that you

00:39:33.892 --> 00:39:35.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the God of the heavens,

00:39:35.477 --> 00:39:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only God who can reveal secrets.

00:39:39.689 --> 00:39:42.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please,

00:39:42.484 --> 00:39:44.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vindicate yourself.

00:40:28.196 --> 00:40:29.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerah!

00:40:47.424 --> 00:40:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have found a man from the exiles of Judah

00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:51.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can make known the interpretation to the king.

00:40:52.637 --> 00:40:54.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know who he is.

00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:57.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you really make known to me

00:40:57.809 --> 00:40:59.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dream that I saw

00:40:59.144 --> 00:41:01.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation?

00:41:13.074 --> 00:41:15.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a God in the heavens

00:41:15.076 --> 00:41:17.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is a Revealer of secrets,

00:41:18.913 --> 00:41:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is to happen in the final part of the days.

00:41:27.797 --> 00:41:30.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is your dream:

00:41:49.152 --> 00:41:51.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You saw an immense image.

00:42:00.038 --> 00:42:03.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That image was standing in front of you.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You yourself are the head of gold.

00:42:10.757 --> 00:42:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after you another kingdom will rise,

00:42:13.802 --> 00:42:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inferior to you.

00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:18.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then another kingdom,

00:42:18.431 --> 00:42:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a third one, of copper,

00:42:20.809 --> 00:42:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will rule over the whole earth.

00:42:23.895 --> 00:42:26.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As for the fourth kingdom,

00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:29.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be strong like iron.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kingdom will be divided.

00:42:33.238 --> 00:42:35.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the toes of the feet

00:42:35.407 --> 00:42:38.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:42.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the kingdom will be partly strong

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and partly fragile.

00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:46.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days of those kings,

00:42:46.543 --> 00:42:48.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of heaven

00:42:48.545 --> 00:42:51.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will set up a kingdom

00:42:51.005 --> 00:42:53.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will never be destroyed.

00:42:53.007 --> 00:42:55.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this kingdom

00:42:55.009 --> 00:42:57.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not be passed on to any other people.

00:43:09.566 --> 00:43:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will crush and put an end

00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all these kingdoms.

00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it alone will stand forever.

00:43:57.572 --> 00:44:00.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dream is true,

00:44:00.867 --> 00:44:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation is trustworthy.

00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quick!

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring a fine robe

00:44:45.703 --> 00:44:48.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a necklace of gold.

00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:53.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Burn incense before him.

00:45:12.564 --> 00:45:16.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly your God is a God of gods

00:45:16.776 --> 00:45:18.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Lord of kings

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Revealer of secrets.

00:45:21.531 --> 00:45:23.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May your God be honored

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:25.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the honor I give you.

00:45:27.787 --> 00:45:31.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are now ruler over all the province of Babylon.

00:45:36.296 --> 00:45:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, these servants

00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:41.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also worship the God in the heavens.

00:45:41.467 --> 00:45:45.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May they too be appointed to administer the province?

00:45:49.726 --> 00:45:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make the necessary arrangements.

00:45:54.689 --> 00:45:56.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have proven far superior

00:45:58.693 --> 00:46:01.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than these so-called wise men.

00:46:03.281 --> 00:46:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now appoint you their chief prefect.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear Nebuchadnezzar?

00:46:15.752 --> 00:46:19.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he said, “Your God is a God of gods

00:46:19.172 --> 00:46:21.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 and a Lord of kings.”

00:46:21.716 --> 00:46:24.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered your prayer.

00:46:24.469 --> 00:46:27.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:46:41.778 --> 00:46:43.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to happen next?

00:46:44.989 --> 00:46:46.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we go back to Jerusalem?

00:46:49.077 --> 00:46:51.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what happens next,

00:46:51.079 --> 00:46:54.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as long as we stay close to Jehovah . . .

00:46:55.041 --> 00:46:59.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will always be with us

00:46:59.045 --> 00:47:03.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as we have faith in him.

00:47:06.427 --> 00:47:08.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing in the stars

00:47:08.471 --> 00:47:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about kingdoms crushing kingdoms.

00:47:10.473 --> 00:47:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:47:17.605 --> 00:47:19.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a trick!

00:47:19.273 --> 00:47:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did he know the dream?

00:47:21.317 --> 00:47:23.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amar-Utu!

00:47:24.278 --> 00:47:27.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amar-Utu, what message from the gods?

00:47:27.615 --> 00:47:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have examined a sheep’s liver.

00:47:30.159 --> 00:47:31.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your future is bright.

00:47:31.703 --> 00:47:33.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars of Shabatu, the giant,

00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:34.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak only of your grandeur.

00:47:34.706 --> 00:47:36.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m the head of gold.

00:47:36.708 --> 00:47:38.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah said so.

00:47:38.084 --> 00:47:40.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dream revealed many good things.

00:47:40.002 --> 00:47:43.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this Belteshazzar, he’s a Jew—

00:47:43.464 --> 00:47:45.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a clever Jew, to be sure,

00:47:45.466 --> 00:47:47.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he couldn’t interpret dreams

00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he came to Babylon.

00:47:49.053 --> 00:47:51.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He first had to be educated here

00:47:51.681 --> 00:47:55.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given a Babylonian name,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a name that honors our great god Bel.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bel used this young captive

00:48:01.482 --> 00:48:04.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal great things to you—

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bel,

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:10.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not Jehovah, who you defeated in Jerusalem.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the tree is my enemies.

00:48:39.312 --> 00:48:42.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is it after the seven times pass over?

00:48:45.234 --> 00:48:49.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it is you again, O great king.

00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:52.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are fools.

00:48:55.161 --> 00:48:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last—

00:48:57.246 --> 00:49:02.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar, chief of the magic-practicing priests,

00:49:02.168 --> 00:49:04.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the other wise men are unable

00:49:04.504 --> 00:49:08.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the interpretation known to me.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you are able to do so.

00:49:16.474 --> 00:49:19.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Explain to me the visions I’ve seen in my dreams.

00:49:23.898 --> 00:49:26.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you dream?

00:49:31.864 --> 00:49:35.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a tree in the midst of the earth,

00:49:35.368 --> 00:49:38.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its height, it was enormous

00:49:38.788 --> 00:49:40.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was enormous.

00:49:40.081 --> 00:49:42.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the tree grew and became strong,

00:49:43.709 --> 00:49:45.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its top—

00:49:45.711 --> 00:49:48.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And its top reached the heavens,

00:49:48.339 --> 00:49:49.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reached the heavens,

00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:51.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the tree grew and became strong.

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:53.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . holy one . . .

00:49:53.719 --> 00:49:54.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chop down the tree!

00:49:54.512 --> 00:49:55.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I saw a watcher . . .

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chop down the tree!

00:49:57.265 --> 00:49:58.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . with a banding of iron

00:49:58.975 --> 00:50:00.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of copper.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who’s the tree?

00:50:35.052 --> 00:50:37.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O my lord,

00:50:37.346 --> 00:50:40.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may the dream apply to those hating you

00:50:40.516 --> 00:50:43.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation to your enemies.

00:50:44.228 --> 00:50:46.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tree that you saw

00:50:46.355 --> 00:50:49.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grew great and became strong,

00:50:49.483 --> 00:50:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose top reached the heavens

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was visible to all the earth,

00:50:53.905 --> 00:50:56.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which had beautiful foliage, abundant fruit,

00:50:56.866 --> 00:50:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and food for all,

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell

00:51:01.495 --> 00:51:03.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on whose branches

00:51:03.497 --> 00:51:05.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the birds of the heavens would reside,

00:51:06.918 --> 00:51:10.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is you, O king.

00:51:11.047 --> 00:51:15.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the king saw a watcher, a holy one,

00:51:15.092 --> 00:51:18.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming down from the heavens who was saying:

00:51:18.262 --> 00:51:20.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Chop down the tree and destroy it,

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:44.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but leave the stump with its roots in the ground

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:48.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with a banding of iron and of copper.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let the dew of the heavens make it wet,

00:51:51.253 --> 00:51:53.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let its portion be

00:51:53.255 --> 00:51:55.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the beasts of the field

00:51:55.091 --> 00:51:58.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until seven times pass over it.”

00:51:59.971 --> 00:52:02.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the interpretation, O king;

00:52:02.974 --> 00:52:05.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is the decree of the Most High.

00:52:06.185 --> 00:52:09.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be driven away from among men,

00:52:09.313 --> 00:52:12.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field,

00:52:13.317 --> 00:52:15.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will be given vegetation to eat

00:52:15.903 --> 00:52:17.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like bulls,

00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:19.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will become wet

00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the dew of the heavens,

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seven times will pass over you

00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:25.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you know

00:52:25.746 --> 00:52:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Most High is Ruler

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:29.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the kingdom of mankind

00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:33.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he grants it to whomever he wants.

00:52:34.588 --> 00:52:36.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because they said to leave

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:38.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stump of the tree with its roots,

00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:41.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your kingdom will be yours again

00:52:41.012 --> 00:52:43.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after you come to know

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the heavens are ruling.

00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:51.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn away from your sins

00:52:51.147 --> 00:52:53.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing what is right

00:52:53.274 --> 00:52:54.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from your iniquity

00:52:54.567 --> 00:52:56.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing mercy to the poor.

00:52:57.903 --> 00:53:02.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that your prosperity will be extended.

00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:18.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Belteshazzar know when this will happen?

00:53:18.716 --> 00:53:19.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:53:22.261 --> 00:53:25.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your wise men

00:53:25.264 --> 00:53:28.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubt that his interpretation can be trusted.

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the facts:

00:53:30.728 --> 00:53:35.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Egypt’s gods told the Egyptians

00:53:35.733 --> 00:53:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would defeat us.

00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:41.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, you destroyed them.

00:53:43.365 --> 00:53:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why should the God of the Jews

00:53:47.036 --> 00:53:49.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be given any more credit?

00:53:51.624 --> 00:53:53.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what you’ve done.

00:53:55.503 --> 00:53:57.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gods are with you.

00:53:58.297 --> 00:54:00.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have made Babylon

00:54:00.424 --> 00:54:03.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the greatest kingdom on earth.

00:54:05.387 --> 00:54:10.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar wants you to grovel like a slave

00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:12.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you.

00:54:12.394 --> 00:54:15.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A strong king means a strong kingdom.

00:54:17.733 --> 00:54:18.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us continue with our discussion

00:54:18.984 --> 00:54:20.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the stars of Enlil.

00:54:20.528 --> 00:54:23.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Lugal star is the brightest star

00:54:23.239 --> 00:54:24.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Urgula constellation.

00:54:24.907 --> 00:54:27.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars are reliable,

00:54:27.409 --> 00:54:29.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unlike the gods of defeated nations.

00:54:31.539 --> 00:54:32.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to Jerusalem.

00:54:34.208 --> 00:54:35.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you could

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was anything left of it.

00:54:53.936 --> 00:54:58.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has Jehovah revealed anything new?

00:54:58.023 --> 00:55:00.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been ten months

00:55:00.025 --> 00:55:02.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:55:02.987 --> 00:55:04.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trust my God.

00:55:04.655 --> 00:55:08.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as we do when we read the stars.

00:55:09.535 --> 00:55:11.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we still shape the message.

00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:14.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be held responsible for the words,

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:18.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when a wise man speaks lies, well . . .

00:55:21.463 --> 00:55:23.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spoke only what Jehovah revealed.

00:55:23.757 --> 00:55:26.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you forgotten what happened

00:55:26.677 --> 00:55:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when some couldn’t interpret the dream image?

00:55:29.305 --> 00:55:31.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A death sentence followed.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was a flattering interpretation,

00:55:34.018 --> 00:55:36.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the king was a head of gold.

00:55:36.812 --> 00:55:40.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, you’ve said he’ll go mad,

00:55:40.482 --> 00:55:43.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing has happened.

00:55:43.777 --> 00:55:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will happen.

00:55:45.988 --> 00:55:49.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, maybe not.

00:55:49.158 --> 00:55:51.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your words are against the king.

00:55:51.869 --> 00:55:53.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s treason.

00:55:54.705 --> 00:55:57.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no one can protect you from that.

00:56:21.398 --> 00:56:23.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten months.

00:56:23.984 --> 00:56:26.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing has happened.

00:56:27.571 --> 00:56:29.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your words are against the king.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:33.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:56:34.828 --> 00:56:36.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s treason.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no one can protect you from that.

00:57:21.875 --> 00:57:25.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can always have Jehovah’s words with you.

00:57:32.177 --> 00:57:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instruct me in your way, O Jehovah.”

00:57:35.389 --> 00:57:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not hand me over to my adversaries,

00:57:38.475 --> 00:57:41.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for false witnesses have risen up against me,

00:57:41.895 --> 00:57:45.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they threaten me with violence.

00:57:45.858 --> 00:57:50.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where would I be if I did not have faith

00:57:50.529 --> 00:57:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I would see Jehovah’s goodness

00:57:52.656 --> 00:57:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the land of the living?”

00:57:56.994 --> 00:57:59.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, test your servants for ten days.

00:58:00.414 --> 00:58:04.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somehow, you look healthier than the others.

00:58:05.169 --> 00:58:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue giving them the diet they’ve requested.

00:58:08.964 --> 00:58:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know your God,

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ve proven

00:58:12.426 --> 00:58:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ten times better than any priest

00:58:13.719 --> 00:58:15.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or conjurer I’ve met.

00:58:16.347 --> 00:58:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a dream,

00:58:18.682 --> 00:58:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:58:31.945 --> 00:58:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered your prayer.

00:58:37.326 --> 00:58:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hope in Jehovah;

00:58:40.537 --> 00:58:43.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be courageous and strong of heart.

00:58:43.665 --> 00:58:47.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope in Jehovah.”

00:58:57.221 --> 00:58:59.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prepare a sacrifice to Bel.

00:59:07.731 --> 00:59:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the gods.

00:59:09.358 --> 00:59:11.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the gods.

00:59:14.947 --> 00:59:18.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This city is the jewel of the world.

00:59:18.617 --> 00:59:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the Ishtar Gate, the gardens,

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ziggurat so high

00:59:24.331 --> 00:59:26.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it reaches the gods themselves.

00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one would question that.

00:59:30.337 --> 00:59:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s odd that only twelve months ago

00:59:32.381 --> 00:59:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of your servants

00:59:34.425 --> 00:59:35.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dared to suggest that you’d go insane.

00:59:35.884 --> 00:59:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this not Babylon the Great

00:59:39.138 --> 00:59:43.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I myself have built for the royal house

00:59:43.892 --> 00:59:46.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my own strength and might

00:59:46.437 --> 00:59:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the glory of my majesty?

00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:53.235 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“To you it is being said,

00:59:53.235 --> 00:59:55.404 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“O King Nebuchadnezzar,

“‘The kingdom has gone away from you,

“‘and from mankind you are being driven away.

01:00:01.076 --> 01:00:04.413 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“‘With the beasts of the field your dwelling will be,

01:00:04.413 --> 01:00:06.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you will be given vegetation

01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:09.918 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center

to whomever he wants.’”

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:29.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:00:29.855 --> 01:00:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father!

01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:34.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father!

01:00:57.299 --> 01:00:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you and your wise men

01:00:59.301 --> 01:01:01.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have failed consistently,

01:01:01.094 --> 01:01:02.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you claim Daniel to be a fraud?

01:01:02.763 --> 01:01:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a trick.

01:01:04.056 --> 01:01:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel conspired against your father.

01:01:07.476 --> 01:01:09.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A trick.

01:01:09.061 --> 01:01:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then how did he make it happen?

01:01:14.358 --> 01:01:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he has said has come true,

01:01:16.485 --> 01:01:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is quite different from our history with you.

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:20.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father trusted you,

01:01:20.614 --> 01:01:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I trusted you, and you were all wrong.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either you failed or Marduk did.

01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:26.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, . . .

01:02:10.122 --> 01:02:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me:

01:02:12.374 --> 01:02:17.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is this God in the heavens, Jehovah?

01:02:43.238 --> 01:02:45.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a thrilling drama!

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:49.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s much more
to learn from the life of Daniel.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:54.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will enjoy Part II
during the final session of this convention.

01:02:56.585 --> 01:03:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Daniel, we encounter
some who oppose and misrepresent us.

01:03:01.632 --> 01:03:05.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we prevent
our faith from being undermined?

01:03:06.803 --> 01:03:09.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay close attention

01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:12.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother David Splane of the Governing Body

01:03:12.184 --> 01:03:14.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he delivers the talk

01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:17.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put Up a Hard Fight for the Faith”!

01:03:23.737 --> 01:03:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith”!

01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:32.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those are the words of Jude,
the half brother of Jesus,

01:03:32.245 --> 01:03:34.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s important to consider them
in their context.

01:03:34.998 --> 01:03:36.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that.

01:03:36.249 --> 01:03:40.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Jude 3,
and then leave your Bibles open

01:03:40.253 --> 01:03:43.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re going
to consider another verse in Jude,

01:03:43.507 --> 01:03:47.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this will help us
to get the point that Jude was making.

01:03:47.594 --> 01:03:50.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Jude 3,

01:03:53.392 --> 01:03:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:
“Beloved ones,

01:03:55.644 --> 01:03:58.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“although I was making
every effort to write you

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:01.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about the salvation we hold in common,

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I found it necessary to write you

01:04:04.653 --> 01:04:09.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to urge you to put up
a hard fight for the faith.”

01:04:10.826 --> 01:04:13.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jude himself

01:04:13.203 --> 01:04:16.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been “[putting] up
a hard fight for the faith.”

01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider this:
Just three years earlier,

01:04:20.711 --> 01:04:23.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own fleshly brother James

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:27.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was stoned to death
at the order of High Priest Ananias.

01:04:27.551 --> 01:04:30.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an open attack on God’s people,

01:04:30.554 --> 01:04:34.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it must have been
very painful to Jude and to others.

01:04:34.766 --> 01:04:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here is something interesting:

01:04:37.519 --> 01:04:40.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jude is not warning his brothers

01:04:40.313 --> 01:04:45.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about High Priest Ananias
or about persecution.

01:04:45.193 --> 01:04:47.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has something else in mind,

01:04:47.195 --> 01:04:50.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a different type of attack,
and this is a sneaky one.

01:04:50.115 --> 01:04:54.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at verse 4,
and we’ll see why he wrote his letter.

01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:59.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that the very first words are
“my reason is.”

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:02.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So this is what I have in mind
when I’m writing you brothers.’

01:05:02.794 --> 01:05:07.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My reason is that certain men
have slipped in among you

01:05:07.632 --> 01:05:12.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were long ago appointed
to this judgment by the Scriptures.”

01:05:13.346 --> 01:05:17.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jude is talking about false brothers

01:05:17.559 --> 01:05:20.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are presenting a real danger
to the congregations

01:05:20.437 --> 01:05:25.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in some ways,
a greater danger than outright persecution.

01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:29.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice what Jude said
about those false brothers?

01:05:29.154 --> 01:05:31.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had “slipped in.”

01:05:31.907 --> 01:05:33.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were sneaky.

01:05:33.909 --> 01:05:37.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was true back then,
and it’s true today, as we’ll see.

01:05:37.245 --> 01:05:41.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers, this is a very serious matter
that we’re considering today.

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:43.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of this:

01:05:43.585 --> 01:05:46.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was the Christian congregation
brought down by persecution

01:05:46.963 --> 01:05:49.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the second and third centuries?

01:05:49.341 --> 01:05:50.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t.

01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:54.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was brought down by false brothers

01:05:54.554 --> 01:05:57.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apostate teachings.

01:05:57.224 --> 01:06:00.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the Devil can use an outright attack.

01:06:00.352 --> 01:06:02.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can use persecution

01:06:02.854 --> 01:06:07.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to batter the structure
of the Christian congregation.

01:06:07.692 --> 01:06:12.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes he uses rot from within,

01:06:12.614 --> 01:06:15.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a subtle means to attack us.

01:06:15.116 --> 01:06:18.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever method he uses,
we have to fight.

01:06:18.078 --> 01:06:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our faith is involved,
and our faith is worth fighting for.

01:06:22.332 --> 01:06:24.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a gift from Jehovah.

01:06:24.334 --> 01:06:25.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to hold on to it.

01:06:25.669 --> 01:06:27.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a product of his holy spirit.

01:06:27.462 --> 01:06:32.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to put up
a hard fight for our faith.

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:35.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this talk,
we’re not going to discuss persecution.

01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:37.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to discuss
two of the subtle means

01:06:37.973 --> 01:06:40.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan uses to weaken our faith:

01:06:40.475 --> 01:06:42.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apostasy

01:06:42.561 --> 01:06:47.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and negative reports
about Jehovah’s Witnesses in the media.

01:06:47.482 --> 01:06:50.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So first, let’s talk about apostasy,

01:06:50.652 --> 01:06:55.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll call it spiritual poison.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:57.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about poison.

01:06:57.492 --> 01:07:00.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the best way to avoid being poisoned?

01:07:00.537 --> 01:07:05.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have to recognize poison
when we see it, and then avoid it.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the same principle applies

01:07:07.544 --> 01:07:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teachings that could destroy our faith.

01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:13.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s not always easy.

01:07:13.842 --> 01:07:15.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, not many of our brothers and sisters

01:07:15.969 --> 01:07:18.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would deliberately get involved
with apostates,

01:07:18.805 --> 01:07:21.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it could happen without our realizing it.

01:07:21.558 --> 01:07:25.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We receive letters at times
from brothers and sisters

01:07:25.353 --> 01:07:28.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are troubled by something
they saw on a web page,

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:33.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an accusation, a rumor about the Society,
or about the organization.

01:07:33.695 --> 01:07:35.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the problem is,

01:07:35.697 --> 01:07:39.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had no idea
that apostates were behind it.

01:07:39.284 --> 01:07:42.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s tricky
because the apostates don’t advertise,

01:07:42.454 --> 01:07:45.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are now on an apostate web page.”

01:07:45.373 --> 01:07:48.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They often pose as sincere Witnesses

01:07:48.168 --> 01:07:51.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who just have questions or concerns.

01:07:51.796 --> 01:07:54.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some who aren’t really apostates

01:07:54.215 --> 01:07:57.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause just as much trouble
as the apostates do

01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:00.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their negative talk and criticism.

01:08:00.013 --> 01:08:03.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, we need to be on the alert.

01:08:03.058 --> 01:08:05.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is serious.

01:08:05.477 --> 01:08:07.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose that out of curiosity

01:08:07.979 --> 01:08:10.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you get into a discussion forum
with individuals

01:08:10.857 --> 01:08:12.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who claim to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:08:12.901 --> 01:08:14.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe they are, maybe they aren’t.

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:16.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t know.
You’ve never met them.

01:08:16.488 --> 01:08:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someone starts asking questions:

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What did you think
of last month’s broadcast?

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you really find it encouraging?”

01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:26.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “Do you think the brothers
who write <i>Watchtower</i>  articles

01:08:26.998 --> 01:08:29.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are living in the real world?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wonder if they realize
just how hard it is out here.”

01:08:32.462 --> 01:08:36.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then a few others join in
with their own negative comments.

01:08:36.925 --> 01:08:40.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you don’t know
whether these individuals are apostates

01:08:40.261 --> 01:08:44.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just brothers and sisters
who are in serious spiritual trouble.

01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:46.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does it matter?

01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:48.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does it make you feel?

01:08:48.103 --> 01:08:51.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you leave the forum,
do you feel upbuilt,

01:08:51.815 --> 01:08:54.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
determined to expand your ministry,

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:58.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more convinced than ever that Jehovah
has an organization that you love

01:08:58.113 --> 01:09:00.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you’re delighted to be a part of?

01:09:00.115 --> 01:09:03.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you feel honored
to be a part of that organization?

01:09:03.368 --> 01:09:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or does the experience leave you sad,

01:09:07.455 --> 01:09:10.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uneasy, uncomfortable?

01:09:11.793 --> 01:09:13.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, someone might say,

01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:17.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I need to get involved in that forum
so that I can help those people.”

01:09:17.549 --> 01:09:19.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They shouldn’t be together.

01:09:19.801 --> 01:09:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if they aren’t apostates,
they’re not good for one another.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Staying in that forum to “help someone”

01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:29.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like holding his hand
while he drinks poison

01:09:29.853 --> 01:09:33.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then having some yourself
so that he doesn’t have to drink alone.

01:09:33.773 --> 01:09:35.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to follow the advice

01:09:35.817 --> 01:09:39.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded at Romans 16:17.

01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:43.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about this imaginary forum
that we just described

01:09:43.575 --> 01:09:48.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the light of Romans 16:17.

01:09:48.246 --> 01:09:50.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
there are all kinds of negative talk

01:09:50.665 --> 01:09:52.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flying around in this forum;

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:54.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t know who’s behind it.

01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:59.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s what it says at Romans 16:17:

01:09:59.257 --> 01:10:02.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I urge you, brothers,
to keep your eye

01:10:02.927 --> 01:10:07.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on those who create divisions

01:10:07.098 --> 01:10:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and causes for stumbling

01:10:11.311 --> 01:10:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“contrary to the teaching
that you have learned,

01:10:14.731 --> 01:10:16.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid them.”

01:10:16.733 --> 01:10:19.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about that forum.

01:10:19.319 --> 01:10:22.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it create divisions?

01:10:22.322 --> 01:10:23.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:10:23.907 --> 01:10:25.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it a cause for stumbling?

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:27.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could be.

01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:30.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it contrary to what we have learned?

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we even have to answer that question?

01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:37.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, whether it’s intended or not,
the effect will be to weaken our faith.

01:10:37.712 --> 01:10:38.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we do?

01:10:38.797 --> 01:10:41.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Paul tell us to do
here at the end of verse 17?

01:10:41.549 --> 01:10:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Avoid them.”

01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:48.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’d like to say a kind word

01:10:48.556 --> 01:10:52.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to some who may be involved
in discussion forums.

01:10:52.102 --> 01:10:56.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may like to use this medium
to blow off steam, so to speak.

01:10:56.147 --> 01:10:58.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe there are
little things in the congregation

01:10:58.566 --> 01:11:00.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are happening
that you wonder about

01:11:00.568 --> 01:11:02.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or decisions the elders have made

01:11:02.737 --> 01:11:05.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you wonder about,
and so you write.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get involved in the forum,
and you blow off steam,

01:11:08.118 --> 01:11:10.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after that, you feel better.

01:11:10.495 --> 01:11:12.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about others in the forum?

01:11:12.956 --> 01:11:14.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they feel?

01:11:14.958 --> 01:11:18.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t you feel awful
if negative comments you made

01:11:18.336 --> 01:11:21.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were responsible
for someone leaving the truth?

01:11:21.381 --> 01:11:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you wouldn’t want that to happen.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please, please,
be careful about what you say.

01:11:29.639 --> 01:11:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another person might say:

01:11:31.641 --> 01:11:34.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, I can see where those warnings
about apostates apply to so-and-so.

01:11:34.686 --> 01:11:36.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s weak,
but don’t worry about me.

01:11:36.729 --> 01:11:39.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m spiritually strong.
I can handle it.”

01:11:40.150 --> 01:11:43.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s like a weight lifter thinking
that he can drink a vial of poison

01:11:43.945 --> 01:11:47.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it won’t hurt him
because he’s so big and strong.

01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:51.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not so strong,
so spiritual, so intelligent

01:11:51.744 --> 01:11:56.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can’t be affected
by the poison of apostate ideas.

01:11:57.834 --> 01:12:01.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when might we feel pressured

01:12:01.379 --> 01:12:04.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read something
that the apostates have written?

01:12:04.966 --> 01:12:07.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider this scenario:

01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:09.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unbelieving husband of your Bible student

01:12:09.929 --> 01:12:13.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sends his wife a link
to an apostate web page and says,

01:12:13.683 --> 01:12:17.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here, you better look at this
and see what you’re getting into.”

01:12:17.228 --> 01:12:19.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your student is concerned,

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:22.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she wants you to take a look
and tell her what you think.

01:12:22.817 --> 01:12:24.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not an option.

01:12:24.944 --> 01:12:28.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “Avoid them.”

01:12:28.031 --> 01:12:31.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t mean reading apostate literature

01:12:31.242 --> 01:12:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or searching social media
to see what they’re saying about us.

01:12:34.704 --> 01:12:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you say to your student?

01:12:38.249 --> 01:12:41.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say something like this:

01:12:41.002 --> 01:12:44.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can imagine
that this is very upsetting for you,

01:12:44.589 --> 01:12:47.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you certainly do need to know
what you’re getting into.

01:12:47.967 --> 01:12:49.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have a suggestion.

01:12:49.552 --> 01:12:51.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have nothing to hide.

01:12:51.304 --> 01:12:53.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you’re at the meetings,
listen carefully

01:12:53.348 --> 01:12:55.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to what the brothers are saying.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:58.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Watch how we interact with one another.

01:12:58.144 --> 01:13:01.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take note
of how the organization is financed.

01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:03.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Get to know the elders and their wives.

01:13:03.858 --> 01:13:07.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Introduce yourself to the circuit overseer
and his wife when they come.

01:13:07.487 --> 01:13:09.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Visit world headquarters or the branch.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ll come with you.
I’ll help you.

01:13:11.783 --> 01:13:15.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I want you to get really acquainted
with the organization.

01:13:15.286 --> 01:13:18.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And if you do,
I’m sure you’ll soon realize

01:13:18.957 --> 01:13:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what these people
are saying about us isn’t true.”

01:13:22.877 --> 01:13:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe you can think of a better answer,
but you get the idea.

01:13:28.049 --> 01:13:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few drops of poison in a drink

01:13:31.761 --> 01:13:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are enough to cause serious harm.

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:38.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And apostates
often mix a few truths with lies.

01:13:38.518 --> 01:13:42.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Eliphaz,
one of Job’s false comforters?

01:13:42.188 --> 01:13:44.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of what he said was true.

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:48.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Job 5:13.

01:13:50.905 --> 01:13:55.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job chapter 5 (I’ll give you a moment)
and verse 13.

01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if what I read sounds familiar:

01:14:01.499 --> 01:14:06.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He catches the wise in their own cunning,

01:14:06.087 --> 01:14:09.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the plans of the shrewd
are thwarted.”

01:14:09.549 --> 01:14:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He catches the wise in their own cunning.”

01:14:13.761 --> 01:14:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that sound familiar?

01:14:15.763 --> 01:14:16.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, yes.

01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:20.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul said the very same thing
at 1 Corinthians 3:19.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the marginal reference,

01:14:22.562 --> 01:14:25.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see (in the little <i>a</i>  in the middle there)

01:14:25.356 --> 01:14:27.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians 3:19.

01:14:27.525 --> 01:14:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul may even have been quoting Eliphaz.

01:14:32.488 --> 01:14:35.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was a truth.

01:14:35.033 --> 01:14:39.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did Jehovah feel
about Eliphaz’s argument overall?

01:14:39.412 --> 01:14:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Job 42:7

01:14:42.957 --> 01:14:46.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how Jehovah felt about it.

01:14:46.502 --> 01:14:49.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 42:7:

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:55.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job,

01:14:55.261 --> 01:14:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite:

01:14:58.222 --> 01:15:02.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My anger burns against you
and your two companions,

01:15:02.185 --> 01:15:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you have not spoken
the truth about me

01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as my servant Job has.’”

01:15:08.358 --> 01:15:12.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few grains of truth
were mixed in with falsehoods,

01:15:12.862 --> 01:15:17.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at least some of what Eliphaz said
was inspired by the demons.

01:15:17.241 --> 01:15:18.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know that?

01:15:18.785 --> 01:15:20.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He admitted it.

01:15:20.244 --> 01:15:24.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Job 4:15-17.

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.
This is interesting.

01:15:29.587 --> 01:15:32.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 4:15-17,

01:15:35.009 --> 01:15:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliphaz says:
“A spirit passed over my face;

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the hair of my flesh bristled.

01:15:41.849 --> 01:15:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It then stood still,

01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:47.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I did not recognize its appearance.”

01:15:47.522 --> 01:15:49.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s stop there for a second.

01:15:49.524 --> 01:15:52.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I did not recognize its appearance.”

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he didn’t know whom he was talking to,

01:15:55.405 --> 01:16:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like someone in a discussion forum
may not know whom he is talking to.

01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:03.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue; he says:

01:16:03.329 --> 01:16:07.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A form was in front of my eyes;
there was a calm,

01:16:07.959 --> 01:16:10.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then I heard a voice:

01:16:10.837 --> 01:16:13.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Can a mortal man
be more righteous than God?

01:16:13.798 --> 01:16:16.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can a man
be cleaner than his own Maker?’”

01:16:17.969 --> 01:16:21.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it surprise you
that a demon would get involved

01:16:21.139 --> 01:16:24.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the debate
between Job and the false comforters?

01:16:24.434 --> 01:16:25.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shouldn’t.

01:16:25.643 --> 01:16:27.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was no small debate.

01:16:27.228 --> 01:16:28.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big issue.

01:16:28.896 --> 01:16:33.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan had challenged Jehovah
in the presence of all the angels

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no man
would keep his integrity under test.

01:16:36.487 --> 01:16:39.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That demon was using Eliphaz

01:16:39.157 --> 01:16:42.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to demoralize Job and weaken his faith.

01:16:42.743 --> 01:16:47.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was something that Job had to fight for,
and Job fought back.

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:53.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apostates are more active in some places
than they are in others.

01:16:53.129 --> 01:16:56.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if there’s a lot of apostate activity
in your area,

01:16:56.299 --> 01:16:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people in the territory may be listening

01:16:58.342 --> 01:17:01.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may challenge you
when you meet them in the ministry.

01:17:01.596 --> 01:17:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how should you handle it?

01:17:03.764 --> 01:17:07.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t try to argue with the apostates;

01:17:07.143 --> 01:17:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t read their comments.

01:17:09.812 --> 01:17:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask the elders
or other experienced publishers

01:17:12.482 --> 01:17:15.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for suggestions
on how to answer the householders.

01:17:17.028 --> 01:17:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how poisonous are apostate teachings?

01:17:21.824 --> 01:17:26.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out
as we watch the following video.

01:17:27.663 --> 01:17:31.626 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was in my 40’s, I was divorced,

01:17:31.626 --> 01:17:34.504 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had three younger kids at home,

01:17:34.504 --> 01:17:36.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working three jobs,

01:17:36.797 --> 01:17:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had drifted away from the congregation.

01:17:40.009 --> 01:17:43.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had an acquaintance who was telling me

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was in a cult

01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I needed to look

01:17:49.393 --> 01:17:51.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at some information that he had.

01:17:53.564 --> 01:17:55.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was about 30 years old,

01:17:55.608 --> 01:17:56.817 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a fellow employee saw

01:17:56.817 --> 01:17:58.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:17:58.402 --> 01:18:00.696 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and was trying to access jw.org.

01:18:00.696 --> 01:18:03.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told me about someone
he knew in another country

01:18:03.366 --> 01:18:05.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could prove to me
that Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t have the truth.

01:18:07.537 --> 01:18:09.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me curious,

01:18:09.539 --> 01:18:11.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and little by little, I was persuaded to look

01:18:11.624 --> 01:18:13.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at apostate material.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born and raised in the truth,

01:18:17.171 --> 01:18:19.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah

01:18:19.465 --> 01:18:22.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the age of 16,

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.011 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but I began to associate with people

01:18:24.011 --> 01:18:26.264 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who had either formerly been associated

01:18:26.264 --> 01:18:27.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the truth

01:18:27.265 --> 01:18:31.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or were very loosely associated
with Jehovah and his organization,

01:18:31.561 --> 01:18:35.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s really where the apostasy
began to take root.

01:18:36.857 --> 01:18:39.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was reading this literature,

01:18:39.443 --> 01:18:41.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw through it to an extent,

01:18:42.863 --> 01:18:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you’re drifting away,

01:18:44.907 --> 01:18:47.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re looking for a reason not to believe.

01:18:49.078 --> 01:18:50.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to feed my mind

01:18:50.955 --> 01:18:54.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with different philosophies, different ideas.

01:18:54.041 --> 01:18:57.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even studied different religions.

01:18:57.461 --> 01:19:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, I told myself
that I was doing that academically,

01:19:01.257 --> 01:19:03.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it started to influence the way

01:19:03.551 --> 01:19:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I thought and felt about things.

01:19:06.053 --> 01:19:09.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the elders reached out to me.

01:19:09.348 --> 01:19:12.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very combative with those brothers.

01:19:12.518 --> 01:19:16.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even made the accusation
that Noah’s ark was

01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:19.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fairy tale,
that it was part of mythology.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those apostate doubts that I was reading

01:19:23.362 --> 01:19:26.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.

01:19:26.365 --> 01:19:28.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped reading the publications,

01:19:28.409 --> 01:19:30.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped going to the meetings,

01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:33.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result,
my spiritual routine was dead.

01:19:33.706 --> 01:19:36.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I’d try to find truth elsewhere.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I looked for something out there that was

01:19:38.252 --> 01:19:41.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with what I knew the Bible taught.

01:19:41.047 --> 01:19:43.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I couldn’t find anything.

01:19:44.258 --> 01:19:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Sunday morning,
I rode by the Kingdom Hall,

01:19:48.137 --> 01:19:50.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said to myself,

01:19:50.139 --> 01:19:52.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, they’re all in there
waiting for Armageddon.’

01:19:52.933 --> 01:19:55.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately when I thought that thought,

01:19:55.478 --> 01:19:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to myself:

01:19:57.104 --> 01:19:59.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, at least they
feel good about themselves.

01:19:59.607 --> 01:20:01.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel?’

01:20:01.609 --> 01:20:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer was I felt terrible.

01:20:06.697 --> 01:20:09.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, by skillful use of the Scriptures
and just reasoning with me,

01:20:09.825 --> 01:20:12.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders got me to realize

01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:14.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had been ‘carried off’

01:20:14.121 --> 01:20:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that I had been ‘taken captive’
by human philosophy,

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the deceptions

01:20:19.794 --> 01:20:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the empty reasoning of men.

01:20:23.297 --> 01:20:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually said a prayer;
I supplicated Jehovah

01:20:26.258 --> 01:20:29.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would really show me
the way to the truth.

01:20:29.011 --> 01:20:31.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took away

01:20:31.013 --> 01:20:33.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this feeling of emptiness,
spiritually speaking.

01:20:35.226 --> 01:20:38.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that a relationship with Jehovah

01:20:38.437 --> 01:20:41.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s our most precious possession.

01:20:41.565 --> 01:20:43.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to get back.

01:20:43.984 --> 01:20:46.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible with sincerity.

01:20:46.487 --> 01:20:49.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart,

01:20:49.615 --> 01:20:52.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted it to effect
change in my behavior.

01:20:52.493 --> 01:20:56.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now as I did that,
I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts.

01:20:56.414 --> 01:21:00.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to help me
to rebuild that relationship with him.

01:21:01.502 --> 01:21:03.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I began to use Jehovah’s name.

01:21:04.463 --> 01:21:07.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy

01:21:07.508 --> 01:21:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a great pleasure to me.

01:21:09.552 --> 01:21:12.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result was that my ministry
was very productive.

01:21:12.012 --> 01:21:14.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s an amazing joy

01:21:14.014 --> 01:21:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to help someone
come to love Jehovah.

01:21:17.977 --> 01:21:19.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just so happy

01:21:19.979 --> 01:21:22.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be back under Jehovah’s wings

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have that peace of mind.

01:21:24.984 --> 01:21:26.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How loving Jehovah is!

01:21:26.485 --> 01:21:27.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to help us.

01:21:27.903 --> 01:21:29.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what better helper could we have?

01:21:29.530 --> 01:21:31.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the best in the universe.

01:21:32.825 --> 01:21:36.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
the second challenge we face:

01:21:36.871 --> 01:21:40.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
negative reports
about Jehovah’s Witnesses in the media.

01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s a good principle to follow

01:21:42.918 --> 01:21:46.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 14:15.

01:21:46.881 --> 01:21:48.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

01:21:48.382 --> 01:21:52.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs chapter 14

01:21:52.303 --> 01:21:56.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 15,

01:21:56.223 --> 01:22:01.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“The naive person believes every word,

01:22:01.228 --> 01:22:05.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the shrewd one ponders each step.”

01:22:06.650 --> 01:22:11.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people believe everything
they read in the newspaper or see on TV.

01:22:12.239 --> 01:22:13.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you?

01:22:13.866 --> 01:22:15.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should you?

01:22:15.701 --> 01:22:18.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider this:
Now, you’re working from door to door,

01:22:18.996 --> 01:22:20.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you meet a householder who says:

01:22:20.998 --> 01:22:23.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You Jehovah’s Witnesses are terrible people.

01:22:23.334 --> 01:22:26.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You let your children die.
You don’t accept medical treatment.”

01:22:27.421 --> 01:22:28.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you ask the householder,

01:22:28.881 --> 01:22:31.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know
any Jehovah’s Witnesses personally?”

01:22:31.717 --> 01:22:32.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No.”

01:22:33.052 --> 01:22:36.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then where did you get the idea
that we let our children die

01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:38.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t accept medical treatment?”

01:22:39.058 --> 01:22:42.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The householder says:
“I have it on good authority.

01:22:42.353 --> 01:22:44.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it in the newspaper.”

01:22:45.272 --> 01:22:50.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if it’s in the newspaper,
it must be true, right?

01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:52.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

01:22:52.112 --> 01:22:55.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember this:
Reporters have a deadline to meet,

01:22:55.449 --> 01:23:00.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a reporter may not have the time
or the inclination to check the facts.

01:23:00.412 --> 01:23:04.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or the reporter
may have written a balanced article,

01:23:04.542 --> 01:23:06.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then the editor changes it.

01:23:06.627 --> 01:23:09.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe the editor
doesn’t like Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:23:09.255 --> 01:23:12.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or he’s been misinformed about us.

01:23:12.174 --> 01:23:14.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s bad enough if people in the world

01:23:14.718 --> 01:23:17.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
believe everything they read in the newspaper

01:23:17.012 --> 01:23:20.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, brothers, let’s not be among them.

01:23:20.057 --> 01:23:25.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s not be naive;
let’s consider things carefully.

01:23:26.522 --> 01:23:31.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, sometimes there’s a TV program
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:23:31.443 --> 01:23:35.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a few of these programs
are balanced and fair.

01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:38.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many or, I daresay, most are not.

01:23:38.826 --> 01:23:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they’re not, you’ll often find
that the producers started out

01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a negative view of Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:48.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they looked for information
to support their prejudice.

01:23:48.252 --> 01:23:50.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whom did they turn to?

01:23:50.504 --> 01:23:52.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apostates and the clergy.

01:23:52.673 --> 01:23:56.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From them,
they got suggestions for people to interview.

01:23:56.218 --> 01:23:58.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know what those people would say.

01:23:58.846 --> 01:24:02.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the very last minute,
they may ask the brothers for a comment

01:24:02.349 --> 01:24:04.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to give an appearance of fairness,

01:24:04.351 --> 01:24:07.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the program wasn’t designed to be fair.

01:24:07.187 --> 01:24:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was designed to be unfair.

01:24:09.231 --> 01:24:12.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was slanted against Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:24:14.069 --> 01:24:16.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s be clear.

01:24:16.238 --> 01:24:20.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some news organizations
are very conscientious about their reporting,

01:24:20.326 --> 01:24:23.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want to present
both sides of an issue.

01:24:23.537 --> 01:24:25.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And where Jehovah’s Witnesses
are concerned,

01:24:25.748 --> 01:24:28.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they do so at their cost.

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:31.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a newspaper publishes
anything positive about us,

01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:33.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the churches will push back.

01:24:33.672 --> 01:24:35.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Our parishioners are upset.

01:24:35.424 --> 01:24:37.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They subscribe to your newspaper,

01:24:37.217 --> 01:24:40.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they don’t like reading favorable things
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.’

01:24:40.721 --> 01:24:42.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The message:

01:24:42.181 --> 01:24:46.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If it ever happens again,
you’re going to lose subscribers.’

01:24:47.686 --> 01:24:51.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this matter of Jehovah’s people

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being the subject of malicious reports
isn’t new.

01:24:55.194 --> 01:24:58.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the days of Queen Esther.

01:24:58.906 --> 01:25:03.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wicked Haman brings a bad report
to King Ahasuerus.

01:25:03.369 --> 01:25:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The Jews don’t obey our laws.

01:25:05.454 --> 01:25:08.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re a danger to society.’

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Ahasuerus check the facts?

01:25:10.876 --> 01:25:12.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he demand proof?

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:25:14.171 --> 01:25:16.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ahasuerus is naive;

01:25:16.423 --> 01:25:20.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he allows himself to be taken in by Haman.

01:25:21.303 --> 01:25:24.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are
a lot of modern-day Hamans today,

01:25:24.306 --> 01:25:27.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they use similar tactics.

01:25:27.393 --> 01:25:31.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
some government officials are taken in.

01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:35.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They believe the slanderous accusations
of the apostates.

01:25:35.526 --> 01:25:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if they just took the time
to check the facts,

01:25:38.654 --> 01:25:43.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’d see that they’re being lied to,
but they don’t check the facts.

01:25:43.117 --> 01:25:45.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now again, it’s bad enough, brothers,

01:25:45.786 --> 01:25:49.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when government officials
are taken in by false reports,

01:25:49.456 --> 01:25:51.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so don’t you be taken in.

01:25:54.044 --> 01:25:57.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever heard the expression
“trial by media”?

01:25:59.425 --> 01:26:02.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It works like this:
Someone is charged with a crime,

01:26:02.845 --> 01:26:05.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the case
is widely publicized in the media,

01:26:05.681 --> 01:26:08.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the media
presents the case in such a way

01:26:08.517 --> 01:26:12.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that everyone who hears about it
thinks the man is guilty.

01:26:12.604 --> 01:26:16.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
to avoid a lawsuit for slander or libel,

01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:19.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these media reports
are very carefully worded,

01:26:19.403 --> 01:26:21.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to understand
what the wording means.

01:26:21.572 --> 01:26:23.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a good principle to keep in mind

01:26:23.574 --> 01:26:27.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Job chapter 12

01:26:27.536 --> 01:26:29.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 11.

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how many principles

01:26:31.915 --> 01:26:34.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can draw from the book of Job
for this talk.

01:26:34.418 --> 01:26:38.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 12:11,

01:26:38.881 --> 01:26:42.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is Job speaking and he says:

01:26:42.134 --> 01:26:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not the ear test out words

01:26:45.888 --> 01:26:48.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the tongue tastes food?”

01:26:49.224 --> 01:26:52.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not the ear test out words?”

01:26:52.978 --> 01:26:54.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

01:26:54.646 --> 01:26:59.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean that if we learn that apostates
are going to be featured on a TV program,

01:26:59.276 --> 01:27:02.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should watch it
to see if what they say is true?

01:27:02.529 --> 01:27:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:27:03.947 --> 01:27:08.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It basically means
to consider the source of the words.

01:27:08.327 --> 01:27:12.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are the words of apostates,
why would we believe them?

01:27:12.706 --> 01:27:14.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think of it this way:

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:18.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a bottle on your shelf
that’s marked “poison.”

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:22.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you need to open it up and take a swig
to see if it really is poison?

01:27:22.925 --> 01:27:26.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Believe what the label says.

01:27:26.261 --> 01:27:28.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for the purpose of this discussion,

01:27:28.847 --> 01:27:32.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider another way
we can test out words

01:27:32.017 --> 01:27:35.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that is to pay attention
to what the words mean.

01:27:35.854 --> 01:27:38.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we talked about media reports

01:27:38.273 --> 01:27:41.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how these are very often carefully worded

01:27:41.443 --> 01:27:43.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid a lawsuit.

01:27:43.529 --> 01:27:45.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So suppose a report indicates

01:27:45.864 --> 01:27:48.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone has been charged with a crime

01:27:48.408 --> 01:27:50.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he’s being investigated.

01:27:50.744 --> 01:27:55.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, you have two words:
charged and investigated.

01:27:55.374 --> 01:27:58.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t mean he’s guilty.

01:27:58.168 --> 01:28:02.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or suppose that someone
is convicted and put in jail.

01:28:02.714 --> 01:28:05.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that would apply
to our young brothers in Korea, wouldn’t it?

01:28:05.634 --> 01:28:07.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were convicted and jailed.

01:28:07.761 --> 01:28:09.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was their crime?

01:28:09.763 --> 01:28:12.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They refused to kill someone.

01:28:12.641 --> 01:28:15.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they do anything wrong?

01:28:15.602 --> 01:28:19.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if someone is found guilty by man,

01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus was,

01:28:21.191 --> 01:28:25.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t mean that he’s guilty
in the sight of God.

01:28:25.404 --> 01:28:28.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers,
we really have to think about these things.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may read that a person
or an organization was sued

01:28:32.911 --> 01:28:35.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then settled out of court.

01:28:35.664 --> 01:28:39.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does settling out of court
mean that they were guilty?

01:28:39.668 --> 01:28:41.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

01:28:41.712 --> 01:28:46.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this country and others,
court cases are often handled by a jury.

01:28:46.383 --> 01:28:48.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, who are on the jury?

01:28:48.385 --> 01:28:50.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ordinary citizens with no legal training.

01:28:50.888 --> 01:28:53.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only that,
these ordinary citizens

01:28:53.974 --> 01:28:56.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t always have access to all the facts

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the judge and lawyers decide
which facts will be shared with the jury,

01:29:01.148 --> 01:29:06.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s unlikely that the whole truth
will ever come out in court.

01:29:06.111 --> 01:29:11.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, neither side probably wants
the whole truth to come out in court.

01:29:12.075 --> 01:29:15.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes attorneys
deliberately withhold information

01:29:15.412 --> 01:29:18.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be prejudicial to their clients.

01:29:18.123 --> 01:29:22.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in addition, the juries
have prejudices like everyone else,

01:29:22.294 --> 01:29:26.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them
just can’t set their prejudices aside.

01:29:27.716 --> 01:29:30.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you an actual experience.

01:29:30.010 --> 01:29:34.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago,
a lawyer told me about a case he had.

01:29:34.598 --> 01:29:38.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a case
of medical malpractice by a doctor.

01:29:38.936 --> 01:29:40.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a jury.

01:29:40.354 --> 01:29:44.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at trial, the doctor was clearly shown
to be in the wrong

01:29:44.775 --> 01:29:48.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the jury didn’t give the patient a penny.

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lawyer was confused.

01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:55.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after the trial,
he approached two of the jurors and asked,

01:29:55.118 --> 01:29:59.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you don’t mind, tell me which part
of the testimony you didn’t believe.”

01:29:59.331 --> 01:30:02.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The jurors replied:
“Oh, we didn’t get that far.

01:30:02.417 --> 01:30:04.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The doctor was cute,

01:30:04.544 --> 01:30:07.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we didn’t want him
to have to pay anything.”

01:30:07.589 --> 01:30:09.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With deep thinkers like that,

01:30:09.591 --> 01:30:12.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no wonder many lawyers
try to settle their cases

01:30:12.344 --> 01:30:14.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than bring them to a jury.

01:30:15.806 --> 01:30:17.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But someone will say:

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, I don’t believe
in settling out of court.

01:30:19.559 --> 01:30:21.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe in justice and truth.”

01:30:21.979 --> 01:30:24.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that brings up the question,

01:30:24.022 --> 01:30:28.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it wrong to settle a matter
before it goes to trial?

01:30:28.527 --> 01:30:30.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is it Scriptural?

01:30:30.529 --> 01:30:32.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s let Jesus answer that question.

01:30:32.864 --> 01:30:37.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Matthew 5:25, 26.

01:30:41.999 --> 01:30:46.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting
that Jesus should mention this

01:30:46.378 --> 01:30:50.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the important things
that Jesus taught.

01:30:50.966 --> 01:30:55.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:25, 26:

01:30:55.971 --> 01:30:59.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be quick to settle matters

01:30:59.558 --> 01:31:01.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with your legal opponent,

01:31:01.727 --> 01:31:04.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while you are with him on the way there,

01:31:04.604 --> 01:31:08.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that somehow the opponent
may not turn you over to the judge,

01:31:08.442 --> 01:31:10.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the judge to the court attendant,

01:31:10.944 --> 01:31:13.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you get thrown into prison.

01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:15.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I say to you for a fact,

01:31:15.032 --> 01:31:17.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will certainly not come out of there

01:31:17.242 --> 01:31:20.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you have paid over
your last small coin.”

01:31:22.748 --> 01:31:25.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is interesting.

01:31:25.042 --> 01:31:27.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the Mosaic Law.

01:31:27.127 --> 01:31:29.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there any provision in the Mosaic Law

01:31:29.212 --> 01:31:32.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to throw someone in jail
if he couldn’t pay a debt?

01:31:32.007 --> 01:31:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That wasn’t the way.

01:31:33.717 --> 01:31:36.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he couldn’t pay, he’d have to work it off

01:31:36.261 --> 01:31:39.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a family member would have to work it off.

01:31:39.014 --> 01:31:42.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jesus talks about prison and a judge,

01:31:42.851 --> 01:31:46.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s obviously referring
to what a Gentile judge would do.

01:31:46.605 --> 01:31:50.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you couldn’t necessarily expect
justice from him.

01:31:50.067 --> 01:31:53.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why might he rule against our brother?

01:31:53.487 --> 01:31:57.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe he got paid
under the table by the other party.

01:31:57.032 --> 01:31:59.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe he was prejudiced

01:31:59.034 --> 01:32:03.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the race
or the religion of the other party.

01:32:03.789 --> 01:32:07.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice, Jesus didn’t say
that the man should settle

01:32:07.876 --> 01:32:10.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only if he was guilty.

01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:13.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, let’s not be naive;

01:32:13.382 --> 01:32:16.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t believe everything you read.

01:32:16.009 --> 01:32:18.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just because an article
is called a news report

01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:20.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t make it true,

01:32:20.472 --> 01:32:22.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an editorial is someone’s opinion

01:32:22.474 --> 01:32:24.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that someone may be wrong.

01:32:24.726 --> 01:32:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And TV producers
may have their own agenda,

01:32:28.397 --> 01:32:31.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prejudice, and viewpoint.

01:32:32.401 --> 01:32:37.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we say in conclusion?

01:32:38.115 --> 01:32:41.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our faith is under attack,

01:32:41.743 --> 01:32:43.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have to fight.

01:32:43.745 --> 01:32:46.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah gives us
what we need to fight with.

01:32:46.665 --> 01:32:50.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things he gives us
is good associations.

01:32:50.127 --> 01:32:53.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will try to lure us
away from good associations.

01:32:53.171 --> 01:32:54.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll try to weaken our faith

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by getting us involved in bad associations
without our knowing it,

01:32:58.718 --> 01:33:03.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah provides
good association in the congregation.

01:33:03.265 --> 01:33:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are people we know.
These are people we love.

01:33:05.934 --> 01:33:09.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are people
who have our best interests at heart.

01:33:09.938 --> 01:33:14.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind the principle we find
at Proverbs 13:20:

01:33:21.408 --> 01:33:26.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise,

01:33:26.079 --> 01:33:30.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one who has dealings with the stupid
will fare badly.”

01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:33.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the members of your congregation;

01:33:33.086 --> 01:33:35.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that they are wise;

01:33:35.088 --> 01:33:38.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that they have
your best interests at heart.

01:33:38.008 --> 01:33:40.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you get involved in a forum,

01:33:40.302 --> 01:33:43.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might not know whether you’re walking
with wise persons or not

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:45.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at least not at first.

01:33:45.182 --> 01:33:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be careful.

01:33:47.517 --> 01:33:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the conversation turns negative,

01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:52.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get out.

01:33:53.148 --> 01:33:58.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is behind
the twisted teachings of apostates.

01:33:58.153 --> 01:34:00.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is “the father of the lie.”

01:34:00.155 --> 01:34:04.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those who lie
are doing exactly what their father does.

01:34:04.951 --> 01:34:07.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostates have nothing
to offer us, brothers.

01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:09.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they have to offer is hate.

01:34:09.873 --> 01:34:14.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they have to offer
is criticism and negative talk.

01:34:14.252 --> 01:34:16.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, oh, how upbuilt we feel

01:34:16.922 --> 01:34:19.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re with those who love Jehovah!

01:34:19.466 --> 01:34:24.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah provides us
with good, wholesome associations.

01:34:24.012 --> 01:34:27.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also provides us with his Word of truth,

01:34:27.224 --> 01:34:29.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an accurate knowledge of the truth

01:34:29.267 --> 01:34:31.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the best defense against apostasy.

01:34:31.645 --> 01:34:34.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the Bible every day and meditate on it.

01:34:34.314 --> 01:34:37.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay attention to the words;
pay attention to what they mean.

01:34:37.817 --> 01:34:42.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like the Beroeans
referred to at Acts chapter 17

01:34:42.822 --> 01:34:45.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 10 and 11.

01:34:45.242 --> 01:34:46.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that.

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 17:10, 11:

01:34:53.583 --> 01:34:58.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately by night the brothers
sent both Paul and Silas to Beroea.

01:34:58.505 --> 01:35:01.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On arriving,
they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now these were more noble-minded
than those in Thessalonica,

01:35:05.679 --> 01:35:09.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for they accepted the word
with the greatest eagerness of mind,

01:35:09.516 --> 01:35:13.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“carefully examining the Scriptures daily

01:35:13.228 --> 01:35:16.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[carefully examining the Scriptures daily]

01:35:16.982 --> 01:35:20.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see whether these things were so.”

01:35:20.694 --> 01:35:25.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul compares the Beroeans
with the Thessalonians.

01:35:25.574 --> 01:35:27.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we know about the Thessalonians?

01:35:27.826 --> 01:35:30.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have YouTube in those days,

01:35:30.203 --> 01:35:33.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at one point, the Thessalonians
apparently heard a rumor

01:35:33.915 --> 01:35:36.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the day of Jehovah” had arrived.

01:35:36.751 --> 01:35:38.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who circulated the rumor?

01:35:38.795 --> 01:35:40.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An apostate?

01:35:40.088 --> 01:35:41.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe.

01:35:41.172 --> 01:35:43.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe it was just someone
who had heard the rumor

01:35:43.717 --> 01:35:46.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and passed it on without checking it out.

01:35:46.261 --> 01:35:48.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever done that

01:35:48.263 --> 01:35:51.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—passed on a report
without checking the facts?

01:35:51.683 --> 01:35:54.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of us have to admit

01:35:54.227 --> 01:35:57.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve been guilty of that
at one time or another.

01:35:57.230 --> 01:36:00.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
how did the Thessalonians react?

01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:01.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were alarmed.

01:36:01.693 --> 01:36:04.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were “quickly shaken
from [their] reason.”

01:36:04.571 --> 01:36:07.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We mustn’t let that happen to us.

01:36:07.073 --> 01:36:09.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hear something,
check it out;

01:36:09.618 --> 01:36:11.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t just circulate it;
don’t just believe it;

01:36:11.995 --> 01:36:14.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
check it out.

01:36:14.122 --> 01:36:16.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 2:6, 7

01:36:16.458 --> 01:36:18.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the last scripture we’ll read
during this talk.

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here Paul explains how we can avoid

01:36:21.963 --> 01:36:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being quickly shaken from our reason.

01:36:24.674 --> 01:36:27.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this final scripture.

01:36:27.052 --> 01:36:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 2:6, 7:

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:37.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, just as you
have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord,

01:36:37.228 --> 01:36:40.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“go on walking in union with him

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[you do that, and you’ll be walking
with a wise one, certainly],

01:36:43.652 --> 01:36:47.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“being rooted and built up in him

01:36:47.072 --> 01:36:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then notice this]
and being stabilized in the faith,

01:36:51.493 --> 01:36:54.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as you were taught.”

01:36:54.371 --> 01:36:58.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re “stabilized in the faith,”
we won’t be quickly shaken

01:36:58.583 --> 01:37:02.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by unfounded accusations
by apostates or the media.

01:37:04.255 --> 01:37:09.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
False rumors are often spread during wartime.

01:37:09.219 --> 01:37:12.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, this is war.

01:37:12.222 --> 01:37:15.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to put up a hard fight for the faith

01:37:15.308 --> 01:37:17.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if our life depended on it

01:37:17.811 --> 01:37:19.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—because it does!

01:37:21.606 --> 01:37:25.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane,
for that insightful talk.

01:37:26.736 --> 01:37:31.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This session has helped us
to safeguard our faith and to act in faith.

01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:35.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we look
forward to in the next two sessions?

01:37:36.705 --> 01:37:40.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptural theme is Matthew 21:21,

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says in part:

01:37:42.544 --> 01:37:46.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

01:37:46.214 --> 01:37:48.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next session begins with a symposium

01:37:48.758 --> 01:37:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlighting women of strong faith.

01:37:51.928 --> 01:37:56.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we eagerly anticipate
the public Bible discourse

01:37:56.391 --> 01:37:59.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have Faith in the Good News.”

01:38:00.186 --> 01:38:03.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s sing together song number 38,

01:38:03.273 --> 01:38:08.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which draws attention
to our source of power, Jehovah God.

01:38:08.278 --> 01:38:13.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This song is entitled
“He Will Make You Strong.”

01:38:13.074 --> 01:38:17.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song,
you may have your local concluding prayer.

01:38:17.078 --> 01:38:20.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 38.

00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:05.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus called them
“serpents, offspring of vipers.”

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is he talking about?

00:00:07.237 --> 00:00:08.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pharisees.

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:10.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who were they?

00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:14.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
A prominent, Jewish religious sect
in the first century.

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:17.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Jesus so critical of them?

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:21.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because even though
those religious leaders had knowledge of God

00:00:21.586 --> 00:00:26.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prided themselves on their
strict adherence to the Law of Moses,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not do as Moses had said

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:31.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to listen to the future Savior

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:34.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah would raise up for his people.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Savior is Jesus Christ.

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:42.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when the Pharisees saw him
miraculously curing the sick, lame, and blind

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even resurrecting the dead—

00:00:44.737 --> 00:00:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not rejoice over that

00:00:46.823 --> 00:00:50.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and glorify God for what he
was performing through Christ.

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:53.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pharisees were faithless,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they refused to believe in
and listen to God’s Son.

00:00:57.668 --> 00:01:01.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they persecuted Jesus’ disciples

00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:05.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they did put faith in the Christ.

00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:07.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus exposed the Pharisees

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:10.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what they were and called them “serpents”

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:12.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the deadly spiritual harm

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they inflicted on others
who were influenced by them.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the Pharisees
exerted such great influence over the people

00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:24.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
that prominent persons
were afraid to openly confess

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
their faith in Jesus
for fear of being expelled

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:29.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their positions in the synagogue

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:31.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and losing face in the community.

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can the same sort of fear

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:38.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
hold people back today from serving Jehovah

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:40.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a disciple of God’s Son,

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
fearing the rejection or ridicule

00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:46.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they might have to endure
from neighbors, friends, or family?

00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:51.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it is, how can you
imitate Jesus’ disciples?

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
They not only knew about God

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:58.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they trusted in him
as their reliable Father and Friend.

00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:02.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
As proof of that, they went right
onto the temple grounds in Jerusalem 

00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:07.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
in full view of everyone
and gave a bold witness about God’s Son.

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:10.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were powerful by their faith.

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:14.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Jewish high court
—many members of which were Pharisees—

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:17.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
heard about this, they were furious.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
They ordered the disciples
to stop teaching about Jesus.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:22.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did they do?

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cower in fear?

00:02:24.286 --> 00:02:25.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:30.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can read what happened at Acts 5:29

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:35.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s Acts 5:29.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:37.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reports:

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:40.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In answer Peter
and the other apostles said:

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:44.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We must obey God as ruler rather than men.’”

00:02:46.352 --> 00:02:48.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ disciples did not allow

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:52.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
the religious leaders’ pressure
and threats to deter them.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew their priorities
and that situations would arise

00:02:55.946 --> 00:03:00.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a Christian cannot obey
both men and Jehovah God.

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:05.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, human rulers forfeit
their right to our obedience

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:09.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they demand what Almighty God prohibits

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or, as in this case,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they prohibit what God requires of us.

00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:19.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if they ban our preaching work,

00:03:19.013 --> 00:03:21.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cannot stop carrying out

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
our God-given assignment
to preach the good news.

00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:27.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at that very moment,

00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostles set a precedent

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:32.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all true Christians throughout the ages

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:36.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to obey God as Ruler first.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples’ faith made them
real friends of Jehovah.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, today they are alive
and well in heaven with Jesus

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:47.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve with him as kings and priests.

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:52.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
What of those faithless Pharisees
and their coveted prominence?

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:55.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told them to their face

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
what fate lay ahead of them

00:03:57.515 --> 00:04:01.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Matthew chapter 23

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 33.

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:06.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 23:33,

00:04:08.277 --> 00:04:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told them: “Serpents, offspring of vipers,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
how will you flee
from the judgment of Gehenna?”

00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:20.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, “the judgment of Gehenna”
meant that if they did not change,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be everlastingly destroyed.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are going
to imitate the disciples’ faith,

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:30.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must do as Jesus urged his followers.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
See what he said at Matthew 6:33

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:38.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:33:

00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:43.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on, then, seeking first
the Kingdom and his righteousness,

00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:47.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all these other things
will be added to you.”

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:50.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus’ disciples must always make

00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Kingdom their first concern in life.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do that, then, as Jesus promised,

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:59.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will see to it
that we have the material

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:01.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual necessities of life.

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:05.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, ‘seeking the Kingdom’ first
in our life includes

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:09.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘preaching the good news of the Kingdom’
to as many people as we can.

00:05:09.804 --> 00:05:13.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
As with Jesus’ disciples,
it requires courage and boldness

00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach when neighbors,
friends, or family oppose us.

00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:23.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do not need to fear them
or any other religious enemies

00:05:23.027 --> 00:05:25.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus taught his disciples

00:05:25.613 --> 00:05:29.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to preach boldly but discreetly.

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:33.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see this at Matthew chapter 10

00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:35.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 16.

00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:39.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 10:16,

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “Look! I am sending you out 
as sheep among wolves;

00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:48.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so prove yourselves cautious as serpents

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet innocent as doves.”

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:56.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems that most literal snakes
would rather flee than attack.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:06:00.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to be cautious, here, means to be prudent,

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
sensible, shrewd.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the dove is known
as “the sheep of the bird world”

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of its gentle appearance
and disposition.

00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:11.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to be innocent means being blameless,

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
or genuine, with pure motives.

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:18.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ point was that when
his sheeplike disciples face persecution,

00:06:18.922 --> 00:06:22.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
they need to combine
the characteristics of being cautious

00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and innocent to avoid possible dangers

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they carry out their preaching work.

00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:33.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
suppose colleagues at work, schoolmates,

00:06:33.814 --> 00:06:37.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even members
of your own family make caustic remarks

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:40.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
about your beliefs as a Witness of Jehovah.

00:06:40.613 --> 00:06:42.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of responding in kind

00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:45.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being equally sarcastic about their faith,

00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
show them that their comments have no effect

00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:51.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your peace and your pleasant demeanor.

00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s being prudent and blameless,

00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:57.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
cautious yet innocent.

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:00.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all need to keep imitating

00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:02.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
the faith of Jesus’ disciples.

00:07:04.348 --> 00:07:06.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what have we learned
from this symposium?

00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:08.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two things.

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:13.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we must reject
the course of faithless ones

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:15.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Cain, Lamech,

00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:19.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah’s neighbors, Pharaoh, and the Pharisees.

00:07:19.532 --> 00:07:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we need
to imitate Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:07:23.953 --> 00:07:27.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Abel, Enoch, Noah,

00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:30.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses, and Jesus’ disciples.

00:07:30.794 --> 00:07:35.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, then we can enjoy living forever

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:37.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a friend of Jehovah.

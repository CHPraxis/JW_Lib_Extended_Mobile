Warm greetings to one and all.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The final session of our “Powerful by Faith!”

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regional Convention is about to begin.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the music-video presentation,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on how strong faith

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us triumph
when our integrity is tested.

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:34.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the video.

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:50.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have now reached
the final portion of this convention.

00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:52.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this session,

00:10:52.172 --> 00:10:55.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see how Bible prophecy
strengthens our faith

00:10:55.926 --> 00:11:00.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll take an exciting look ahead
at future events.

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:03.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s sing a song that expresses

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:06.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our determination to exercise faith.

00:11:06.394 --> 00:11:09.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song is number 126, entitled

00:11:09.523 --> 00:11:13.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stay Awake, Stand Firm, Grow Mighty.”

00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:17.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 126.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, we saw how Daniel the prophet

00:13:27.118 --> 00:13:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed faith as a young man.

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:32.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What further tests lie ahead,

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:35.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how did Jehovah strengthen him?

00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now invite you
to watch Part II of the drama 

00:13:38.922 --> 00:13:41.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith.</i>

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:50.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over here!

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:54.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail Nebo, Ishtar,

00:14:54.038 --> 00:14:56.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Marduk—greatest god of all!

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yah!

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men.

00:16:10.532 --> 00:16:12.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men!

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what that is.

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:22.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t appear to be an omen.

00:16:22.502 --> 00:16:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing in the books, is there?

00:16:24.003 --> 00:16:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are these all the wise men?

00:16:25.588 --> 00:16:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best in the kingdom.

00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:31.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, I need to speak to the king!

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:37.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The queen mother, my lord.

00:16:37.684 --> 00:16:41.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a man in your kingdom

00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has the spirit of the holy gods.

00:16:46.609 --> 00:16:48.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will tell you the interpretation.

00:16:49.487 --> 00:16:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is this man?

00:16:51.614 --> 00:16:53.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:55.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel?

00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:58.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s Daniel?

00:17:42.248 --> 00:17:44.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you Daniel?

00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:47.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am, my lord.

00:17:48.546 --> 00:17:50.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve heard concerning you

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re able to provide interpretations.

00:17:53.718 --> 00:17:57.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you are able to read the writing

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make its interpretation known to me,

00:18:00.224 --> 00:18:02.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be clothed with purple,

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a gold necklace will be placed around your neck,

00:18:06.397 --> 00:18:09.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will rule as the third one in the kingdom.

00:18:09.317 --> 00:18:11.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may keep your gifts.

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:14.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give your presents to others.

00:18:15.448 --> 00:18:19.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, I will read the writing to the king.

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:21.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Most High God granted to Nebuchadnezzar

00:18:21.955 --> 00:18:24.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the kingdom and greatness

00:18:24.457 --> 00:18:26.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and honor and majesty.

00:18:28.044 --> 00:18:30.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when his heart became haughty,

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:33.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:37.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his dignity was taken away.

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:46.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you, Belshazzar—

00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:48.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have not humbled your heart,

00:18:48.064 --> 00:18:49.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although you knew all of this.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:55.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens.

00:18:55.863 --> 00:18:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had them bring you the vessels of His house.

00:18:59.826 --> 00:19:03.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you and your nobles,

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your concubines and secondary wives

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:08.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drank wine from them

00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praised the gods of silver and gold

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:14.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—gods who see nothing

00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:17.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear nothing

00:19:19.303 --> 00:19:21.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and know nothing.

00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:26.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve not glorified the God

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whose hand is your breath

00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:31.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all your ways.

00:19:31.482 --> 00:19:36.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the hand was sent from Him.

00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:42.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the interpretation of the words:

00:19:43.745 --> 00:19:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
MENE:

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has numbered the days of your kingdom

00:19:50.293 --> 00:19:53.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brought it to an end.

00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:05.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
TEKEL:

00:20:05.016 --> 00:20:10.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been weighed in the balances

00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:12.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found lacking.

00:20:16.986 --> 00:20:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
PERES:

00:20:20.156 --> 00:20:23.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your kingdom has been divided

00:20:23.326 --> 00:20:27.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given to the Medes

00:20:27.413 --> 00:20:30.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Persians.

00:21:10.081 --> 00:21:12.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Darius, this is Daniel

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:14.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Jew taken captive by the Babylonians.

00:21:17.547 --> 00:21:21.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you interpret the handwriting from the gods?

00:21:22.343 --> 00:21:24.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:27.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not me, O king

00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:29.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my God—

00:21:29.642 --> 00:21:31.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of Israel.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could use a satrap

00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who understands the captives.

00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:39.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I confess, a satrap

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not as prominent a position

00:21:42.321 --> 00:21:44.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Belshazzar granted you.

00:21:45.032 --> 00:21:46.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Daniel refused

00:21:46.576 --> 00:21:49.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every gift and honor Belshazzar offered him.

00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:55.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man without a price.

00:21:55.459 --> 00:21:57.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t need you as a satrap

00:21:57.879 --> 00:21:59.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we need you over them.

00:22:04.468 --> 00:22:06.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tura,

00:22:06.012 --> 00:22:08.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pronounce Daniel’s appointment

00:22:08.014 --> 00:22:09.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the kingdom.

00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:12.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want those stealing from the treasury to know

00:22:12.768 --> 00:22:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they will now be held accountable.

00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:43.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:22:43.382 --> 00:22:45.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll make a fine high official.

00:22:46.886 --> 00:22:49.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only with Jehovah’s help.

00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:18.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is the land tax so high?

00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:28.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another revolt?

00:23:28.261 --> 00:23:29.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is far more troubling.

00:23:29.512 --> 00:23:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just collected the land tax from an administrator.

00:23:32.014 --> 00:23:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he pay?

00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:36.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, but he refuses to give us “our fees.”

00:23:36.644 --> 00:23:38.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the same problem.

00:23:38.062 --> 00:23:41.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re calling anything more than the tax extortion.

00:23:42.024 --> 00:23:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s changed?

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:44.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:23:46.028 --> 00:23:47.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you offered him anything

00:23:47.863 --> 00:23:49.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make him more reasonable?

00:23:49.573 --> 00:23:50.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He won’t take a shekel of silver.

00:23:51.325 --> 00:23:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel claims that what he receives

00:23:53.035 --> 00:23:54.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more than enough.

00:23:55.246 --> 00:23:57.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be so naive!

00:23:57.248 --> 00:24:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s putting on a show of integrity for the king.

00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:01.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t last.

00:24:01.961 --> 00:24:04.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius will tire of him soon enough.

00:24:14.223 --> 00:24:16.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There seems to be a discrepancy in the taxes

00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
due the treasury, my lord.

00:24:19.395 --> 00:24:21.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re brave to say that here.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s hard to hear.

00:24:24.442 --> 00:24:26.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will review the evidence.

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:30.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, your time here has given you much wisdom.

00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:32.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been here?

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 70 years.

00:24:36.203 --> 00:24:37.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share more with me.

00:24:37.788 --> 00:24:39.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me about the dreams

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar.

00:24:41.292 --> 00:24:43.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interpretations belong to my God,

00:24:43.961 --> 00:24:45.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah.

00:24:45.463 --> 00:24:47.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He revealed the dreams to me.

00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:03.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have I really been in Babylon over 70 years?

00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:10.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah’s prophecy!

00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:32.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When 70 years have been fulfilled,

00:25:32.635 --> 00:25:34.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will call to account the king of Babylon

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that nation for their error.”

00:25:38.349 --> 00:25:40.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belshazzar’s death

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s been fulfilled!

00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this mean for God’s people?

00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:27.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,

00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:30.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will turn my attention to you,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:36.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will make good my promise

00:26:36.157 --> 00:26:40.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by bringing you back to this place.”

00:26:42.872 --> 00:26:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Judah!

00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:54.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must approach Jehovah

00:26:54.008 --> 00:26:58.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to confess the sin of my people.

00:27:02.183 --> 00:27:04.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah,

00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:08.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do hear,

00:27:08.355 --> 00:27:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do forgive.

00:27:10.357 --> 00:27:14.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah, do pay attention and act.

00:27:15.237 --> 00:27:20.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not delay, for your own sake,

00:27:20.117 --> 00:27:22.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O my God.

00:27:26.332 --> 00:27:28.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Daniel,

00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:32.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now I have come to give you insight

00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:34.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and understanding.

00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:37.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you began your entreaty,

00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:39.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word went out,

00:27:39.428 --> 00:27:41.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I have come to report it to you.

00:27:42.264 --> 00:27:44.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are 70 weeks that have been determined

00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:47.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your people and your holy city

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:49.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to terminate the transgression,

00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:51.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to finish off sin.

00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:02.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, Azarel and Hannah are here.

00:28:02.076 --> 00:28:03.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Daniel.

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:06.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so good to see you!

00:28:06.413 --> 00:28:08.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Epher, come sit with me.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have good news!

00:28:14.171 --> 00:28:16.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the good news?

00:28:17.758 --> 00:28:20.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has long told us

00:28:20.427 --> 00:28:23.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will return to Judah.

00:28:23.764 --> 00:28:27.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I looked again at Jeremiah’s prophecy:

00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,

00:28:32.648 --> 00:28:35.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, . . .

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:39.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will make good my promise

00:28:39.488 --> 00:28:42.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by bringing you back to this place.’”

00:28:44.034 --> 00:28:46.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seventy years.”

00:28:46.078 --> 00:28:48.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means God’s people will return soon.

00:28:48.706 --> 00:28:50.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be sure?

00:28:54.545 --> 00:28:56.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sent an angel to tell me.

00:28:56.797 --> 00:28:58.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An angel?

00:28:59.425 --> 00:29:01.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that the city

00:29:01.802 --> 00:29:04.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its temple will be rebuilt,

00:29:04.346 --> 00:29:06.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Messiah will finally come!

00:29:08.517 --> 00:29:12.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will get to see the temple rebuilt.

00:29:12.062 --> 00:29:14.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But won’t it be dangerous?

00:29:15.983 --> 00:29:19.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is eager

00:29:19.486 --> 00:29:21.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill the needs of his people.

00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:25.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told Isaiah

00:29:25.451 --> 00:29:29.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we ‘won’t bear children for distress,

00:29:29.538 --> 00:29:31.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘for they’re the offspring

00:29:31.832 --> 00:29:34.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made up of those blessed by Jehovah.’

00:29:35.377 --> 00:29:36.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if Jehovah says it,

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:39.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as good as done!

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:41.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t the land desolate?

00:29:42.092 --> 00:29:44.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we’ll need skilled builders

00:29:44.553 --> 00:29:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the restoration work.

00:29:47.514 --> 00:29:50.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean you’ll return to Judah?

00:29:54.146 --> 00:29:56.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sure hope so.

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:06.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a team of workers maintain the roads.

00:30:06.241 --> 00:30:08.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, conditions will only worsen

00:30:08.285 --> 00:30:10.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the rainy season.

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:14.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tura, see that it’s done.

00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is it that you know so much?

00:30:16.752 --> 00:30:18.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t take credit, my lord.

00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:19.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just . . .

00:30:19.672 --> 00:30:21.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many great men

00:30:21.674 --> 00:30:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who provide the information we need, O king.

00:30:25.886 --> 00:30:27.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:30:28.639 --> 00:30:31.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about that satrap in Susa.

00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:34.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should he be replaced?

00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:37.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My men have thoroughly investigated,

00:30:37.606 --> 00:30:40.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the satrap has been diverting palace money

00:30:40.818 --> 00:30:41.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his own pocket.

00:30:41.902 --> 00:30:43.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s—that’s impossible!

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t he your nephew, Otanes?

00:30:45.823 --> 00:30:50.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, and I can vouch for his integrity!

00:30:50.035 --> 00:30:52.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There must be some mistake.

00:30:52.287 --> 00:30:56.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can Daniel know his character as I do?

00:30:57.459 --> 00:31:00.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will speak with him and resolve the matter.

00:31:01.505 --> 00:31:03.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We Medes and Persians

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not as intolerant as these Jews.

00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:08.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure we can fix this.

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:12.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very well. Settle it quickly.

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:14.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That will be all.

00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:53.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, I’m so sorry.

00:31:53.807 --> 00:31:55.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have guests.

00:32:08.113 --> 00:32:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All you Jews do is pray.

00:32:13.285 --> 00:32:15.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not serve the king

00:32:15.287 --> 00:32:17.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way I do without God’s help.

00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:19.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serve the king

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by intimidating satraps?

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:24.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve only done what I should.

00:32:24.421 --> 00:32:26.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An outsider has no place telling us

00:32:26.632 --> 00:32:28.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to conduct business.

00:32:30.135 --> 00:32:32.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I act in the king’s interests.

00:32:32.679 --> 00:32:34.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve heard how you acted

00:32:34.056 --> 00:32:36.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Nebuchadnezzar’s interests.

00:32:36.809 --> 00:32:39.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made him go insane.

00:32:40.604 --> 00:32:42.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a message from Jehovah.

00:32:42.648 --> 00:32:44.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call it what you will,

00:32:44.733 --> 00:32:47.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do not interfere with us.

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:51.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it seemed easy

00:32:51.156 --> 00:32:53.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remove a satrap,

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:56.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of how much easier it will be

00:32:56.203 --> 00:32:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get rid of an old Jew.

00:33:24.898 --> 00:33:26.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an honor to be with you.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know why I summoned you?

00:33:29.111 --> 00:33:30.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, my lord.

00:33:30.404 --> 00:33:34.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That satrap whose dismissal Daniel recommended

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:35.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what’s become of him?

00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:39.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we thoroughly investigated the matter.

00:33:39.288 --> 00:33:40.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there negligence?

00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:41.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None.

00:33:41.748 --> 00:33:43.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any omission of duty?

00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:44.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All taxes due the treasury have come to the treasury?

00:33:48.755 --> 00:33:51.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every shekel of gold and quart (1.08 L) of beer

00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:53.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are accounted for.

00:33:54.344 --> 00:33:58.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel reached a different conclusion.

00:33:58.098 --> 00:34:00.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, Daniel—

00:34:00.142 --> 00:34:02.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He served the Babylonian kings well, but . . .

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s so old!

00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:05.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Otanes means is,

00:34:05.689 --> 00:34:08.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Daniel’s age, how reliable is his judgment?

00:34:08.275 --> 00:34:11.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His ideas are outdated.

00:34:11.236 --> 00:34:14.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, he is a Jew.

00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:16.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Katu, we are tolerant of all peoples.

00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, of course. That’s my point.

00:34:18.368 --> 00:34:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, we were just talking about you.

00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:24.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were right.

00:34:24.833 --> 00:34:27.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been a revolt in Susa.

00:34:28.211 --> 00:34:29.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They demand a new satrap

00:34:29.755 --> 00:34:31.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one who doesn’t steal from them.

00:34:32.674 --> 00:34:34.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my lord, surely . . .

00:34:34.259 --> 00:34:35.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough!

00:34:35.677 --> 00:34:38.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sent my own inspectors—men I trust!

00:34:41.934 --> 00:34:46.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, you’ve distinguished yourself over these men.

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:52.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine what I could do if you were my prime minister.

00:34:58.408 --> 00:34:59.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we could approach the king.

00:34:59.743 --> 00:35:01.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s no use.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel’s manipulating him.

00:35:03.372 --> 00:35:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need an accusation against Daniel

00:35:05.415 --> 00:35:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something that Darius can’t ignore.

00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:09.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no one has accused him of anything.

00:35:09.127 --> 00:35:11.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not yet.

00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:13.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assemble a team to comb through our laws.

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:15.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely he’s violated something.

00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:16.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You!

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:19.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interview merchants, inspectors, officials

00:35:19.596 --> 00:35:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whoever will make an accusation against him.

00:35:21.765 --> 00:35:23.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assure the accuser

00:35:23.183 --> 00:35:26.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will be generously rewarded.

00:35:26.103 --> 00:35:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the Babylonian records.

00:35:28.271 --> 00:35:31.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Search for any scandal that might implicate him.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is nothing in the records.

00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:01.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anything?

00:36:03.015 --> 00:36:05.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a shekel of silver is missing.

00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:08.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when Daniel gets involved,

00:36:08.186 --> 00:36:10.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
corruption and loss go down.

00:36:13.025 --> 00:36:15.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep searching.

00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:21.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will speak against him.

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:26.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all love him,

00:36:30.042 --> 00:36:32.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has the king’s trust.

00:36:35.047 --> 00:36:37.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually, the foreign merchants are ignored

00:36:37.716 --> 00:36:39.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they experience theft.

00:36:40.969 --> 00:36:43.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Daniel stands up for them

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:45.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and investigates.

00:36:47.142 --> 00:36:50.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has thieves return whatever was stolen.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even his friends are spotless.

00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:56.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nebuchadnezzar once forbade anyone

00:36:56.693 --> 00:36:58.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak against their God.

00:36:58.695 --> 00:37:00.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supposedly,

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:03.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this “Jehovah” saved them from the furnace

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they refused to worship a Babylonian god.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jews won’t worship other gods?

00:37:10.957 --> 00:37:12.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would seem.

00:37:14.086 --> 00:37:16.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’ve solved our problem.

00:37:18.215 --> 00:37:22.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Katu, Otanes, what favor do you seek?

00:37:22.302 --> 00:37:25.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O King Darius, may you live on forever.

00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:27.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This Babylon of which you are king

00:37:27.432 --> 00:37:29.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is mighty but diverse.

00:37:29.434 --> 00:37:33.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and others.

00:37:33.897 --> 00:37:35.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Otanes, I know these things.

00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:38.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are the rightful king

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also a foreigner and a newcomer.

00:37:41.196 --> 00:37:43.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people must adapt,

00:37:43.156 --> 00:37:45.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the kingdom could become unstable.

00:37:46.451 --> 00:37:48.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you suggest?

00:37:48.954 --> 00:37:50.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All royal officials,

00:37:50.956 --> 00:37:52.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prefects, satraps,

00:37:52.707 --> 00:37:55.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
high royal officers, and governors

00:37:55.168 --> 00:37:59.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have consulted together to establish a royal decree

00:37:59.381 --> 00:38:01.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to enforce a ban

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that for 30 days, whoever makes a petition

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:06.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to any god or man

00:38:06.596 --> 00:38:08.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except to you, O king,

00:38:08.682 --> 00:38:12.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:38:12.644 --> 00:38:15.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people are not above rebellion.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look what happened in Susa.

00:38:21.653 --> 00:38:24.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, O king,

00:38:24.322 --> 00:38:27.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may you establish the decree and sign it

00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:29.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it cannot be changed,

00:38:29.411 --> 00:38:32.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the law of the Medes and the Persians,

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which cannot be annulled.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this time,

00:38:48.471 --> 00:38:51.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our empire experiences peace and prosperity

00:38:51.183 --> 00:38:54.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unlike ever seen before.

00:38:54.269 --> 00:38:57.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The recent acts of defiance in Susa,

00:38:57.355 --> 00:39:00.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with similar acts by small groups of radicals,

00:39:00.692 --> 00:39:01.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seek to undermine

00:39:01.985 --> 00:39:03.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our way of life

00:39:03.987 --> 00:39:08.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a way of life we will sacrifice for nothing.

00:39:08.909 --> 00:39:12.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In honor of the glorious freedom

00:39:12.037 --> 00:39:14.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so kindly granted by the empire

00:39:14.748 --> 00:39:17.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a reminder of its sovereignty,

00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:20.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, Darius the Mede,

00:39:20.045 --> 00:39:22.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make this decree:

00:39:22.088 --> 00:39:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 30 days, anyone

00:39:24.674 --> 00:39:29.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who makes a petition to any god or man,

00:39:29.387 --> 00:39:30.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except to the king,

00:39:30.889 --> 00:39:33.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:00.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not going home to pray, are you?

00:40:00.877 --> 00:40:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azarel,

00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:08.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know me,

00:40:09.636 --> 00:40:12.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so do my enemies.

00:40:12.264 --> 00:40:16.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray at my window three times a day,

00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:18.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day.

00:40:18.895 --> 00:40:22.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I even appear to compromise,

00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:26.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they think?

00:40:28.071 --> 00:40:30.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That you stopped praying altogether.

00:40:30.865 --> 00:40:33.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or even worse,

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:38.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’d trade my worship for my life.

00:40:38.707 --> 00:40:40.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah.

00:40:40.834 --> 00:40:43.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I trust him,

00:40:43.795 --> 00:40:46.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

00:40:46.006 --> 00:40:48.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:53.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

00:40:54.097 --> 00:40:59.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that I keep my faith

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we all keep our faith—

00:41:01.896 --> 00:41:05.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how this ends.

00:41:25.503 --> 00:41:30.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have something for you.

00:41:35.555 --> 00:41:37.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dinner’s ready.

00:41:50.862 --> 00:41:53.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light

my God of salvation.”

00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:44:05.246 --> 00:44:07.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not sign a ban

00:44:08.875 --> 00:44:12.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stating that for 30 days any man

00:44:12.253 --> 00:44:14.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who makes a petition to any god or man

00:44:14.839 --> 00:44:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except to you, O king—

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be thrown into the lions’ pit?

00:44:19.052 --> 00:44:21.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the matter is well-established

00:44:21.054 --> 00:44:23.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the law of the Medes and the Persians.

00:44:23.097 --> 00:44:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s your business?

00:44:27.143 --> 00:44:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judah,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has paid no regard to you, O king,

00:44:32.482 --> 00:44:34.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor to the ban that you signed.

00:44:37.362 --> 00:44:39.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But three times a day,

00:44:39.572 --> 00:44:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is praying.

00:44:48.039 --> 00:44:49.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel?

00:44:57.549 --> 00:45:00.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can’t be true.

00:45:00.009 --> 00:45:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sure?

00:45:02.679 --> 00:45:05.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t even try to deny it.

00:45:07.475 --> 00:45:09.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were there witnesses?

00:45:09.602 --> 00:45:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All five of us, my lord.

00:45:11.187 --> 00:45:13.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can attest to it.

00:45:13.022 --> 00:45:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he is old.

00:45:14.983 --> 00:45:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he know what he’s doing?

00:45:16.985 --> 00:45:18.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a high official,

00:45:18.987 --> 00:45:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely he understands what it means

00:45:22.198 --> 00:45:24.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey the king.

00:45:27.036 --> 00:45:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me be.

00:45:29.038 --> 00:45:30.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we arrest Daniel?

00:45:30.623 --> 00:45:33.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave the matter to me!

00:46:27.972 --> 00:46:30.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel should indeed be made an example of.

00:46:31.601 --> 00:46:33.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll remove him from his post

00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:35.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and expel him from the city tomorrow morning.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord . . . 

00:46:37.023 --> 00:46:39.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All will learn that our laws must be obeyed.

00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:42.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the law actually states that the accused

00:46:42.904 --> 00:46:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be “thrown into the lions’ pit,” my lord.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see what you’re doing!

00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you no shame?

00:46:50.453 --> 00:46:53.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The law of the Medes and the Persians

00:46:53.206 --> 00:46:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that any ban or decree that the king establishes

00:46:57.043 --> 00:46:59.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot be changed.

00:46:59.087 --> 00:47:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We only wish the king to receive the honor

00:47:02.465 --> 00:47:05.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he deserves.

00:47:20.024 --> 00:47:22.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take him to the pit.

00:49:51.008 --> 00:49:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your God, whom you are continually serving,

00:49:53.803 --> 00:49:55.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will rescue you.

00:50:11.279 --> 00:50:13.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remove the stone!

00:50:21.622 --> 00:50:23.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:50:27.253 --> 00:50:29.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:50:30.673 --> 00:50:34.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

He lives!

00:50:38.306 --> 00:50:40.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring him up!

00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:42.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My God sent his angel

00:50:42.602 --> 00:50:46.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shut the mouths of the lions,

00:50:46.147 --> 00:50:48.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have not harmed me,

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:54.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I was found innocent before him;

00:50:58.451 --> 00:51:02.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor have I done any wrong to you, O king.

00:51:08.002 --> 00:51:10.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Armenia is mine.

00:51:10.087 --> 00:51:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel let them off too easily.

00:51:12.715 --> 00:51:15.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need their exceptional horses for our cavalry

00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:19.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few for myself.

00:51:21.557 --> 00:51:24.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine, you take Armenia.

00:51:24.685 --> 00:51:28.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have my eye on Bactria and its precious stones.

00:51:30.274 --> 00:51:32.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Must you divide up Daniel’s kingdom now?

00:51:33.527 --> 00:51:35.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 Check the back room!

00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:42.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the meaning of this?

00:51:42.828 --> 00:51:44.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are being arrested

00:51:44.288 --> 00:51:46.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for crimes against Darius the king!

00:51:46.123 --> 00:51:48.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king ordered Daniel’s arrest, not ours.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel was arrested

00:51:53.422 --> 00:51:55.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lifted from the pit this morning

00:51:55.508 --> 00:51:57.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—unharmed.

00:51:57.635 --> 00:51:59.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can’t be!

00:51:59.178 --> 00:52:01.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lions must have already been fed.

00:52:01.597 --> 00:52:03.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they were ill.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lions were ill?

00:52:09.313 --> 00:52:11.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not hungry?

00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:21.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throw them and their families into the pit,

00:52:21.283 --> 00:52:22.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they can test their theories.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Darius!

00:52:25.246 --> 00:52:27.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t do this! I served you!

00:52:27.289 --> 00:52:28.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Don’t do this!

00:52:28.749 --> 00:52:30.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served you!

00:52:31.377 --> 00:52:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Please!

00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:36.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:52:38.718 --> 00:52:40.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am issuing an order

00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:42.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in every domain of my kingdom,

00:52:42.722 --> 00:52:45.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people are to tremble in fear

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:48.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the God of Daniel.

00:52:48.519 --> 00:52:51.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For he is the living God, and he endures forever.

00:52:51.439 --> 00:52:53.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His kingdom will never be destroyed.

00:52:53.441 --> 00:52:54.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He rescues,

00:52:54.692 --> 00:52:57.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saves, and performs signs and wonders

00:52:57.403 --> 00:52:59.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the heavens and on the earth,

00:52:59.947 --> 00:53:03.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.”

00:53:03.743 --> 00:53:05.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius wrote that?

00:53:05.369 --> 00:53:07.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s sending it to all of his subjects.

00:53:07.538 --> 00:53:08.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so worried.

00:53:09.832 --> 00:53:11.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you scared?

00:53:11.959 --> 00:53:13.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very scared,

00:53:13.961 --> 00:53:17.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah helps us when we’re scared.

00:53:18.758 --> 00:53:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re scared of going to Jerusalem.

00:53:20.676 --> 00:53:21.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Epher!

00:53:24.847 --> 00:53:26.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re still thinking about it.

00:53:27.558 --> 00:53:29.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about you? Are you going back?

00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:32.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king says we’re all allowed to go.

00:53:40.071 --> 00:53:42.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d love to go home,

00:53:54.293 --> 00:53:55.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but

00:53:59.632 --> 00:54:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s too late for me.

00:54:12.228 --> 00:54:14.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I don’t want to go either.

00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:16.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh no, no, no, no.

00:54:16.315 --> 00:54:18.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t cry.

00:54:21.987 --> 00:54:24.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go,

00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:27.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see a better city than the one I left.

00:54:28.828 --> 00:54:31.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see prophecies fulfilled,

00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:37.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city full of people worshipping Jehovah,

00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:42.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a new temple

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most beautiful building on earth.

00:55:10.452 --> 00:55:13.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see our old neighbor at all?

00:55:13.372 --> 00:55:15.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I didn’t him at all today.

00:55:16.709 --> 00:55:20.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw our neighbor Eli the other day.

00:55:56.165 --> 00:55:59.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:55:59.168 --> 00:56:01.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be blessed.

00:56:12.181 --> 00:56:15.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One thing

00:56:15.184 --> 00:56:19.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have asked from Jehovah . . .

00:56:25.611 --> 00:56:30.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I might dwell

on his temple.”

00:58:05.586 --> 00:58:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, you need to rest.

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Daniel, you very precious man.

00:59:10.526 --> 00:59:13.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been sent to you.

00:59:13.654 --> 00:59:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:59:17.032 --> 00:59:18.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words have been heard from the first day

00:59:18.617 --> 00:59:20.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you gave your heart to understanding

00:59:20.702 --> 00:59:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humbling yourself before your God.

00:59:23.247 --> 00:59:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have come to make you understand

00:59:25.249 --> 00:59:27.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will befall your people

00:59:27.251 --> 00:59:29.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the final part of the days.

00:59:29.253 --> 00:59:31.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no strength.

00:59:31.964 --> 00:59:33.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no breath left in me.

00:59:35.092 --> 00:59:37.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, O very precious man.

00:59:37.511 --> 00:59:39.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you have peace.

00:59:39.054 --> 00:59:41.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong.

00:59:42.391 --> 00:59:44.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong!

00:59:54.528 --> 00:59:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let my lord speak,

for you have strengthened me.

00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:01.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will tell you the things recorded

01:00:01.452 --> 01:00:03.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the writings of truth:

01:00:03.454 --> 01:00:04.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

01:00:04.663 --> 01:00:07.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Three more kings will stand up for Persia,

“and the fourth one will amass greater riches

than all others.”

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:31.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O my lord,

01:00:31.231 --> 01:00:34.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will be the outcome of these things?

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:41.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on to the end.

01:00:41.783 --> 01:00:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will rest,

01:00:43.494 --> 01:00:46.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will stand up for your lot

01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:48.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the days.

01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we eat those foods, we’ll disobey our God.

01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:12.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You fear your God?

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.

01:01:18.153 --> 01:01:20.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

01:01:20.822 --> 01:01:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that he will reveal it to me.

01:01:25.994 --> 01:01:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah

01:01:27.663 --> 01:01:32.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is eager to fulfill the needs of his people.

01:01:37.798 --> 01:01:41.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah.

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I trust him,

01:01:49.935 --> 01:01:52.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

01:02:04.783 --> 01:02:08.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

01:02:09.997 --> 01:02:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:28.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an inspiring account!

01:02:28.932 --> 01:02:30.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Daniel,

01:02:30.976 --> 01:02:35.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look to Jehovah
for strength and protection.

01:02:35.314 --> 01:02:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next song expresses
our confidence in him.

The song is entitled
“Seek God for Your Deliverance.”

01:02:43.488 --> 01:02:47.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing together song number 150.

Again, that’s song number 150.

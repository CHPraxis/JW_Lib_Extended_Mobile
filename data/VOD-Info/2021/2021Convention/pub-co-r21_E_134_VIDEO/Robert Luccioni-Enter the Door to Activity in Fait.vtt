Would you like to assist
with a theocratic building project?

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:10.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may see reports regarding
branch construction and renovation

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the need for new Kingdom Halls
and remote translation offices (RTOs),

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this may cause you to wonder
if you could have a share.

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is a wonderful goal.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we’ve considered in this symposium,

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it takes faith to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, faith is required

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share in a theocratic building project.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that?

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, generally, there are two concerns:

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) We may lack experience.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may feel that we do not have
construction, design,

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:47.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
engineering, or real estate experience,

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus we may feel inadequate

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:52.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist with a Local/Design
Construction Department (LDC)

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other project.

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or (2) we may also realize
that to begin assisting,

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
generally, we do so on a temporary basis.

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we may have concerns
about leaving our job

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our family for a period of time to assist.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you can relate to those concerns,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, no doubt the example of Nehemiah
will build your faith.

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to Nehemiah 1:2, 3

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nehemiah 1:2, 3:

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time Hanani, one of my brothers,

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“arrived with other men from Judah,

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I asked them about the remaining Jews
who had escaped the captivity,

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and also about Jerusalem.

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They replied: ‘Those remaining
there in the province

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who have survived the captivity
are in a terrible situation

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:46.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and in disgrace.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.’”

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah here is presented with a need.

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would he do?

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he say: ‘Oh, I hope
those skilled brothers

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help that situation one day.’

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:03.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at chapter 2 and verse 5:

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I then said to the king:

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If it pleases the king and if your servant
has found favor with you,

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘send me to Judah, to the city
where my forefathers are buried,

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I may rebuild it.’”

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Nehemiah was moved; he wanted to help.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw an opportunity
and demonstrated his faith.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took the initiative.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did it take faith for Nehemiah
to take this step?

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt it did.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do we say that?

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first off, what was
Nehemiah’s work assignment?

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:42.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he the head
of the king’s construction project?

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he the leading architect
or engineer or a city planner?

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, rather, he was the cupbearer to the king.

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:54.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can picture him saying:
‘Well I don’t have the experience

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:56.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:57.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I wouldn’t even know where to start.

00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:00.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I best leave that to somebody else.’

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, rather, he saw the need;

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had the circumstances to help,
and he acted on that need.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:11.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah did not let
his possible lack of experience

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hold him back.

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That took faith.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about the fact that this was
only a temporary assignment?

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Nehemiah, again, was willing to leave

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:25.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this prestigious position
as the cupbearer to the king.

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think about it,
he could have wondered

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether his replacement
would take over his position permanently.

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:35.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would his nice job be there
when he returned from Jerusalem?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Nehemiah showed faith

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had loyal love
and would remember him.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his words at Nehemiah 1:5:

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I said: ‘O Jehovah, the God of the heavens,

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:54.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the great and awe-inspiring God

00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:57.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who love him
and keep his commandments.’”

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Nehemiah was confident
that Jehovah would show loyal love.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would work things out.

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:11.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the result of Nehemiah’s faith?

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, although at first Nehemiah
was not known as a builder,

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used him in a mighty way
to accomplish his will.

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Nehemiah contributed to the rebuilding
of the walls of Jerusalem

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in significant ways.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:30.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson is that we need faith

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we are going to assist
with a theocratic building project.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, primarily, we need brothers and sisters

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:40.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have a strong relationship
with Jehovah and a willing spirit.

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the qualities we need.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Construction or technical skills
can be learned.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith will give us the confidence
that if we are invited,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make us equal to the task

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:58.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us to develop the skills
that are needed,

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:01.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith will also help us to trust

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will care for us
when our assignment is over.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:09.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how Sarah
found the courage

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist in a theocratic building project.

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:20.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, darling, we’re back. 

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I learned that I was invited to work

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a few weeks on the upcoming
construction project, I was thrilled.

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:31.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that excitement
quickly turned into anxiety

00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:34.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what I had to do.

00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:42.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah for weeks
to give me the strength

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:45.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the conversation with my employer.

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Sarah, come in!

00:05:57.502 --> 00:05:58.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, first of all, say thank you

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking the time to meet with me, . . .

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:05.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to explain
about the construction project

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:07.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I had been invited to volunteer.

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:08.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I would
really like the time to . . .

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you want time off

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the busiest time of our year?

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, but . . .

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:23.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your choice, but under no circumstances
will I hold your position.

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:32.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege
felt like a huge risk.

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:36.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was I making my life
more complicated by doing this?

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the account
about the people in Nehemiah’s day.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their willing spirit demonstrated faith,

00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:03.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jerusalem’s walls were built by people

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:05.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “put their heart into the work.”

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:11.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to miss out

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:14.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the opportunity
to serve Jehovah in that way.

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:16.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my resignation letter.

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:24.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have faith that Jehovah
would bless my decision.

00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:29.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure what the future holds
when I get back,

00:07:29.386 --> 00:07:32.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I know Jehovah will take care of me.

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:39.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For now, I’m going to focus

00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:42.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on putting my heart into the work.

00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:57.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you relate to when Sarah
went to meet her employer

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:01.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how she struggled
with the decision of what to do?

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how did Sarah resolve her concerns?

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:07.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember, she examined
the example of Nehemiah and others,

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:09.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this gave her courage to act

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result, she enjoyed many blessings.

00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:17.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many of our brothers and sisters
have made the same choice.

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:21.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one couple
had to give up their apartment

00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:25.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and resign from their secular employment
to help with a project.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they said they did feel some anxiety

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:31.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the end of their six-month assignment
neared,

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:35.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they trusted that Jehovah
would help them, and help he did.

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:38.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they returned,
they called their former employer.

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:41.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did he offer them their job back

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:43.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was with better terms.

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:46.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they said that within one week
of returning back,

00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:49.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had found a new apartment.

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:53.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In another example, the LDC Department
invited a brother

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:56.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work for a few months on a project.

00:08:56.181 --> 00:09:00.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the time, he was working full-time
with a major company.

00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:04.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had good benefits, a good salary,
a company car, housing.

00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:07.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He requested a leave of absence.

00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:09.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They denied his request.

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother decided to take
the LDC assignment anyway.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was fired from his job.

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:19.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what would he do
after he completed his assignment?

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:23.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was actually able to find
a part-time job

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has allowed him to stay
in full-time service,

00:09:26.002 --> 00:09:28.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he is a pioneer.

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:31.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his wife are pioneers,
and he’s serving as a remote volunteer

00:09:31.758 --> 00:09:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a branch construction project.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similar stories are repeated over and over.

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:41.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah foretold that during these last days

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:45.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a great crowd” would worship him acceptably,

00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:49.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fulfillment of that prophecy
has created an urgent need

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:51.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls,

00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:54.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
branch facilities, and RTOs.

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:58.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we understand
that the pandemic has limited

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic building projects
to some extent at this time.

00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:06.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there is still much work to do

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:09.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and on into the future.

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:12.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if your health and circumstances permit,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make yourself available.

00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:17.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do so by filling out the A-19

00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:20.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and DC-50 applications.

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your elders can help you

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:25.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to access these on jw.org.

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:30.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if assisting with a theocratic
building project is your goal,

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can be confident that you too

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will become powerful by faith.

00:10:35.614 --> 00:10:37.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take that leap.

00:10:37.073 --> 00:10:39.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will enjoy Jehovah’s support

00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:42.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many, many blessings.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:51.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘Set Something Aside’ for Jehovah’s Work.”

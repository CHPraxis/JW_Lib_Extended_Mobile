Are you tired of being tired?

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sick of being sick?

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us are feeling the impact
of living in this old system of things.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we do?

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we try to improve our health

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or find some relief by medical means

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by improving our diet,

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exercise, and getting more rest.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the bottom line is,

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are infected with sin,

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with sin comes sickness

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the effects of aging.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s promise after promise,
but are they really true?

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no pill, medicine,

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
diet, or exercise program

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can give us complete relief

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:51.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—removal of sickness

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:56.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, what we really want
and what we need, perfect health.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is a promise
recorded in God’s Word

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that does give us confidence.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this together
at Isaiah chapter 33.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Isaiah chapter 33,

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the reassuring words from Jehovah

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the prophet Isaiah in verse 24.

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there it says:

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And no resident
[no one] will say: ‘I am sick.’

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people dwelling in the land
will be pardoned for their error.”

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sin will be removed in God’s new world.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you believe that?

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we really put faith in Jehovah’s promise?

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:38.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not just another empty promise
by a human.

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This comes from our Creator, Jehovah.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he can guarantee it.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we do today

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build up our faith in those promises?

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as highlighted in this symposium,

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can take the time and stop

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at Jehovah’s creation.

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that right now.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine the human body

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its amazing ability to repair itself.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video.

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our bones

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are amazing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support our bodies,

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protect our organs,

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and store almost all

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the body’s calcium

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a mineral essential

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our health.

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For their weight,

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bones are very strong.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The feet of a track and field jumper

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:57.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may experience forces
of several times his body weight.

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bones can compress and bend,

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:10.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sometimes they break.

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A fractured bone
can heal well if properly set.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inflammation brings
organic building blocks to the area,

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soft tissue grows
between the broken pieces.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The soft tissue
is replaced with harder tissue.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body replaces the harder tissue

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with new bone until the repair is complete.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In children,

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:52.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the break may heal
without leaving a trace.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave every bone in our body

00:03:56.548 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this incredible ability to heal.

00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:06.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am wonderfully made.”

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was an amazing video.

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned a lot
about what happens on the inside.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We take it for granted
that when we get a cut or broken bone,

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:28.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our body automatically heals itself.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:30.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David was very impressed

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:34.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the way that he was made
and the way the human body works.

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:37.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did not have the modern technology

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowledge that we have today

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:42.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an X-ray machine or a microscope—

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he observed Jehovah’s creation,

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew that we were designed
in an awe-inspiring way.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:54.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what he says at Psalm 139

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 139:14—

00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:00.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you feel the same way.

00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:03.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“I praise you

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because in an awe-inspiring way
I am wonderfully made.

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:13.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your works are wonderful,
I know this very well.”

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what helped David
to build a strong faith in Jehovah

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:21.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his promises for the future?

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you read there?

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I know this very well.”

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:28.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David took the time to stop

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and observe Jehovah’s creations.

00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:35.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what helped him
to put faith in Jehovah.

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he took the time,

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be distracted
by other things going on around him,

00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:42.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to observe Jehovah’s creations.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what inspired him,

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what motivated him
to give praise to Jehovah.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to do the same.

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we are far
from the perfect health and life

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had intended for the future.

00:05:56.168 --> 00:06:00.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even so,
we are made in an awe-inspiring way.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to continue living.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s plain to see.

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:06.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we saw in the video,

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our bodies are amazing in that they
can continue to repair themselves

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:12.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even without a conscious thought.

00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:15.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But therein lies a problem.

00:06:15.687 --> 00:06:17.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be so busy with our lives

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:22.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t stop
and take that time to have a thought:

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:25.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why did Jehovah make this?

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he create me the way he did?’

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:31.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’re busy thinking
about how we’ll care for our families,

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay the bills,
or maybe take care of our health.

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:38.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like David, we need to stop, pause,

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:42.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think deeply about what Jehovah has made.

00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:46.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t miss out on an opportunity
to be inspired, like David,

00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the inspiring creations around us.

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:54.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:
If Jehovah could create our bodies

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:57.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the ability to repair themselves,
like we saw in the video,

00:06:57.896 --> 00:07:01.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can certainly heal all infirmities.

00:07:01.024 --> 00:07:03.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can reverse the aging process,

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can prevent sickness in his new world.

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:13.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While on earth, Jesus proved
with the power he was given from Jehovah

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:18.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could cure “every sort of disease
and every sort of infirmity.”

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:21.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every sort” meant everything

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from healing the blind, the lame,

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:26.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those with epilepsy, leprosy

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to raising the dead to life.

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:35.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That truly is an amazing thing to ponder.

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:38.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that must have been
an amazing thing to see back then.

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:42.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what Jesus did
was just a preview on a small scale

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:46.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what he will do
in the future worldwide on a large scale

00:07:46.987 --> 00:07:51.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under God’s Kingdom arrangement
during the Millennium.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will finally see
that promise we read in Isaiah

00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:57.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:58.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jesus will use his kingly power

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:05.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring about perfect health
—yes, lasting health.

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:09.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promises fill us with hope.

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:13.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fill us with confidence
that every sort of disease and illness

00:08:13.722 --> 00:08:15.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—anything that we’re going through now—

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:17.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is only temporary,

00:08:17.851 --> 00:08:21.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that permanent perfect health

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is soon to come.

00:08:23.732 --> 00:08:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium has considered examples
ranging from the heavens

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:33.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the way to the inner workings
of our amazing bodies.

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:37.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah left his imprint
on all of his creations.

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:40.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The evidence is clearly seen; it’s evident.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What must we do today

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:47.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build our faith and confidence
in Jehovah’s promises?

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:52.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Romans 1:20 has to say.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in verse 20,

00:08:57.766 --> 00:09:00.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 1:20:

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:02.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen

00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the world’s creation onward, [why?]

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are perceived
by the things made,

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even his eternal power and Godship,

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:15.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they are inexcusable.”

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s focus in on the word “perceived.”

00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:22.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that the study note
says that “perceived” means

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:25.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than just seeing something
with our literal eyes.

00:09:25.502 --> 00:09:28.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means “grasping [or understanding]

00:09:28.505 --> 00:09:30.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with [our] mind.”

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:32.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible translation says:

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:36.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God’s qualities are
‘visible . . .  to the eye of reason.’”

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:37.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s interesting.

00:09:37.973 --> 00:09:40.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we see Jehovah’s creations,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the time, like David did,
to stop and think deeply.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate on what we can learn
from that creation

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what it tells us about our Creator, Jehovah.

00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:55.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens
when we perceive Jehovah’s wisdom,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his power, his justice,
his love in creations?

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:02.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It strengthens our faith
in his promises now

00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as in the future.

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:09.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we always be inspired and stay inspired

00:10:09.087 --> 00:10:11.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah’s awe-inspiring creations,

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus we will always be inspired

00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:17.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by our Almighty God and Creator, Jehovah!

00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:05.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without warning, our faith
could suddenly be tested

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by how we react in a violent encounter.

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:13.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our faith may be tested as Enoch’s was.

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:18.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ungodliness and violence
were commonplace before the Flood,

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Scriptures clearly indicate
how people reacted.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are told that the faithful man Enoch
chose to walk with God.

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he was threatened,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he looked to Jehovah for security.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, Lamech,
a descendant of the murderer Cain,

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opted to provide his own security.

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This led to killing a man
in supposed self-defense.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Enoch and the killer Lamech

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both lived in a violent world,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their violence-reaction plans

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were totally different.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we descend deeper into the last days,

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people will become more desperate

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and violence will only escalate.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see how reacting to violence

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could suddenly become
a personal test of faith in Jehovah.

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son barely escaped the gangs

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:00.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again.

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:08.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re the only ones without a gun.

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to keep a gun for protection.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:19.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how else can I protect my family?

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In today’s violent society,

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the perceived safest
of neighborhoods,

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could have a similar experience.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, how can we imitate Enoch’s faith?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, he recognized
a simple but fundamental truth:

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hates violence.

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for us to walk with God as Enoch did,

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must reject violence as an option.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us to do that?

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t harbor retaliatory thoughts.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violent thoughts can lead to violent actions,

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without thinking about the consequences.

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:07.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn to recognize situations
that could harm us;

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then act to avoid the danger.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the counsel given at Proverbs 22:3:

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:22.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself,

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the inexperienced keep right on going
and suffer the consequences.”

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:33.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re encouraged to conceal ourselves
if we sense danger.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:36.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think ahead, look around, be perceptive,

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid situations that may become violent.

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid violent entertainment.

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It frequently portrays a violent response

00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a character’s safety is threatened.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All sorts of objects or weapons

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are depicted as strategies

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:01.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to kill or overpower the opponents.

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While Christians may take reasonable steps

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ensure their personal security,

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they do so within the framework
of Bible principles.

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider these three scriptures
as you make decisions

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about your family’s security needs.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David prayed at Psalm 51:14:

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:27.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Save me from bloodguilt.”

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:31.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never wanted to be guilty of murder.

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparing a response
that includes the use of weapons

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could result in taking a life.

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:41.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a Christian takes reasonable steps

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend himself or his property,

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would do everything in his power

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid taking a human life
and become bloodguilty.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 26:52, Jesus warned

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘those who draw the sword

00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shall die by the sword.’

00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:04.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s well-established
that when weapons are displayed,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
situations usually escalate
with tragic outcomes.

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:13.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Planning to use a deadly weapon

00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:18.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could effectively dismiss Jehovah’s spirit
from our presence.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To pull away from Jehovah
is the last thing we want to do

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:25.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a dangerous situation.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third is found at Ecclesiastes 9:18,
where it simply says:

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:34.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wisdom is better than weapons.”

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:36.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, being armed

00:05:36.982 --> 00:05:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot match wisdom.

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:43.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prudent course is to trust in Jehovah,

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not weapons.

00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word wisely teaches us

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to daily show respect, consideration,

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and genuine kindness to others.

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This approach of pursuing peace

00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:01.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will often minimize
otherwise potential conflicts.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true, violent struggles often begin

00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a heated exchange of words?

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:12.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So calmness can often defuse anger

00:06:12.184 --> 00:06:16.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deflect violent conflicts.

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s something else to consider.

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:21.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible book of Jude

00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:25.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that Enoch prophesied to his opposers.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that he was a preacher.

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:31.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being known
as a courageous Witness of Jehovah

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing compassion
for those to whom we preach

00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always our best protection.

00:06:39.294 --> 00:06:43.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was Enoch rewarded
for putting his faith in Jehovah?

00:06:43.757 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note the answer at Hebrews 11:5:

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:56.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Enoch was transferred
so as not to see death,

00:06:56.937 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he was nowhere to be found
because God had transferred him;

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:05.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for before he was transferred
he received the witness

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had pleased God well.”

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch was rewarded with the knowledge
that “he had pleased God well.”

00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:17.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some manner, in a very clear way,

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:21.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was given assurance of Jehovah’s approval.

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:23.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting to know

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we face dangerous encounters
with no good way out,

00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Enoch, we too can handle
that test of faith

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:36.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that will please God well!

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:43.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how our brother
imitates Enoch’s example.

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:48.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:1:

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for.”

00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:55.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do have faith in God’s promises,

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:59.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if a gun is what I need
to protect my family,

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:01.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I couldn’t do that.

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not the first to face a violent world.

00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:55.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:5:

00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:59.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . received the witness
that he had pleased God well.”

00:08:59.351 --> 00:09:03.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch lived among extreme violence,

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:05.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he walked with God.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can imitate his faith.

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:31.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
this brother’s violence-reaction plan?

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:35.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith in God’s promises helped him
to look to Jehovah for security

00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:37.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of a gun.

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:41.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized he was not the first
to face a violent world

00:09:41.643 --> 00:09:46.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made the firm decision
to imitate the faith of Enoch.

00:09:46.523 --> 00:09:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, prior to a violent confrontation,

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:54.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can we do to be sure our reaction plan

00:09:54.614 --> 00:09:57.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be pleasing to Jehovah?

00:09:57.325 --> 00:10:00.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate Enoch in these four ways.

00:10:00.954 --> 00:10:04.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build our faith and confidence in Jehovah now

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we are tested in a violent situation.

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:11.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reject violent thoughts.

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:15.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow the violent movies
or violent video games

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are sponsored by the Devil

00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:20.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to train your children or yourselves

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:24.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to react in a violent confrontation.

00:10:25.312 --> 00:10:29.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reject the idea that you will prepare
yourselves with weapons.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:34.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And fearlessly keep preaching
as Enoch did.

00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:38.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, even if we find ourselves

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a violent situation,

00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:43.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our violence-reaction plan

00:10:43.663 --> 00:10:46.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will allow us to imitate Enoch

00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:03.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people believe in God.

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:05.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what sense?

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They believe that there must exist
a God, a Creator.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sheer logic causes them to believe this.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of being aware
that there is creation.

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Creator would not exist,

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no creation would exist.

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because nothing comes from nothing.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is also why we know
that God has always existed.

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If there would have been a time
when he did not exist,

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then nothing would exist today.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that creation exists

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves there must be a Creator.

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also shows
that God exists from all eternity,

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:56.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although with our imperfect human mind

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have a hard time grasping this.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are the product of his creation.

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it enough
to believe in him as the Creator

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because without a Creator
there could be no creation?

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it enough for a child to believe
he has a father

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:22.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because without a father he would not exist?

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A child should love his father;

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a father normally loves
and cares for his children.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Creator, our Father,

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only cares about his creation,

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also loves us

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cares for us as individuals.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cares about you.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God loves you.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you love him?

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a lover of God?

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not automatic.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul says at 2 Timothy 3:4

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:08.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that most people
in this time of the end would be

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“lovers of pleasures
rather than lovers of God.”

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we may have
feelings of worthlessness,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and such feelings could dampen
our zeal in serving Jehovah,

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could dampen our love,
or even could cause us

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:28.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stop serving him.

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:32.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to build up and deepen

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:35.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our love and trust in Jehovah.

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves mankind.

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What evidence is there for that?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see Jehovah’s love in nature.

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He created numerous trees,
plants, and flowers

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can enjoy them.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He created for us not only things
that we need to keep living

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but things that impress our hearts

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:04.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with awe and love for God,

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Giver of “every good gift.”

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man is not able to create one single animal

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even a fruit or flower.

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things God created help us to live

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:22.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy living for as long as we do.

00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah loves mankind so much

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave his firstborn spirit Son,

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom we came to know as Jesus Christ,

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a ransom for the sins
of us imperfect humans

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(for those who love him)

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they may live and enjoy

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s love forever.

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:50.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the first humans
rebelled against Jehovah God,

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knew that there would be many others

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would choose to serve him out of love.

00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to John chapter 6.

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your listening in to this program is proof

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only of your love
for Jehovah God and Jesus

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:15.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also of their love

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you as an individual.

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:23.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 6:44, Jesus said:

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No man can come to me

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:31.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless the Father, who sent me, draws him.”

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:40.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures show
that Jehovah has given humans free will.

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone has a choice

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to serving him.

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:48.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God gently draws to himself

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who have a heart
that is “rightly disposed.”

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:56.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does so through the Bible’s message

00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:59.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through his holy spirit.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:02.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah draw us?

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Greek verb rendered “draw”

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:10.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is used in reference
to hauling in a net of fishes.

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:13.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah drag us against our will,

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forcing us to serve him?

00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:16.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:19.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us free will,

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:22.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he does not force our heart open.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scholar puts it this way:

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no handle on the outside
of the door of the human heart.

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:34.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must be opened from within.”

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:40.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah searches through the billions
of hearts in this world,

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking for individuals
who are inclined toward him.

00:05:46.742 --> 00:05:51.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he finds such a person,
he responds in a touching way.

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you such a person?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We trust you are.

00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gently attracts, or tugs,

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:05.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the hearts of ones
who are “rightly disposed.”

00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:09.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does so in two ways

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—through the Bible’s message of good news

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:14.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and through his holy spirit.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:19.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah sees a heart
that is responsive to Bible truth,

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:22.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he uses his spirit to help the individual

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grasp and apply that truth in his life.

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without divine help,

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:33.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could never become
genuine followers of Jesus

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:36.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and devoted worshippers of Jehovah.

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:41.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah draws people because he sees
something good in their heart

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cares about them as individuals.

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:50.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does knowing that Jehovah cares
about his worshippers as individuals

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:54.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move you to want to open
that door of your heart

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and open it wide?

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:59.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:06:59.523 --> 00:07:02.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a brother named Carlos

00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:06.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to appreciate
that Jehovah is the loving Father

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom he had always yearned for.

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:16.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went through difficult times
during my childhood,

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:20.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was like my Father.

00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:24.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was my refuge.

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:31.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first memory I have of my dad

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:34.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when I went to visit him

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the prison where he was being held.

00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:45.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jehovah so many times
for my dad to come back home.

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day,

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:51.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mom said, “Dad’s coming home today.”

00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:54.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to school,
and when I came back, he was there.

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that he was finally back for good
and that it would be forever.

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:09.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But soon after that,
I heard my mom and my grandmother crying,

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:13.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they started to explain
that my dad was back in prison.

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:21.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From then on, I felt hatred,
resentment, and anger toward my dad

00:08:21.146 --> 00:08:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also toward Jehovah.

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:32.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to take drugs

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:34.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to lead an immoral and violent lifestyle.

00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:44.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a couple of sisters
gave me a magazine.

00:08:44.252 --> 00:08:46.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was looking through it,

00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:49.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the experience about Dustin.

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:53.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to think about the times

00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during my childhood

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:57.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I would take refuge in Jehovah

00:08:57.224 --> 00:08:58.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would feel the same way Dustin did.

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:00.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say: “Jehovah is there.

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hasn’t abandoned me.”

00:09:03.814 --> 00:09:06.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin never doubted Jehovah’s love,

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up until the day he died.

00:09:10.821 --> 00:09:14.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:17.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him to forgive me because,

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well,

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wasn’t his fault.

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:28.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night I poured out
all my feelings to Jehovah.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:42.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt Jehovah’s love every step of the way.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed it through the brothers
who didn’t judge me for what I had done.

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:56.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how many problems we have

00:09:56.658 --> 00:09:59.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how far we’ve drifted away from Jehovah.

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:03.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never abandons us.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:16.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has lovingly helped
many brothers and sisters

00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:18.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of his love for them.

00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:23.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can reassure you
that Jehovah will help you as well

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah loves you too.

00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Jehovah
demonstrated his love for Carlos?

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through his worshippers,
Jehovah lovingly cared for this young man.

00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:42.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 119.

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:46.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had not forgotten Carlos,

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:49.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he had strayed for a time.

00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:51.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This reminds us of the words

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:56.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 119:176:

00:10:57.427 --> 00:11:00.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have strayed like a lost sheep.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Search for your servant,

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I have not forgotten your commandments.”

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are indications that Psalm 119

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:15.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have been written
by young Prince Hezekiah.

00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:18.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hezekiah poured out his heart to Jehovah,

00:11:18.323 --> 00:11:21.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah responded.

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:25.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters, please pour out
your hearts to Jehovah,

00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:30.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note
of how he will answer your prayers.

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3.

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:39.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can and will

00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:43.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intervene positively in your life.

00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:47.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says at Ephesians 3:20:

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now to the one who can,
according to his power

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is operating in us,

00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:56.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do more than superabundantly

00:11:56.987 --> 00:12:00.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond all the things we ask or conceive.”

00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:07.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression
“his power that is operating in us”

00:12:07.372 --> 00:12:12.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—is this not something very encouraging
and faith-strengthening?

00:12:12.377 --> 00:12:15.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His power is not just “operating in us”

00:12:15.672 --> 00:12:20.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “operating in us . . . superabundantly”

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no, but “more than superabundantly,”

00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:26.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond what we can envision or comprehend.

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will draw close to you,”

00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:33.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says James 4:8.

00:12:33.023 --> 00:12:35.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether he wrote Psalm 119 or not,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hezekiah strengthened
his faith in Jehovah and trusted him.

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:44.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did so even though he was surrounded
by false worshippers

00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:48.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may have been ridiculed
by members of the royal court.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed Hezekiah.

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:57.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you trust Jehovah,
he will bless you as well.

00:12:57.213 --> 00:12:59.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With reliance on God,

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:02.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you too can endure trials

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:04.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as integrity-keepers.

00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:08.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apply Bible principles in your life,

00:13:08.224 --> 00:13:11.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how following Jehovah’s advice

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will always work out for your good.

00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:20.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith in God’s love helps us
to see beyond our imperfections

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the negative experiences
that we may have had in the past.

00:13:25.742 --> 00:13:28.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:32.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—as a cherished part of his household.

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are a family member of Jehovah’s family.

00:13:38.296 --> 00:13:40.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the encouragement we receive

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 119

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:47.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 32.

00:13:48.306 --> 00:13:51.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in God’s love gives us the confidence

00:13:51.726 --> 00:13:54.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to keep going.

00:13:56.439 --> 00:14:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 119:32, it says:

00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:08.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will eagerly pursue
the way of your commandments

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:13.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you make room for it in my heart.”

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:19.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote says: “Or possibly,
‘you make my heart have the confidence.’”

00:14:19.838 --> 00:14:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be able to endure any trial.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there things that can separate us

00:14:26.302 --> 00:14:29.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah’s love toward us?

00:14:30.432 --> 00:14:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall what we are told
at Romans chapter 8?

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:40.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing can separate us
from Jehovah’s love toward us.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this together,

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:46.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans chapter 8

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:51.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 35 to 39:

00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:58.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will tribulation or distress or persecution

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:06.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as it is written:

00:15:08.052 --> 00:15:11.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For your sake we are being put to death
all day long;

00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:16.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have been accounted
as sheep for slaughtering.’

00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary, in all these things

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:23.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are coming off completely victorious

00:15:23.234 --> 00:15:26.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the one who loved us.

00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:29.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am convinced
that neither death nor life

00:15:29.115 --> 00:15:32.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor angels nor governments
nor things now here nor things to come

00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:36.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor powers nor height nor depth
nor any other creation

00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:40.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:43.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:50.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are things that can diminish
or kill our love for Jehovah,

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we need to be careful.

00:15:54.974 --> 00:15:56.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium has reminded us

00:15:56.976 --> 00:16:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of why we have faith in God’s existence,

00:16:00.063 --> 00:16:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Word, his moral standards,

00:16:03.733 --> 00:16:05.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his love.

00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:09.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the world around us grows more hopeless,

00:16:09.072 --> 00:16:11.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are determined to become

00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:14.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more and more powerful by faith!

00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:21.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About Abraham, Romans 4:20 says:

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:23.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did not waver in a lack of faith;

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:31.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he became powerful by his faith,
giving God glory.”

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:37.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, Jehovah has also given
promises to us.

00:16:37.016 --> 00:16:40.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as he progressively fulfills them,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:45.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become
more and more “powerful by [our] faith”

00:16:45.149 --> 00:16:48.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give glory to Jehovah God!

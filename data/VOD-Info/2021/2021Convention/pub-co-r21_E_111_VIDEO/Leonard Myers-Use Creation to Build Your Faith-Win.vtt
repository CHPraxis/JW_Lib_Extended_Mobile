When we think of events
that will soon happen,

00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:07.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the great tribulation
and Armageddon,

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t you agree that we need
to build our faith now?

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if you turn with me
to Ezekiel chapter 38

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you may want to put a marker there),

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 14 and 15 describe the time
when God’s people will experience

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an all-out assault by those determined
to destroy pure worship.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 14 mentions that Gog

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—or, as we know, a coalition of nations—

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come against God’s people.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And though verse 18 states that on that day

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:40.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s “great rage will flare up”
against his enemies,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the question is,
Will you and I remain confident

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s promise to rescue his people?

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can build our faith
by considering another aspect of creation,

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the awesome power of wind and water.

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please allow the following video
to strengthen your faith.

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—though it is made of ice,
it is very different from snow.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail usually forms in warm weather

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when turbulent air produces thunderstorms

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with powerful updrafts.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those updrafts can pull a piece of dust

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ice high into the cloud,
where water freezes around it.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each trip up into the cloud
adds a layer of ice

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waits

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it becomes

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a hailstone that is heavy enough to fall.

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hailstorms can be powerfully destructive.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One deadly storm dropped hailstones

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weighing more than one kilogram (2 lbs) each.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:22.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used hail to demonstrate his power

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and defend his people,

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as during
the seventh plague against Egypt.

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:31.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Joshua fought the Amorites,

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:34.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused a great hailstorm,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more Amorites died from the hailstones

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than in battle.

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:44.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail is also mentioned among the elements

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:47.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will use in the future

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against those who attack his people.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:54.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you seen the storehouses of the hail,

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:58.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which I have reserved
for the . . . day of battle and war?”

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:04.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the video showed,
wind and water in the form of hail

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are powerful and can
at times be very destructive.

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a report in <i>Awake!</i>
magazine some years ago reported

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at times humans are hurt
—even killed—

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by hailstones weighing
as much as one and a half pounds

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:24.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as big as five inches in diameter.

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s larger than this ball.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are scientific reports
of even larger hailstones.

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we know, Jehovah can use wind
and water to fight for his people.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, he is the Source
of these natural forces,

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can control them perfectly.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 147,

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s notice that together
—Psalm 147—

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll look at verses 17 and 18

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the assurance that Jehovah
is the Source of these natural forces,

00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:58.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 147:17:

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:03.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He hurls down his hailstones
like morsels of bread.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who can withstand his cold?

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He sends out his word, and they melt.

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes his wind blow,
and the waters flow.”

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice to whom
these natural forces belong?

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 17 speaks of “<i>his </i> hailstones.”

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 18 says: “He makes <i>his</i>  wind blow.”

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah is the Source,
and he can control them.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He proved this in the past.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:33.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the examples
given in the video?

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was the account in Joshua chapter 10

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Israelites
were fighting the Amorites.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 11 states that “while [the Amorites]
were fleeing from Israel . . . ,

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:45.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah hurled great hailstones

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the sky on them . . . ,
and they perished.

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:51.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, more died from the hail

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:54.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than from the sword of the Israelites.”

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah can create
such powerful elements and control them,

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that should build our faith.

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:05.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should convince us that he’ll be able
to use these powerful elements

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:09.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the future when he defends
his people at Armageddon.

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:13.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The video partially quoted
a scripture that emphasizes that point.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:17.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together—Job chapter 38,

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 38,

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice with me verses 22 and 23.

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:29.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 38:22:

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you entered
the storehouses of the snow,

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:35.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or have you seen
the storehouses of the hail,

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which I have reserved
for the time of distress,

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:41.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the day of battle and war?”

00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Jehovah
says he ‘has storehouses of hail

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reserved for the day of battle’?

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:52.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 135:7 mentions ‘storehouses of wind.’

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these verses, Jehovah speaks
of things he’s reserved under his control

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for special purposes.

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:04.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can this knowledge
of Jehovah’s storehouses build our faith?

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re attacked during
the great tribulation by God’s enemies,

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how powerful
or threatening they may seem,

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:16.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can’t possibly survive Jehovah’s anger.

00:06:16.396 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if we go back
to Ezekiel chapter 38

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and glance at verse 22,

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see things Jehovah will use
against those enemies of pure worship.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides pestilence, fire, and sulfur,

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what else Jehovah will use.

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:34.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the middle of the verse, it says:

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:37.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will rain down a torrential downpour

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:40.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hailstones.”

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:42.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah will use water.

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may use hailstones of undisclosed size

00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:48.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy those wicked humans.

00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:53.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, during that time,
will we need to fear the natural elements?

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:55.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:58.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Peter 2:9 assures us:

00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah knows how to rescue people

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:03.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of godly devotion out of trial.”

00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:06.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will perfectly control
the natural elements

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:09.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so his people are not harmed.

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:13.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This knowledge about the awesome power
of wind and water

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should make us powerful by faith.

00:07:16.665 --> 00:07:21.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should build our faith not only in
Jehovah’s ability to protect us in the future

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:24.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in his protection now.

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, we have no reason to fear bans

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:30.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or threats from worldly governments.

00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The One who controls the storehouses

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:35.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the wind and hail is our Helper.

00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:38.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Hebrews 13:6,

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:41.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not need to “be afraid.”

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:44.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true now,
and it will be true in the future

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah brings the natural elements

00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:49.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at his disposal against our enemies.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his assurance
at the end of Ezekiel chapter 38;

00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:56.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice verse 23:

00:07:56.621 --> 00:08:00.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will certainly magnify myself
and sanctify myself

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:04.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and make myself known
before the eyes of many nations;

00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will have
to know that I am Jehovah.”

00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a thrilling time that will be!

00:08:12.095 --> 00:08:15.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As these enemies are defeated,
they will know that it is

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God who is bringing
destruction upon them.

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May our anticipation of that happy outcome

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:26.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our study of creation build our faith now

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:30.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we confidently look forward
to Jehovah’s complete victory.

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:35.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:38.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:42.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith
—Sea Creatures.”

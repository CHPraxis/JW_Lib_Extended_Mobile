Welcome to the “Powerful by Faith!”

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’ll certainly be happy

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:20.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you made the effort to attend

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.377 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all three days of this convention.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:27.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “powerful by faith”

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is drawn from the apostle Paul’s words

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 4:20.

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did the Governing Body choose faith

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we need strong faith

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal successfully with our present trials

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with those we’ll face in the near future.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 17:20,

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus assured his disciples:

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:01.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the size of a mustard grain,

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will say to this mountain,

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move,

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, faith enables us

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do things we could never imagine
doing on our own.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Christians, faith is essential.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:27.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, God commands us to have faith.

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 John 3:23, we read:

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:35.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, this is his commandment:

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have faith

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the name of his Son Jesus Christ

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and love one another,

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he gave us a commandment.”

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 11:6 tells us:

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:52.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Without faith

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must believe that he is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, to receive Jehovah’s blessing

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gain the reward of everlasting life,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to build and maintain faith.

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 1:17,

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quoting the prophet Habakkuk, Paul wrote:

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous one will live

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reason of faith.”

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:34.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With these words, Paul emphasized

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will reward
all who show real faith.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on our faith in Jesus’ ransom,

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah forgives our sins

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grants us a righteous standing
with him even now.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during Armageddon,

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will protect God’s people

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:54.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then give them the opportunity

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live forever in Paradise.

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we want for all of you.

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us here today

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already have a large measure of faith,

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as Paul wrote

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 1:24:

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is by your faith that you are standing.”

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reports from around the globe

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
testify to your genuine faith

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the good that Jehovah is accomplishing
through you

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your faith.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel as Paul expressed

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Colossians 1:3, 4:

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We always thank God,

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when we pray for you,

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love you have for all the holy ones.”

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But constant pressure
from Satan and the demons,

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the old world, and our own imperfections

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can weaken and wear down our faith.

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:02.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The purpose of this convention

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:05.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strengthen that faith.

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how to cultivate true faith,

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:11.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to exercise it in our daily lives,

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to maintain it
during difficult times.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:21.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay close attention
to each part of the program.

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As scriptures are read,
follow along in the Bible.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may God’s Word empower you

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a man, woman, or child of faith!

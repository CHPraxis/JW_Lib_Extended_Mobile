Jehovah cherishes all who serve him loyally,

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:21.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of their circumstances.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you truly understand
why Jehovah loves those

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose situation in life
may be very different from your own?

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you are in a much better position

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show them your love and support.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please listen closely
as Brother William Malenfant,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,
begins this symposium with the talk

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Those With Unbelieving Mates.”

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will then introduce
the one to follow.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Malenfant, you have our attention.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God’s inspired Word

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes this significant declaration

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Titus 2:11.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the undeserved kindness of God
has been manifested,

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“bringing salvation

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all sorts of people.”

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, “to all sorts of people”

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this was true in the first century,

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s true today more than ever before.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:44.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are a worldwide brotherhood
made up of “all sorts of people”

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have come to a knowledge of the truth,

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have made the decision
to serve Jehovah.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will discuss three sorts of people:

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, those whose mates

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not yet Jehovah’s Witnesses;

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, those who are being raised

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by one believing parent or relative;

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and third, those who are single.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:20.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters
who find themselves in these situations

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are successfully putting up
“a hard fight for the faith,”

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated in Jude 3.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of them are valuable assets
to the congregation.

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we discuss each situation

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this symposium,

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please focus your attention
on those who are in the congregation

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you attend

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask yourself,

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:51.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I show my appreciation
for brothers and sisters

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have these circumstances?’

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And ask yourself,

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I am in one of the situations
being discussed,

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘what will help me to continue

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:07.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fight successfully for the faith?’

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This talk will focus

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Christians with unbelieving mates.

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a well-known example,
we look back to the first century

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a woman named Eunice,
the mother of Timothy.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is referred to at Acts 16:1,

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:32.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Timothy was
“the son of a believing Jewish woman

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of a Greek father.”

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:39.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it refers to Eunice as a believing woman,

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:44.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it does not refer to Timothy’s father
as a believing man.

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:49.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is that Timothy’s father
was not a Christian.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:51.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, Eunice, his mother,

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with Lois, his grandmother,

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught Timothy the holy writings

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the truth as found in God’s Word.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we speak of unbelieving mates,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we recognize that their circumstances

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not all the same.

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some non-Witness mates oppose true worship.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others are indifferent.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And others may be tolerant,

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:24.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even somewhat interested and supportive,

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:28.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they may not be progressing
toward baptism.

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some mates of believers are baptized,

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they have weakened spiritually.

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may no longer be regular at meetings,
go in service,

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or participate in family worship.

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:47.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And last of all, sad to say,

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some mates are disfellowshipped.

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we never give up on unbelieving mates,

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:58.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we always hope
that any who are disfellowshipped

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come to their senses, repent,
and return to Jehovah.

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there something that we as publishers
in the congregation can do

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:13.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show appreciation for fellow believers

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:17.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose mates are not yet serving Jehovah?

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:19.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there is,

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:21.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the apostle Paul tells us

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 3:17

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:29.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can learn from their good example

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imitate them.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:36.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 3:17 says:

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers,

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and keep your eye on those
who are walking in a way

00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:50.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in harmony
with the example we set for you.”

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul tells us
to look closely at his example

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:59.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fine example of others
in the congregation.

00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among those setting a fine example

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:06.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are brothers and sisters
who have unbelieving mates.

00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:11.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have worked hard to maintain
a strong relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:15.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have cultivated self-discipline
to keep a good schedule

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of theocratic activities.

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:20.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many have become proficient in balancing

00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:25.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
family obligations with spiritual pursuits.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:29.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy, but they are doing it.

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:35.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how should we view them and treat them?

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:40.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do what Philippians 2:4 tells us to do.

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:44.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We “look out
not only for [our] own interests,

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:48.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:52.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that we show concern
for their well-being.

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:55.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We treat them with respect.

00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:58.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly do not ignore them.

00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We recognize that as spiritual people,

00:07:01.817 --> 00:07:04.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have much to offer.

00:07:05.654 --> 00:07:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it wonderful that we are family

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we belong to one another?

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:17.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We take brothers and sisters who have
unbelieving mates into account,

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:21.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look out for their interests
as the scripture states

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:23.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we love them

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:26.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see their good qualities.

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do?

00:07:31.013 --> 00:07:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever possible,

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:36.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should include them in our activities.

00:07:36.852 --> 00:07:40.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what else can we do?

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can show interest in their mates

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:46.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try to help them spiritually.

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:50.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if circumstances allow,

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invite them with their mates

00:07:52.284 --> 00:07:55.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a meal or to a gathering.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that friendliness
and upbuilding conversation

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:03.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have a powerful effect
on a person’s heart.

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:06.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:09.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about how you can show appreciation

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for any in your congregation

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:16.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose mates
are not presently serving Jehovah.

00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:21.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was when my husband was really opposed.

00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:26.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night, he put a knife to his stomach

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:31.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said,
“Will you choose me or the truth?”

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:35.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband was cooperative.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would wave goodbye

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we went to the meetings,

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:44.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he wasn’t interested at all.

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:47.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt really jealous

00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:51.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I saw families
sitting together at assemblies.

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:53.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of work

00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking care of his mother,

00:08:56.973 --> 00:09:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband gradually started missing
meetings.

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:03.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in our congregation,
with good intentions,

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:05.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pointed it out to him.

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:08.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way they did this

00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:10.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made him feel misunderstood

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discouraged,

00:09:11.613 --> 00:09:14.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he put the Bible
and the publications away.

00:09:15.283 --> 00:09:19.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had times when I wanted

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:21.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to drift away with him.

00:09:22.874 --> 00:09:26.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really happy when I learned the truth.

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:31.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my zeal, I bombarded my husband
with information,

00:09:31.508 --> 00:09:35.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that made him worry
that I had turned into a fanatic.

00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:39.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he was genuinely concerned
for his family

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:42.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thought that I had joined
a weird religion.

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:45.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One family in the congregation

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:47.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often invited us to meals

00:09:47.816 --> 00:09:49.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and outdoor activities.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think my husband appreciated

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those small acts of kindness.

00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:58.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also tried to show that I appreciated him

00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:00.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through my speech and conduct.

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:03.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my children and I applied

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we learned in our lives,

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:09.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he gradually became interested
in the truth.

00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words “safeguard your heart”

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caught my eye.

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:19.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to try and keep my heart

00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:21.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my children’s hearts

00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:23.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward Jehovah.

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:26.188 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I went out in the ministry

00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:27.522 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with my children,

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:29.816 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would point out various aspects

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:32.569 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s creation around us.

00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:34.571 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And before my husband

00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:37.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would come home from work,

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made it a habit to teach them God’s Word.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a conscious effort

00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:46.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see myself in Paradise with my husband.

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:49.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strengthened my resolve

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:52.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never leave the truth.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote caring notes to my husband

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:57.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I went to the meetings.

00:10:57.469 --> 00:11:00.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced
that he would come back one day,

00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:05.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did come back.

00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not leave Jehovah,

00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:11.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband never embraced the truth.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:19.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, right now all five

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:21.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of my children are in the truth,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I feel really blessed.

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:28.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being able to serve Jehovah as a family

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with my husband

00:11:30.877 --> 00:11:33.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the joy and appreciation

00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:35.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just keep welling up.

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:41.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we learn from the video?

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that believing mates
who display fine Christian qualities

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:49.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have a positive influence on mates

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are not yet serving Jehovah.

00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:54.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will help you

00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:57.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on fighting for the faith?

00:11:58.405 --> 00:12:00.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wisdom and strength

00:12:00.782 --> 00:12:03.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only Jehovah can provide.

00:12:03.952 --> 00:12:08.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, his power is unlimited

00:12:08.164 --> 00:12:11.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he finds pleasure in showing favor

00:12:11.001 --> 00:12:13.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who trust in him.

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:17.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you know that he loves you

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he listens to sincere prayers

00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:23.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who want to do things his way.

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:29.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The combination of God’s love,
prayer, and his spirit

00:12:29.394 --> 00:12:33.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can give you the strength
and the wisdom you need

00:12:33.231 --> 00:12:37.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain a balanced routine
of spiritual activities

00:12:37.485 --> 00:12:42.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while making sure to care
for your family responsibilities.

00:12:43.783 --> 00:12:47.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video, the believing mates
took advantage

00:12:47.662 --> 00:12:50.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all the spiritual food that was available

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build themselves up.

00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:55.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah helped them to display

00:12:55.545 --> 00:13:00.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spiritual qualities of patience and tact.

00:13:00.258 --> 00:13:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know as well as I do that at times

00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:06.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may not be as tactful as we should be.

00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:11.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being patient and tactful is not always easy,

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:13.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you’re tired

00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel disappointed
by your mate’s words or actions.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:23.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, regardless of your situation,

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can supply you with the power

00:13:26.284 --> 00:13:29.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep setting a fine example

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:31.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you keep on praying

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:35.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your mate will eventually respond
to the truth.

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:41.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Peter 3:1, 2

00:13:41.841 --> 00:13:45.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 3:1, 2—

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find this very wise and practical counsel.

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:54.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:1, 2 reads:

00:13:54.729 --> 00:13:56.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the same way,

00:13:56.731 --> 00:14:01.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you wives, be in subjection
to your husbands,

00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:04.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that if any are not obedient to the word,

00:14:04.864 --> 00:14:07.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they may be won without a word

00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:10.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the conduct of their wives,

00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:14.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of having been eyewitnesses

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:16.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of your chaste conduct

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:20.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together with deep respect.”

00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:14:22.298 --> 00:14:27.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The counsel that Peter gives
is tested and true.

00:14:27.095 --> 00:14:29.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its application has helped

00:14:29.097 --> 00:14:32.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an untold number of unbelieving mates

00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:34.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept the truth.

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:38.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think about it,
it is truly amazing

00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:42.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how deep respect and fine conduct

00:14:42.402 --> 00:14:45.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can win over an unbelieving mate

00:14:45.572 --> 00:14:48.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without a word being spoken.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, as you work
what is good toward your mate,

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there undoubtedly will be opportunities
to speak about the truth

00:14:56.374 --> 00:14:58.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provide spiritual assistance

00:14:58.877 --> 00:15:03.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when circumstances permit
and it seems appropriate.

00:15:04.007 --> 00:15:07.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep on setting a fine example

00:15:07.343 --> 00:15:12.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying that your mate
will respond to the truth.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have faith in the inspired words
that Paul wrote

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:20.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 7:16

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 7:16—

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:27.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remember to continue to show

00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:31.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a positive attitude toward your mate.

00:15:31.493 --> 00:15:35.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 7:16 poses two questions

00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:38.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with a positive slant.

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 7 and verse 16 reads:

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For wife, how do you know

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether you will save your husband?

00:15:47.217 --> 00:15:49.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or, husband, how do you know

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:53.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether you will save your wife?”

00:15:53.431 --> 00:15:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this text is telling us
to remain positive

00:15:57.393 --> 00:16:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the possibility
of a mate taking the truth.

00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:03.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is a fact

00:16:03.942 --> 00:16:07.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many unbelieving mates
have accepted the truth

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of observing a husband or a wife

00:16:11.074 --> 00:16:13.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who follows God’s direction.

00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:18.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we continue to hope wholeheartedly

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:23.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in time unbelieving mates
will respond to the truth

00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:27.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find pleasure in serving Jehovah.

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:32.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you apply divine counsel from God’s Word,

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be assured that with Jehovah’s help,

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:40.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can continue to be
a successful fighter for the faith

00:16:40.061 --> 00:16:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring honor to Jehovah God.

Brother Seth Hyatt,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the next talk,

00:16:50.822 --> 00:16:53.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Those Being Raised by Single Parents.”

00:17:04.502 --> 00:17:07.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 68:5,

00:17:07.255 --> 00:17:12.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is called
“a father of the fatherless.”

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:14.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a fatherless child?

00:17:14.888 --> 00:17:17.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do you have a fatherless child

00:17:17.223 --> 00:17:22.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or fatherless children in your congregation?

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:24.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be wondering,

00:17:24.147 --> 00:17:28.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What do we mean by fatherless child?’

00:17:28.693 --> 00:17:31.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the context of our discussion,

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re talking about young people

00:17:34.073 --> 00:17:37.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have only one believing parent

00:17:37.577 --> 00:17:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one parent in the truth.

00:17:39.787 --> 00:17:43.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that allows
for a spectrum of possibilities:

00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:46.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a single-parent family;

00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:49.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could be a religiously divided family,

00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:53.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially when the unbeliever
is opposed;

00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:57.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could even include a situation

00:17:57.347 --> 00:18:02.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where only one parent
is actively serving Jehovah.

00:18:03.978 --> 00:18:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was five years old when my mother
learned the truth from the Bible.

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:13.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some years,
I lived in a religiously divided home.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:17.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And eventually,
my mother became a single parent,

00:18:17.075 --> 00:18:20.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we dealt with those circumstances.

00:18:20.912 --> 00:18:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many of us here at Bethel

00:18:23.998 --> 00:18:26.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the field pioneering,

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:28.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as missionaries,
circuit overseers,

00:18:28.962 --> 00:18:31.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
construction workers

00:18:31.255 --> 00:18:35.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many of us who
have experienced similar circumstances.

00:18:36.552 --> 00:18:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, in the Bible,

00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw fit to include
the life experience of a young man

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:47.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who grew up
in a religiously divided home

00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Timothy.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes him as having

00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:55.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘a believing Jewish mother

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a Greek father.’

00:18:58.866 --> 00:19:02.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had only one parent who served Jehovah.

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:07.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that his mother, Eunice,

00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:09.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his grandmother Lois

00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:12.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were instrumental in helping him

00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:16.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become well-founded in the truth.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Scriptures indicate
that others had a share

00:19:19.595 --> 00:19:22.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his spiritual advancement as well.

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:26.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where all of us
come into this conversation.

00:19:26.811 --> 00:19:29.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us, like Jehovah,

00:19:29.647 --> 00:19:33.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to appreciate the fatherless children

00:19:33.401 --> 00:19:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our congregations.

00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should view them as modern-day Timothys.

00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:42.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do that?

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can learn a lot
from the apostle Paul.

00:19:46.998 --> 00:19:52.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Late in the year 49 or early 50 C.E.,

00:19:52.003 --> 00:19:56.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul,
on his second missionary journey,

00:19:56.007 --> 00:19:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visited the city of Lystra

00:19:59.135 --> 00:20:03.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there he observed Timothy

00:20:03.097 --> 00:20:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just in a casual way.

00:20:05.933 --> 00:20:09.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul really saw Timothy.

00:20:09.687 --> 00:20:12.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed his potential,

00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he took the initiative
to provide training

00:20:16.986 --> 00:20:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Timothy could realize that potential.

00:20:20.948 --> 00:20:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a beautiful example for us.

00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:27.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to take note of

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:29.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encourage

00:20:29.874 --> 00:20:33.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fatherless children in our midst.

00:20:34.504 --> 00:20:38.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul set a nice example

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in something that he wrote to Timothy.

00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:44.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the year 65 C.E.,

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:47.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was a prisoner in Rome

00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:52.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no prospect of being released.

00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:56.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, his death was imminent

00:20:56.484 --> 00:21:00.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—time to write one more letter.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To whom did he write?

00:21:03.449 --> 00:21:08.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Timothy
—his beloved “child in the faith.”

00:21:08.412 --> 00:21:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he have to say to Timothy

00:21:11.374 --> 00:21:14.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this last inspired letter?

00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:18.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together,
2 Timothy chapter 1,

00:21:20.758 --> 00:21:24.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Timothy 1:5:

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I recall your unhypocritical faith,

00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:33.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois

00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:36.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your mother Eunice,

00:21:36.274 --> 00:21:39.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but which I am confident is also in you.”

00:21:41.362 --> 00:21:45.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what Paul did?

00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:47.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a few words,

00:21:47.743 --> 00:21:51.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he commended and expressed confidence

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:53.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Timothy

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:56.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he also commended Timothy’s mother

00:21:56.335 --> 00:21:58.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grandmother
—didn’t he?—

00:21:58.337 --> 00:22:02.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their “unhypocritical faith.”

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:07.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Lois and Eunice,
serving Jehovah was not playacting.

00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:09.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith was genuine.

00:22:09.724 --> 00:22:13.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing for Timothy
that proved to be!

00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:22:18.774 --> 00:22:21.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can offer

00:22:21.068 --> 00:22:25.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
specific, sincere, heartfelt commendation

00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:28.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fatherless children

00:22:28.034 --> 00:22:30.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their parents

00:22:30.953 --> 00:22:35.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and commend them
for what they’re able to do.

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:39.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Include them
in spiritual and recreational activities.

00:22:41.005 --> 00:22:43.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a boy,

00:22:43.007 --> 00:22:46.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my grandmother used to pick me up
every Saturday morning

00:22:46.302 --> 00:22:48.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take me in the ministry.

00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:51.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had to wonder if she was coming,

00:22:51.515 --> 00:22:54.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I never had to wonder
who I would work with.

00:22:54.602 --> 00:22:58.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book study conductor, an older brother,

00:22:58.272 --> 00:23:01.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would always include my grandmother and me

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:05.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the group with him and his wife.

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:07.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cherish those memories.

00:23:08.532 --> 00:23:10.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay close attention now

00:23:10.868 --> 00:23:14.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as some who grew up
in single-parent homes

00:23:14.538 --> 00:23:17.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explain how they were encouraged

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:20.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be successful fighters for the faith.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like a bad dream.

00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:31.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family was really zealous in the truth.

00:23:31.264 --> 00:23:34.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were playing downstairs one day,

00:23:34.058 --> 00:23:35.685 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Mom came down to tell us

00:23:35.685 --> 00:23:38.312 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she was leaving Jehovah and leaving Dad.

00:23:38.312 --> 00:23:42.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying goodbye to Mom,
that was the hardest day of my life.

00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:45.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My mother and father became inactive

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:47.446 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when I was about four years old.

00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:50.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My father was never really around.

00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:53.035 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When my mom started to learn the truth,

00:23:53.035 --> 00:23:55.955 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my dad said she was forbidden from studying.

00:23:55.955 --> 00:23:59.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were to go to the meetings,
he would take us out forcibly.

00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:03.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became verbally and physically abusive
to my mom.

00:24:03.254 --> 00:24:07.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents’ breakup was very tough.

00:24:07.091 --> 00:24:10.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle for my mother
to raise two boys on her own.

00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:14.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would work two or three jobs,

00:24:14.307 --> 00:24:16.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serving Jehovah just took a backseat.

00:24:16.976 --> 00:24:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my parents divorced,
my mom was very depressed.

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did the best she could,

00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:25.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah didn’t intend for mothers
to fill both roles

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as parents.

00:24:28.988 --> 00:24:30.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sisters and I,
we made a conscious choice

00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:34.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we weren’t going to make
the same bad choices that Mom did.

00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:37.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that it was up to us.

00:24:37.204 --> 00:24:39.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah

00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was baptized when I was 15.

00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:46.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thrived spiritually
when we didn’t have the opposition from Dad.

00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:51.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we could go out in service,
go to the meetings freely.

00:24:51.093 --> 00:24:53.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have to hide our literature
for fear he would rip them up.

00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:57.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was around 15 years old,

00:24:57.016 --> 00:24:59.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother took us to the meeting,

00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:02.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was determined
that this was going to be her last meeting.

00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:05.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the night of a local needs part.

00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the right time.

00:25:07.443 --> 00:25:11.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah just opened my mother’s heart wide.

00:25:11.155 --> 00:25:13.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that experience,

00:25:13.157 --> 00:25:15.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was like she was a new woman.

00:25:16.243 --> 00:25:18.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sisters and I have always been a team.

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:20.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pioneered together; we moved to Cambodia

00:25:20.915 --> 00:25:22.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as need-greaters together.

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re both in special full-time service

00:25:24.794 --> 00:25:27.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their husbands in Cambodia,

00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:30.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been serving here in Myanmar Bethel,
along with my husband,

00:25:30.508 --> 00:25:32.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for just over 11 years now.

00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:35.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom set a stellar example
for me to follow.

00:25:35.763 --> 00:25:39.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her relationship with Jehovah
was always above everything else.

00:25:39.266 --> 00:25:42.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was her example that helped me

00:25:42.436 --> 00:25:45.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set and reach spiritual goals.

00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:48.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering
during my senior year of high school.

00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:51.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In nearly 20 years of full-time service,

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:55.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve spent most of that time
at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.

00:25:56.951 --> 00:26:00.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother had a very strong influence
on my theocratic goals.

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:05.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I had the privilege of attending
the first School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:26:05.543 --> 00:26:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and currently we’re serving
in the circuit work.

00:26:10.089 --> 00:26:12.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one needs to be defined
by their negative circumstances.

00:26:12.716 --> 00:26:14.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:10 says:

00:26:14.718 --> 00:26:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘God himself will complete your training.’

00:26:17.513 --> 00:26:22.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be tough at times,
but with Jehovah’s help, you can succeed.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of what David said
in the 27th Psalm and verse 10;

00:26:26.856 --> 00:26:31.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “Even if my . . . father [or] mother
abandon me,

00:26:31.318 --> 00:26:33.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah . . . will take me in.”

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was definitely the case

00:26:35.948 --> 00:26:37.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my situation.

00:26:38.534 --> 00:26:40.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t define us
by our upbringing or our past.

00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:43.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our potential.

00:26:43.038 --> 00:26:44.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s up to us.

00:26:44.457 --> 00:26:48.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah,
we can be anything we want to be.

00:26:50.838 --> 00:26:54.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we appreciate
those beautiful expressions.

00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:59.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those of you who are fatherless children,

00:26:59.763 --> 00:27:03.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you see yourself?

00:27:03.225 --> 00:27:06.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see yourself as Jehovah sees you,

00:27:06.437 --> 00:27:10.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a unique individual with potential?

00:27:10.774 --> 00:27:15.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, you’re not inferior in any way
because of your circumstances.

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:20.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you appreciate the comments
made by those in the video?

00:27:20.117 --> 00:27:25.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your circumstances don’t have to define you.

00:27:25.122 --> 00:27:30.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Negative circumstances and upbringing
do not have to define you.

00:27:30.127 --> 00:27:32.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would add this:

00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:36.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your unique experience in life
gives you a unique perspective,

00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:41.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah may be able
to use you to help others.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be a Timothy.

00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:48.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a young age, relatively speaking,

00:27:48.062 --> 00:27:52.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was a spiritual man
and entrusted with responsibility.

00:27:52.191 --> 00:27:54.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul described him

00:27:54.443 --> 00:27:57.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as having a disposition like no one else’s.

00:27:57.905 --> 00:28:00.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy cared for others.

00:28:00.991 --> 00:28:03.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do the same.

00:28:03.035 --> 00:28:04.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reach out!

00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:07.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be a pioneer, a Bethelite,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a field missionary, a construction worker,

00:28:10.876 --> 00:28:12.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a circuit overseer.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You young brothers,
qualify and reach out

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a ministerial servant
and then an elder.

00:28:20.844 --> 00:28:23.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opportunities are endless.

00:28:23.889 --> 00:28:28.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow Jehovah to use you,

00:28:28.352 --> 00:28:32.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue to cultivate appreciation

00:28:32.856 --> 00:28:35.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your loyal parent.

00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:38.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I appreciate my mother very much

00:28:38.153 --> 00:28:40.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her fine example of faith

00:28:40.322 --> 00:28:44.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through a number
of very trying circumstances.

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t take the faithfulness
of our single parents

00:28:48.998 --> 00:28:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for granted.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in conclusion,

00:28:53.502 --> 00:28:55.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to assure you

00:28:55.504 --> 00:29:00.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can be
a successful fighter for the faith,

00:29:00.426 --> 00:29:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Timothy was.

00:29:02.678 --> 00:29:05.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have confidence in you,

00:29:05.472 --> 00:29:08.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray Jehovah’s continued rich blessing

00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:11.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your service to him.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:29:16.275 --> 00:29:20.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:25.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Successful Fighters for the Faith
—Single Christians.”

00:29:32.291 --> 00:29:35.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium, we’ve been reminded

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:38.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah cherishes and empowers

00:29:38.964 --> 00:29:41.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who serve him loyally.

00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:43.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this concluding part of the symposium,

00:29:43.927 --> 00:29:47.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll focus on single brothers and sisters.

00:29:47.348 --> 00:29:49.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s answer three questions:

00:29:49.683 --> 00:29:53.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, how do we know
that married and single Christians

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>all</i>  have an honored place
in the congregation?

00:29:57.024 --> 00:30:01.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, how can we show
that we value and support 

00:30:01.028 --> 00:30:04.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fellow believers who are not married?

00:30:04.114 --> 00:30:06.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, if you’re single,

00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:11.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you be
a successful fighter for the faith?

00:30:12.164 --> 00:30:15.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin,
let’s briefly consider Jehovah’s view

00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:18.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of married and single Christians.

00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:23.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing we love
about our God is that Jehovah is not partial.

00:30:23.258 --> 00:30:26.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of a person’s
nationality or skin color,

00:30:26.553 --> 00:30:30.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anyone who wishes can serve him acceptably.

00:30:30.474 --> 00:30:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s impartiality also means

00:30:33.936 --> 00:30:38.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he does not favor
married or single Christians,

00:30:38.232 --> 00:30:40.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one over the other.

00:30:40.442 --> 00:30:44.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, remaining single
or getting married is a personal choice.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And nowhere does the Bible
state that our value to Jehovah

00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:53.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is linked to being either single or married.

00:30:53.038 --> 00:30:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Matthew 19:12,

00:30:56.125 --> 00:31:00.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that some of his followers
would choose to remain single

00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:02.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on account of the Kingdom.”

00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:04.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then went on to say:

00:31:04.383 --> 00:31:08.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the one who can
make room for it make room for it.”

00:31:08.637 --> 00:31:11.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about that for a moment.

00:31:11.265 --> 00:31:13.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a Christian, younger or older,

00:31:13.892 --> 00:31:16.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chooses to remain single
for the sake of the Kingdom,

00:31:16.979 --> 00:31:20.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus respect such a decision

00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:25.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they appreciate the good motive
behind that personal choice.

00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:30.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other Christians are unmarried
because of circumstances in life.

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:35.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, some faithful Christians
in the congregation are too young to marry.

00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:40.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others have lost a mate
because of death or divorce.

00:31:40.544 --> 00:31:44.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul
maintained God’s impartial view

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both single and married Christians.

00:31:47.718 --> 00:31:51.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus,
Paul did not teach that Christians

00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should marry or that they
should remain single.

00:31:54.183 --> 00:31:57.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In commenting on Paul’s
first inspired letter to the Corinthians,

00:31:57.686 --> 00:32:01.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> back in 2012 said this:

00:32:01.482 --> 00:32:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Really, both [marriage and singleness]

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:08.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can be described as gifts from God. 

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not view
[singleness] as a cause for shame or grief.”

00:32:13.202 --> 00:32:16.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Singleness may bring
a Christian certain advantages.

00:32:16.997 --> 00:32:21.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An unmarried Christian who is not
weighed down with family responsibilities

00:32:21.418 --> 00:32:23.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have more time and energy

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to devote to God’s service
than a married Christian.

00:32:27.174 --> 00:32:30.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, single Christians
do not view themselves

00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as better than married
Christians for this reason.

00:32:34.097 --> 00:32:38.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible’s message
—Jehovah’s thinking—is clear, isn’t it?

00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:40.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Married and single Christians

00:32:40.854 --> 00:32:45.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all can have an honored
place in the congregation.

00:32:46.276 --> 00:32:48.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider our second question:

00:32:48.946 --> 00:32:50.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we who are married

00:32:50.948 --> 00:32:55.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show that we value
and support fellow believers

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:57.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are not married?

00:32:57.079 --> 00:33:01.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible
with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:04.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice verse 25.

00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:07.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the context,
we notice that Paul is emphasizing

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the Christian congregation,
we need one another.

00:33:11.885 --> 00:33:14.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We depend on one another.

00:33:14.096 --> 00:33:16.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as we need all
the parts of our literal body

00:33:16.598 --> 00:33:18.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our eyes, our hands, and our feet—

00:33:18.851 --> 00:33:23.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all Christians, single and married,
are valued and needed.

00:33:23.814 --> 00:33:28.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we show that we appreciate
our single brothers and sisters?

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:31.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 25:

00:33:32.197 --> 00:33:34.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . so that there should be
no division in the body,”

00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:38.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s the point,
“but its members should have

00:33:38.537 --> 00:33:42.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mutual concern for one another.”

00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:47.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study edition of the <i>New World</i>
<i>Translation </i> says that this expression,

00:33:47.296 --> 00:33:50.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have mutual concern for one another,”

00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:53.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could also be rendered
as “be anxious over one another.”

00:33:53.886 --> 00:33:55.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson is clear:

00:33:55.888 --> 00:33:57.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Married Christians,

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we show appreciation
for single brothers and sisters

00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:04.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we show concern for their welfare,

00:34:04.646 --> 00:34:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether that’s spiritually or physically.

00:34:07.983 --> 00:34:11.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not ignore them;
we don’t look down on them;

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor do we treat them as if we
have very little in common with them.

00:34:17.117 --> 00:34:22.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard, the apostle Paul
set an example worthy of imitation.

00:34:22.122 --> 00:34:27.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was keenly interested
in Timothy’s spiritual health and progress.

00:34:27.002 --> 00:34:29.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though single,

00:34:29.004 --> 00:34:33.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul saw potential in Timothy
and invested in that spiritual man.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened as a result?

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:40.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An inexperienced, young, single Christian

00:34:40.015 --> 00:34:44.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became an excellent overseer.

00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:46.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the two of them, Paul and Timothy,

00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were no longer traveling together,

00:34:48.357 --> 00:34:52.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul continued to show
genuine interest in Timothy’s welfare.

00:34:52.402 --> 00:34:55.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that because he wrote two letters

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has preserved
for our benefit in the Holy Scriptures.

00:34:59.743 --> 00:35:03.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine
how Timothy must have felt

00:35:03.622 --> 00:35:07.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have received a letter
from his older friend Paul?

00:35:07.709 --> 00:35:11.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For just a moment,
let’s put ourselves in Timothy’s sandals

00:35:11.672 --> 00:35:16.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we listen to just a few lines
from Paul’s first letter.

00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:21.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith:

00:35:21.515 --> 00:35:24.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May you have undeserved kindness
and mercy and peace

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:35:28.522 --> 00:35:32.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A little later in the letter,
Timothy would have read this:

00:35:32.192 --> 00:35:36.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This instruction I entrust to you,
my child Timothy,

00:35:36.154 --> 00:35:39.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in harmony with the prophecies
that were made about you,

00:35:39.616 --> 00:35:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that by these you may
go on waging the fine warfare.”

00:35:44.454 --> 00:35:46.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there was this encouragement:

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:49.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not neglect the gift in you

00:35:49.835 --> 00:35:52.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was given you through a prophecy

00:35:52.504 --> 00:35:56.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the body of elders
laid their hands on you.”

00:35:56.258 --> 00:36:00.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think those
words of encouragement reassured Timothy

00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:02.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made him feel appreciated?

00:36:02.597 --> 00:36:04.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt.

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:07.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same letter,
Paul went on to express concern

00:36:07.644 --> 00:36:10.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Timothy’s “frequent cases of sickness.”

00:36:10.689 --> 00:36:13.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s concern for Timothy’s welfare,

00:36:13.817 --> 00:36:16.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his spiritual and physical welfare,

00:36:16.194 --> 00:36:19.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt touched
Timothy’s heart and encouraged him

00:36:19.406 --> 00:36:22.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move forward in Jehovah’s service.

00:36:22.034 --> 00:36:27.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul’s example touches our heart as well.

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:29.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may be moved to ask ourselves:

00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:32.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there more I can do

00:36:32.044 --> 00:36:35.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to look out for the needs of single ones

00:36:35.005 --> 00:36:38.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘who are exerting
themselves in God’s service?

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I wrongly view single ones as incomplete,

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘inferior, or lacking,

00:36:46.183 --> 00:36:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or do I show them honor?’

00:36:49.352 --> 00:36:53.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a traveling overseer,
Timothy was a success.

00:36:53.774 --> 00:36:56.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul did not look down on him.

00:36:56.068 --> 00:37:00.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Paul chose Timothy,
a single Christian,

00:37:00.363 --> 00:37:04.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for weighty assignments
and gave him the training he needed

00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:06.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to succeed.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, I’m sure you
and I can think of many practical ways

00:37:11.291 --> 00:37:15.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can demonstrate
our concern for the welfare

00:37:15.212 --> 00:37:18.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our fellow believers who are unmarried.

00:37:18.924 --> 00:37:21.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The August 2020 issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:37:21.802 --> 00:37:24.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided this reminder in a study article:

00:37:24.387 --> 00:37:27.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We do well to keep in mind

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:32.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that some single Christians have made it
a personal goal to remain unmarried.

00:37:32.729 --> 00:37:35.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Other . . . Christians would like to marry,

00:37:35.315 --> 00:37:38.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they simply
have not found the right person.

00:37:38.527 --> 00:37:42.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Still others may
have lost their mate in death.

00:37:42.322 --> 00:37:45.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In any case,
should those in the congregation

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“feel the need to ask
single Christians why they are not married

00:37:49.121 --> 00:37:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to offer [help to] find a mate?”

00:37:53.875 --> 00:37:58.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we reason on Jehovah’s thinking
as found in the Scriptures,

00:37:58.213 --> 00:38:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know the answer to that question.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:04.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We <i>do not</i>  need to ask single ones
when they are getting married;

00:38:04.594 --> 00:38:07.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor do we need to pair them up
with other single ones

00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:09.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they have not requested our help.

00:38:09.808 --> 00:38:14.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we should look for ways
to commend them

00:38:14.437 --> 00:38:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their fine example and assure them

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we love and appreciate them.

00:38:20.652 --> 00:38:22.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:27.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please note what an elder learned
about the challenges faced by single ones.

00:38:30.078 --> 00:38:33.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, it’s hard to believe
this is our last time together.

00:38:34.624 --> 00:38:35.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:39.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a packed agenda,
so let’s get started.

00:38:39.087 --> 00:38:40.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first point . . .

00:38:40.088 --> 00:38:43.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is our last week
with our circuit overseer

00:38:43.216 --> 00:38:45.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he leaves us
for his new circuit assignment.

00:38:45.886 --> 00:38:47.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick has been a great circuit overseer

00:38:47.971 --> 00:38:50.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spiritually mature, experienced,

00:38:50.682 --> 00:38:53.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and patient with us.

00:38:53.226 --> 00:38:54.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom, your thought?

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:55.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers and sisters . . .

00:38:55.854 --> 00:38:57.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick is single.

00:38:57.189 --> 00:38:59.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sadly, there were plenty of times

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we turned that gift into a challenge

00:39:03.278 --> 00:39:05.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ever since his first visit.

00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:20.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Jeff.

00:39:20.545 --> 00:39:22.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I have a minute.

00:39:22.464 --> 00:39:24.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that.

00:39:24.216 --> 00:39:25.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laundry night.

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:27.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My washing machine is a clunker.

00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:32.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just assumed a single brother
had lots of free time.

00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:36.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know how much he had to do
on his own.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a lot more I didn’t understand.

00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you. Bye!

00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:49.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, look!

00:39:50.742 --> 00:39:52.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have something there.

00:39:52.953 --> 00:39:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like a great Bible study.

00:39:55.038 --> 00:39:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t wait to meet her.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.
See you then.

00:39:58.208 --> 00:39:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:02.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would be really good . . .

00:40:04.506 --> 00:40:06.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what you’re waiting for.

00:40:06.716 --> 00:40:08.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For what?

00:40:09.427 --> 00:40:10.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on!

00:40:10.428 --> 00:40:13.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A single circuit overseer, a pioneer sister

00:40:13.473 --> 00:40:15.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you’ve got to be looking for a C.O.’s wife.

00:40:18.687 --> 00:40:20.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, . . .

00:40:20.188 --> 00:40:22.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teasing was so inappropriate

00:40:22.482 --> 00:40:25.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was there at every visit.

00:40:28.738 --> 00:40:31.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there were those trying to be,

00:40:31.741 --> 00:40:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how should I say, <i>helpful.</i>

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!

00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:42.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to meet them,

00:40:42.877 --> 00:40:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I invited them for lunch Saturday.

00:40:46.756 --> 00:40:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick never asked for that help.

00:40:49.759 --> 00:40:52.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All it did was put him

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and plenty of sisters
in an awkward situation.

00:40:55.724 --> 00:40:59.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he dealt with week after week.

00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all failed at times
to see past the single person

00:41:04.107 --> 00:41:07.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the spiritual man giving Jehovah his best.

00:41:08.528 --> 00:41:10.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll miss you.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just maybe not as much
as some of the sisters.

00:41:14.868 --> 00:41:17.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to make that mistake again

00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:19.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with any single brother or sister.

00:41:19.539 --> 00:41:20.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick.

00:41:20.206 --> 00:41:20.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeff.

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:22.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:41:22.208 --> 00:41:23.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot from you.

00:41:23.543 --> 00:41:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I hope Jehovah blesses you
wherever you go.

00:41:27.047 --> 00:41:28.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!
Thanks, Rick.

00:41:32.594 --> 00:41:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now consider our final point:

00:41:35.764 --> 00:41:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re single,

00:41:37.766 --> 00:41:42.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you too can be powerful by faith.

00:41:42.103 --> 00:41:44.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how?

00:41:44.147 --> 00:41:46.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A great help in building faith

00:41:46.149 --> 00:41:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by setting and reaching spiritual goals.

00:41:50.195 --> 00:41:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of Abraham, Romans 4:20 says:

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:56.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of the promise of God,

00:41:56.326 --> 00:41:59.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not waver in a lack of faith.”

00:41:59.371 --> 00:42:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Abraham, we encourage you
single brothers and sisters

00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:06.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to frequently meditate on God’s promises.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking often about how Jehovah

00:42:09.631 --> 00:42:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has kept every promise to us in the past

00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he’s keeping his promises now

00:42:15.095 --> 00:42:17.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely encourages us to remember

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will keep every promise
that he has made for our future.

00:42:22.685 --> 00:42:26.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so strengthens our faith.

00:42:26.439 --> 00:42:29.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, like Paul, like Timothy,

00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:32.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk about Jehovah’s promises with others

00:42:32.654 --> 00:42:36.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by zealously sharing in the field ministry.

00:42:36.282 --> 00:42:39.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, please, do not isolate yourself

00:42:39.911 --> 00:42:41.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from others in the congregation,

00:42:41.955 --> 00:42:45.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that you have
very little to contribute.

00:42:45.208 --> 00:42:48.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you have much to contribute

00:42:48.586 --> 00:42:53.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a faithful brother or sister
in the Christian congregation.

00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We warmly encourage you to reach out

00:42:55.802 --> 00:42:58.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and associate with spiritually mature ones

00:42:58.555 --> 00:43:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your congregation,
whether single or married.

00:43:02.225 --> 00:43:05.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Timothy, “ponder over these things;

00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:08.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be absorbed in [spiritual pursuits],

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that your advancement
may be plainly [manifest to] all.”

00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:18.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you are needed and loved.

00:43:20.034 --> 00:43:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what have all of us
learned in this faith-strengthening

00:43:23.288 --> 00:43:25.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouraging symposium?

00:43:25.707 --> 00:43:29.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible
with me to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:43:29.878 --> 00:43:34.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting in verse 4, you’ll notice,
as you scan the verses,

00:43:34.007 --> 00:43:38.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many familiar names of men
and women of faith are outlined for us.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s Abel and Enoch,

00:43:40.972 --> 00:43:43.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah, Abraham, Sarah,

00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:47.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab, Gideon, and David, and many more.

00:43:47.979 --> 00:43:51.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these men and women
had different circumstances in life.

00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true.

00:43:53.318 --> 00:43:56.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did they all have in common?

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:59.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Hebrews 11:34.

00:43:59.741 --> 00:44:02.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the middle of the verse, it tells us

00:44:02.076 --> 00:44:05.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they “were made powerful.”

00:44:05.872 --> 00:44:10.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they “were made powerful” by faith.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the same is happening today

00:44:12.962 --> 00:44:18.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every congregation
of Jehovah’s people earth wide.

00:44:18.009 --> 00:44:22.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young ones, older ones, men and women

00:44:22.055 --> 00:44:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—regardless of our family circumstances—

00:44:25.141 --> 00:44:29.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us are being made powerful by faith.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,

00:44:32.023 --> 00:44:37.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please be assured that we love you
and appreciate you.

00:44:37.028 --> 00:44:39.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may Jehovah bless your efforts

00:44:39.906 --> 00:44:43.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a successful fighter for the faith.

00:44:45.787 --> 00:44:50.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers, for those loving talks.

00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:54.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time has now arrived
for the baptism discourse.

00:44:54.337 --> 00:44:57.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite all baptism candidates

00:44:57.048 --> 00:44:59.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay particular attention.

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:01.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days ahead,

00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:04.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you further strengthen your faith?

00:45:04.973 --> 00:45:08.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can you be confident
that Jehovah will reward your faith?

00:45:10.395 --> 00:45:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen closely to the answers presented
in the discourse entitled

00:45:14.691 --> 00:45:18.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exercising Faith Means Everlasting Life!”

00:45:18.861 --> 00:45:21.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The talk will be given
by Brother John Ekrann,

00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:23.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee.

00:45:30.957 --> 00:45:33.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us around the world

00:45:33.042 --> 00:45:35.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoice with you baptismal candidates.

00:45:35.962 --> 00:45:38.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a very special occasion for you.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, you will join millions
of your brothers and sisters

00:45:42.051 --> 00:45:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very special relationship with Jehovah.

00:45:45.555 --> 00:45:47.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to imagine for a moment

00:45:47.974 --> 00:45:50.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re in a very large stadium

00:45:50.685 --> 00:45:54.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are eight and a half million
of your brothers and sisters

00:45:54.772 --> 00:45:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all in this stadium clapping and so happy

00:45:58.735 --> 00:46:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the stand
you’re taking for Jehovah today.

00:46:02.572 --> 00:46:05.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you are young ones
that are raised in the truth,

00:46:05.825 --> 00:46:08.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re sitting
with your parents and family.

00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:11.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you may have known
the truth years ago

00:46:11.914 --> 00:46:14.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have recently returned to Jehovah.

00:46:14.292 --> 00:46:17.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others may have learned the truth recently

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, even under these unusual circumstances
of a pandemic and Zoom meetings,

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:26.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have come to the point
of dedicating your life to Jehovah.

00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:29.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever your circumstances,

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:34.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are so happy that you’ve made
the decision to get baptized.

00:46:34.395 --> 00:46:38.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the theme of our talk
with you baptism candidates

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:43.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Exercising Faith Means Everlasting Life!”

00:46:43.279 --> 00:46:47.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are two key words here:
exercising and faith.

00:46:47.617 --> 00:46:50.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is your trust and confidence

00:46:50.995 --> 00:46:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah and his promises.

00:46:53.289 --> 00:46:55.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And exercising your faith

00:46:55.625 --> 00:46:59.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is living your life to do God’s will.

00:46:59.545 --> 00:47:01.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve shown your faith

00:47:01.714 --> 00:47:05.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by working hard to qualify for baptism today.

00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:10.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, faith is a little bit like
building a wood fire.

00:47:10.181 --> 00:47:12.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to build a fire,

00:47:12.183 --> 00:47:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you first have to collect
some small pieces of wood.

00:47:15.144 --> 00:47:19.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, later, you need to have on hand
some larger pieces of wood

00:47:19.023 --> 00:47:21.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the fire going.

00:47:21.609 --> 00:47:24.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, your baptism today

00:47:24.487 --> 00:47:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the start of your fire of faith.

00:47:27.657 --> 00:47:30.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s not easy to start a fire at times.

00:47:30.535 --> 00:47:32.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wood may be wet.

00:47:32.578 --> 00:47:35.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wind keeps blowing out your flame.

00:47:35.581 --> 00:47:37.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, it may not have been easy for you

00:47:37.834 --> 00:47:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the fire of your faith started.

00:47:40.336 --> 00:47:43.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have taken the time and effort

00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:46.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build your fire of faith.

00:47:46.968 --> 00:47:50.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you need to keep
that fire of faith burning.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:47:51.848 --> 00:47:55.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because our faith can become weak

00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless we work to keep it strong.

00:47:58.688 --> 00:48:03.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On one occasion, Jesus said to some
of his disciples that they had little faith.

00:48:03.317 --> 00:48:07.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that at Matthew 17:20.

00:48:10.283 --> 00:48:13.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 17:20:

00:48:13.453 --> 00:48:17.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:
‘Because of your little faith.

00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:19.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For truly I say to you,

00:48:19.333 --> 00:48:22.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:48:22.712 --> 00:48:26.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will say to this mountain,
“Move from here to there,”

00:48:26.257 --> 00:48:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will move,
and nothing will be impossible for you.’”

00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:33.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was letting them know

00:48:33.598 --> 00:48:37.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they needed
to make their faith stronger.

00:48:37.018 --> 00:48:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after a fire gets started,

00:48:39.687 --> 00:48:42.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can often get very large and very hot.

00:48:42.648 --> 00:48:46.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if there’s no wood added to the fire,
what happens?

00:48:46.694 --> 00:48:51.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It soon goes out
and turns to just cold ashes.

00:48:51.657 --> 00:48:56.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in order for us to keep
our fire of faith burning,

00:48:56.662 --> 00:48:59.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to keep feeding it.

00:48:59.165 --> 00:49:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, your fire of faith

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:05.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs constant attention
to keep burning hot and bright.

00:49:05.713 --> 00:49:09.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three questions:

00:49:09.133 --> 00:49:13.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) How can you feed your fire of faith?

00:49:13.012 --> 00:49:17.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:49:17.725 --> 00:49:22.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) How will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:49:23.898 --> 00:49:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we answer those questions, though,

00:49:25.942 --> 00:49:28.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will talk to two baptized Witnesses

00:49:28.653 --> 00:49:33.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have taken steps
to make their faith stronger.

00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:37.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk to Jouni Palmu.

00:49:37.036 --> 00:49:40.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Palmu and his wife, Heli,
serve at Bethel in Finland.

00:49:40.832 --> 00:49:44.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has faithfully served
Jehovah for 60 years.

00:49:44.335 --> 00:49:47.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want you to note
what helped Brother Palmu

00:49:47.296 --> 00:49:52.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face a test of his faith
early in his pioneering.

00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:56.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Palmu, can you recall a time
when you had little faith?

00:49:56.097 --> 00:49:59.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I can recall.

00:49:59.642 --> 00:50:02.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 17, I moved

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:05.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as an auxiliary pioneer

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:10.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an isolated group far away from my home.

00:50:10.278 --> 00:50:14.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There I faced very religious people
who were convinced

00:50:14.991 --> 00:50:17.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we Witnesses were wrong

00:50:17.577 --> 00:50:21.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was badly misled.

00:50:21.122 --> 00:50:24.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked questions about scriptures

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:27.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never encountered in my former territory.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:31.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people were very convincing

00:50:31.757 --> 00:50:34.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their arguments,
and I felt confused and lost.

00:50:36.095 --> 00:50:39.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked myself,
‘Are there other questions too

00:50:39.932 --> 00:50:42.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I don’t have answers to?’

00:50:42.143 --> 00:50:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this started, little by little,

00:50:45.688 --> 00:50:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bothering me and tested my faith.

00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:55.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there you were, young and isolated,
with all those questions.

00:50:55.031 --> 00:50:57.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:50:57.909 --> 00:51:01.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have bound volumes,

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:05.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no <i>Watchtower Library</i>,
or those kinds of tools.

00:51:05.666 --> 00:51:09.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wrote a letter to my fleshly brothers

00:51:09.378 --> 00:51:11.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who at that time were in prison

00:51:11.547 --> 00:51:14.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of refusing military service.

00:51:14.884 --> 00:51:19.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that they had
all of our literature there,

00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:21.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were studying every day

00:51:21.974 --> 00:51:25.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible, like scholars.

00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:28.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They saw my situation,

00:51:28.773 --> 00:51:31.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they sent me a letter with answers

00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:34.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all my questions.

00:51:34.487 --> 00:51:38.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy and thanked Jehovah.

00:51:38.449 --> 00:51:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really strengthened my faith.

00:51:42.078 --> 00:51:46.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used your brothers
in prison to help you.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you think you benefited
from strengthening your faith?

00:51:50.252 --> 00:51:53.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience was decisive

00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a hallmark to my whole spiritual life.

00:51:57.385 --> 00:52:01.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood the value of accurate knowledge,

00:52:01.097 --> 00:52:05.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I started to collect a library of my own.

00:52:05.351 --> 00:52:08.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still have my early library,

00:52:08.521 --> 00:52:13.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to me, it is something very special.

00:52:13.317 --> 00:52:16.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience happened 56 years ago,

00:52:16.988 --> 00:52:20.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and since then,
I have not had any such doubts.

00:52:20.992 --> 00:52:25.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us all
the answers we need to know.

00:52:25.621 --> 00:52:27.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even

00:52:27.665 --> 00:52:32.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there are questions we don’t have
answers to at the moment,

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have faith that they will be answered

00:52:35.965 --> 00:52:39.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah in his due time.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Palmu.

00:52:41.554 --> 00:52:44.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your experience really helps us to appreciate

00:52:44.348 --> 00:52:48.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible’s answers
to life’s most complex questions.

00:52:51.022 --> 00:52:53.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we can talk to Frankie Brown.

00:52:53.566 --> 00:52:58.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Brown and his wife, Karen,
serve at Bethel in the United States.

00:52:58.195 --> 00:53:01.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want you to pay close attention
to what helped Brother Brown

00:53:01.323 --> 00:53:05.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the decision
to dedicate his life to Jehovah.

00:53:05.244 --> 00:53:09.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Brown, can you recall a time
when you had little faith?

00:53:09.457 --> 00:53:11.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until the age of 12,

00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:15.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised by my grandmother,
who studied with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:53:15.588 --> 00:53:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how I was introduced to the truth,

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I studied off and on growing up.

00:53:20.342 --> 00:53:23.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 17, like many young people,

00:53:23.512 --> 00:53:27.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I faced the decision of what
to do with my life after school.

00:53:27.266 --> 00:53:31.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many around me just assumed
I’d go off to college and pursue a career.

00:53:31.395 --> 00:53:33.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, from my study of the Bible,

00:53:33.606 --> 00:53:37.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I had another choice to make
—to serve Jehovah.

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:39.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a big decision for me.

00:53:39.737 --> 00:53:42.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, I had no idea what I wanted to do.

00:53:42.948 --> 00:53:46.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was inexperienced and unsure
about whose advice to take

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible’s
or that of well-meaning family and friends.

00:53:50.331 --> 00:53:54.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s quite a challenging decision
for you at that age to make.

00:53:54.418 --> 00:53:57.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:53:57.296 --> 00:54:00.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to know Jehovah better

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:02.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what was involved in serving him.

00:54:02.635 --> 00:54:06.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I resumed my Bible study
and attendance at Christian meetings.

00:54:06.555 --> 00:54:09.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also began to do personal study.

00:54:09.058 --> 00:54:12.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One personal study project was Psalm 119.

00:54:12.269 --> 00:54:14.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This beautiful psalm
helped me to view Jehovah

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the loving Father I never had.

00:54:17.441 --> 00:54:19.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also helped me to see the wisdom

00:54:19.735 --> 00:54:22.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of living in harmony
with the Bible’s standards.

00:54:22.822 --> 00:54:26.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Psalm 119:99 says:

00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:29.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have more insight than all my teachers,

00:54:29.995 --> 00:54:33.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I ponder over your reminders.”

00:54:33.457 --> 00:54:35.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Essentially, the psalmist was saying

00:54:35.543 --> 00:54:38.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was his Guidance Counselor.

00:54:38.879 --> 00:54:42.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, I’ve benefited from the good example

00:54:42.591 --> 00:54:45.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers
and sisters in my congregation.

00:54:45.386 --> 00:54:49.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had already made the decision
to serve Jehovah, and from their life,

00:54:49.974 --> 00:54:54.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was obvious they were truly happy
and had a meaningful life.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convinced me that serving Jehovah

00:54:57.439 --> 00:54:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best way to use my life.

00:54:59.942 --> 00:55:03.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thank Jehovah for their good example

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:08.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for their efforts to help me
at a time when I needed more faith.

00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:11.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your personal study and help
from the brothers and sisters

00:55:11.287 --> 00:55:14.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your congregation really helped you.

00:55:14.206 --> 00:55:18.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you think you benefited
from strengthening your faith?

00:55:18.252 --> 00:55:21.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized, started pioneering,

00:55:21.338 --> 00:55:23.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some years later was invited to Bethel.

00:55:23.966 --> 00:55:27.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From my youth onward, I have found security

00:55:27.178 --> 00:55:30.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stability
in my relationship with Jehovah.

00:55:30.514 --> 00:55:34.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look back on my decision
to dedicate my life to Jehovah,

00:55:34.226 --> 00:55:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without a doubt that’s
the best decision I’ve ever made.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old,
Jehovah will not let you down

00:55:41.567 --> 00:55:43.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you need him the most.

00:55:43.611 --> 00:55:45.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Brown.

00:55:45.279 --> 00:55:48.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made a good choice.

00:55:48.365 --> 00:55:50.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to our three questions.

00:55:50.951 --> 00:55:53.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider our first question:

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:01.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible is our main source of fuel

00:56:01.128 --> 00:56:03.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed the fire of our faith.

00:56:03.672 --> 00:56:07.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To feed the fire of our faith,
we need to do two things.

00:56:07.635 --> 00:56:11.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to read God’s Word
and meditate on it.

00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:13.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, reading God’s Word

00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:16.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like adding wood to our fire,

00:56:16.894 --> 00:56:21.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation
is a lot like fanning the flames.

00:56:21.273 --> 00:56:23.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss these one at a time.

00:56:23.984 --> 00:56:26.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s use the example

00:56:26.612 --> 00:56:29.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the psalmist at Psalm

00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:33.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 1, verses 1-3.

00:56:33.661 --> 00:56:36.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 1:1-3:

00:56:39.083 --> 00:56:41.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is the man who does not walk

00:56:41.418 --> 00:56:43.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the advice of the wicked

00:56:43.879 --> 00:56:46.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and does not stand on the path of sinners

00:56:46.757 --> 00:56:49.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and does not sit in the seat of scoffers.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But his delight is in the law of Jehovah,

00:56:52.888 --> 00:56:56.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he reads His law in an undertone

00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:58.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“day and night.

00:56:58.269 --> 00:57:02.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will be like a tree planted
by streams of water,

00:57:02.147 --> 00:57:05.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a tree that produces fruit in its season,

00:57:05.317 --> 00:57:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the foliage of which does not wither.

00:57:07.611 --> 00:57:11.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everything he does will succeed.”

00:57:11.282 --> 00:57:14.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we want to be like
that man in this psalm.

00:57:14.702 --> 00:57:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His delight is in the law of Jehovah.”

00:57:18.289 --> 00:57:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we find delight, or pleasure,
in reading God’s Word,

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not like we have to read God’s Word,

00:57:26.588 --> 00:57:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we want to read God’s Word.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reads His law “day and night.”

00:57:33.429 --> 00:57:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to read his Word often.

00:57:38.267 --> 00:57:42.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer is when we speak to Jehovah,

00:57:42.021 --> 00:57:44.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but reading the Bible

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when he speaks to us.

00:57:47.443 --> 00:57:50.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to notice
the beautiful mental picture

00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:54.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Isaiah gives us
of how Jehovah speaks to us

00:57:54.533 --> 00:57:59.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 30:21.

00:57:59.121 --> 00:58:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:21:

00:58:02.791 --> 00:58:05.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And your own ears will hear a word
behind you

00:58:05.794 --> 00:58:08.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying, ‘This is the way.

00:58:08.172 --> 00:58:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Walk in it,’ in case you
should go to the right

00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in case you should go to the left.”

00:58:15.763 --> 00:58:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why do we hear Jehovah’s voice

00:58:18.182 --> 00:58:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind us instead of in front of us?

00:58:21.685 --> 00:58:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing,
Jehovah’s words in the Bible

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were written many years ago or, we could say,

00:58:28.108 --> 00:58:31.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a time in the past—behind us.

00:58:31.987 --> 00:58:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s another way
to visualize this verse.

00:58:35.074 --> 00:58:37.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve been with a group

00:58:37.076 --> 00:58:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with some small children,
and you’re walking somewhere.

00:58:40.371 --> 00:58:42.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where often are the children?

00:58:42.664 --> 00:58:45.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re out in front running ahead,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if they don’t really know
where they’re going.

00:58:47.586 --> 00:58:50.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do the parents behind have to do?

00:58:50.672 --> 00:58:53.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they have to call to them and say:
“No, no, no, not that way!

00:58:53.926 --> 00:58:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to the left here.”

00:58:55.386 --> 00:58:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the children run back,
and that’s the direction that they go in.

00:59:00.849 --> 00:59:04.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely, we want to listen carefully

00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s voice behind us, helping us

00:59:07.022 --> 00:59:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the right decisions.

00:59:10.317 --> 00:59:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to schedule Bible reading

00:59:12.569 --> 00:59:15.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as part of your daily routine.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:17.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a suggestion, you can use the schedule

00:59:17.991 --> 00:59:20.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bible reading that’s found on jw.org.

00:59:20.994 --> 00:59:24.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find it, type “schedule for Bible reading”

00:59:24.665 --> 00:59:27.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the search field at the top right.

00:59:27.376 --> 00:59:32.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you read just three
to five chapters every day,

00:59:32.005 --> 00:59:36.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can complete
the entire Bible in just one year.

00:59:36.802 --> 00:59:40.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But simply reading God’s Word is not enough.

00:59:40.347 --> 00:59:45.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to meditate on what you are reading.

00:59:45.352 --> 00:59:50.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why should you meditate
on what you read in God’s Word?

00:59:50.357 --> 00:59:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because knowing

00:59:53.318 --> 00:59:58.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the right thing to do is
and doing it are not the same.

00:59:58.282 --> 01:00:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is the process

01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of converting knowledge—that is, what we know

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:08.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into wise decisions and actions.

01:00:08.459 --> 01:00:11.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible often associates

01:00:11.044 --> 01:00:13.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditation with the heart.

01:00:13.088 --> 01:00:14.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that?

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because meditation can convert knowledge

01:00:17.759 --> 01:00:20.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, what we know into feelings.

01:00:20.512 --> 01:00:23.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is those feelings that drive

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our actions and decisions.

01:00:26.101 --> 01:00:30.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could kind of think
of meditation like a bridge.

01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:35.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On this side of the river, we have knowing
what the right thing to do is,

01:00:35.235 --> 01:00:38.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on this side, we have actually doing it.

01:00:38.822 --> 01:00:41.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is the bridge

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that closes the gap
between knowing and doing.

01:00:45.704 --> 01:00:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we find ourselves always
kind of knowing what the right thing to do is

01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not actually doing it,
meditation is the bridge to help us

01:00:54.254 --> 01:00:58.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close that gap between knowing and doing.

01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:03.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can you meditate on God’s Word?

01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:06.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after reading a portion of the Bible

01:01:06.225 --> 01:01:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or one of our publications,

01:01:08.644 --> 01:01:13.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take a few moments to think deeply
about what you have read.

01:01:13.148 --> 01:01:15.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself:

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:20.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What do I learn about Jehovah
when I read this account?

01:01:20.155 --> 01:01:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How does this account
make me feel about Jehovah?

01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:27.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I apply this in my life?

01:01:27.704 --> 01:01:30.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or how can I use this to help others?’

01:01:33.252 --> 01:01:36.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s review our first question:

01:01:36.046 --> 01:01:40.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

01:01:40.008 --> 01:01:43.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read and meditate on God’s Word each day.

01:01:45.889 --> 01:01:48.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at our second question:

01:01:48.267 --> 01:01:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to exercise faith?

01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:56.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus told us that more was required

01:01:56.066 --> 01:01:58.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than just believing in him.

01:01:58.277 --> 01:02:01.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read John 3:16

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the emphasis that Jesus put
on exercising faith.

01:02:07.452 --> 01:02:10.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 3:16:

01:02:10.622 --> 01:02:13.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For God loved the world so much

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he gave his only-begotten Son,

01:02:15.877 --> 01:02:19.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that everyone exercising faith in him

01:02:19.965 --> 01:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might not be destroyed
but have everlasting life.”

01:02:26.597 --> 01:02:31.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what does it mean
to exercise faith?

01:02:31.268 --> 01:02:34.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A study note on this verse explains:

01:02:34.896 --> 01:02:38.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘To exercise faith’ includes the idea

01:02:38.108 --> 01:02:41.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of demonstrating
one’s strong beliefs or faith

01:02:41.361 --> 01:02:44.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[by obeying God].”

01:02:44.448 --> 01:02:47.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham was a powerful example

01:02:47.367 --> 01:02:50.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of proving his faith by obedience.

01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:55.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at a very wonderful description
of Abraham’s faith

01:02:55.834 --> 01:03:00.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at James 2:21-23.

01:03:03.008 --> 01:03:06.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 2:21-23:

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:11.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Was not Abraham our father
declared righteous by works

01:03:11.933 --> 01:03:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after he offered up
Isaac his son on the altar?

01:03:15.354 --> 01:03:18.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You see that his faith was active

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with his works and his faith

01:03:20.984 --> 01:03:23.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was perfected by his works,

01:03:23.779 --> 01:03:26.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the scripture was fulfilled that says:

01:03:26.907 --> 01:03:30.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

01:03:30.202 --> 01:03:33.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it was counted to him as righteousness,’

01:03:33.747 --> 01:03:37.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he came to be called Jehovah’s friend.”

01:03:40.045 --> 01:03:45.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we read and we meditate
on the account of Abraham,

01:03:45.008 --> 01:03:48.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can feel the emotions
that he must have felt

01:03:48.595 --> 01:03:52.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being asked to offer up his son Isaac,

01:03:52.265 --> 01:03:55.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only son that he and Sarah had.

01:03:55.519 --> 01:03:59.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could Abraham
make such a very difficult decision?

01:03:59.606 --> 01:04:02.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, long before this,
Abraham had made a decision

01:04:02.818 --> 01:04:06.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would obey Jehovah
and serve him in everything.

01:04:06.738 --> 01:04:11.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that decision years before
to obey Jehovah in all things

01:04:11.493 --> 01:04:14.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped Abraham to make
all the other decisions

01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:16.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in life clear on what he should do.

01:04:16.498 --> 01:04:18.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not always have to consider,

01:04:18.834 --> 01:04:22.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Should I do what Jehovah asks or not?’

01:04:22.129 --> 01:04:27.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As difficult a request
as it was to offer up his son,

01:04:27.092 --> 01:04:31.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham did not delay
and took action immediately

01:04:31.763 --> 01:04:33.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey Jehovah’s request.

01:04:35.892 --> 01:04:39.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by your baptism today,
you’re telling everyone

01:04:39.563 --> 01:04:43.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have dedicated your life to Jehovah

01:04:43.734 --> 01:04:48.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to serve and obey him
for the rest of your life.

01:04:48.613 --> 01:04:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider three scriptures

01:04:52.159 --> 01:04:55.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how you can show your faith

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by your actions.

01:04:57.789 --> 01:05:01.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we read each scripture,
we’ll consider how each scripture

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:04.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is part of your dedication promise

01:05:04.045 --> 01:05:07.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how you can show your faith in action.

01:05:07.674 --> 01:05:11.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first scripture is Hebrews 10:25.

01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:17.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:25 says:

01:05:21.563 --> 01:05:25.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not forsaking our meeting together,
as some have the custom,

01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:27.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but encouraging one another,

01:05:27.819 --> 01:05:30.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all the more so

01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:33.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you see the day drawing near.”

01:05:33.492 --> 01:05:36.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dedication promise:

01:05:36.077 --> 01:05:40.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will attend all meetings,
assemblies, and conventions.”

01:05:40.332 --> 01:05:43.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do you show that
by faith in action?

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:47.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you really need a job,
but you say no to a job

01:05:47.881 --> 01:05:51.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would mean that you
would regularly miss meetings.

01:05:51.468 --> 01:05:55.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to decide,
‘Should I go to meetings or not?’

01:05:55.472 --> 01:05:58.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve already made that decision

01:05:58.016 --> 01:06:01.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you dedicated yourself to Jehovah.

01:06:01.728 --> 01:06:06.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second scripture is Romans 10:10.

01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:11.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 10:10:

01:06:14.699 --> 01:06:19.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For with the heart
one exercises faith for righteousness,

01:06:19.037 --> 01:06:21.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with the mouth

01:06:21.122 --> 01:06:25.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one makes public declaration for salvation.”

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So your dedication promise:

01:06:27.629 --> 01:06:30.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want everyone to know about Jehovah.”

01:06:30.841 --> 01:06:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith in action?

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, going to bed early
so that you can get up

01:06:35.971 --> 01:06:38.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for field service the next morning,

01:06:38.223 --> 01:06:41.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
auxiliary pioneering when you can,

01:06:41.393 --> 01:06:44.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scheduling field service first

01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:47.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then other activities later in the day,

01:06:47.649 --> 01:06:50.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or adapting to different forms
of the ministry,

01:06:50.277 --> 01:06:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like telephone witnessing or letter writing.

01:06:55.156 --> 01:06:59.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third scripture is Mark 11:24.

01:07:02.706 --> 01:07:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark 11:24:

01:07:12.465 --> 01:07:17.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is why I tell you,
all the things you pray and ask for,

01:07:17.262 --> 01:07:20.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have faith that you have received them,

01:07:20.265 --> 01:07:23.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will have them.”

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:25.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your dedication promise:

01:07:25.478 --> 01:07:29.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will constantly seek
Jehovah’s direction in prayer.”

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:31.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith in action?

01:07:31.484 --> 01:07:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re tempted
to play a violent video game,

01:07:35.071 --> 01:07:39.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you reject that game and play something else.

01:07:39.034 --> 01:07:41.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When faced with a serious illness,

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:46.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pray for calm and wisdom
to make good decisions.

01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:49.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you feel yourself
getting angry with someone,

01:07:49.252 --> 01:07:53.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pray for self-control.

01:07:53.173 --> 01:07:55.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we could use many more scriptures,

01:07:55.884 --> 01:07:58.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we could give you many more examples

01:07:58.136 --> 01:08:03.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how you can exercise
and show your faith by your actions.

01:08:03.141 --> 01:08:06.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is that you baptismal candidates

01:08:06.478 --> 01:08:11.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have dedicated your life
to Jehovah and to do his will.

01:08:11.399 --> 01:08:14.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one decision to dedicate your life

01:08:14.819 --> 01:08:17.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to live by his standards

01:08:17.656 --> 01:08:20.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets the spiritual and moral foundation

01:08:20.992 --> 01:08:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the decisions you will make
from this day forward.

01:08:25.747 --> 01:08:28.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s review our second question:

01:08:28.833 --> 01:08:32.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to exercise faith?

01:08:32.337 --> 01:08:36.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

01:08:38.843 --> 01:08:41.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s go to our third question:

01:08:42.889 --> 01:08:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will Jehovah reward your faith?

01:08:48.061 --> 01:08:50.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves his faithful worshippers.

01:08:50.772 --> 01:08:55.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants the best for us,
and he wants us to be happy.

01:08:55.694 --> 01:09:00.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees every time you
do something to demonstrate your faith

01:09:00.115 --> 01:09:04.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to show faith in action,
to be obedient to him.

01:09:04.119 --> 01:09:07.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some feel that God, or Jehovah,

01:09:07.747 --> 01:09:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always watching out
for the bad things that they do,

01:09:11.167 --> 01:09:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe keeping a ledger,
keeping track, of all these

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bad things that a person does.

01:09:16.381 --> 01:09:18.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah is not doing that.

01:09:18.383 --> 01:09:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s actually looking for the good
and rejoicing in the good that we are doing.

01:09:23.346 --> 01:09:26.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could kind of illustrate it by the way

01:09:26.057 --> 01:09:28.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many of us are taking
so many pictures these days.

01:09:28.935 --> 01:09:31.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have phones, cameras.

01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re taking lots of pictures.

01:09:33.356 --> 01:09:35.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe you’ve noticed that at one point,

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you take a picture of one of your friends

01:09:37.652 --> 01:09:40.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have kind
of a funny look on their face

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:43.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they are in the middle
of eating something.

01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:47.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you show your friend that picture,
what do they often say?

01:09:47.746 --> 01:09:49.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Could you please delete that?”

01:09:49.914 --> 01:09:54.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not the picture
they want you to show to other people,

01:09:54.085 --> 01:09:56.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s not the picture
you want to show of them.

01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I want you to imagine for a moment

01:09:58.715 --> 01:10:02.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has
a digital photo album of you.

01:10:04.137 --> 01:10:07.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which pictures do you think
he’s keeping there?

01:10:07.474 --> 01:10:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones where we made serious mistakes?

01:10:10.393 --> 01:10:13.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones where we did something dumb?

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:10:14.981 --> 01:10:19.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on your repentance
and the ransom sacrifice, those are deleted.

01:10:19.569 --> 01:10:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re gone.

01:10:21.571 --> 01:10:25.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has in his photo album of you
the beautiful pictures

01:10:25.992 --> 01:10:28.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the beautiful moments
that he’s proud of when

01:10:28.661 --> 01:10:32.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you showed your faith in action.

01:10:32.123 --> 01:10:36.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants to reward your faith.

01:10:36.336 --> 01:10:40.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:6,

01:10:40.965 --> 01:10:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see how Jehovah
feels about his servants

01:10:44.427 --> 01:10:48.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by what he says here about rewarding them.

01:10:48.014 --> 01:10:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:6:

01:10:51.559 --> 01:10:53.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, without faith

01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:56.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

01:10:56.606 --> 01:10:59.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must believe that he is
and that he becomes the rewarder

01:11:03.446 --> 01:11:08.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when listing
all these other examples of faith

01:11:11.454 --> 01:11:13.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there in chapter 11 of Hebrews,

01:11:13.665 --> 01:11:16.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul pauses for a moment

01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:20.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind us that Jehovah
“becomes the rewarder

01:11:20.672 --> 01:11:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you take the time

01:11:26.719 --> 01:11:29.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and effort to build a fire,

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what reward do you get in return?

01:11:32.433 --> 01:11:35.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you get the warmth
and light of that fire.

01:11:35.645 --> 01:11:39.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can keep yourself
and others warm by the fire,

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a fire gives off a beautiful light

01:11:42.944 --> 01:11:46.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be very welcome on a dark night.

01:11:46.156 --> 01:11:48.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sounds of a crackling fire

01:11:48.283 --> 01:11:52.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make us feel safe and happy.

01:11:52.287 --> 01:11:54.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will Jehovah reward

01:11:54.956 --> 01:11:58.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his faithful worshippers
for their fire of faith?

01:11:58.835 --> 01:12:02.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, ultimately, He will reward us
with everlasting life.

01:12:02.964 --> 01:12:06.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During his ministry,
Jesus repeatedly promised

01:12:06.551 --> 01:12:11.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his faithful servants
would get everlasting life.

01:12:11.055 --> 01:12:15.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah provided
the rewards of a wood fire,

01:12:15.393 --> 01:12:19.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also provides many gifts
that come when we build

01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:21.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feed our fire of faith.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider some of the rewards
that Jehovah gives us now.

01:12:25.278 --> 01:12:28.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward of his Word, the Bible,

01:12:28.781 --> 01:12:31.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us the best advice for life.

01:12:31.326 --> 01:12:35.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It lights our way
in a spiritually dark world.

01:12:36.956 --> 01:12:41.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward of the ministry
is the most satisfying work that we can do.

01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward of holy spirit

01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:48.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a powerful helper in times of trials.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you are never alone.

01:12:52.931 --> 01:12:56.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the reward of our loving group

01:12:56.017 --> 01:12:58.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters around the world

01:12:58.186 --> 01:13:01.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a source of great warmth and comfort.

01:13:03.274 --> 01:13:07.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In conclusion,
let’s review our three questions:

01:13:07.153 --> 01:13:11.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) How can you feed your fire of faith?

01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:16.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read and meditate on God’s Word each day.

01:13:16.537 --> 01:13:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) What does it mean to exercise faith?

01:13:20.917 --> 01:13:24.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

01:13:26.506 --> 01:13:31.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) How will Jehovah reward your faith?

01:13:31.386 --> 01:13:33.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everlasting life.

01:13:35.723 --> 01:13:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take note of this day.

01:13:37.767 --> 01:13:40.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember it; write it down.

01:13:40.395 --> 01:13:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time you hear
a baptism talk in the future,

01:13:43.773 --> 01:13:47.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take that opportunity
to reflect on your baptism

01:13:47.318 --> 01:13:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the many blessings that you have received

01:13:50.029 --> 01:13:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the decision that you made

01:13:52.448 --> 01:13:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

01:13:56.452 --> 01:14:00.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants you to be happy
and to enjoy life.

01:14:00.581 --> 01:14:05.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All eight and a half million plus
of your brothers and sisters

01:14:05.128 --> 01:14:09.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are watching this program
are with you in heart and mind,

01:14:09.299 --> 01:14:11.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want you to be happy.

01:14:13.052 --> 01:14:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep clear in mind, though,
that happiness is not something

01:14:16.806 --> 01:14:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can buy for yourself
or get for yourself,

01:14:20.643 --> 01:14:24.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can’t get it by loving yourself.

01:14:24.105 --> 01:14:26.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like warmth and light

01:14:26.524 --> 01:14:29.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are by-products of a wood fire,

01:14:29.319 --> 01:14:33.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so too happiness is a by-product of faith

01:14:33.614 --> 01:14:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love for others and for Jehovah.

01:14:37.618 --> 01:14:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could say that happiness

01:14:39.996 --> 01:14:44.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the warmth and glow from love’s fire.

01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:49.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world will tell you:
“You can follow your dreams.

01:14:49.255 --> 01:14:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be anything you want to be.”

01:14:51.924 --> 01:14:56.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is far better
to let Jehovah dream for you.

01:14:56.888 --> 01:14:59.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your life serving Jehovah

01:14:59.474 --> 01:15:02.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be far greater than anything

01:15:02.435 --> 01:15:05.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could dream up for yourself.

01:15:05.271 --> 01:15:07.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, from this day forward,

01:15:07.857 --> 01:15:10.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be determined to keep feeding

01:15:10.818 --> 01:15:13.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exercising your faith.

01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Ekrann.

01:15:17.658 --> 01:15:19.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again this year,

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the circumstances for baptism
will vary in each location.

01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured that your elders
have made suitable provisions

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:32.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with local circumstances
for candidates to be baptized

01:15:32.006 --> 01:15:34.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the conclusion of this session.

01:15:34.926 --> 01:15:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now let’s sing together song number 79,

01:15:39.389 --> 01:15:42.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Teach Them to Stand Firm.”

01:15:42.058 --> 01:15:44.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song,

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may have the prayer offered
from your own location.

01:15:47.188 --> 01:15:50.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 79.

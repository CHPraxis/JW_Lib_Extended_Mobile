00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:04.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We depend on many powerful man-made things

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver the items that we need.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:11.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a powerful freight train
can climb steep hills

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deliver its freight on time.

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A powerful cargo ship can withstand
high seas and deliver its cargo.

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is a limit
to what man’s ingenuity can do.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to our most crucial needs,
such as true peace,

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real security, and lasting happiness,

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humans promise what they
do not have the power to deliver.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Political, religious,
and financial institutions

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have proved to be untrustworthy.

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With so many promises broken,

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re not surprised that many people
are skeptical about the future.

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in contrast to such failures,

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promises never fail.

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we are made more powerful
when we trust in his promises.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always delivers on his word.

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises to sustain us
through any trials,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how intense they may become.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider Jesus’ example.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No human has faced trials more intense
than what he experienced.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jesus had faith that delivered

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—powerful faith that carried him through.

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With freeness of speech,
Jesus encouraged his followers

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have faith and not to doubt.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on one occasion while traveling
near Bethany with his disciples,

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus used a fig tree
to provide an object lesson

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the need to have faith in God.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in Matthew chapter 21

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that the fig tree
was barren except for leaves.

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:52.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 19 and 20, Jesus said to the tree:

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let no fruit come from you ever again.’

00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:59.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the fig tree withered instantly.”

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as a result, the disciples
were amazed and they asked Jesus:

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:08.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How is it that the fig tree
withered instantly?”

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:13.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read Jesus’ reply to them
in verses 21 and 22,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please keep in mind that Jesus is providing

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an object lesson for them.

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s pull out the lesson about faith

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read verses 21 and 22:

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:30.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In answer Jesus said to them:
‘Truly I say to you,

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you have faith and do not doubt,

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:36.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘not only will you do
what I did to the fig tree,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but even if you say to this mountain,

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,”
it will happen.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And all the things you ask in prayer,
having faith,

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive.’”

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a powerful object lesson on faith,

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in view of the trials
that his disciples would soon experience.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see any more
object lessons in this example?

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another connection
between what happened to the fig tree

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having faith.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the nation of Israel,
like that fig tree,

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a deceptive appearance.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the nation was
in a covenant relationship with God,

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:19.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it proved to be without faith

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:22.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was barren of good fruitage.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It even rejected God’s own Son.

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:28.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by causing
the unproductive fig tree to wither,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus demonstrated
what the end result would be

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:34.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those without faith.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To benefit from this object lesson today,

00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also need to have faith and not doubt.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we will discuss four situations

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that show how prayer, study,

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:53.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation can help us
to rely fully on Jehovah’s promises.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each situation, we will look
at the challenge we face,

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the promise we’ve received,

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our reason for faith in that promise.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:05.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first situation:

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is when we are tempted.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the challenge?

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:15.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge is to avoid
giving in to temptation.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things that can tempt us

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go down a wrong path
and show a lack of faith.

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be tempted by immoral desires

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:26.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that violate God’s laws and principles.

00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:29.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be tempted to set
spiritual interests aside

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pursue material things.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:35.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be tempted to become prideful

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ambitiously try to outdo others.

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:42.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must never allow that to happen.

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:45.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that there are
many things that could tempt us

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:49.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show a lack of faith
and of trust in Jehovah.

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:53.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, there is the challenge;
here is the promise.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see Jehovah’s promise in his Word.

00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is twofold, or two-part,

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:03.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we find it at 1 Corinthians 10:13.

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:07.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read it, look for the promise.

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13:

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:13.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No temptation has come upon you
except what is common to men.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God is faithful,

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:19.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear,

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:23.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but along with the temptation
he will also make the way out

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may be able to endure it.”

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the promise here?

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jehovah will not let us “be tempted

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:34.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond what [we] can bear,” or handle.

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Jehovah will help us.

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:40.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will “make the way out” for us, it said

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:45.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, out of any temptation
if we rely on him.

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:49.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have faith and not doubt.

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:53.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far, we’ve considered
the challenge and the promise.

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s examine our
reason for faith in that promise.

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:00.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our reason for faith is this:

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:03.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows us better
than we know ourselves,

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:08.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Word says
that we can remain faithful.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:11.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Deuteronomy 30:11,

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:14.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told the Israelites
that what he required of them

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:19.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was “not too difficult” nor was it
“beyond [their] reach,” he said.

00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for good reason,

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:24.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he expected them to show faith and to obey.

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:29.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He expects no less of his servants today.

00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some practical steps
that will help us to resist temptations.

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:37.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will list them first,
and then we will look

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:40.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more closely at two of the steps.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray regularly
for the needed strength.

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:46.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, study and meditate

00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:51.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to keep your mind fixed
on Jehovah’s promises.

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:53.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, know your weaknesses.

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:58.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And fourth, avoid situations
that would increase temptation.

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:03.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look more closely
at steps three and four.

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:05.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are the need to know our weaknesses

00:07:05.737 --> 00:07:10.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to avoid situations
that cause temptation for us.

00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:14.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to begin with a chain.

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:16.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a fact that a chain

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:19.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is only as strong as its weakest link, true?

00:07:19.876 --> 00:07:23.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where it is weak
is where it will break first.

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:27.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like a chain, we have weaknesses
that others may not see,

00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:31.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we should know our weaknesses.

00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:33.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make certain that you know yourself

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you know
where you are most vulnerable.

00:07:36.643 --> 00:07:40.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we know our weaknesses,
we know what to guard against.

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:45.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
we know where the weak link is.

00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we know our weaknesses,

00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:50.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re able to stand “firm in the faith.”

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:55.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister said: “When I face temptation,
I reject it immediately.

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:57.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Letting the mind dwell on the possibilities

00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what gets you into trouble
in the first place.”

00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:03.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, again, know your weaknesses

00:08:03.795 --> 00:08:06.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and guard against those weaknesses.

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:09.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another important step that we listed

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:13.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to avoid situations
that increase temptation.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:16.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay away from people
whose speech and conduct

00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make wrongdoing look attractive.

00:08:19.102 --> 00:08:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remove yourself from situations

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:25.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you know
you’re going to face temptations.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surround yourself with friends
who encourage you to do what is right.

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:32.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 22:3 says:

00:08:32.574 --> 00:08:36.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself,

00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:41.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the inexperienced keep right on going
and suffer the consequences.”

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:46.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prove to be shrewd
when we trust that inspired statement

00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid temptation.

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:52.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review of when we are tempted,

00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:55.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we looked at the challenge, the promise,

00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:57.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our reason for faith in that promise.

00:08:57.849 --> 00:09:00.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we considered
what will help us to succeed,

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included the need to pray regularly

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to study and meditate on God’s Word.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:10.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each of the next three situations,

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:12.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will follow the same pattern.

00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:17.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next situation in which we
must rely on Jehovah’s promise

00:09:17.452 --> 00:09:21.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to do with when we face opposition.

00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:26.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the challenge:
Avoid compromising under pressure.

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:31.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt all of us think at times about how
we would handle various problems

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may eventually confront us.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such mental exercises can be helpful,

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:39.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided that we remember that Jehovah

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:42.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will always be with us
when we are doing his will,

00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:45.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which brings us to his promise

00:09:45.439 --> 00:09:48.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will give us his holy spirit

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:50.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can endure opposition.

00:09:50.694 --> 00:09:54.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is one who trusted in that promise.

00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:57.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also urged his followers to remain calm

00:09:57.784 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show trust.

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what he said at Luke 12:11, 12.

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:07.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we read Jesus’ words,

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:09.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have in mind that the scribes
and the Pharisees

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were putting extreme pressure
on him with many questions

00:10:13.592 --> 00:10:17.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an effort to use Jesus’ words against him.

00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:19.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they failed.

00:10:19.848 --> 00:10:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus here gives
assurance that, like him,

00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:26.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too will succeed when persecution comes

00:10:26.563 --> 00:10:29.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have faith and do not doubt.

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:33.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 12:11, 12, Jesus said:

00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:36.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they bring you
in before public assemblies,

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“government officials, and authorities,

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:43.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not become anxious about how
or what you will speak in defense

00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:45.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or what you will say,

00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:49.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the holy spirit will
teach you in that very hour

00:10:49.002 --> 00:10:51.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the things you should say.”

00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:54.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we receive the benefits

00:10:54.883 --> 00:10:58.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this promise when opposition comes?

00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:01.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By listening carefully to Jesus’ words there:

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:03.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not become anxious.”

00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:08.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said to remain calm,
“for the holy spirit will teach you.”

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show trust.

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:14.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is the greatest example of one

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:17.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lived by those very words,
and we can too.

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:20.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it takes faith.

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:23.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, again, we’ve looked
at the challenge and the promise.

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:26.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s examine our reason for faith

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:29.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that promise, and it is this:

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:32.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is more powerful

00:11:32.587 --> 00:11:37.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—infinitely more powerful—
than any opposer.

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:40.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three things all centered on Jehovah

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us to face
persecution and opposition.

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:49.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray regularly, and when doing so,

00:11:49.187 --> 00:11:51.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
express your fears to Jehovah

00:11:51.856 --> 00:11:54.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for the “peace of God.”

00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:59.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the book of Lamentations,
the inspired writer urged God’s people

00:11:59.072 --> 00:12:02.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “pour out [their] heart like water.”

00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:04.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Water can flow quickly,

00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:08.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like water flowing out of a large bucket,

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:12.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should not hold back
when praying to our heavenly Father,

00:12:12.627 --> 00:12:17.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially whenever we are faced
with opposition and persecution.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pour out your heart to him,

00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:23.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah promises that he will help you.

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:26.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have faith in Jehovah’s power

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us and trust in that promise.

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:32.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said: “Do not become anxious.”

00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:37.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith will help us
to avoid such anxiety.

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:41.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we are also helped
to face opposition when we study

00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:43.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on God’s Word.

00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:48.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daily Bible reading helps to strengthen
our conviction that Jehovah loves us

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:51.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will never abandon us.

00:12:51.082 --> 00:12:55.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on his tender qualities
as you read his words.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feel Jehovah’s love for you
in the things that he says and does.

00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:05.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you meditate on the words
and works of Jehovah,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on your own
experience in his service.

00:13:09.142 --> 00:13:12.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll likely be able to list
many things that our heavenly Father

00:13:12.812 --> 00:13:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has done for you
since you started to serve him.

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:21.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Bible reading and meditation
draw us closer to Jehovah,

00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:24.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Source of strength.

00:13:24.115 --> 00:13:26.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the more your confidence in him grows,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stronger your bond with him will become

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:32.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the stronger your faith
in him will become.

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, related to what we just mentioned,

00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:38.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a third thing that will help you
when opposition comes

00:13:38.421 --> 00:13:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to reflect on how Jehovah
has helped you through trials in the past,

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:46.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is exactly what David did.

00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:49.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 18:6, he said:

00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:53.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In my distress I called on Jehovah,

00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:55.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to my God I kept crying for help.

00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:59.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From his temple he heard my voice,

00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:03.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my cry to him for help reached his ears.”

00:14:03.655 --> 00:14:06.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did David recall Jehovah’s help?

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he did.

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He heard my voice,” David said,

00:14:10.578 --> 00:14:14.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and my cry to him
for help reached his ears.”

00:14:14.582 --> 00:14:17.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David not only remembered what had happened

00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he had faith that Jehovah heard him.

00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was still putting that blessing to work

00:14:24.134 --> 00:14:28.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he never forgot
all that Jehovah had done for him.

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:32.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you know that Jehovah has helped you

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:34.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when you just know it—

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:37.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget it.

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:39.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show gratitude when we remember,

00:14:39.774 --> 00:14:42.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and such experiences strengthen us

00:14:42.318 --> 00:14:44.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face the trials yet ahead of us.

00:14:46.114 --> 00:14:49.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, so far we’ve
considered the need for faith

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:53.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are tempted
and when we face opposition.

00:14:53.246 --> 00:14:58.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we will again follow
the same pattern with the third situation:

00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are afflicted with illness.

00:15:01.504 --> 00:15:03.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the challenge?

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:08.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge we face when we are
seriously ill is to avoid questioning

00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:11.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Jehovah will care for us.

00:15:11.848 --> 00:15:16.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must continue to remind
ourselves that Jehovah loves us

00:15:16.811 --> 00:15:19.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will never abandon us.

00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:21.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the promise:

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:25.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will sustain
his loyal ones who are sick.

00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:27.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that promise
is not just a general feeling

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you get from reading his Word.

00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:32.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That promise is a clear statement

00:15:32.577 --> 00:15:35.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Psalm 41:3.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to read it at Psalm 41:3.

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:43.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it a promise to cure us?

00:15:43.338 --> 00:15:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says:

00:15:45.465 --> 00:15:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed;

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:53.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during his sickness
you will completely change his bed.”

00:15:54.974 --> 00:15:58.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah use the word “cure” here?

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:01.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he said “sustain.”

00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:03.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will sustain [us].”

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:06.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The cure will come later.

00:16:06.528 --> 00:16:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his promise to sustain
his servants is a promise that we can trust.

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is our reason for faith in that promise:

00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:18.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah has compassion

00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:23.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who are disadvantaged
by poor health, among other things.

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:25.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 1 of that same psalm,

00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:29.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are assured that Jehovah
will rescue “the lowly one.”

00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:32.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah makes a similar loving expression

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 57:15.

00:16:35.682 --> 00:16:37.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he says:

00:16:37.684 --> 00:16:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reside in the high and holy place,

00:16:40.937 --> 00:16:44.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also with those
crushed and lowly in spirit,

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:47.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to revive the spirit of the lowly [one]

00:16:47.694 --> 00:16:52.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to revive the heart
of those being crushed.”

00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reside in the . . . holy place,” he said,

00:16:55.618 --> 00:17:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also with those
crushed and lowly in spirit.”

00:17:00.623 --> 00:17:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cares deeply for us, doesn’t he?

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his compassion, he draws close
to his faithful ones who are ill.

00:17:09.465 --> 00:17:13.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But while we should have faith
that Jehovah will sustain us

00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:17.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that is true, of course,
whenever we face serious illness),

00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:21.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what steps must we take to cope?

00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:24.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three things
that we can do to work along

00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s loving support.

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:30.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray regularly for practical wisdom

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with your illness.

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:35.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:6 says:

00:17:35.491 --> 00:17:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep asking in faith, not doubting at all.”

00:17:39.996 --> 00:17:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, Jesus said:
“Have faith and do not doubt.”

00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:48.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister with strong faith
saw the need to do her part

00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:51.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she found out
that she was seriously ill.

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:53.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said:

00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:57.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I learned that I had
cancer in my lung and colon,

00:17:57.055 --> 00:18:00.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I thought that I had
just received a death sentence.

00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But after I got home
from the doctor, I thought,

00:18:03.394 --> 00:18:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘OK, it’s not what I expected,

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I have to find a way to deal with this.’”

00:18:09.692 --> 00:18:11.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did she do?

00:18:11.778 --> 00:18:15.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She prayed
—and not just any prayer.

00:18:15.573 --> 00:18:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says: “I never pray, ‘Make me better.’

00:18:19.702 --> 00:18:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I always pray,

00:18:21.704 --> 00:18:25.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Help me to be strong
and endure my illness.’”

00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:27.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beautiful example.

00:18:27.293 --> 00:18:32.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sister understands
Psalm 41:3, doesn’t she?

00:18:32.298 --> 00:18:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do not recover from an illness,

00:18:35.134 --> 00:18:39.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have faith that the cure
is coming in God’s new world.

00:18:39.764 --> 00:18:43.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
we also have faith in Jehovah’s promise

00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will sustain us
through any trial, any illness.

00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will “change [our] bed,”
as the verse said,

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:55.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that Jehovah
will see to it that our sickbed

00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:57.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not be one of hopelessness.

00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:02.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we will endure with faith and hope.

00:19:02.787 --> 00:19:07.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have found that their
greatest comfort comes from heartfelt prayer

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from reading such
comforting passages in God’s Word.

00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:14.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this,
Jehovah will give us strength

00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:18.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will bring
comforting thoughts to our mind.

00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:21.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to the second thing
that we can do

00:19:21.639 --> 00:19:25.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work along with Jehovah’s promise
and his loving support,

00:19:25.518 --> 00:19:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is this: Study and meditate
on Jehovah’s promises

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to strengthen your conviction

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:37.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world where you
will have perfect health.

00:19:37.572 --> 00:19:39.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That time is coming,

00:19:39.574 --> 00:19:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Isaiah 33:24 foretells:

00:19:43.494 --> 00:19:46.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can meditate
on such wonderful promises

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:55.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only if we take the time to read them.

00:19:55.339 --> 00:20:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take time to read
a portion of God’s Word every day.

00:20:00.344 --> 00:20:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give close attention to the Psalms

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:06.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to what Jesus did
during his earthly ministry.

00:20:06.476 --> 00:20:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such accounts provide
real-life examples not only of coping

00:20:10.938 --> 00:20:14.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also of godly compassion
for those who are ill.

00:20:14.901 --> 00:20:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also have such real-life examples
of compassion among us today.

00:20:19.822 --> 00:20:24.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the third thing that those
who are afflicted with illness can do

00:20:24.035 --> 00:20:27.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is benefit from association
with fellow believers

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:30.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the extent possible.

00:20:30.124 --> 00:20:32.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve come to appreciate this even more

00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:36.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after living through a pandemic,
isn’t that true?

00:20:36.464 --> 00:20:40.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister who has coped
with serious illness says this:

00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:42.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not isolate yourself.

00:20:42.386 --> 00:20:44.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Allow friends to help you.

00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There may be times when you feel alone,

00:20:47.141 --> 00:20:50.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t isolate yourself.”

00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s wise advice,
and it is Scriptural advice.

00:20:54.857 --> 00:20:58.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always remember that the love
we see among Jehovah’s people

00:20:58.945 --> 00:21:03.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just a reflection
of how he feels about us.

00:21:03.449 --> 00:21:06.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, he gave us
the ability to love others,

00:21:06.953 --> 00:21:11.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his people show that godlike love
for one another every day.

00:21:11.749 --> 00:21:16.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put your faith
in Jehovah’s sustaining power.

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put your faith
in the comfort from the Scriptures

00:21:19.882 --> 00:21:24.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the loving support
of family and friends.

00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:28.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put your faith in Jehovah’s sure promises,

00:21:28.474 --> 00:21:32.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hold on to the assurance
that life is worth living,

00:21:32.687 --> 00:21:36.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when you are afflicted
with a serious illness.

00:21:38.151 --> 00:21:41.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all that we have considered
about Jehovah’s promises,

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that faith is the essential quality
that we need to have.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need faith when we are tempted,
faith when we face opposition,

00:21:50.913 --> 00:21:55.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith when we are afflicted
with serious illness.

00:21:55.126 --> 00:21:59.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also need faith
when we face economic hardship.

00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:04.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, we must have certain things
to survive from day to day

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:08.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to continue on in our service to Jehovah.

00:22:08.723 --> 00:22:11.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is, How well do we cope

00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:14.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when getting the necessities of life

00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:16.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becomes difficult for us?

00:22:16.397 --> 00:22:20.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Food, clothing, shelter,
transportation, and so forth

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you see, when these things
become hard to get,

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:24.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can cause anxiety.

00:22:24.614 --> 00:22:26.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a fact.
It can.

00:22:26.699 --> 00:22:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And avoiding such anxiety
is a challenge we may face.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we ever face that challenge,
what must we call to our mind?

00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:37.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promise.

00:22:37.668 --> 00:22:41.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises that if we
put the Kingdom first,

00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:44.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will provide the things that we need.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have faith in that promise

00:22:47.136 --> 00:22:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—strong faith in that promise.

00:22:50.223 --> 00:22:53.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a promise that Jesus
made very clear for us.

00:22:53.643 --> 00:22:56.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Son understood
that in this system of things,

00:22:56.479 --> 00:23:00.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
economic hardship would
sometimes befall God’s people.

00:23:00.274 --> 00:23:04.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he made it a point to include
some comments about this challenge

00:23:04.528 --> 00:23:07.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his well-known Sermon on the Mount.

00:23:07.323 --> 00:23:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But along with the challenge,

00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:12.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provided Jehovah’s promise.

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:16.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along
as we read Matthew chapter 6

00:23:16.249 --> 00:23:18.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 33

00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:20.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:33.

00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus lived as a human,

00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:27.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s a point we want to keep in mind

00:23:27.843 --> 00:23:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we get ready to read this verse.

00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He grew up in a hardworking family.

00:23:33.683 --> 00:23:37.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that acquiring
the necessities of life

00:23:37.144 --> 00:23:39.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not always come easy for them,

00:23:39.772 --> 00:23:44.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they trusted in Jehovah,
and they had what they needed to serve him.

00:23:44.235 --> 00:23:48.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what Jesus later
said here at Matthew 6:33,

00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:50.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said as a real person

00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:53.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a human—
who knew what people faced at times.

00:23:53.577 --> 00:23:58.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that context, he had just urged
his listeners to stop being anxious

00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:01.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to trust in Jehovah’s ability
to help them.

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:05.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he gave the promise in verse 33:

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:09.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on, then,” he said, “seeking first
the Kingdom and his righteousness,

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all these other things

00:24:12.263 --> 00:24:14.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be added to you.”

00:24:16.183 --> 00:24:18.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conviction in that statement

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:20.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be added”

00:24:20.813 --> 00:24:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stems from the certainty of the promise.

00:24:24.734 --> 00:24:29.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cannot lie, and his Son does not lie.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we put the interests of the Kingdom first,

00:24:32.908 --> 00:24:37.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will experience the blessings
that come from that promise.

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:41.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many reasons
to have faith in those words.

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:44.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider: Jehovah provides daily

00:24:44.003 --> 00:24:47.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the needs of plants and of birds.

00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:50.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how much more
so for his faithful servants!

00:24:50.718 --> 00:24:54.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that this is true
not only because the Scriptures tell us so

00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:57.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also because we see it for ourselves.

00:24:57.641 --> 00:25:01.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 6:26-29,

00:25:01.312 --> 00:25:05.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before urging his disciples
to put the Kingdom first,

00:25:05.316 --> 00:25:10.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus invited them to “observe intently
the birds of heaven.”

00:25:10.321 --> 00:25:12.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:25:12.323 --> 00:25:15.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he want his disciples to see?

00:25:15.701 --> 00:25:19.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted them to see
how our heavenly Father cares

00:25:19.205 --> 00:25:21.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those little creatures

00:25:21.207 --> 00:25:25.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how he looks after them
and sees that they have their daily food.

00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:27.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have what they need.

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:30.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Birds do not spend
their days feeling anxious,

00:25:30.383 --> 00:25:32.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neither should we.

00:25:32.385 --> 00:25:37.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus rhetorically asked:
“Are you not worth more than they are?”

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:42.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such lessons remind us
that we should trust Jehovah’s promise

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:46.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his ability and desire to keep it.

00:25:46.148 --> 00:25:50.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned from Jesus’ Sermon
on the Mount that real happiness and security

00:25:50.778 --> 00:25:53.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not depend on material things.

00:25:53.489 --> 00:25:57.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What matters is our friendship
with our heavenly Father.

00:25:57.493 --> 00:25:59.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are the lessons.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in practical terms,

00:26:01.622 --> 00:26:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you avoid anxiety
over economic hardship?

00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:08.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember to pray continually.

00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:13.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When anxiety takes hold of a person,
he or she might overlook things

00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:16.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they normally would never overlook.

00:26:16.011 --> 00:26:19.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep praying,
and have faith in Jehovah’s promise.

00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:22.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He listens to our prayers.

00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:27.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And pray just as Jesus taught us,
not for financial security,

00:26:27.398 --> 00:26:32.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for our daily needs,
“our bread for this day,” as he said.

00:26:32.027 --> 00:26:34.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And along with prayer,

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:37.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to study and meditate
on God’s Word each day.

00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:42.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This too can be overlooked
when one feels overwhelmed.

00:26:42.079 --> 00:26:44.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let that happen to you.

00:26:44.331 --> 00:26:46.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will see your effort,

00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:50.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will bless you for relying on him.

00:26:50.004 --> 00:26:52.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Study and meditate in order
to strengthen your conviction

00:26:52.923 --> 00:26:55.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will take care of you.

00:26:55.176 --> 00:26:58.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promises to do so.

00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:01.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of this,
don’t forget your past blessings.

00:27:01.765 --> 00:27:05.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah sustained
his people in the past,

00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:08.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on how Jehovah has helped you.

00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:10.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has not changed.

00:27:10.065 --> 00:27:13.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use that experience to build up
your faith and your conviction

00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:18.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will go on helping you
through difficult times.

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:24.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a largely faithless
and skeptical world, isn’t that true?

00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:29.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need faith, and when we have it,
we must keep it strong.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:33.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we have faith
in Jehovah’s promises and do not doubt,

00:27:33.547 --> 00:27:37.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are helped to face
whatever may come our way.

00:27:37.384 --> 00:27:40.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are helped when we are tempted,

00:27:40.012 --> 00:27:42.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we face opposition,

00:27:42.431 --> 00:27:44.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are afflicted with illness,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we experience economic hardship.

00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:51.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these critical last days,

00:27:51.315 --> 00:27:55.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us—each one of us—
needs to keep growing in faith.

00:27:55.778 --> 00:28:00.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cultivate the yearning that Jesus’ apostles
had toward growing in faith.

00:28:00.199 --> 00:28:03.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see their desire
in what they said to Jesus

00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:08.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 17:5

00:28:08.332 --> 00:28:09.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Luke 17:5.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:11.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to that verse,

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will also read
Jesus’ reply to them in verse 6.

00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:21.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After hearing Jesus warn
about those who caused stumbling,

00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:23.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read starting in verse 5:

00:28:23.556 --> 00:28:28.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The apostles said to the Lord:
‘Give us more faith.’

00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:33.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the Lord said: ‘If you had faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you would say to this black mulberry tree,

00:28:36.318 --> 00:28:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Be uprooted and planted in the sea!”

00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:42.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it would obey you.’”

00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:44.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words:

00:28:44.243 --> 00:28:48.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have faith and do not doubt,”
he was telling them.

00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:51.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it is extremely unlikely

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:55.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will ever need
to command a black mulberry tree

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:58.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to uproot itself and be planted in the sea.

00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:01.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what was Jesus’ point?

00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:05.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is this: We are powerful by faith.

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:08.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Challenges that may seem equally impossible

00:29:08.934 --> 00:29:13.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been overcome,
or defeated, by our faith in God’s power.

00:29:13.856 --> 00:29:18.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith helps us to conquer
any temptation that we face,

00:29:18.694 --> 00:29:23.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith helps us to defeat
any opposition that rises up against us,

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:28.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith sustains us through
any illness we may experience,

00:29:28.412 --> 00:29:32.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith strengthens us to trust
in Jehovah’s promise to support us

00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:34.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during economic hardship.

00:29:34.877 --> 00:29:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, uproot the mulberry tree,
and plant it in the sea.

00:29:40.716 --> 00:29:43.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we considered in each of those situations,

00:29:43.844 --> 00:29:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we reviewed how prayer, study,

00:29:46.722 --> 00:29:50.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation will help us
to stay close to Jehovah,

00:29:50.392 --> 00:29:53.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One who will grant us more faith.

00:29:53.604 --> 00:29:56.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for it each day.

00:29:56.148 --> 00:29:59.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate examples of faith found in God’s Word

00:29:59.943 --> 00:30:03.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as those serving along with us today.

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:08.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain focused on Jehovah
who fulfills all of his promises,

00:30:08.369 --> 00:30:10.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will bless your efforts

00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:14.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have faith and not to doubt.

00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:04.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our life experience,
there are many people we do not forget

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:06.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both good and bad.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those we delight to call to mind,
or remember,

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the people most important
and most loved to us.

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is true of Jehovah as well.

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows everyone who has ever lived
—righteous and unrighteous—

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will resurrect millions of them.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what he finds the greatest delight in

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is remembering those with strong faith
who became his friends,

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including many faithful women.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Word is filled with accounts of women
who had strong faith.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will consider
faithful women from the past

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with various backgrounds.

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will learn why they needed faith,

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they showed faith,

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how all of us can imitate their faith.

00:00:56.577 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin with the faithful woman, Sarah.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah needed faith.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because like her husband, Abraham,

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah accepted a nomadic lifestyle

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah directed them to do so.

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:8 says of Abraham

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “by faith [he] . . . obeyed
by going out to a place

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that] he was to receive
as an inheritance . . . ,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although not knowing where he was going.”

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was true for Abraham
was true for Sarah as well.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with Abraham, she complied
with Jehovah’s direction

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she left the prosperous city of Ur.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She no doubt had
to leave behind her relatives

00:01:41.914 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as material advantages.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Genesis 12:1
that Abraham was told:

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go out from your land
and away from your relatives.”

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:57.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such moves are never easy.

00:01:57.763 --> 00:01:59.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, moving is known to be

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the most stressful things
that people must do at times,

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:06.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when it involves moving away

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from friends and relatives.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Sarah needed faith, and she had it.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She cooperated with her husband’s direction,

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:21.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which meant accepting
a completely different way of life.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her obedience revealed
her strong faith in Jehovah.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:32.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine the challenges that Sarah faced.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in Ur was comfortable.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all the modern conveniences.

00:02:39.513 --> 00:02:43.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah gave us
an assignment we never expected

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one that meant saying goodbye
to the life we loved.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather than look behind,

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:53.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham and I looked ahead.

00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had seen Jehovah’s hand in our lives,

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:59.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we knew he would be with us

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every step of the journey.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was in ways that surprised us

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ways we never could have imagined.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah did more than help us;

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:14.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he fulfilled his every promise.

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As accurately depicted in that video,
how did Sarah show faith?

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed faith by looking ahead.

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also reflected on what Jehovah
had already done for them.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham and Sarah had seen
Jehovah’s hand in their lives.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were his friends.

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had obeyed before,
and Jehovah had confidence

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their obedience now.

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a woman of strong faith,

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah trusted that Jehovah would continue
to be with them in their new assignment.

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:54.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She willingly gave up the comforts
and conveniences of Ur,

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her faith in God did not go unrewarded.

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, she received a blessing
that she never could have anticipated.

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah’s faith in Jehovah
led to the birth of Isaac.

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:10.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What made this blessing especially remarkable

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is described for us at Hebrews 11:11, 12.

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read those verses.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 11

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:22.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lists a number of faithful servants of God.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah is mentioned along with Abraham.

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read starting in verse 11,

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the focus is on faith:

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:36.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith also Sarah received power
to conceive offspring,

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even when she was past the age,

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since she considered Him faithful
who made the promise.

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:47.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this reason, from one man
who was as good as dead,

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:52.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there were born children,
as many as the stars of heaven in number

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as innumerable
as the sands by the seaside.”

00:04:57.568 --> 00:04:59.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what remarkable blessing

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:03.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did Sarah receive as a result of her faith?

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:05.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “power to conceive offspring,

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when she was past the age,” it said.

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:13.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how specifically did she show faith?

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed faith
because “she considered Him faithful

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had made the promise.”

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:21.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah had faith in Jehovah’s promise

00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:24.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Abraham would become the father to many.

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham needed faith, but so did Sarah.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because they both had such faith,
verse 12 says:

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this reason, . . .
there were born children.”

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:38.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some might say,
‘But I recall from the Scriptures

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:41.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Sarah laughed when she heard
that she would give birth?’

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:42.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was that because she lacked faith?

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read a moment ago
that Sarah considered Jehovah faithful.

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:52.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, she trusted him.

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happened?

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, evidently, the thought
of giving birth at her age

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
struck her as being so unusual

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she could not hold back
from laughing to herself.

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while she was only all too human,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was undeniably a woman of strong faith.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years later, Sarah’s faith
in Jehovah’s promise concerning Isaac

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:16.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved her to speak up when 5-year-old Isaac

00:06:16.104 --> 00:06:18.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was persecuted, or bullied,

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:20.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by 19-year-old Ishmael.

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:24.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She saw a real threat
to the well-being of Isaac,

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:28.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her faith reminded her
that Isaac was more than just her son.

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:31.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was assigned a key role
in Jehovah’s purpose.

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:36.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she mustered up courage
and spoke up in his defense.

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:40.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith helps us to do many things.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:45.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
take note of how a husband and wife

00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:48.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show faith like that of Abraham and Sarah.

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:58.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying goodbye

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is never easy.

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:05.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we were excited
about our new LDC assignment,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was going to take us farther
than we’d ever been.

00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:24.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just a new routine;

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:27.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a whole new way of life!

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each new move and project,

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we thought about Sarah.

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:48.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She focused on the good things ahead

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:52.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not on what she’d left behind.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:56.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what we tried to do.

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:33.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been so good to us.

00:09:04.606 --> 00:09:08.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t always know
where the next project would take us,

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:12.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we did know that Jehovah would be with us

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every step of the way.

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:24.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As demonstrated in that video,

00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can strengthen our faith

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by meditating on Jehovah’s goodness
to his people in the past

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:34.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his goodness to his people today.

00:09:34.803 --> 00:09:38.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to meditate
on how Jehovah has helped you

00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:42.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’ve made sacrifices in his service.

00:09:42.602 --> 00:09:45.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the sister in the video stated,

00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:49.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Sarah focused on the good things ahead

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:51.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not on what she had left behind.’

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:55.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show faith like that of Sarah’s

when we support the decisions that are made

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by God’s organization today.

00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:03.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate Sarah’s faith,

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow Jehovah’s direction closely.

00:10:07.377 --> 00:10:10.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we are obedient to Jehovah’s direction,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then as Hebrews 13:17 states,

00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers may carry out
their responsibilities

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:20.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with joy and not with sighing.”

00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:22.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For married sisters, this means

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:26.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
displaying a Sarah-like spirit
in their marriage.

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:30.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Christian wife respects
and supports her husband

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:32.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in doing Jehovah’s will.

00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:35.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter wrote that such a spirit

00:10:35.238 --> 00:10:38.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has “great value in the eyes of God.”

00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:41.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of the many ways
in which sisters today

00:10:41.786 --> 00:10:44.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
display faith like Sarah’s?

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:47.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many Christian women of strong faith

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:51.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are supportive of their husbands
in the circuit work.

00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:53.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many others leave family behind

00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:57.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when accepting an assignment
from Local/Design Construction

00:10:57.552 --> 00:11:00.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many sisters serving at Bethel

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do so far away from their families.

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:10.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is true of single sisters as well.

00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:15.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these, and many more,
show Sarah-like faith

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:18.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by trusting in Jehovah’s loving care

00:11:18.281 --> 00:11:22.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making themselves available
in his service.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident that Jehovah sees
these acts of faith.

00:11:27.415 --> 00:11:29.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:16 says

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:32.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:37.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So see their example,
and imitate their faith.

00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:42.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother James Mantz,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
in this symposium,

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!—Rahab.”

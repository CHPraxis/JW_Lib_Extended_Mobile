00:00:01.438 --> 00:00:03.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us around the world

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:06.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoice with you baptismal candidates.

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:09.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a very special occasion for you.

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, you will join millions
of your brothers and sisters

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very special relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to imagine for a moment

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re in a very large stadium

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are eight and a half million
of your brothers and sisters

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:29.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all in this stadium clapping and so happy

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:33.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the stand
you’re taking for Jehovah today.

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you are young ones
that are raised in the truth,

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re sitting
with your parents and family.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you may have known
the truth years ago

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:44.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have recently returned to Jehovah.

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others may have learned the truth recently

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:52.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, even under these unusual circumstances
of a pandemic and Zoom meetings,

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have come to the point
of dedicating your life to Jehovah.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:59.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever your circumstances,

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:04.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are so happy that you’ve made
the decision to get baptized.

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the theme of our talk
with you baptism candidates

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Exercising Faith Means Everlasting Life!”

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are two key words here:
exercising and faith.

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is your trust and confidence

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah and his promises.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And exercising your faith

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is living your life to do God’s will.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve shown your faith

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by working hard to qualify for baptism today.

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, faith is a little bit like
building a wood fire.

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to build a fire,

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you first have to collect
some small pieces of wood.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, later, you need to have on hand
some larger pieces of wood

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:52.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the fire going.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, your baptism today

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the start of your fire of faith.

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s not easy to start a fire at times.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wood may be wet.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wind keeps blowing out your flame.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:08.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, it may not have been easy for you

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the fire of your faith started.

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have taken the time and effort

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build your fire of faith.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you need to keep
that fire of faith burning.

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because our faith can become weak

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless we work to keep it strong.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On one occasion, Jesus said to some
of his disciples that they had little faith.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that at Matthew 17:20.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 17:20:

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:
‘Because of your little faith.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For truly I say to you,

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:56.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will say to this mountain,
“Move from here to there,”

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will move,
and nothing will be impossible for you.’”

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was letting them know

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they needed
to make their faith stronger.

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after a fire gets started,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can often get very large and very hot.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if there’s no wood added to the fire,
what happens?

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It soon goes out
and turns to just cold ashes.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in order for us to keep
our fire of faith burning,

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to keep feeding it.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, your fire of faith

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs constant attention
to keep burning hot and bright.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three questions:

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) How can you feed your fire of faith?

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) How will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we answer those questions, though,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will talk to two baptized Witnesses

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have taken steps
to make their faith stronger.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk to Jouni Palmu.

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:11.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Palmu and his wife, Heli,
serve at Bethel in Finland.

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has faithfully served
Jehovah for 60 years.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:17.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want you to note
what helped Brother Palmu

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:22.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face a test of his faith
early in his pioneering.

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Palmu, can you recall a time
when you had little faith?

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:30.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I can recall.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:32.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 17, I moved

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as an auxiliary pioneer

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:40.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an isolated group far away from my home.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There I faced very religious people
who were convinced

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:48.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we Witnesses were wrong

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:51.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was badly misled.

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked questions about scriptures

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never encountered in my former territory.

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:02.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people were very convincing

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:05.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their arguments,
and I felt confused and lost.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:10.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked myself,
‘Are there other questions too

00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:12.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I don’t have answers to?’

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:16.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this started, little by little,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bothering me and tested my faith.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:25.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there you were, young and isolated,
with all those questions.

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:28.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have bound volumes,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no <i>Watchtower Library</i>,
or those kinds of tools.

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wrote a letter to my fleshly brothers

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who at that time were in prison

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of refusing military service.

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:49.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that they had
all of our literature there,

00:05:49.703 --> 00:05:52.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were studying every day

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible, like scholars.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They saw my situation,

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:02.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they sent me a letter with answers

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:04.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all my questions.

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:08.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy and thanked Jehovah.

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really strengthened my faith.

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:16.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used your brothers
in prison to help you.

00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:20.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you think you benefited
from strengthening your faith?

00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience was decisive

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:27.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a hallmark to my whole spiritual life.

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:31.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood the value of accurate knowledge,

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:35.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I started to collect a library of my own.

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:39.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still have my early library,

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:43.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to me, it is something very special.

00:06:43.298 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience happened 56 years ago,

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and since then,
I have not had any such doubts.

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:56.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us all
the answers we need to know.

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:58.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:03.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there are questions we don’t have
answers to at the moment,

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:06.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have faith that they will be answered

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:09.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah in his due time.

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:12.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Palmu.

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:14.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your experience really helps us to appreciate

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible’s answers
to life’s most complex questions.

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:24.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we can talk to Frankie Brown.

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:28.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Brown and his wife, Karen,
serve at Bethel in the United States.

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want you to pay close attention
to what helped Brother Brown

00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:35.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the decision
to dedicate his life to Jehovah.

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:39.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Brown, can you recall a time
when you had little faith?

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:42.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until the age of 12,

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:46.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised by my grandmother,
who studied with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:48.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how I was introduced to the truth,

00:07:48.322 --> 00:07:50.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I studied off and on growing up.

00:07:50.824 --> 00:07:53.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 17, like many young people,

00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:57.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I faced the decision of what
to do with my life after school.

00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:01.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many around me just assumed
I’d go off to college and pursue a career.

00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, from my study of the Bible,

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:08.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I had another choice to make
—to serve Jehovah.

00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a big decision for me.

00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:13.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, I had no idea what I wanted to do.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was inexperienced and unsure
about whose advice to take

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:20.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible’s
or that of well-meaning family and friends.

00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s quite a challenging decision
for you at that age to make.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:08:27.778 --> 00:08:31.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to know Jehovah better

00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:33.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what was involved in serving him.

00:08:33.116 --> 00:08:37.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I resumed my Bible study
and attendance at Christian meetings.

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:39.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also began to do personal study.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One personal study project was Psalm 119.

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:45.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This beautiful psalm
helped me to view Jehovah

00:08:45.462 --> 00:08:47.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the loving Father I never had.

00:08:47.923 --> 00:08:50.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also helped me to see the wisdom

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of living in harmony
with the Bible’s standards.

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:57.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Psalm 119:99 says:

00:08:57.015 --> 00:09:00.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have more insight than all my teachers,

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:03.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I ponder over your reminders.”

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:06.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Essentially, the psalmist was saying

00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:09.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was his Guidance Counselor.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, I’ve benefited from the good example

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:15.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers
and sisters in my congregation.

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:20.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had already made the decision
to serve Jehovah, and from their life,

00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was obvious they were truly happy
and had a meaningful life.

00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:27.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convinced me that serving Jehovah

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:30.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best way to use my life.

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:33.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thank Jehovah for their good example

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:38.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for their efforts to help me
at a time when I needed more faith.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your personal study and help
from the brothers and sisters

00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:44.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your congregation really helped you.

00:09:44.688 --> 00:09:48.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you think you benefited
from strengthening your faith?

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:51.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized, started pioneering,

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some years later was invited to Bethel.

00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:57.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From my youth onward, I have found security

00:09:57.659 --> 00:10:00.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stability
in my relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:04.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look back on my decision
to dedicate my life to Jehovah,

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:08.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without a doubt that’s
the best decision I’ve ever made.

00:10:08.462 --> 00:10:12.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old,
Jehovah will not let you down

00:10:12.048 --> 00:10:14.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you need him the most.

00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:15.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Brown.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made a good choice.

00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:21.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to our three questions.

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:23.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider our first question:

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:27.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:31.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible is our main source of fuel

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed the fire of our faith.

00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:38.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To feed the fire of our faith,
we need to do two things.

00:10:38.116 --> 00:10:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to read God’s Word
and meditate on it.

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:44.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, reading God’s Word

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:47.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like adding wood to our fire,

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:51.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation
is a lot like fanning the flames.

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss these one at a time.

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s use the example

00:10:57.093 --> 00:11:00.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the psalmist at Psalm

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:04.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 1, verses 1-3.

00:11:04.142 --> 00:11:07.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 1:1-3:

00:11:09.564 --> 00:11:11.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is the man who does not walk

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the advice of the wicked

00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:17.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and does not stand on the path of sinners

00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:20.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and does not sit in the seat of scoffers.

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:23.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But his delight is in the law of Jehovah,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he reads His law in an undertone

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“day and night.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will be like a tree planted
by streams of water,

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:35.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a tree that produces fruit in its season,

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the foliage of which does not wither.

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:41.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everything he does will succeed.”

00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:45.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we want to be like
that man in this psalm.

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:48.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His delight is in the law of Jehovah.”

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we find delight, or pleasure,
in reading God’s Word,

00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:57.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not like we have to read God’s Word,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we want to read God’s Word.

00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:03.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reads His law “day and night.”

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to read his Word often.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer is when we speak to Jehovah,

00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:15.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but reading the Bible

00:12:15.171 --> 00:12:17.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when he speaks to us.

00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:20.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to notice
the beautiful mental picture

00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:25.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Isaiah gives us
of how Jehovah speaks to us

00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:29.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 30:21.

00:12:29.227 --> 00:12:33.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:21:

00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:36.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And your own ears will hear a word
behind you

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:38.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying, ‘This is the way.

00:12:38.653 --> 00:12:42.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Walk in it,’ in case you
should go to the right

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:45.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in case you should go to the left.”

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why do we hear Jehovah’s voice

00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:52.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind us instead of in front of us?

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:55.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing,
Jehovah’s words in the Bible

00:12:55.712 --> 00:12:58.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were written many years ago or, we could say,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a time in the past—behind us.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:05.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s another way
to visualize this verse.

00:13:05.555 --> 00:13:07.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve been with a group

00:13:07.557 --> 00:13:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with some small children,
and you’re walking somewhere.

00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:13.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where often are the children?

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:15.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re out in front running ahead,

00:13:15.482 --> 00:13:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if they don’t really know
where they’re going.

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:21.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do the parents behind have to do?

00:13:21.154 --> 00:13:24.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they have to call to them and say:
“No, no, no, not that way!

00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:25.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to the left here.”

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:29.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the children run back,
and that’s the direction that they go in.

00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:34.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely, we want to listen carefully

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:37.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s voice behind us, helping us

00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:40.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the right decisions.

00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:43.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to schedule Bible reading

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:45.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as part of your daily routine.

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:48.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a suggestion, you can use the schedule

00:13:48.473 --> 00:13:51.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bible reading that’s found on jw.org.

00:13:51.476 --> 00:13:55.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find it, type “schedule for Bible reading”

00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:57.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the search field at the top right.

00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:02.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you read just three
to five chapters every day,

00:14:02.487 --> 00:14:07.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can complete
the entire Bible in just one year.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:10.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But simply reading God’s Word is not enough.

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to meditate on what you are reading.

00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:20.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why should you meditate
on what you read in God’s Word?

00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:23.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because knowing

00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:28.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the right thing to do is
and doing it are not the same.

00:14:28.513 --> 00:14:31.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is the process

00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:34.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of converting knowledge—that is, what we know

00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:38.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into wise decisions and actions.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible often associates

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:43.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditation with the heart.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that?

00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:48.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because meditation can convert knowledge

00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:50.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, what we know into feelings.

00:14:50.994 --> 00:14:53.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is those feelings that drive

00:14:53.621 --> 00:14:56.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our actions and decisions.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:15:01.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could kind of think
of meditation like a bridge.

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:05.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On this side of the river, we have knowing
what the right thing to do is,

00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:09.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on this side, we have actually doing it.

00:15:09.053 --> 00:15:12.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is the bridge

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:16.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that closes the gap
between knowing and doing.

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:20.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we find ourselves always
kind of knowing what the right thing to do is

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:24.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not actually doing it,
meditation is the bridge to help us

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:28.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close that gap between knowing and doing.

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can you meditate on God’s Word?

00:15:33.495 --> 00:15:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after reading a portion of the Bible

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:39.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or one of our publications,

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:43.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take a few moments to think deeply
about what you have read.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself:

00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:50.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What do I learn about Jehovah
when I read this account?

00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:55.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How does this account
make me feel about Jehovah?

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:58.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I apply this in my life?

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:01.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or how can I use this to help others?’

00:16:03.733 --> 00:16:06.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s review our first question:

00:16:06.528 --> 00:16:10.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read and meditate on God’s Word each day.

00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:18.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at our second question:

00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:23.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:16:23.002 --> 00:16:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus told us that more was required

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:28.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than just believing in him.

00:16:28.758 --> 00:16:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read John 3:16

00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:35.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the emphasis that Jesus put
on exercising faith.

00:16:37.934 --> 00:16:41.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 3:16:

00:16:41.104 --> 00:16:43.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For God loved the world so much

00:16:43.815 --> 00:16:46.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he gave his only-begotten Son,

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that everyone exercising faith in him

00:16:50.446 --> 00:16:55.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might not be destroyed
but have everlasting life.”

00:16:57.078 --> 00:17:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what does it mean
to exercise faith?

00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:05.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A study note on this verse explains:

00:17:05.378 --> 00:17:08.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘To exercise faith’ includes the idea

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of demonstrating
one’s strong beliefs or faith

00:17:11.843 --> 00:17:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[by obeying God].”

00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:17.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham was a powerful example

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of proving his faith by obedience.

00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:26.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at a very wonderful description
of Abraham’s faith

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:31.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at James 2:21-23.

00:17:33.489 --> 00:17:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 2:21-23:

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:42.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Was not Abraham our father
declared righteous by works

00:17:42.415 --> 00:17:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after he offered up
Isaac his son on the altar?

00:17:45.835 --> 00:17:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You see that his faith was active

00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:51.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with his works and his faith

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:54.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was perfected by his works,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the scripture was fulfilled that says:

00:17:57.388 --> 00:18:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

00:18:00.683 --> 00:18:04.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it was counted to him as righteousness,’

00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:08.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he came to be called Jehovah’s friend.”

00:18:10.526 --> 00:18:15.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we read and we meditate
on the account of Abraham,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can feel the emotions
that he must have felt

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:22.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being asked to offer up his son Isaac,

00:18:22.747 --> 00:18:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only son that he and Sarah had.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could Abraham
make such a very difficult decision?

00:18:30.088 --> 00:18:33.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, long before this,
Abraham had made a decision

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would obey Jehovah
and serve him in everything.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that decision years before
to obey Jehovah in all things

00:18:41.975 --> 00:18:44.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped Abraham to make
all the other decisions

00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:46.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in life clear on what he should do.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not always have to consider,

00:18:49.315 --> 00:18:52.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Should I do what Jehovah asks or not?’

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As difficult a request
as it was to offer up his son,

00:18:57.573 --> 00:19:02.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham did not delay
and took action immediately

00:19:02.245 --> 00:19:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey Jehovah’s request.

00:19:06.374 --> 00:19:10.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by your baptism today,
you’re telling everyone

00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:14.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have dedicated your life to Jehovah

00:19:14.215 --> 00:19:18.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to serve and obey him
for the rest of your life.

00:19:18.845 --> 00:19:22.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider three scriptures

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how you can show your faith

00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by your actions.

00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:31.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we read each scripture,
we’ll consider how each scripture

00:19:31.899 --> 00:19:34.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is part of your dedication promise

00:19:34.527 --> 00:19:38.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how you can show your faith in action.

00:19:38.156 --> 00:19:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first scripture is Hebrews 10:25.

00:19:44.954 --> 00:19:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:25 says:

00:19:52.045 --> 00:19:56.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not forsaking our meeting together,
as some have the custom,

00:19:56.257 --> 00:19:58.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but encouraging one another,

00:19:58.301 --> 00:20:00.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all the more so

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you see the day drawing near.”

00:20:03.973 --> 00:20:06.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dedication promise:

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will attend all meetings,
assemblies, and conventions.”

00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do you show that
by faith in action?

00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you really need a job,
but you say no to a job

00:20:18.362 --> 00:20:21.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would mean that you
would regularly miss meetings.

00:20:21.949 --> 00:20:25.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to decide,
‘Should I go to meetings or not?’

00:20:25.953 --> 00:20:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve already made that decision

00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:31.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you dedicated yourself to Jehovah.

00:20:31.959 --> 00:20:36.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second scripture is Romans 10:10.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 10:10:

00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:49.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For with the heart
one exercises faith for righteousness,

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:51.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with the mouth

00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one makes public declaration for salvation.”

00:20:55.525 --> 00:20:58.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So your dedication promise:

00:20:58.111 --> 00:21:01.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want everyone to know about Jehovah.”

00:21:01.322 --> 00:21:03.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith in action?

00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:06.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, going to bed early
so that you can get up

00:21:06.452 --> 00:21:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for field service the next morning,

00:21:08.704 --> 00:21:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
auxiliary pioneering when you can,

00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:14.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scheduling field service first

00:21:14.627 --> 00:21:18.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then other activities later in the day,

00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or adapting to different forms
of the ministry,

00:21:20.758 --> 00:21:23.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like telephone witnessing or letter writing.

00:21:25.638 --> 00:21:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third scripture is Mark 11:24.

00:21:33.187 --> 00:21:37.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark 11:24:

00:21:42.947 --> 00:21:47.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is why I tell you,
all the things you pray and ask for,

00:21:47.743 --> 00:21:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have faith that you have received them,

00:21:50.746 --> 00:21:53.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will have them.”

00:21:53.541 --> 00:21:55.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your dedication promise:

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will constantly seek
Jehovah’s direction in prayer.”

00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:01.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith in action?

00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:05.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re tempted
to play a violent video game,

00:22:05.553 --> 00:22:09.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you reject that game and play something else.

00:22:09.515 --> 00:22:11.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When faced with a serious illness,

00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:16.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pray for calm and wisdom
to make good decisions.

00:22:16.522 --> 00:22:19.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you feel yourself
getting angry with someone,

00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:23.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pray for self-control.

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:26.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we could use many more scriptures,

00:22:26.365 --> 00:22:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we could give you many more examples

00:22:28.618 --> 00:22:33.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how you can exercise
and show your faith by your actions.

00:22:33.623 --> 00:22:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is that you baptismal candidates

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:41.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have dedicated your life
to Jehovah and to do his will.

00:22:41.881 --> 00:22:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one decision to dedicate your life

00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to live by his standards

00:22:48.137 --> 00:22:51.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets the spiritual and moral foundation

00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:56.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the decisions you will make
from this day forward.

00:22:56.229 --> 00:22:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s review our second question:

00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:02.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:11.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s go to our third question:

00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:16.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:21.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves his faithful worshippers.

00:23:21.254 --> 00:23:26.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants the best for us,
and he wants us to be happy.

00:23:26.008 --> 00:23:30.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees every time you
do something to demonstrate your faith

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:34.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to show faith in action,
to be obedient to him.

00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:38.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some feel that God, or Jehovah,

00:23:38.229 --> 00:23:41.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always watching out
for the bad things that they do,

00:23:41.649 --> 00:23:44.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe keeping a ledger,
keeping track, of all these

00:23:44.151 --> 00:23:46.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bad things that a person does.

00:23:46.862 --> 00:23:48.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah is not doing that.

00:23:48.864 --> 00:23:53.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s actually looking for the good
and rejoicing in the good that we are doing.

00:23:53.828 --> 00:23:56.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could kind of illustrate it by the way

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:59.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many of us are taking
so many pictures these days.

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:02.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have phones, cameras.

00:24:02.003 --> 00:24:03.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re taking lots of pictures.

00:24:03.838 --> 00:24:05.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe you’ve noticed that at one point,

00:24:05.881 --> 00:24:08.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you take a picture of one of your friends

00:24:08.134 --> 00:24:10.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have kind
of a funny look on their face

00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:13.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they are in the middle
of eating something.

00:24:13.973 --> 00:24:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you show your friend that picture,
what do they often say?

00:24:18.227 --> 00:24:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Could you please delete that?”

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not the picture
they want you to show to other people,

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:26.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s not the picture
you want to show of them.

00:24:26.986 --> 00:24:29.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I want you to imagine for a moment

00:24:29.196 --> 00:24:33.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has
a digital photo album of you.

00:24:34.618 --> 00:24:37.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which pictures do you think
he’s keeping there?

00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:40.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones where we made serious mistakes?

00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:43.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones where we did something dumb?

00:24:43.961 --> 00:24:45.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:24:45.463 --> 00:24:50.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on your repentance
and the ransom sacrifice, those are deleted.

00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:52.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re gone.

00:24:52.053 --> 00:24:56.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has in his photo album of you
the beautiful pictures

00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:59.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the beautiful moments
that he’s proud of when

00:24:59.143 --> 00:25:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you showed your faith in action.

00:25:02.605 --> 00:25:06.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants to reward your faith.

00:25:06.817 --> 00:25:11.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:6,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see how Jehovah
feels about his servants

00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:18.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by what he says here about rewarding them.

Hebrews 11:6:

00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, without faith

00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:27.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is impossible to please God well,

00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:29.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God

00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:33.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must believe that he is
and that he becomes the rewarder

00:25:33.928 --> 00:25:37.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:41.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when listing
all these other examples of faith

00:25:41.936 --> 00:25:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there in chapter 11 of Hebrews,

00:25:44.146 --> 00:25:46.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul pauses for a moment

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:51.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind us that Jehovah
“becomes the rewarder

00:25:51.153 --> 00:25:54.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:25:54.115 --> 00:25:57.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you take the time

00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:59.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and effort to build a fire,

00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:02.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what reward do you get in return?

00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:06.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you get the warmth
and light of that fire.

00:26:06.127 --> 00:26:09.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can keep yourself
and others warm by the fire,

00:26:09.922 --> 00:26:13.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a fire gives off a beautiful light

00:26:13.426 --> 00:26:16.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be very welcome on a dark night.

00:26:16.637 --> 00:26:18.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sounds of a crackling fire

00:26:18.764 --> 00:26:22.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make us feel safe and happy.

00:26:22.435 --> 00:26:25.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will Jehovah reward

00:26:25.438 --> 00:26:29.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his faithful worshippers
for their fire of faith?

00:26:29.316 --> 00:26:33.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, ultimately, He will reward us
with everlasting life.

00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:37.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During his ministry,
Jesus repeatedly promised

00:26:37.032 --> 00:26:41.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his faithful servants
would get everlasting life.

00:26:41.078 --> 00:26:45.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah provided
the rewards of a wood fire,

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:49.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also provides many gifts
that come when we build

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feed our fire of faith.

00:26:52.047 --> 00:26:55.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider some of the rewards
that Jehovah gives us now.

00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:59.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward of his Word, the Bible,

00:26:59.263 --> 00:27:01.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us the best advice for life.

00:27:01.807 --> 00:27:06.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It lights our way
in a spiritually dark world.

00:27:07.354 --> 00:27:12.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward of the ministry
is the most satisfying work that we can do.

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:15.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward of holy spirit

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:19.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a powerful helper in times of trials.

00:27:19.241 --> 00:27:23.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you are never alone.

00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:26.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the reward of our loving group

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters around the world

00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:31.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a source of great warmth and comfort.

00:27:33.756 --> 00:27:37.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In conclusion,
let’s review our three questions:

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:42.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) How can you feed your fire of faith?

00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:46.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read and meditate on God’s Word each day.

00:27:46.685 --> 00:27:51.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) What does it mean to exercise faith?

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

00:27:56.987 --> 00:28:01.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) How will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:28:01.867 --> 00:28:04.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everlasting life.

00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:08.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take note of this day.

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:10.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember it; write it down.

00:28:10.876 --> 00:28:14.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time you hear
a baptism talk in the future,

00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take that opportunity
to reflect on your baptism

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the many blessings that you have received

00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:22.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the decision that you made

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

00:28:26.934 --> 00:28:31.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants you to be happy
and to enjoy life.

00:28:31.063 --> 00:28:35.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All eight and a half million plus
of your brothers and sisters

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:39.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are watching this program
are with you in heart and mind,

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want you to be happy.

00:28:43.534 --> 00:28:47.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep clear in mind, though,
that happiness is not something

00:28:47.288 --> 00:28:51.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can buy for yourself
or get for yourself,

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:54.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can’t get it by loving yourself.

00:28:54.378 --> 00:28:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like warmth and light

00:28:57.006 --> 00:28:59.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are by-products of a wood fire,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so too happiness is a by-product of faith

00:29:04.096 --> 00:29:08.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love for others and for Jehovah.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could say that happiness

00:29:10.477 --> 00:29:15.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the warmth and glow from love’s fire.

00:29:15.482 --> 00:29:19.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world will tell you:
“You can follow your dreams.

00:29:19.737 --> 00:29:22.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be anything you want to be.”

00:29:22.197 --> 00:29:27.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is far better
to let Jehovah dream for you.

00:29:27.119 --> 00:29:29.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your life serving Jehovah

00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:32.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be far greater than anything

00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:35.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could dream up for yourself.

00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:38.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, from this day forward,

00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:41.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be determined to keep feeding

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exercising your faith.

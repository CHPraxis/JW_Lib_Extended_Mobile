WEBVTT

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We extend a warm welcome

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all who accepted an invitation

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join us for this convention.

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a world
that has grown deeply distrustful.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:34.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we really believe the Bible’s promises
for the future?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, what must we do to benefit from them?

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Turner,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will answer those questions
in the discourse entitled

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have Faith in the Good News.”

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever received an email
from an unknown source

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
informing you of great news?

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re a grand prize winner!

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just click on the link
to receive your prize.”

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe it was a phone call.

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The person says they have exciting news.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’ve just won something of value.

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But hurry!

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Limited time only!”

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All you have to do
is provide your personal information.

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:27.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sadly, the great and exciting news

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually doesn’t turn out
as presented, does it?

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This highlights that no matter the form
or method that we receive it,

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much of the news and information
we’re given today

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misleads, misinforms,

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often leaves us disappointed.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our world is just saturated with bad news.

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even just watching the local news
can leave us feeling anxious, depressed

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:57.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even fearful.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s no wonder that when people
actually do receive good news,

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re often skeptical,

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:08.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feeling that if something
seems too good to be true,

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:10.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it probably is.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that it’s actually wise

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be cautious about the news we believe.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it also tells us that there is news
—good news—

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can trust.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to turn with me, please,
in your Bibles to the book of Mark.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Mark chapter 1,

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:35.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the words of Mark 1:14, 15

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it reads:

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now after John was arrested,
Jesus went into Galilee,

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“preaching the good news of God and saying:

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:49.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The appointed time has been fulfilled,

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:52.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the Kingdom of God has drawn near.

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Repent,

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith in the good news.’”

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:02.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have faith in the good news.”

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the theme of our discussion.

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:07.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To better understand Jesus’ words,

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to answer three questions.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, What is the good news?

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Why can we have faith in it?

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, How can we build such faith?

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing the answers to these questions
will help us to have faith in the good news

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fill our life with real purpose.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s address our first question.

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:40.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What specifically is the “good news”
that Jesus was referring to?

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:44.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go back to the Bible,
this time to the book of Luke.

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Luke chapter 8,

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice Luke 8:1:

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:01.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shortly afterward he traveled from city
to city and from village to village,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“preaching and declaring the good news
of the Kingdom of God.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Twelve were with him.”

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was that “good news”
that Jesus preached?

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse states: “The good news

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Kingdom of God.”

00:04:19.238 --> 00:04:21.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So an important aspect of the good news

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the message about God’s Kingdom.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:28.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This Kingdom is a real government in heaven

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a heavenly King and earthly subjects.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ earthly life as a grown man

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:37.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was devoted to preaching
and declaring God’s Kingdom

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:41.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the only solution to man’s problems.

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:43.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did he do it?

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:46.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the simplest of tools

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:49.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his mouth and his feet.

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:53.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, he walked tirelessly
from city to city and village to village

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:57.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—hundreds of miles on dusty roads,
even without food at times,

00:04:57.568 --> 00:05:01.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to share this message with others.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:03.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even taught his disciples this good news

00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:06.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could share
and extend the good news

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:10.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well beyond the cities and villages
that Jesus reached.

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:12.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you might be wondering,

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:17.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why should this good news
that Jesus preached about 2,000 years ago

00:05:17.963 --> 00:05:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be of interest to us today?’

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:24.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because the message of the good news
that Jesus taught

00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:27.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
promises future blessings

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for obedient humans living
under the rulership of God’s Kingdom.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that affects all mankind today.

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That affects you and me.

00:05:35.564 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these blessings will touch
every facet of life.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a few examples.

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:46.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with our physical health.

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah.

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:53.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 33,

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:59.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read
the first part of verse 24.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 33:24:

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:09.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, that’s such a simple statement,

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:17.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can you just process what that means?

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:22.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To never again say or hear someone say:

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:26.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m sick,”

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:29.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t feel well,”

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:32.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Something is not right with me.”

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think of the millions

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:39.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have suffered illness
because of the pandemic,

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:43.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the millions that are coping
with a disability,

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:47.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then all the diseases

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the diseases that are common,

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:54.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the diseases that are rare,

00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ones that are life-threatening,

00:06:57.145 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chronic, debilitating,

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the diseases where you look
fine on the outside

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:08.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inside it’s a day-to-day struggle.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:12.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, under God’s Kingdom, all of it

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:16.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all disabilities, all diseases,
all health problems—

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will no longer plague mankind.

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:22.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will all be a thing of the past.

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:26.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just to show you how wonderful this is
—how far reaching this blessing will be—

00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:29.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we don’t have
a disease or disability,

00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of what your life
would be like right now

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:36.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just didn’t hurt.

00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:41.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, right now, it hurts
if we stand too long;

00:07:41.315 --> 00:07:44.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it hurts if we sit too long;
it hurts if we walk too long

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if we sleep too long.

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:50.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to be pain free

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know that each day

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:55.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re just going to feel better and better,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t that good news?

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:03.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, so much is going
to be accomplished from this promise:

00:08:03.462 --> 00:08:07.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[No one] will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider another blessing.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:15.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a family head,
we know it’s a priority for you

00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:20.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for your family
and keep a roof over their heads.

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:24.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it a struggle to make ends meet?

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How often do you worry about having a job

00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:29.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or keeping your job?

00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:33.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just think of how you’ll feel
when these words become a reality.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:38.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still in the book of Isaiah,
this time Isaiah chapter 65,

00:08:40.248 --> 00:08:44.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note verses 21 and 22:

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:51.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will build houses and live in them,

00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:54.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:57.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:08:57.057 --> 00:08:59.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:08:59.726 --> 00:09:03.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:08.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the blessing?

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:15.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will be homeless or unemployed.

00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:16.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you note?

00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:19.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nowhere in these verses do we see the words

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rent” or “lease.”

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:26.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under this Kingdom arrangement, you see,
we’re going to experience

00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:30.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the full joy of ownership.

00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:32.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that?

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine the satisfaction
—the dignity—

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:40.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from living in a home
you personally built

00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:45.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then working with your hands
for the direct benefit of your family?

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:48.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good feeling, isn’t it?

00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:50.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, if you’re planting
your own vineyard,

00:09:50.777 --> 00:09:53.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, that’s an indication
of another blessing

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:56.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an abundance of food.

00:09:56.658 --> 00:09:58.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes this quite beautifully.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to the book of Psalms,

00:10:02.956 --> 00:10:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 72nd Psalm,

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:14.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note Psalm 72:16:

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:10:19.848 --> 00:10:22.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:25.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon,

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:30.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the cities people will blossom
like the vegetation of the earth.”

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve all seen heartbreaking pictures

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:38.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of neglected and starving children.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:43.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve likely seen the increasing number
of food lines during this pandemic.

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you see, under God’s government,

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:49.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no one will be without sufficient food
or undernourished.

00:10:49.753 --> 00:10:54.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poverty and food shortages will be gone.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:58.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful word picture
this verse gives us

00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:01.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how the ground will produce abundantly!

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be as if grain were growing
along the sides of a mountain

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:09.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clear to the top and overflowing.

00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:12.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we have so many wonderful blessings
to look forward to.

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:16.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for this next blessing,

00:11:16.905 --> 00:11:19.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God will use his creative powers

00:11:19.574 --> 00:11:23.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do one of the most wonderful works
of all time.

00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to the book of Isaiah,

00:11:26.122 --> 00:11:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time Isaiah 25:8.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Isaiah 25:8

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:44.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there we’re told:

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:48.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will swallow up death forever,

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:53.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:58.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The reproach of his people
he will take away from all the earth,

00:11:58.071 --> 00:12:01.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah himself has spoken it.”

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:06.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, some may consider this
to be the best news of all.

00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:09.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it is going to be

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:13.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when “death will be no more,”
removed forever!

00:12:15.213 --> 00:12:18.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If any of us have ever had
someone close to us

00:12:18.258 --> 00:12:20.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taken away by death,

00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:24.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know the emptiness, the anguish,

00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the painful scars that death leaves behind.

00:12:28.184 --> 00:12:30.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s something that affects all of us.

00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:32.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just think, how many memorial services

00:12:32.856 --> 00:12:35.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have you attended in this pandemic?

00:12:35.692 --> 00:12:39.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, for some,
it’s just too painful to think about.

00:12:39.696 --> 00:12:42.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother made the statement; he said:

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:45.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t even look forward
to Saturdays anymore.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that Saturdays have been set aside
for funeral and memorial services.”

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:53.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can relate to that, can’t we?

00:12:53.543 --> 00:12:55.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see what the Bible says?

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:59.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that God
is going to “swallow up death forever.”

00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:04.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when something is swallowed,
it’s gone—destroyed.

00:13:04.512 --> 00:13:08.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is going to be a time to rejoice.

00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:10.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the good news doesn’t stop there

00:13:10.602 --> 00:13:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because not only is Jehovah
going to put an end to death

00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:17.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also note what he does next.

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look over in chapter 26, this time verse 19.

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Your dead will live.

00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:26.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My corpses will rise up.

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:30.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Awake and shout joyfully,
you residents in the dust!

00:13:30.705 --> 00:13:33.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For your dew is as the dew of the morning,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the earth will let
those powerless in death come to life.”

00:13:39.756 --> 00:13:43.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we’re talking about the resurrection.

00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dead loved ones will return to life.

00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you note the expression there:

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Awake and shout joyfully.”

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was interesting
that <i>The New English Bible</i>

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:58.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quotes this as saying:

00:13:58.316 --> 00:14:01.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They that sleep in the earth

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:04.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will awake and shout for joy.”

00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:07.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doesn’t that nicely describe
how right now

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:10.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our dead loved ones are just sleeping?

00:14:12.038 --> 00:14:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just like an infant is protected
within its mother’s womb,

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:20.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dead are
in the safest situation imaginable,

00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:23.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perfectly preserved and protected

00:14:23.758 --> 00:14:26.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within Jehovah’s memory.

00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:30.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in God’s due time,
they will be brought back to life.

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:32.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can be there.

00:14:32.058 --> 00:14:34.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be there to warmly welcome them

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:39.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like a newborn is greeted
by a loving, waiting family

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so many tremendous blessings.

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these blessings that we’ve considered,

00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is just a small sampling
of the good news.

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s so much more
that this Kingdom will accomplish.

00:14:52.495 --> 00:14:57.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Psalm 46:9,
war will cease to exist.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Revelation 11:18,

00:14:59.002 --> 00:15:02.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anyone and anything that dirties the earth,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pollutes the air and water,
or kills off the earth’s wildlife,

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God promises that he will “bring to ruin

00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:12.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those [who ruin, or pollute,] the earth.”

00:15:14.726 --> 00:15:19.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve established the answer
to our first question,

00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the good news?

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news is the news of God’s Kingdom,

00:15:25.737 --> 00:15:28.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this heavenly government that will rule

00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:31.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provide tremendous blessings
to obedient mankind.

00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:36.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with all these wonderful promises
in store for mankind,

00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:41.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you think of any better news
that you’d like to receive?

00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:46.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t you agree that these promises
are worth investigating?

00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:48.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed they are.

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:51.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s the challenge:

00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:54.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The idea of living forever
under such wonderful conditions

00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:57.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might be difficult for some to comprehend,

00:15:57.602 --> 00:16:02.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with what life is like
right now at present.

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:06.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what if those that hear this good news

00:16:06.486 --> 00:16:08.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are skeptical?

00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if they feel,

00:16:10.698 --> 00:16:13.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If it seems too good to be true,

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it probably is’?

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address this
by answering our second question,

00:16:22.126 --> 00:16:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we have faith in the good news?

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, why can we firmly believe

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:33.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all the things we’ve just considered,
all these promises from God, are true

00:16:33.763 --> 00:16:36.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be fulfilled?

00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:41.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just like any news,
or information, that we receive,

00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the credibility all starts
with the Source, doesn’t it?

00:16:45.942 --> 00:16:50.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news comes
from Jehovah God himself.

00:16:50.363 --> 00:16:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s note what the Bible says about him.

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:55.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Titus,

00:16:57.036 --> 00:16:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Titus chapter 1,

00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:03.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read

00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:06.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Titus 1:1, 2:

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul, a slave of God
and an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:17:13.344 --> 00:17:16.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the faith of God’s chosen ones

00:17:16.014 --> 00:17:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the accurate knowledge of the truth
that is according to godly devotion

00:17:19.976 --> 00:17:22.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is based on a hope
of the everlasting life

00:17:22.979 --> 00:17:26.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God, who cannot lie,

00:17:26.274 --> 00:17:29.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
promised long ago.”

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can be certain
that these promises will be fulfilled

00:17:34.657 --> 00:17:38.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Bible tells us
we have a basis for hope,

00:17:38.953 --> 00:17:42.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “God, who cannot lie,”

00:17:42.749 --> 00:17:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the one who made these promises.

00:17:47.086 --> 00:17:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what exactly does this mean?

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s illustrate it this way.

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:57.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever asked a friend to meet you
or pick you up to go somewhere,

00:17:57.764 --> 00:17:59.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your friend says: “Oh, no problem.

00:17:59.849 --> 00:18:01.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be there at 7:00.”

00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:04.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as he says it,

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:07.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you already know he’s not coming until 7:30,

00:18:07.732 --> 00:18:09.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even 8:00.

00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:12.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all seem to have that friend, don’t we?

00:18:12.862 --> 00:18:16.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do we know this about our friend?

00:18:16.658 --> 00:18:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likely it’s because of his past record.

00:18:19.702 --> 00:18:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, if our friend,
although well-intentioned,

00:18:22.872 --> 00:18:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a pattern of being late,

00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:27.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s given us a basis

00:18:27.627 --> 00:18:31.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to question his promise.

00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, as humans,
we’re all imperfect.

00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:37.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is our record of works

00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forms a basis for our credibility.

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:45.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we elevate this to our Almighty God.

00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:48.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to Jehovah,

00:18:48.648 --> 00:18:52.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Source of the good news,
the one “who cannot lie,”

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, if we examine his record, we’ll see

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:58.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has given us a basis to trust him.

00:18:58.449 --> 00:19:01.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a perfect record
of fulfilling his promises;

00:19:01.661 --> 00:19:06.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they come true 100 percent of the time.

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not
just the general prophecy itself;

00:19:12.338 --> 00:19:15.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s the accurate details as well.

00:19:16.592 --> 00:19:19.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the prophet Isaiah foretold

00:19:19.637 --> 00:19:24.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the mighty city of Babylon
would be destroyed.

00:19:24.142 --> 00:19:29.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he went into detail
of exactly how the city would be defeated

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:34.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from the river being dried up
to the gates being left wide open.

00:19:34.152 --> 00:19:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even named the one
who was going to overthrow Babylon

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:39.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 200 years before it happened.

00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:44.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And history confirms
that every detail of this prophecy

00:19:44.245 --> 00:19:46.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was fulfilled.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was even prophesied that Babylon
would become piles of stone

00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:52.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “never [again] be inhabited.”

00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:56.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that stands true down to this day.

00:19:56.382 --> 00:20:00.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is just one
of a number of prophecies.

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:04.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when we take the time
to investigate, we find other prophecies

00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:07.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the number of years
when the land of Judah would be desolate,

00:20:07.852 --> 00:20:10.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exact year when the Messiah would come,

00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:12.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he would be born, what he would do,

00:20:12.732 --> 00:20:15.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he would die and be raised from the dead

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:20.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all fulfilled exactly as foretold.

00:20:21.908 --> 00:20:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fact that so many Bible prophecies

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:27.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have already come true

00:20:27.497 --> 00:20:29.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows that we can trust

00:20:29.874 --> 00:20:33.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the Bible says about the future.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another reason
we can have faith in the good news.

00:20:38.758 --> 00:20:42.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to our Bibles,
this time to Matthew chapter 9.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:51.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Matthew chapter 9, note verse 35:

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:58.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jesus set out on a tour
of all the cities and villages,

00:20:58.736 --> 00:21:02.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teaching in their synagogues and preaching
the good news of the Kingdom

00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:06.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and curing every sort of disease
and every sort of infirmity.”

00:21:06.994 --> 00:21:10.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you recall, earlier we discussed
the efforts Jesus put forth

00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:12.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to declare the good news.

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:15.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we see that as he went
to those cities and villages,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only did he preach but,
empowered by God,

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:21.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he performed miracles

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prove the credibility of the good news.

00:21:25.888 --> 00:21:30.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of those miracles
were witnessed by thousands

00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:34.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point where they cannot be denied
even by his opposers.

00:21:36.399 --> 00:21:38.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to this point,

00:21:38.734 --> 00:21:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve established what the good news is
—the news regarding God’s Kingdom—

00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we’ve answered
why we can have faith in the good news.

00:21:48.244 --> 00:21:52.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Source of the good news is Jehovah,

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:54.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a God “who cannot lie”

00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:58.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who has a perfect track record
of keeping his promises.

00:21:58.671 --> 00:22:03.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then God’s Son, Jesus Christ,
who as King of God’s Kingdom

00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:06.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
solidified that evidence
during his time on the earth

00:22:06.762 --> 00:22:11.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by demonstrating the power
to cure disease and infirmity.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, there are millions of people
from a variety of backgrounds

00:22:16.939 --> 00:22:21.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have taken the time to investigate
the promises of God’s Kingdom.

00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:23.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have found them to be true,

00:22:23.863 --> 00:22:27.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have benefited from the good news.

00:22:27.241 --> 00:22:29.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has improved their lives now

00:22:29.243 --> 00:22:32.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given them a solid hope for the future.

00:22:32.496 --> 00:22:35.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to watch the following video,

00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:39.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as you do,
note how some have benefited

00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:41.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the good news.

00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear and war were normal in my home country.

00:22:51.265 --> 00:22:54.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had many questions:

00:22:54.143 --> 00:22:56.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do young people have to die?

00:22:56.312 --> 00:22:58.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do my children have to go through this?

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:01.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
God did not create us to make war.

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:04.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The priests in my church always said,

00:23:04.153 --> 00:23:06.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is God’s will.”

00:23:07.698 --> 00:23:09.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being on the run was dreadful.

00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:12.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than once,
I thought we were going to die.

00:23:12.578 --> 00:23:14.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, we arrived in Germany,

00:23:14.747 --> 00:23:18.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was convinced that the priests there
could give me some answers.

00:23:18.626 --> 00:23:21.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to several different churches

00:23:21.963 --> 00:23:24.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but no answers.

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:27.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept telling them:
“I’m looking for something.

00:23:27.218 --> 00:23:31.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what it is,
but I didn’t find it here with you.”

00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I thought
I was searching for something

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no one could give me.

00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:40.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, 

00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:42.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a German woman approached me,
speaking in Arabic.

00:23:42.984 --> 00:23:45.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was amazing for me.

00:23:45.403 --> 00:23:48.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had a good opinion
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:23:48.572 --> 00:23:51.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t think
I could learn anything from her,

00:23:51.617 --> 00:23:53.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I gave her a chance.

00:23:54.203 --> 00:23:58.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave me logical answers
to all of my questions.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:06.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my home country, there are
multiple religious groups and nationalities

00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:09.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who hate and fight each other.

00:24:09.468 --> 00:24:12.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:24:12.722 --> 00:24:15.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen that all people
can live in peace with each other

00:24:15.933 --> 00:24:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they get to know our Father in heaven.

00:24:19.395 --> 00:24:21.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives love and peace.

00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:26.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, I found what I had been looking for.

00:24:33.284 --> 00:24:36.287 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I lived a life without rules.

00:24:36.287 --> 00:24:38.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to get drunk,

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:42.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked a lot,
and I became a compulsive gambler.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My behavior was a complete disaster.

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:49.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife wanted to separate from me.

00:24:51.344 --> 00:24:53.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a horrible time.

00:24:53.971 --> 00:24:57.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife started studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:24:57.975 --> 00:25:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember being doubtful

00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:03.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very doubtful.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was one thing
that started to make me think.

00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:11.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both my wife and my children
looked more peaceful,

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:15.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more joyful, happier.

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:18.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I even accepted a Bible study.

00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:25.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize that Jehovah
loves each one of us as an individual.

00:25:25.378 --> 00:25:28.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gave me real hope for the future.

00:25:28.506 --> 00:25:31.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I was studying in the Bible

00:25:31.258 --> 00:25:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to understand

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doing Jehovah’s will
is in our best interests.

00:25:39.058 --> 00:25:42.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really helped me to quit my bad habits,

00:25:42.603 --> 00:25:45.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
treat my family better,

00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:49.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show due respect to my wife.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah hadn’t searched for me,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I hadn’t come to know him,

00:25:54.782 --> 00:25:56.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would no longer be a family.

00:25:58.869 --> 00:26:02.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today we are, indeed, a happy family,

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:04.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a united family

00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:07.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—united more than ever.

00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:13.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle.

00:26:17.513 --> 00:26:20.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address our final question,

00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:25.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you and I
build faith in the good news?

00:26:25.354 --> 00:26:28.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that just like our sister
in the video,

00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:31.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have gone through situations in our life

00:26:31.444 --> 00:26:34.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that leave us searching for answers.

00:26:34.405 --> 00:26:36.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our search might provide us

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with incorrect or misinformed information
about God.

00:26:41.704 --> 00:26:46.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up again,
How can we know?

00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:50.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we be sure of what to believe?

00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:52.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible gives us the answer.

00:26:52.673 --> 00:26:55.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hebrews.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And note what is stated at Hebrews chapter 11

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 1.

00:27:07.229 --> 00:27:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:

00:27:09.231 --> 00:27:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for,

00:27:13.569 --> 00:27:17.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the evident demonstration of realities

00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:19.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not seen.”

00:27:19.492 --> 00:27:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you note the footnote there
for “evident demonstration”;

00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:28.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “convincing evidence.”

00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:33.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that helps us to see
that real faith is not gullible.

00:27:33.422 --> 00:27:37.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like with the scammers
and misinformation we spoke of earlier,

00:27:37.927 --> 00:27:41.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, we don’t believe what we hear
just because it sounds good.

00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:42.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:27:42.014 --> 00:27:46.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the footnote says, there should be
“convincing evidence”

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of things that are not seen and are yet real.

00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:54.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to illustrate this, a child may ask,

00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:59.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How do we know that air exists?”

00:27:59.031 --> 00:28:01.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can’t say: “Well, it just does.

00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how it works.”

00:28:02.618 --> 00:28:03.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:28:03.494 --> 00:28:06.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, likely we’d have
to help the child to reason

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the evidence that exists
—right?—

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his ability to breathe air in and out,

00:28:12.628 --> 00:28:16.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the effects of the wind, and so forth.

00:28:16.048 --> 00:28:20.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once the child is convinced
of the evidence,

00:28:20.302 --> 00:28:23.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can now accept the existence

00:28:23.889 --> 00:28:26.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is invisible to him

00:28:26.725 --> 00:28:29.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in this case, the air.

00:28:29.937 --> 00:28:33.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is how our faith has to be.

00:28:33.315 --> 00:28:38.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to be based
on solid convincing evidence.

00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:44.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide
have faith in the good news.

00:28:44.827 --> 00:28:47.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have made an examination
of the Bible’s promises,

00:28:47.746 --> 00:28:50.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’ve seen the evidence for themselves.

00:28:50.332 --> 00:28:53.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like our brother in the video,
we’ve also seen

00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:56.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the good news
has not only improved our lives

00:28:56.505 --> 00:29:00.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it shows us evidence
of Jehovah’s love for us as well.

00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:05.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who are listening to this program
may be newly acquainted

00:29:05.514 --> 00:29:07.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:10.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d like to tell you
that we are so happy

00:29:10.853 --> 00:29:13.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you took the time to attend.

00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:16.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that you too may have questions

00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:21.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you need answers—truthful answers.

00:29:21.488 --> 00:29:25.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, give Jehovah’s Witnesses a chance.

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:29.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give them a chance to help you find
those answers in the Bible.

00:29:29.955 --> 00:29:31.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you associate with them,

00:29:31.957 --> 00:29:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how they have come
to believe the good news

00:29:34.501 --> 00:29:36.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why they have faith in it.

00:29:36.587 --> 00:29:39.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as your faith grows,
you’ll come to appreciate

00:29:39.632 --> 00:29:42.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how important this message is.

00:29:42.676 --> 00:29:45.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will move you to make
any needed changes in your life.

00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:49.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of the joy
and happiness you feel,

00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:51.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, you will be excited, right?

00:29:51.185 --> 00:29:53.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to share
what you have learned with others.

00:29:53.979 --> 00:29:56.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s good, for doing so

00:29:56.398 --> 00:29:59.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will reinforce Bible truth in your own mind.

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:04.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from all that we’ve discussed,

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we conclude?

00:30:07.326 --> 00:30:10.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have faith in the good news,

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are firmly convinced
that everything Jehovah says is true

00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:17.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be fulfilled.

00:30:17.544 --> 00:30:20.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the way we live our lives
will demonstrate that.

00:30:20.756 --> 00:30:24.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this world that is saturated
with so much bad news,

00:30:24.593 --> 00:30:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how thankful we are that we have a God

00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:30.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that not only provides us
with a basis to trust his good news

00:30:30.724 --> 00:30:34.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even shows evidence
of his care and concern

00:30:34.353 --> 00:30:36.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us as individuals!

00:30:36.689 --> 00:30:39.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This good news is not too good to be true.

00:30:39.983 --> 00:30:41.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is real.

00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:44.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a reality that is soon to come.

00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may all of us have faith in the good news.

00:30:49.993 --> 00:30:52.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we draw close to God,

00:30:52.037 --> 00:30:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we experience firsthand Jehovah’s love

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:58.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he rewards all those

00:30:58.293 --> 00:31:01.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who earnestly seek him in faith.

00:31:03.006 --> 00:31:06.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Turner,
for reviewing the evidence

00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:10.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of God’s promises
will soon be fulfilled.

00:31:11.974 --> 00:31:15.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the earth, millions are building faith

00:31:15.018 --> 00:31:18.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah God and his Word, the Bible.

00:31:18.814 --> 00:31:23.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:31:44.214 --> 00:31:47.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have reached
the conclusion of this session.

00:31:47.718 --> 00:31:49.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to the next session

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:54.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we will see
the conclusion of the Daniel drama

00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:57.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear the final talk of this convention.

00:31:57.895 --> 00:32:00.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s sing a song that expresses

00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:04.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our confidence in God and in his Kingdom.

00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:08.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to sing
song number 22, entitled

00:32:08.447 --> 00:32:12.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!”

00:32:12.284 --> 00:32:15.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 22,

00:32:15.537 --> 00:32:18.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after which you may have
your local concluding prayer.

Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today’s session will begin
with a music-video presentation

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reminds us
of our privilege and responsibility

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others develop faith.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the presentation!

00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:31.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome back to our “Powerful by Faith!”
Regional Convention.

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this session and the next one,

00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:37.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will hear the talks listed
under the “Saturday” heading

00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your printed program.

00:10:40.952 --> 00:10:43.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scripture theme for today’s program

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:47.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is taken from Jude 3, where we are told

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:50.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “put up a hard fight for the faith.”

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:53.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how we can demonstrate our faith

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:55.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of our circumstances,

00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:59.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll see how we can help others
to build faith.

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:05.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s share in singing
song number 57, entitled

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:08.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Preaching to All Sorts of People.”

00:11:08.647 --> 00:11:11.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 57.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your ministry, do you meet some

00:13:56.648 --> 00:14:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who seem unlikely to respond favorably?

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you prepared to help them?

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:06.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we will see in our first symposium
of this session,

00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:10.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our attitude toward others
can affect how we give a witness

00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how people might respond.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will introduce
the one to follow.

00:14:18.795 --> 00:14:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give your attention
to Brother Ronald Curzan,

00:14:21.798 --> 00:14:24.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee.

00:14:24.384 --> 00:14:26.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will begin with the theme

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember—Faithless People
Can Acquire Faith!—The Ninevites.”

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Impossible!

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:44.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will never happen—not in a million years!’

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:48.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought that way
about someone coming into the truth?

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:52.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that might be
our limited view of a person.

00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:55.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does Jehovah view him or her?

00:14:55.206 --> 00:15:00.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is his view of all humans,
even faithless ones?

00:15:00.044 --> 00:15:02.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his limitless view

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:06.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Timothy 2:4.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says: “. . . God, whose will is
that all sorts of people should be saved

00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:16.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:18.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Jehovah’s desire?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s his will that all hear the message

00:15:21.691 --> 00:15:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be allowed to make changes and be saved.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to us that might be impossible,

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:30.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know
“with God all things are possible.”

00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:35.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can stir the heart,
and he can motivate anyone.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it’s true that “faith
is not [the] possession of all people,”

00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:43.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is a possession
of millions around the world,

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:47.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can be for those
who choose to acquire it.

00:15:47.217 --> 00:15:50.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that the Bible
contains many examples

00:15:50.428 --> 00:15:53.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of men and women
who at one time lacked faith

00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:57.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but later acquired it,
and the same is true today.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not impossible.

00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:03.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will help us
to remember this fact:

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:07.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithless people can acquire faith

00:16:07.153 --> 00:16:09.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have Jehovah’s view of them

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:11.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow all sorts of people

00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:15.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hear God’s Word and make adjustments.

00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:19.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will discuss four groups
of people in this symposium:

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ninevites, Jesus’ fleshly brothers,

00:16:24.128 --> 00:16:27.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prominent ones, and nonreligious people.

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:30.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in each one of these symposium talks,

00:16:30.218 --> 00:16:33.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will consider
what helped former unbelievers

00:16:33.054 --> 00:16:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to acquire faith
and what we can learn from that.

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:41.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s consider
the example of the Ninevites.

00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you recall, they were Assyrians

00:16:44.607 --> 00:16:47.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lived in the capital city of Nineveh,

00:16:47.193 --> 00:16:49.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was founded by Nimrod.

00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was referred to
as “the city of bloodshed.”

00:16:52.323 --> 00:16:54.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that history and backdrop,

00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can imagine what the people were like.

00:16:57.453 --> 00:16:59.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They worshipped gods of war.

00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:02.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
War was their religion.

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were aggressive.

00:17:04.168 --> 00:17:05.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were violent people,

00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:09.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they took pleasure
in sadistically torturing their captives.

00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:11.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, their reputation was known

00:17:11.718 --> 00:17:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all the surrounding nations,
including God’s people.

00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s why Jehovah sent his prophet Jonah

00:17:18.808 --> 00:17:22.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go there and proclaim their destruction.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we notice this first video,

00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:28.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine how Jonah must have felt
going into Nineveh

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—going through the streets
and observing the people of Nineveh

00:17:31.654 --> 00:17:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contemplating his warning message.

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:49.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jonah view his assignment?

00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:53.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at this time,
he did not have Jehovah’s view.

00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:57.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was afraid of the Ninevites
—maybe what they thought of him

00:18:57.073 --> 00:19:00.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what they would do
once they heard his message.

00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:02.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jonah was human.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had feelings like ours.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A human tendency is to judge people

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what we see or what we hear about them.

00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were alive then

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:15.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave you
this assignment instead of Jonah,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how might you have reacted?

00:19:17.844 --> 00:19:20.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you have thought about the Ninevites

00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:22.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their cruelty
and their wickedness and say,

00:19:22.849 --> 00:19:24.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They can change”?

00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would you feel: ‘It’s impossible!

00:19:26.561 --> 00:19:30.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will never happen—not in a million years’?

00:19:30.231 --> 00:19:32.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s how Jonah felt.

00:19:32.442 --> 00:19:36.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah corrected
his view of his assignment

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:38.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as his view of the people.

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:43.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took that message
and that counsel from Jehovah to heart,

00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:47.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he proclaimed the message
to the people of Nineveh.

00:19:47.832 --> 00:19:50.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly got the Ninevites’ attention,

00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:52.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he might have thought to himself,

00:19:52.253 --> 00:19:54.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, this is the end for me.’

00:19:54.255 --> 00:19:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did they respond?

00:19:56.632 --> 00:20:00.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jonah 3:5;

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:03.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the men of Nineveh put faith in God.”

00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:10.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this surprised even Jonah himself.

00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:13.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king made a proclamation
to all the people

00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:16.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they should do
to demonstrate their faith.

00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:18.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 8; it says:

00:20:18.404 --> 00:20:21.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let them be covered with sackcloth,
both man and beast;

00:20:21.866 --> 00:20:24.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let them call out earnestly to God

00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:29.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and turn from their evil ways
and from the violence they practice.

00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:32.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who knows
whether the true God may reconsider

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what he intends to do
and turn from his burning anger,

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we may not perish?”

00:20:40.009 --> 00:20:44.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped the Ninevites
to change, to acquire faith?

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a direct result
of Jonah accomplishing his assignment

00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:52.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—boldly preaching God’s message.

00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were given the opportunity to change,

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:59.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jonah’s surprise, they did.

00:20:59.153 --> 00:21:01.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jonah had to make changes too.

00:21:01.697 --> 00:21:05.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to take his limited view
of his assignment and the people

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:08.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and change it to the limitless view
that Jehovah had

00:21:08.788 --> 00:21:13.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that people can change,
and Jehovah can stir their hearts.

00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:17.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jonah had to look at himself
and relook at his assignment.

00:21:17.672 --> 00:21:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not the judge.

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not the jury.

00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:23.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a messenger.

00:21:23.469 --> 00:21:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having Jehovah’s view changes everything

00:21:26.722 --> 00:21:29.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how we view others, how we view ourselves,

00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:31.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we view our assignments today.

00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:35.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are ministers who have a message.

00:21:35.398 --> 00:21:38.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not the judges.

00:21:38.192 --> 00:21:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah is the Judge.

00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:43.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did he judge
the Ninevites worthy

00:21:43.531 --> 00:21:46.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being saved and having his mercy?

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:51.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jonah 3:10;

00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:55.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“When the true God saw what they did,

00:21:55.835 --> 00:21:58.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how they had turned back
from their evil ways,

00:21:58.796 --> 00:22:02.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he reconsidered the calamity
that he said he would bring on them,

00:22:02.758 --> 00:22:05.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did not bring it.”

00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:22:09.098 --> 00:22:13.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the changes that the Ninevites
made and how they benefited.

00:22:59.941 --> 00:23:01.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you Jonah?

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:03.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am.

00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:05.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:18.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Ninevites certainly changed
from the first video that we watched.

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Changes that they made on the inside

00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:23.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowed them to make changes on the outside

00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how they viewed their fellow Ninevites,
and how they treated them.

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even their dispositions changed from gloomy,

00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unhappy faces to smiling, happy ones.

00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:37.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were appreciative
of Jonah’s warning message

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as Jehovah’s mercy.

00:23:39.981 --> 00:23:42.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:45.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same lesson that Jonah learned:

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:48.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to show compassion as Jehovah does.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means more than just noticing

00:23:51.033 --> 00:23:54.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone needs help but taking the time

00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:57.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having the desire
to try to relieve that pain.

00:23:57.957 --> 00:23:59.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help them.

00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate
Jehovah’s compassion today?

00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:06.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s by putting compassion into action.

00:24:06.966 --> 00:24:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do by our preaching.

00:24:09.552 --> 00:24:12.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do this for <i>all </i> persons

00:24:12.138 --> 00:24:16.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—giving them an opportunity
to change and not being judgmental—

00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:18.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by viewing them as potential sheep

00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:22.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as our future brother or sister.

00:24:22.648 --> 00:24:24.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the Ninevites, many today

00:24:24.942 --> 00:24:28.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are taught wrong beliefs
and attitudes from childhood.

00:24:28.612 --> 00:24:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it may be difficult
to change but not impossible.

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:35.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help them change?

00:24:35.703 --> 00:24:38.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 4:12 says

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:39.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the word of God” can help.

00:24:39.957 --> 00:24:43.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of God is alive and exerts power.”

00:24:44.712 --> 00:24:49.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us are living proof
of the Bible’s power to change us.

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:51.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before learning the truth,

00:24:51.635 --> 00:24:56.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of us might have been
violent, immoral, faithless.

00:24:56.057 --> 00:25:00.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the apostle Paul said:
“That is what some of you were.”

00:25:00.936 --> 00:25:02.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They changed back then.

00:25:02.938 --> 00:25:04.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are changing today.

00:25:04.982 --> 00:25:08.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the help of God’s Word
and his holy spirit,

00:25:08.152 --> 00:25:10.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can help others change.

00:25:10.237 --> 00:25:12.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot read hearts,

00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:14.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know that Jehovah can,

00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:18.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can stir the heart
and motivate anyone.

00:25:18.954 --> 00:25:20.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do in the meantime?

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:23.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can remember to follow

00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:27.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Romans 10:16 says.

00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:30.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assignment is to be a messenger.

00:25:30.424 --> 00:25:32.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 16:

00:25:32.843 --> 00:25:36.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless, they did not
all obey the good news.

00:25:36.597 --> 00:25:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For Isaiah says: ‘Jehovah, who has put faith
in the thing heard from us?’

00:25:41.477 --> 00:25:44.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So faith follows the thing heard.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, what is heard
is through the word about Christ.”

00:25:48.234 --> 00:25:51.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith follows the thing heard.”

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What motivated the Ninevites to change?

00:25:53.989 --> 00:25:57.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was only after they heard
Jonah’s warning message.

00:25:57.326 --> 00:26:01.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is our hope and prayer
that many will put faith in God

00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:04.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the warning message that we give.

00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:06.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we be like Jonah.

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:10.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be compassionate but bold
in preaching the good news to all.

00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:12.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who knows?

00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:15.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Faith may follow the things heard.’

00:26:15.052 --> 00:26:18.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it is possible.

00:26:18.347 --> 00:26:21.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithless people can acquire faith.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next part of this symposium,

00:26:28.816 --> 00:26:32.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember—Faithless People
Can Acquire Faith!

00:26:32.111 --> 00:26:34.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus’ Fleshly Brothers.”

00:26:41.454 --> 00:26:45.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have relatives
who are presently not serving Jehovah?

00:26:45.958 --> 00:26:47.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think most of us do.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re not alone.

00:26:49.962 --> 00:26:53.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even our Lord Jesus
had that same circumstance.

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though his half brothers knew
about the miracles he was performing,

00:26:58.721 --> 00:27:01.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says that they were not

00:27:01.932 --> 00:27:06.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was so bad
—can you imagine?—

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when Jesus was being put to death,

00:27:11.775 --> 00:27:14.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it appears that his brothers were not there.

00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:18.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the account
when Jesus was on the torture stake

00:27:18.365 --> 00:27:20.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he looked down at the disciple

00:27:20.618 --> 00:27:25.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked him basically
to become responsible for His mother?

00:27:25.623 --> 00:27:28.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t there to support Him.

00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:32.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened just a short while

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after Jesus had been resurrected?

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:37.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was amazing

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:40.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because some of those
half brothers were found,

00:27:40.554 --> 00:27:45.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with Jesus’ mother,
with the disciples fervently praying.

00:27:45.434 --> 00:27:48.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt?

00:27:48.437 --> 00:27:51.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine the joy
he must have experienced

00:27:51.315 --> 00:27:55.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them now beginning to express faith?

00:27:55.569 --> 00:27:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe you’ve had that experience too.

00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe one of your relatives

00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:04.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe your mate,
one of your children, one of your siblings—

00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has now come to serve Jehovah.

00:28:06.747 --> 00:28:08.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:10.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyful feeling!

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, nothing could compare to it.

00:28:12.753 --> 00:28:14.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was it

00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:19.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped Jesus’ half brothers
to go from being faithless

00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:21.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to putting faith in him?

00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:24.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can you
and I learn from that example?

00:28:24.932 --> 00:28:27.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address that question.

00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:31.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that helped
Jesus’ brothers to acquire faith?

00:28:31.897 --> 00:28:34.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s the number one thing:

00:28:34.733 --> 00:28:39.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was patient with his relatives.

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an important point,

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:44.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because look at how Jesus
was treated by his relatives.

00:28:44.994 --> 00:28:49.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you look with me at Mark 3:21?

00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:54.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says there:
“But when his relatives heard about it,

00:28:54.962 --> 00:28:57.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they went out to seize him,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for they were saying:
‘He has gone out of his mind.’”

00:29:02.261 --> 00:29:05.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not take offense

00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:07.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even though his relatives
were trying to seize him

00:29:07.349 --> 00:29:10.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even though they said he had gone crazy.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:14.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have your relatives perhaps
said some things like that to you?

00:29:14.648 --> 00:29:17.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not take offense.

00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:19.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was patient.

00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:23.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in fact, after his resurrection,
look at what Jesus did.

00:29:23.824 --> 00:29:26.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:29:26.952 --> 00:29:29.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together verse 7.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “After that he appeared to James,

00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then to all the apostles.”

00:29:37.087 --> 00:29:41.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is just a very small detail,
but did you notice what it said?

00:29:41.425 --> 00:29:44.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “[Jesus] appeared to James.”

00:29:44.678 --> 00:29:49.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, we don’t know what Jesus
said to James when He appeared to him.

00:29:49.683 --> 00:29:54.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is
that Jesus made a special effort

00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appear to His half brother James.

00:29:57.733 --> 00:30:00.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, James must have deeply appreciated

00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:03.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that special attention from Jesus.

00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:05.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do we say that?

00:30:05.407 --> 00:30:08.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, James went on to become

00:30:08.994 --> 00:30:12.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a respected elder
in the congregation in Jerusalem.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, you may remember
that in Acts chapter 15,

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:19.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the apostles and older men
gathered in Jerusalem

00:30:19.963 --> 00:30:22.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to consider the matter about circumcision,

00:30:22.883 --> 00:30:27.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that James was the one
who was presiding at that meeting.

00:30:27.888 --> 00:30:30.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what had happened?

00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:34.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James had gone from being a faithless person

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to now being a pillar in the congregation.

00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:41.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James and His other half brother Jude

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both had the privilege of writing letters

00:30:44.488 --> 00:30:48.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were included
in the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:30:48.492 --> 00:30:50.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, in the following video,

00:30:50.619 --> 00:30:52.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please take careful note

00:30:52.621 --> 00:30:57.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what helped a family member
to be a person with faith.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth came to our home
through my mother.

00:31:04.508 --> 00:31:07.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was never seriously interested
in the truth.

00:31:09.012 --> 00:31:11.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we grew up,
education was very important.

00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:15.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person needed to make money
and live a lavish life.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the life I chose

00:31:18.647 --> 00:31:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to study, to get higher education—

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could have what others had.

00:31:24.486 --> 00:31:27.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although they could see
that I wasn’t interested in the truth,

00:31:27.197 --> 00:31:30.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother and brother did not give up on me.

00:31:30.868 --> 00:31:33.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back from school in January, 

00:31:33.996 --> 00:31:37.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother ordered the <i>Examining</i>
<i>the Scriptures Daily</i>  booklet for me.

00:31:38.751 --> 00:31:43.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Year after year, I always had
the <i>Examining the Scriptures Daily </i> booklet

00:31:43.172 --> 00:31:45.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Bible.

00:31:45.257 --> 00:31:48.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She made sure
that although I wasn’t attending meetings,

00:31:48.552 --> 00:31:50.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least I had literature.

00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides that, my younger brother,
the one I was close to,

00:31:57.227 --> 00:32:01.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided to take the truth seriously.

00:32:01.106 --> 00:32:03.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back from school,

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw my brother
getting a Bible study of his own,

00:32:06.236 --> 00:32:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was surprised to see him

00:32:08.238 --> 00:32:11.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
studying the Bible
and noticed that he had prepared.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cared about
and loved what he was learning.

00:32:15.954 --> 00:32:20.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I understood
that the Bible changes lives.

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:23.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that comes to mind

00:32:23.378 --> 00:32:27.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Hosea 11:4.

00:32:27.466 --> 00:32:30.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it shows that Jehovah

00:32:30.385 --> 00:32:33.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pulls us with “cords of love” and “kindness.”

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my situation, Jehovah did this.

00:32:38.393 --> 00:32:41.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I made the decision to be regular
at the congregation meetings,

00:32:43.315 --> 00:32:47.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I finally started studying
the Bible with someone in 2007

00:32:47.027 --> 00:32:49.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got baptized in 2008.

00:32:49.154 --> 00:32:52.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family really encouraged me;

00:32:52.783 --> 00:32:54.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they never gave up on me.

00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:56.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I encourage parents

00:32:56.787 --> 00:32:58.831 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not to give up on their children.

00:33:00.666 --> 00:33:04.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must continue encouraging them
and have the hope

00:33:04.545 --> 00:33:08.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God
will draw them to the organization

00:33:08.048 --> 00:33:10.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have good hearts.

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:16.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters, we want

00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:20.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that same experience for our relatives.

00:33:20.018 --> 00:33:25.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to help them to grow in faith?

00:33:25.023 --> 00:33:27.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s talk briefly about three things.

00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:29.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first one:

00:33:29.903 --> 00:33:33.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be patient with your relatives.

00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:37.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to imitate the example
of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:33:37.953 --> 00:33:42.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when the nation of Israel
went astray so many times?

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:45.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in Jeremiah chapter 44,

00:33:45.544 --> 00:33:48.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says that Jehovah sent his prophets

00:33:48.797 --> 00:33:51.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“again and again.”

00:33:51.174 --> 00:33:54.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was very patient with his people.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:57.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be patient with our relatives too.

00:33:57.639 --> 00:34:00.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t give up on them.

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:03.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then second, we want to be tactful.

00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:08.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to look for ways that we
can stimulate their interest in the truth.

00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:12.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it’s true, Jesus described
the message of the truth

00:34:12.613 --> 00:34:16.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like “water” that could
lead to “everlasting life.”

00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:20.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But have you ever tried
to drink from a fire hydrant?

00:34:20.245 --> 00:34:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very difficult thing to do.

00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:26.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want our relatives to choke

00:34:26.793 --> 00:34:29.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re forcing too much information

00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:32.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with too much force, or power.

00:34:32.424 --> 00:34:34.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,

00:34:34.051 --> 00:34:38.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want our relatives
to feel refreshed by the truth.

00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:42.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whether our relatives
feel choked or refreshed

00:34:42.517 --> 00:34:47.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will really depend on how we
go about explaining the truth to them.

00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:51.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be tactful and speak
to them in a loving way

00:34:51.526 --> 00:34:54.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will stimulate their interest.

00:34:54.446 --> 00:34:57.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to that third point:

00:34:57.115 --> 00:34:59.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to show empathy

00:34:59.284 --> 00:35:03.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our relatives
and let our conduct speak for us.

00:35:03.622 --> 00:35:05.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when we first learn the truth,

00:35:05.749 --> 00:35:09.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relatives may not be sure of how this

00:35:09.336 --> 00:35:12.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now going to affect
our relationship with them.

00:35:12.214 --> 00:35:16.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of thinking of many,
many different things that we could say,

00:35:16.718 --> 00:35:20.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important to remember that what we do

00:35:20.472 --> 00:35:23.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to speak far more loudly

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the things that we say.

00:35:25.352 --> 00:35:27.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, there is a saying that says:

00:35:27.354 --> 00:35:30.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’d rather see a sermon than hear one.”

00:35:30.857 --> 00:35:32.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:35:32.484 --> 00:35:36.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister named Pauline realized
that instead of talking to her husband

00:35:36.697 --> 00:35:40.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much about the truth,
she needed to set a good example.

00:35:40.909 --> 00:35:43.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when her husband
observed the good effect

00:35:43.996 --> 00:35:47.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible was having on his wife
and on his children,

00:35:47.624 --> 00:35:51.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was the thing that opened
his mind and opened his heart

00:35:51.712 --> 00:35:54.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the message of the good news.

00:35:54.006 --> 00:35:56.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just don’t know, brothers and sisters,

00:35:56.717 --> 00:36:01.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good effect of your conduct,
of your example, on your relatives.

00:36:01.638 --> 00:36:03.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, about two years ago,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was out in California
at a regional convention

00:36:06.643 --> 00:36:10.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a sister came up to me with two brothers.

00:36:10.397 --> 00:36:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, she had been raised

00:36:12.482 --> 00:36:15.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by her faithful mother in the truth,

00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:19.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had gone away
from the truth for more than 30 years.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She watched a broadcast,
and she was moved to return.

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:26.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She then reached out to her brother

00:36:26.288 --> 00:36:30.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was also away from the truth
for more than 30 years.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He decided to come back too.

00:36:32.127 --> 00:36:35.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the two of them
reached out to their other brother

00:36:35.547 --> 00:36:40.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was also away for more than 30 years,
and he also came back.

00:36:40.343 --> 00:36:42.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the three of them were in front of me.

00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:44.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the sister said:

00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:48.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think my mother is going to have
to be resurrected twice.

00:36:48.268 --> 00:36:52.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were all out of the truth when she died.

00:36:52.147 --> 00:36:54.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When she sees us in the new world,

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she’ll be so shocked that I’m sure
she’ll need to be resurrected again.”

00:36:59.112 --> 00:37:01.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:37:01.114 --> 00:37:05.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good example
of their mother stayed with them

00:37:05.118 --> 00:37:08.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even long after their mother had passed away.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:37:10.582 --> 00:37:14.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can use you to help your relatives.

00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:17.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might be faithless right now,

00:37:17.047 --> 00:37:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with your help,
they can become full of faith.

00:37:21.384 --> 00:37:23.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It worked in the case of Jesus,

00:37:23.553 --> 00:37:25.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can work for you too.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:31.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:37:31.103 --> 00:37:33.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the next talk
of this symposium,

00:37:33.939 --> 00:37:37.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember—Faithless People
Can Acquire Faith!

00:37:37.984 --> 00:37:39.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Prominent Ones.”

00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:50.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago, a brother in Mexico
from the rurals,

00:37:50.747 --> 00:37:54.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dressed in very simple country garb,

00:37:54.334 --> 00:37:57.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knocked at the door of a palatial mansion.

00:37:57.671 --> 00:38:02.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man in a silken bathrobe responded
and asked what he wanted.

00:38:02.175 --> 00:38:04.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Witness said,

00:38:04.177 --> 00:38:08.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a mule should come to your door
with two bags of gold,

00:38:08.223 --> 00:38:10.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you accept it?”

00:38:10.267 --> 00:38:12.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Annoyed, the householder replied:

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:15.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not understand what you’re telling me.

00:38:15.438 --> 00:38:19.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am a famous engineer.”

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:21.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Witness then asked him,

00:38:21.403 --> 00:38:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you understand about prophecies?”

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:27.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man admitted that he did not know
anything about them.

00:38:27.784 --> 00:38:30.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the Witness said:

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is what I want to speak to you about.

00:38:32.956 --> 00:38:35.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am that mule that came to your door,

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the two bags of gold
are these magazines:

00:38:38.753 --> 00:38:40.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  and <i>Awake!” </i>

00:38:41.756 --> 00:38:44.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man was impressed by the presentation
of this humble Witness

00:38:44.968 --> 00:38:47.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took the two magazines.

00:38:47.596 --> 00:38:50.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that man come into the truth?

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:38:52.142 --> 00:38:55.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know
is that our humble brother

00:38:55.395 --> 00:39:00.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave that man an opportunity
for Jehovah to stir his heart.

00:39:01.443 --> 00:39:06.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century, many prominent Jews
hesitated to follow Jesus

00:39:06.198 --> 00:39:09.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they feared becoming outcasts.

00:39:09.201 --> 00:39:14.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in the Gospel
of John chapter 12 says:

00:39:14.206 --> 00:39:17.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many even of the rulers

00:39:17.959 --> 00:39:20.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“actually put faith in him,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they would not acknowledge him
because of the Pharisees,

00:39:24.299 --> 00:39:26.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they would not be expelled

00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:28.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the synagogue.”

00:39:29.596 --> 00:39:33.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, some overcame social pressure

00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:36.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took a stand for Jesus.

00:39:36.436 --> 00:39:40.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us of “Joseph of Arimathea,

00:39:40.398 --> 00:39:42.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a reputable member of the Council,

00:39:42.651 --> 00:39:45.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who . . . took courage
and went in before Pilate

00:39:45.153 --> 00:39:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked for the body of Jesus.”

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:50.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the book of Acts reports

00:39:50.742 --> 00:39:53.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the word of God
continued to spread, . . .

00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:57.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a large crowd of priests
began to be obedient to the faith.”

00:39:59.084 --> 00:40:03.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An outstanding example of a prominent one
is Saul of Tarsus,

00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:06.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who later became the apostle Paul.

00:40:06.925 --> 00:40:08.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a Pharisee

00:40:08.927 --> 00:40:12.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one who persecuted Jewish Christians.

00:40:12.639 --> 00:40:15.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He admitted this, saying:

00:40:15.642 --> 00:40:19.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I persecuted this Way to the point of death,

00:40:19.521 --> 00:40:24.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
binding and handing over to prisons
both men and women.”

00:40:25.151 --> 00:40:28.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he changed and became
a zealous preacher

00:40:28.321 --> 00:40:30.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an apostle.

00:40:30.824 --> 00:40:35.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly today, some who had
a high social position in this world

00:40:35.704 --> 00:40:38.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have become believers.

00:40:38.623 --> 00:40:42.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Saul acquire faith?

00:40:42.168 --> 00:40:44.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s let Paul tell us.

00:40:44.462 --> 00:40:48.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Acts chapter 22,

00:40:48.675 --> 00:40:52.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 6 through 8.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 22:6-8,

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:

00:40:59.894 --> 00:41:01.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as I was traveling

00:41:01.896 --> 00:41:05.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and getting near to Damascus,
about midday,

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“suddenly out of heaven a great light

00:41:08.653 --> 00:41:10.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“flashed all around me,

00:41:10.864 --> 00:41:14.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I fell to the ground
and heard a voice say to me:

00:41:14.284 --> 00:41:17.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Saul, Saul,

00:41:17.203 --> 00:41:20.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“why are you persecuting me?’

00:41:20.248 --> 00:41:24.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I answered: ‘Who are you, Lord?’

00:41:24.252 --> 00:41:28.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he said to me: ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene,

00:41:28.673 --> 00:41:30.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom you are persecuting.’”

00:41:32.093 --> 00:41:34.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it was by Jesus

00:41:34.095 --> 00:41:37.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
miraculously appearing to Saul
and identifying himself.

00:41:37.557 --> 00:41:40.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A shocking event!

00:41:40.226 --> 00:41:43.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, Saul completely changed

00:41:43.688 --> 00:41:46.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his values and priorities in life.

00:41:46.483 --> 00:41:48.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, he was inspired to write something

00:41:48.735 --> 00:41:53.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reflects
an entirely different viewpoint.

00:41:53.114 --> 00:41:55.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it.

00:41:55.116 --> 00:41:59.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in the book of Philippians chapter 3,

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:02.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what he says in verses 7 and 8:

00:42:04.334 --> 00:42:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yet, the things that were gains to me,

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have considered loss
on account of the Christ.

00:42:11.633 --> 00:42:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What is more, I do indeed also consider
all things to be loss

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on account of the excelling value

00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:21.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.

00:42:21.643 --> 00:42:25.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For his sake I have taken
the loss of all things

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I consider them as a lot of refuse,

00:42:28.858 --> 00:42:31.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I may gain Christ.”

00:42:32.821 --> 00:42:37.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that moved Paul
to have such a change?

00:42:37.242 --> 00:42:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used a startling occasion
to stir Paul’s heart.

00:42:43.289 --> 00:42:46.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
World events, personal tragedy,

00:42:46.334 --> 00:42:51.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other changed circumstances,
though not initiated by Jehovah,

00:42:51.172 --> 00:42:54.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause a person
prominent in this system of things

00:42:54.467 --> 00:42:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reevaluate his or her life

00:42:57.262 --> 00:42:59.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to the good news.

00:42:59.764 --> 00:43:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a person may realize
that high social status

00:43:03.268 --> 00:43:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not offer a solution to life’s problems.

00:43:07.147 --> 00:43:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note how changing circumstances

00:43:10.733 --> 00:43:12.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can affect a person’s thinking.

00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:16.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
During my high-school years,

00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:19.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would work at a shipyard

00:43:19.742 --> 00:43:21.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a third-class welder.

00:43:21.744 --> 00:43:23.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult.

00:43:23.663 --> 00:43:27.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the summertime,
it was real hot on the water.

00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just said: “Wow!

00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I’m going to have to do this
for 30 or 40 years,

00:43:31.171 --> 00:43:33.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to find something better.”

00:43:34.174 --> 00:43:36.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that period of time, “successful” meant

00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a good job, a lot of money, comfort.”

00:43:39.888 --> 00:43:43.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I went through college in four years

00:43:43.224 --> 00:43:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got an accounting degree.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:48.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I would get a transfer,
I would get promoted.

00:43:48.188 --> 00:43:51.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went from Africa to Belgium,

00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:53.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Belgium to Scotland,

00:43:53.526 --> 00:43:55.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Scotland back to the U.S.,

00:43:55.945 --> 00:43:58.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then from the U.S. to Singapore.

00:43:58.156 --> 00:44:00.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was really a big jump

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:05.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—nice cars, a driver,

00:44:05.038 --> 00:44:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting a whole lot of money in the bank.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And every time
I would reach one of these goals,

00:44:11.294 --> 00:44:13.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I would sit at the table and say:

00:44:13.505 --> 00:44:16.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now—now we’re going to be happy.

00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:19.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re going to finally start
to be able to enjoy this.”

00:44:19.511 --> 00:44:22.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was like something fleeting.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just wasn’t there.

00:44:24.432 --> 00:44:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The emptiness was growing bigger.

00:44:26.643 --> 00:44:29.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was getting— 
The hole was getting larger.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were just perplexed.

00:44:30.897 --> 00:44:34.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know where to go
to find any kind of joy or happiness.

00:44:35.235 --> 00:44:37.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, my daughter,

00:44:37.862 --> 00:44:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had a baby shop.

00:44:40.532 --> 00:44:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sold baby clothes
and small baby furniture.

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:44.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She and her husband ran the shop.

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:47.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they hired this young girl

00:44:47.622 --> 00:44:49.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with the store
and to help with their children.

00:44:49.707 --> 00:44:52.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when she wasn’t busy
with the store and with the children,

00:44:52.877 --> 00:44:56.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she’d pull open her Bible
and she would be reading her Bible.

00:44:56.756 --> 00:44:59.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they asked this young girl,

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:01.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know anybody

00:45:01.469 --> 00:45:04.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could study with the two kids?”

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “I have the perfect people,
the perfect couple.”

00:45:08.476 --> 00:45:10.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they set up a study

00:45:10.478 --> 00:45:12.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the following week
on one night during the week.

00:45:12.814 --> 00:45:17.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my daughter called me and said:
“Dad, can you come to this Bible study?

00:45:17.652 --> 00:45:19.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t know these people.

00:45:19.696 --> 00:45:23.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you just need to be there
to make sure it’s on the up-and-up.”

00:45:23.616 --> 00:45:27.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I came to that first Bible study,
and I watched it.

00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:29.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just sat there amazed!

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the study was over,
I asked them, I said,

00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:36.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would y’all be interested
in studying with me?”

00:45:38.506 --> 00:45:41.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, in the world,
you may hit these goals,

00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then very quickly after that,

00:45:44.596 --> 00:45:47.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you go way down
and then you stay way down.

00:45:47.807 --> 00:45:50.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth brings you constant joy.

00:45:50.768 --> 00:45:52.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing like it.

00:45:52.812 --> 00:45:55.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just complete satisfaction,

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just know now
you’re doing the right thing.

00:45:58.026 --> 00:46:01.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s just changed our whole life now
and our whole attitude.

00:46:01.154 --> 00:46:06.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are just so very content and happy.

00:46:08.786 --> 00:46:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers, we are being encouraged

00:46:11.414 --> 00:46:15.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give a bold witness to prominent ones.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s natural that at times we may feel
intimidated by prominent ones

00:46:19.631 --> 00:46:22.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hesitate to give a witness,

00:46:22.634 --> 00:46:26.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let’s be determined to imitate Jesus.

00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:28.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way?

00:46:28.473 --> 00:46:33.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Isaiah 11:3 says about him:

00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:39.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will find delight
in the fear of Jehovah.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will not judge
by what appears to his eyes,

00:46:43.154 --> 00:46:47.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor reprove simply according
to what his ears hear.”

00:46:48.618 --> 00:46:50.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that?

00:46:50.912 --> 00:46:52.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like Jesus,

00:46:52.914 --> 00:46:56.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who does not judge
by what appears to his eyes,

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not want to predetermine
a person’s response

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their outward appearance,
their large homes,

00:47:02.757 --> 00:47:05.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their prominence, or their position.

00:47:06.219 --> 00:47:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also want to imitate the apostle Paul

00:47:09.097 --> 00:47:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his attitude after he became a Christian.

00:47:12.642 --> 00:47:14.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what he says

00:47:14.894 --> 00:47:19.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Romans chapter 1.

00:47:19.357 --> 00:47:23.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to key in to verse 16.

00:47:23.444 --> 00:47:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 1:16.

00:47:30.743 --> 00:47:34.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll read
the first part of that verse.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:47:36.582 --> 00:47:41.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am not ashamed of the good news.”

00:47:42.171 --> 00:47:44.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, under inspiration, he then comments

00:47:44.632 --> 00:47:48.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the effectiveness
of preaching the good news

00:47:48.136 --> 00:47:50.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he says:

00:47:50.138 --> 00:47:54.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It [that is, the good news]

00:47:54.267 --> 00:47:57.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is, in fact, God’s power for salvation

00:47:57.937 --> 00:48:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to everyone having faith,

00:48:00.523 --> 00:48:03.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.”

00:48:05.194 --> 00:48:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s be determined

00:48:07.196 --> 00:48:10.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach boldly to all,

00:48:10.908 --> 00:48:15.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving Jehovah the opportunity
to stir the hearts of those who listen.

00:48:17.415 --> 00:48:19.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris of the Governing Body

00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:23.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:48:23.087 --> 00:48:27.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember
—Faithless People Can Acquire Faith!

00:48:27.425 --> 00:48:29.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nonreligious People.”

00:48:36.142 --> 00:48:39.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to use your imagination
for a moment.

00:48:39.645 --> 00:48:43.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to when you were having
a conversation

00:48:43.024 --> 00:48:47.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone who you respect,
and they’re in a position of authority.

00:48:47.779 --> 00:48:52.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, during the conversation,
this person says to you

00:48:52.074 --> 00:48:54.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(coming up to certain points),

00:48:54.076 --> 00:48:56.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they say: “Remember.

00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:59.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to remember this.”

00:48:59.207 --> 00:49:03.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is what Jehovah has done for us
in this symposium.

00:49:03.753 --> 00:49:06.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When somebody says “remember,”

00:49:06.547 --> 00:49:10.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then most people stop and they refocus

00:49:10.384 --> 00:49:13.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and concentrate even more.

00:49:13.679 --> 00:49:18.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does Jehovah want us to remember
with this specific part?

00:49:18.643 --> 00:49:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many people who are not religious

00:49:22.939 --> 00:49:26.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can acquire faith.

00:49:26.692 --> 00:49:28.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you think about how every year

00:49:28.694 --> 00:49:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are people
who were atheists or agnostics

00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have come into the truth.

00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:38.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the lesson in this part is this:

00:49:38.371 --> 00:49:40.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not hold back

00:49:40.873 --> 00:49:45.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from witnessing to people
who are nonreligious.

00:49:45.044 --> 00:49:49.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t want to take the position
as if we’re the judge of this:

00:49:49.924 --> 00:49:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, they wouldn’t be interested
—they’re an atheist; they’re an agnostic;

00:49:53.803 --> 00:49:56.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re wrapped up with materialism.’

00:49:56.722 --> 00:50:00.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not our position to take.

00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:02.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be individuals

00:50:02.812 --> 00:50:05.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who Jehovah believes will try to help

00:50:05.565 --> 00:50:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these nonreligious individuals.

00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:11.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what Paul writes here

00:50:11.863 --> 00:50:15.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Romans chapter 10.

00:50:15.324 --> 00:50:18.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll find out
how some have changed their mind

00:50:18.744 --> 00:50:21.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after an exposure to the truth

00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:24.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jehovah’s teaching.

00:50:24.208 --> 00:50:27.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the only way
that they could acquire faith

00:50:27.795 --> 00:50:29.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when this is done.

00:50:29.881 --> 00:50:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice carefully and pay attention,

00:50:33.009 --> 00:50:37.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 10:13-15:

00:50:37.305 --> 00:50:40.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For ‘everyone who calls
on the name of Jehovah

00:50:40.725 --> 00:50:42.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be saved.’

00:50:42.727 --> 00:50:46.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, how will they call on him

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if they have not put faith in him?

00:50:48.941 --> 00:50:51.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How, in turn, will they put faith in him

00:50:51.694 --> 00:50:54.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about whom they have not heard?

00:50:54.405 --> 00:50:56.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How, in turn, will they hear

00:50:56.782 --> 00:50:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“without someone to preach?

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How, in turn, will they preach

00:51:01.162 --> 00:51:04.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“unless they have been sent out?

00:51:04.332 --> 00:51:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as it is written:

00:51:06.542 --> 00:51:09.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How beautiful are the feet

00:51:09.211 --> 00:51:11.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘of those who declare good news

00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:14.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of good things!’”

00:51:14.133 --> 00:51:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:51:15.718 --> 00:51:19.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how an individual acquires faith,

00:51:19.639 --> 00:51:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by answering these questions
—very penetrating questions—

00:51:23.726 --> 00:51:26.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of us want to remember

00:51:26.312 --> 00:51:28.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to witnessing to people

00:51:28.856 --> 00:51:32.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are nonreligious.

00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need someone
to share the good news with them

00:51:35.738 --> 00:51:39.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to do it in such a way
that touches their heart.

00:51:39.325 --> 00:51:40.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep that in mind.

00:51:40.618 --> 00:51:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It isn’t always just what we say;

00:51:43.746 --> 00:51:47.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s how we say it that matters.

00:51:47.875 --> 00:51:51.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody has to share
the good news with them

00:51:51.337 --> 00:51:53.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they’re going to acquire faith.

00:51:53.506 --> 00:51:56.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question arises here,

00:51:56.384 --> 00:51:59.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we share Bible truths in a way

00:51:59.345 --> 00:52:01.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nonreligious people

00:52:01.347 --> 00:52:05.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are more likely to accept?

00:52:05.476 --> 00:52:07.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good question.

00:52:07.186 --> 00:52:10.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in helping nonreligious people
acquire faith,

00:52:10.773 --> 00:52:14.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s an important point
that the apostle Paul shared with us

00:52:14.944 --> 00:52:17.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his first letter to the Corinthians.

00:52:17.279 --> 00:52:19.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So find 1 Corinthians

00:52:19.615 --> 00:52:22.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 9, if you would, please

00:52:22.868 --> 00:52:25.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians chapter 9.

00:52:25.579 --> 00:52:28.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the 22nd verse:

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the weak I became weak,

00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to gain the weak.

00:52:34.964 --> 00:52:38.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:52:38.509 --> 00:52:41.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might by all possible means

00:52:41.762 --> 00:52:43.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
save some.”

00:52:43.764 --> 00:52:45.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:52:45.307 --> 00:52:48.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example the apostle Paul was

00:52:48.644 --> 00:52:52.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with adapting to his audience!

00:52:52.606 --> 00:52:55.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d speak one way to the Jews,

00:52:55.443 --> 00:52:58.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referencing the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:52:58.404 --> 00:53:00.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then different to the Greeks,

00:53:00.573 --> 00:53:03.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who didn’t know about Jehovah God.

00:53:03.034 --> 00:53:05.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the message is

00:53:05.202 --> 00:53:09.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak to them about topics
that might interest them.

00:53:09.498 --> 00:53:12.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had to share this issue with you.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The July 2019, <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:53:17.465 --> 00:53:20.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 22-23.

00:53:20.468 --> 00:53:22.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these are some points

00:53:22.636 --> 00:53:25.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can keep in mind
when it comes to witnessing

00:53:25.139 --> 00:53:28.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to nonreligious people

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very, very good advice.

00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:36.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the point here
when it comes to nature.

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:40.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of people, they might even be
atheists or agnostics,

00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:42.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love nature.

00:53:42.823 --> 00:53:45.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So using that as a basis

00:53:45.326 --> 00:53:48.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a conversation
is the course of wisdom.

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:51.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say something like:
“You probably know

00:53:51.415 --> 00:53:54.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that many inventions came about

00:53:54.126 --> 00:53:59.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when scientists copied things
that already existed in nature.

00:53:59.006 --> 00:54:02.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For instance, microphone designers

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“study ears,

00:54:04.678 --> 00:54:08.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and camera designers study eyes.

00:54:08.099 --> 00:54:11.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What comes to your mind
when you think of nature?

00:54:11.685 --> 00:54:14.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think that it is a marvelous force,

00:54:14.188 --> 00:54:16.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a person, or something else?”

00:54:16.941 --> 00:54:20.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now listen attentively
when you ask questions like that.

00:54:21.862 --> 00:54:24.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then add, maybe:

00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:27.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When engineers learn
from the design of ears and eyes,

00:54:27.368 --> 00:54:31.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we might wonder whom they are learning from.

00:54:31.038 --> 00:54:35.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was intrigued by something
an ancient poet [said].”

00:54:35.459 --> 00:54:38.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is wise because the poet is

00:54:38.546 --> 00:54:41.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the psalmist from Psalm 94:9, 10.

00:54:41.966 --> 00:54:43.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you could say ancient poet.

00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:45.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s appropriate.

00:54:45.177 --> 00:54:47.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s the quote:

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One who made the ear, can he not hear?

00:54:51.559 --> 00:54:56.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One who formed the eye,
can he not see?

00:54:56.021 --> 00:54:59.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . He is the One who imparts knowledge
to people!”

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:00.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:55:00.818 --> 00:55:03.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good questions to ask and discuss

00:55:03.821 --> 00:55:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with nonreligious people.

00:55:05.948 --> 00:55:10.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we have
the marvelous website, jw.org;

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:14.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve got
the “Viewpoints on the Origin of Life,”

00:55:14.081 --> 00:55:17.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a number of videos that can help them.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:22.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the same time, we want to have
compassion, empathy,

00:55:22.339 --> 00:55:24.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try to reach their heart.

00:55:24.425 --> 00:55:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were some key points,
just to pass them on to you

00:55:28.637 --> 00:55:33.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you want to keep in mind talking
—giving a witness to nonreligious people):

00:55:33.601 --> 00:55:35.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be positive.

00:55:35.686 --> 00:55:39.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind that “every year
 there are nonreligious people

00:55:39.273 --> 00:55:41.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who [have] become Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:55:41.483 --> 00:55:43.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is important.

00:55:43.485 --> 00:55:46.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be kind and tactful,

00:55:46.572 --> 00:55:49.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because people will listen

00:55:49.283 --> 00:55:53.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘not just because of what we say,
but how we say it.’

00:55:53.078 --> 00:55:55.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re going to reach a heart,

00:55:55.706 --> 00:55:57.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak from the heart.

00:55:57.708 --> 00:56:00.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be kind and tactful,

00:56:00.586 --> 00:56:04.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imitate Jesus in the way he witnessed.

00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:08.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such compassion and love was always evident.

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:10.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then this point:

00:56:10.095 --> 00:56:14.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be understanding and listen.

00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:18.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so crucial to remember to listen.

00:56:18.395 --> 00:56:22.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes (and sincere Witnesses do it),

00:56:22.316 --> 00:56:24.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we talk too much.

00:56:24.318 --> 00:56:28.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask a question,
and they have two seconds to answer.

00:56:28.155 --> 00:56:30.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next thing, we’re talking already,

00:56:30.241 --> 00:56:32.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have to listen.

00:56:32.576 --> 00:56:36.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are not being listened to today.

00:56:36.622 --> 00:56:38.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let that be us.

00:56:38.999 --> 00:56:42.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be understanding and listen to them.

00:56:42.503 --> 00:56:44.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let them express themselves,

00:56:44.964 --> 00:56:49.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you show you have
empathy and love for them.

00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:53.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep these thoughts in mind,
and Jehovah will bless your efforts.

00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:56.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the following video,

00:56:56.892 --> 00:57:01.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what has attracted nonreligious people

00:57:01.438 --> 00:57:03.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the truth.

00:57:05.276 --> 00:57:08.445 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My family were nonpracticing Catholics,

00:57:08.445 --> 00:57:12.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so I was never taught to believe in God.

00:57:12.283 --> 00:57:16.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trusted my teachers more than anyone else,

00:57:18.247 --> 00:57:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I accepted
and loved the theory of evolution.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 19, a childhood friend

00:57:26.297 --> 00:57:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had become one
of Jehovah’s Witnesses started to call on me.

00:57:31.176 --> 00:57:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked talking to him, but when
he spoke to me about God, I told him,

00:57:35.806 --> 00:57:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, stop talking about God
because I don’t believe in him.”

00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up on me.

00:57:44.523 --> 00:57:46.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked, “Why won’t you,

00:57:46.525 --> 00:57:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just for a moment,
entertain a conversation about God?”

00:57:51.864 --> 00:57:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This question made me think.

00:57:54.325 --> 00:57:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had rejected his arguments
without even listening to them.

00:57:59.163 --> 00:58:01.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to give the impression

00:58:01.165 --> 00:58:04.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being arrogant or stubborn.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Why not let him speak?’

00:58:11.842 --> 00:58:14.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the book <i>Life</i>—<i>How Did It Get Here?</i>

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>By Evolution or by Creation?</i>

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if a veil
had been lifted from my eyes.

00:58:21.769 --> 00:58:24.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment Jehovah

00:58:24.772 --> 00:58:26.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
introduced himself to me.

00:58:27.524 --> 00:58:31.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, I understood
that my life has a purpose.

00:58:32.237 --> 00:58:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I regret that I didn’t know Jehovah

00:58:35.282 --> 00:58:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first 20 years of my life.

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt

00:58:42.539 --> 00:58:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most precious thing I have.

00:58:45.042 --> 00:58:47.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am determined to witness

00:58:47.419 --> 00:58:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah to everyone I meet,

00:58:49.546 --> 00:58:53.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially to those without faith,

00:58:53.884 --> 00:58:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they too can appreciate

00:58:56.178 --> 00:58:58.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wonderful qualities of our Creator.

00:59:04.353 --> 00:59:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:59:06.021 --> 00:59:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonreligious people are accepting the truth.

00:59:11.026 --> 00:59:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can acquire faith,

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:17.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those beautiful experiences
prove that point.

00:59:17.991 --> 00:59:21.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again we say, “Remember

00:59:21.036 --> 00:59:25.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Faithless People Can Acquire Faith!”

00:59:25.499 --> 00:59:29.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think back to the Ninevites,

00:59:29.378 --> 00:59:33.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ fleshly brothers, and prominent Jews

00:59:33.674 --> 00:59:36.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they all made great changes.

00:59:36.969 --> 00:59:40.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today as in the past,
here’s what is happening

00:59:40.264 --> 00:59:44.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned here in 1 Timothy chapter 2

00:59:45.436 --> 00:59:47.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Timothy chapter 2,

00:59:47.896 --> 00:59:52.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it mentions in the fourth verse
about Jehovah’s will:

00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . whose will is that all sorts of people

00:59:56.405 --> 00:59:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be saved
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:59:59.533 --> 01:00:01.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Jehovah’s will.

01:00:01.368 --> 01:00:05.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve dedicated our lives to him
to do Jehovah’s will.

01:00:05.956 --> 01:00:08.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all sorts of people

01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:11.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are acquiring faith in Jehovah

01:00:11.336 --> 01:00:14.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
year after year.

01:00:14.339 --> 01:00:19.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we encourage you to give
a bold but tactful witness

01:00:19.344 --> 01:00:21.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your unbelieving relatives

01:00:21.972 --> 01:00:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as to prominent ones

01:00:24.308 --> 01:00:28.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to nonreligious people.

01:00:29.354 --> 01:00:32.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we continue to preach to all,

01:00:32.316 --> 01:00:34.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make it grow.

01:00:34.526 --> 01:00:38.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless our efforts.

01:00:38.322 --> 01:00:41.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jehovah can stir

01:00:41.074 --> 01:00:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hearts of any person

01:00:43.744 --> 01:00:47.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause them to acquire faith.

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:54.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers, for the encouragement
to view people of all sorts

01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:56.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as potential disciples.

01:00:58.634 --> 01:01:02.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you were thrilled with the release
of the new Bible study aid

01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course.</i>

01:01:07.476 --> 01:01:12.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you best use this new tool
to help others?

01:01:12.439 --> 01:01:16.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along closely
as Brother Robert Ciranko,

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,

01:01:18.362 --> 01:01:20.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presents the talk

01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:23.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Build Faith Using <i>Enjoy Life Forever!”</i>

01:01:30.666 --> 01:01:34.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say
is your greatest desire in life?

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:39.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the psalmist who wrote Psalm 146
had been asked that question,

01:01:39.007 --> 01:01:43.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he probably would have answered
with the words in the opening verses:

01:01:43.512 --> 01:01:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praise Jah!
Let my whole being praise Jehovah.

01:01:47.933 --> 01:01:51.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will praise Jehovah all my life.”

01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:56.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it not also our greatest desire
to praise Jehovah forever

01:01:56.567 --> 01:02:00.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to teach others
how they can worship him along with us?

01:02:00.779 --> 01:02:03.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those sentiments are nicely expressed

01:02:03.031 --> 01:02:05.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our original song entitled

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All I Can Give.”

01:02:07.369 --> 01:02:10.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to a reciting of the opening words

01:02:10.372 --> 01:02:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we watch a portion of the music video.

01:02:27.472 --> 01:02:32.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O heavenly Father,
I want to give all I can give.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My desire is to please you

01:02:38.483 --> 01:02:41.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love you as long as I live.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll help those who listen

01:02:49.536 --> 01:02:52.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find in your Word what they need.

01:02:57.628 --> 01:02:59.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To preach and to teach

01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:02.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the way I can really succeed.

01:03:08.138 --> 01:03:10.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I praise you, Jehovah,

01:03:10.974 --> 01:03:15.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my faith’s getting stronger each day.

01:03:19.107 --> 01:03:21.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll reflect on my dedication.

01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:25.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll walk in your way.

01:03:32.454 --> 01:03:35.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be glad that I did not try
to sing those words to you.

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:40.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is true that our faith
gets stronger each day

01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:42.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we praise Jehovah.

01:03:42.673 --> 01:03:47.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what of those who do not know him
or who lack faith in him?

01:03:47.052 --> 01:03:49.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we study the Bible with them,

01:03:49.388 --> 01:03:52.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to help them to find in God’s Word

01:03:52.766 --> 01:03:56.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they need
to worship Jehovah with strong faith.

01:03:56.603 --> 01:03:58.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we do that?

01:03:58.605 --> 01:04:01.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, faith is based on evidence.

01:04:01.191 --> 01:04:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to have faith, a person must first acquire

01:04:04.152 --> 01:04:08.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an accurate knowledge of Bible truth
on which they can build their faith.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:13.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a good place to start
is with Jesus’ words at John 17:3,

01:04:13.704 --> 01:04:15.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we know very well.

01:04:15.706 --> 01:04:17.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In prayer to Jehovah, he said:

01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:20.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This means everlasting life,

01:04:20.085 --> 01:04:23.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their coming to know you, the only true God,

01:04:23.088 --> 01:04:26.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

01:04:26.591 --> 01:04:29.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is Jesus saying?

01:04:29.386 --> 01:04:31.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that to gain everlasting life,

01:04:31.638 --> 01:04:36.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people need to develop
a personal relationship with Jehovah,

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:38.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that requires learning the truth

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about both God and Christ.

01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:45.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that require of us
as Bible teachers?

01:04:45.235 --> 01:04:47.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three things.

01:04:47.279 --> 01:04:51.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we have to clear up
any confusion in people’s minds

01:04:51.616 --> 01:04:54.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the identities of God and Christ.

01:04:54.953 --> 01:04:57.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And two scriptures that we can use

01:04:57.122 --> 01:05:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Jeremiah 10:10 and Matthew 16:16

01:05:02.085 --> 01:05:07.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jeremiah 10:10 and Matthew 16:16.

01:05:07.048 --> 01:05:09.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 10:10 says:

01:05:09.634 --> 01:05:12.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jehovah is truly God.

01:05:12.554 --> 01:05:15.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the living God.”

01:05:15.557 --> 01:05:19.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at Matthew 16:16, it reports:

01:05:19.436 --> 01:05:21.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Simon Peter answered:

01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:25.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.’”

01:05:25.859 --> 01:05:28.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah is the living God,

01:05:28.403 --> 01:05:31.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus is the Son of the living God.

01:05:31.031 --> 01:05:33.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could be clearer than that?

01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:36.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet,
simply acknowledging these basic facts

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:38.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not enough.

01:05:38.872 --> 01:05:40.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then second,

01:05:40.874 --> 01:05:45.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to help Bible students
build strong faith in Jehovah.

01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:48.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we learned
in the first talk of this convention,

01:05:48.757 --> 01:05:52.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having faith involves
coming to know Jehovah

01:05:52.844 --> 01:05:55.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a real Person

01:05:55.013 --> 01:06:00.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—trusting in him and forming
an unbreakable friendship with him.

01:06:00.018 --> 01:06:03.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This involves learning
what Jehovah likes and dislikes

01:06:03.939 --> 01:06:06.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowing his values and standards.

01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:09.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the student can do what God’s Son said,

01:06:09.444 --> 01:06:12.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 14:1:

01:06:12.697 --> 01:06:16.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exercise faith in God.”

01:06:16.076 --> 01:06:18.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then Jesus added:

01:06:18.203 --> 01:06:21.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exercise faith also in me.”

01:06:21.206 --> 01:06:23.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So third,

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to help Bible students

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:29.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build strong faith in Jesus.

01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:32.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What especially do they need
to believe about Jesus?

01:06:32.926 --> 01:06:35.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can let the apostle Paul answer,

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:39.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated at Ephesians 1:7.

01:06:39.933 --> 01:06:42.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 1:7

01:06:42.143 --> 01:06:44.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he wrote:

01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:47.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By means of him
we have the release by ransom

01:06:47.357 --> 01:06:49.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the blood of that one,

01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:52.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses,

01:06:52.153 --> 01:06:55.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the riches
of his undeserved kindness.”

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person learns that Jesus
gave his life for him personally,

01:07:01.204 --> 01:07:05.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then he can begin to exercise faith
in the power of the ransom

01:07:05.083 --> 01:07:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that it is the basis
for forgiveness of one’s sins,

01:07:08.545 --> 01:07:12.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it offers the hope of everlasting life
under Christ’s Kingdom,

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that it is the greatest proof

01:07:14.426 --> 01:07:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s love for us.

01:07:18.263 --> 01:07:20.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to accept the whole truth

01:07:20.599 --> 01:07:24.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

01:07:24.394 --> 01:07:26.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, that is not enough,

01:07:26.563 --> 01:07:29.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for at Romans 10:10,
the Bible says:

01:07:29.274 --> 01:07:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With the heart one exercises faith.”

01:07:32.903 --> 01:07:35.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person must not only believe the truth

01:07:35.488 --> 01:07:37.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but must also value it,

01:07:37.991 --> 01:07:42.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because only then will he be motivated
to act in harmony with the truth.

01:07:42.996 --> 01:07:45.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise,
he could reject convincing evidence

01:07:45.832 --> 01:07:47.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the truthfulness of what he is learning

01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:52.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue to hold on
to false beliefs and wrong practices.

01:07:52.756 --> 01:07:55.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must do all we can

01:07:55.175 --> 01:07:59.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the student’s heart
as we conduct Bible studies.

01:08:00.263 --> 01:08:04.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, does this seem
like a daunting task for you?

01:08:04.059 --> 01:08:07.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have been given
a wonderful new tool

01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:11.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with which to build heartfelt faith,
the study book

01:08:11.232 --> 01:08:16.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course</i>.

01:08:16.196 --> 01:08:19.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It uses key scriptures, clear reasoning,

01:08:19.699 --> 01:08:22.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
effective questions, beautiful artwork,

01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:24.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stirring videos

01:08:24.412 --> 01:08:28.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the teacher
reach the heart of the student

01:08:28.458 --> 01:08:31.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw out what he truly believes.

01:08:31.836 --> 01:08:33.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have the book

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if you have it in your <i>JW Library®</i> app
on your phone or tablet,

01:08:38.635 --> 01:08:43.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please open it now to section 1—section 1.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at the lessons in that section

01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:50.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that progressively build faith in Jehovah.

01:08:50.605 --> 01:08:55.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lesson 4, the student learns
who the only true God is

01:08:55.026 --> 01:08:57.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that his name is Jehovah.

01:08:57.612 --> 01:08:59.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 5 builds faith

01:08:59.614 --> 01:09:02.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really is
the Author of the Bible.

01:09:02.909 --> 01:09:06.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 6 reveals
that Jehovah is the Creator of the universe

01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:09.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Source of all life.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 7 explains what Jehovah is like,

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is a real person
with many appealing qualities.

01:09:16.047 --> 01:09:19.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And lessons 8 and 9 show how the student

01:09:19.592 --> 01:09:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can become God’s friend
and draw close to him.

01:09:24.389 --> 01:09:26.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people, however, find it difficult

01:09:26.391 --> 01:09:30.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imagine being friends
with anyone they cannot see,

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:33.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let alone with God himself.

01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:35.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open lesson 8

01:09:35.191 --> 01:09:38.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—lesson 8,
“You Can Be Jehovah’s Friend,”

01:09:38.278 --> 01:09:40.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the next video, follow along

01:09:40.989 --> 01:09:44.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we see how a teacher
uses what is provided in the book

01:09:44.659 --> 01:09:46.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her students build faith

01:09:46.995 --> 01:09:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s desire to be her Friend.

01:09:50.331 --> 01:09:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look in, they are starting to consider

01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:55.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the information under point 6,

01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:58.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Jehovah does for his friends.”

01:10:00.967 --> 01:10:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, good.

01:10:02.385 --> 01:10:06.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Point 6,
“What Jehovah does for his friends.”

01:10:06.056 --> 01:10:08.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, can you tap that link

01:10:08.641 --> 01:10:11.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Has Done So Much For Me”?

01:10:13.313 --> 01:10:15.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 14,

01:10:15.315 --> 01:10:17.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that happened in the past

01:10:17.442 --> 01:10:20.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to catch up with me emotionally.

01:10:22.489 --> 01:10:24.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like everything
that happened in my life

01:10:24.824 --> 01:10:26.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was my fault.

01:10:27.911 --> 01:10:30.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning from the Bible that God says

01:10:30.789 --> 01:10:33.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will take my right hand,

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:36.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will fortify me,
that he will really help me

01:10:36.586 --> 01:10:39.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it blew me away!

01:10:47.055 --> 01:10:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She mentioned a Bible passage

01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:53.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah takes our hand.

01:10:54.562 --> 01:10:59.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read that at Isaiah 41:10, 13,

01:11:00.568 --> 01:11:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please?

01:11:04.697 --> 01:11:07.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

01:11:07.575 --> 01:11:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:18.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on to you
with my right hand of righteousness.”

01:11:18.253 --> 01:11:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 13: “For I, Jehovah your God,

01:11:21.464 --> 01:11:23.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

01:11:23.466 --> 01:11:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid.

01:11:25.468 --> 01:11:26.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will help you.’”

01:11:26.886 --> 01:11:27.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Cassie,

01:11:27.971 --> 01:11:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to these verses,
what does Jehovah promise to do

01:11:30.473 --> 01:11:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of his friends?

01:11:32.475 --> 01:11:34.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help us when we’re down or scared.

01:11:34.477 --> 01:11:35.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

01:11:35.979 --> 01:11:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look a little closer, though.

01:11:38.481 --> 01:11:40.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify . . . ,

01:11:40.567 --> 01:11:42.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will help . . . ,

01:11:42.193 --> 01:11:45.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on . . .”

01:11:45.029 --> 01:11:48.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—does that sound like a Friend who can help

01:11:48.616 --> 01:11:51.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a Friend who wants to help?

01:11:52.162 --> 01:11:55.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought of God, Jehovah,

01:11:55.498 --> 01:11:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that.

01:11:57.834 --> 01:12:00.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Jehovah
would make a good Friend?

01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:02.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

01:12:02.005 --> 01:12:03.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:12:07.969 --> 01:12:11.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10, Jehovah
stretches out his hand to you.

01:12:11.389 --> 01:12:12.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

01:12:12.807 --> 01:12:14.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His right.

01:12:14.225 --> 01:12:18.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 13,
he takes your hand.

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:20.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

01:12:20.732 --> 01:12:22.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My right.

01:12:22.734 --> 01:12:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, come here.

01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is Jehovah

01:12:30.366 --> 01:12:32.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beside you

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:34.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holding your hand?

01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:38.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is he—

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:41.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In front.

01:12:41.794 --> 01:12:43.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it

01:12:43.796 --> 01:12:45.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his right hand

01:12:45.798 --> 01:12:47.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking your right hand.

01:12:48.384 --> 01:12:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s facing you

01:12:50.386 --> 01:12:52.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pull you up and out.

01:12:55.099 --> 01:12:57.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, what has Jehovah
pulled you out of?

01:13:00.939 --> 01:13:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

01:13:03.608 --> 01:13:05.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um,

01:13:09.322 --> 01:13:11.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hopelessness.

01:13:13.117 --> 01:13:16.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a direct result
of friendship with Jehovah.

01:13:16.371 --> 01:13:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It grows stronger

01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:21.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we talk to him.

01:13:21.084 --> 01:13:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that in the next section, OK?

01:13:30.385 --> 01:13:34.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example
of using <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

01:13:34.055 --> 01:13:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build faith in Jehovah!

01:13:36.432 --> 01:13:39.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This student, Cassie,
appeared troubled and distressed,

01:13:39.978 --> 01:13:41.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the sister who is teaching her

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so compassionate and patient.

01:13:44.857 --> 01:13:48.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice
that the sister did not talk too much?

01:13:48.987 --> 01:13:53.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She just effectively used
the video, scripture, and bolded questions

01:13:53.825 --> 01:13:56.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw out the student’s feelings

01:13:56.077 --> 01:14:00.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped her to visualize
what Jehovah has promised to do for her.

01:14:01.874 --> 01:14:06.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new study book
also progressively builds faith in Jesus.

01:14:06.879 --> 01:14:10.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open to section 2
—section 2—

01:14:10.258 --> 01:14:12.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look at the lessons in that section

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that progressively build faith in Jesus.

01:14:16.681 --> 01:14:20.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lesson 15,
the student learns who Jesus is

01:14:20.768 --> 01:14:23.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why learning about him is so important.

01:14:23.563 --> 01:14:27.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 16 outlines what Jesus did on earth

01:14:27.025 --> 01:14:29.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how that affects us.

01:14:29.277 --> 01:14:32.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 17 explains what Jesus is like

01:14:32.572 --> 01:14:35.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can imitate his fine qualities.

01:14:35.533 --> 01:14:38.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Skip down to lessons 27 and 28,

01:14:38.745 --> 01:14:40.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which show that Jesus’ death

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves how much Jehovah and Jesus love us.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people, however, do not understand
the ransom sacrifice of Jesus,

01:14:50.048 --> 01:14:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they do not view it
as God’s personal gift to them.

01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the apostle Paul
believed that with all his heart.

01:14:58.222 --> 01:15:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open lesson 27

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:04.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—lesson 27, entitled
“How Can Jesus’ Death Save Us?”

01:15:04.896 --> 01:15:09.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And go to point 5,
“The ransom is Jehovah’s gift to you.”

01:15:09.901 --> 01:15:12.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice that the read scripture

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Galatians 2:20

01:15:16.157 --> 01:15:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Galatians 2:20, which reads:

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am nailed to the stake
along with Christ.

01:15:24.374 --> 01:15:26.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is no longer I who live,

01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it is Christ who is living
in union with me.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:32.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, the life that I now live
in the flesh

01:15:32.799 --> 01:15:36.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I live by faith in the Son of God,

01:15:36.219 --> 01:15:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who loved <i>me</i>
and handed himself over for <i>me</i>.”

01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:44.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words should come to mind

01:15:44.352 --> 01:15:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when answering
the last review question for this lesson.

01:15:47.397 --> 01:15:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this next video,

01:15:49.399 --> 01:15:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how a teacher uses the Explore feature
at the end of the lesson

01:15:53.694 --> 01:15:57.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the heart of his skeptical student.

01:15:57.657 --> 01:16:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look in,
they are discussing the last review question.

01:16:06.541 --> 01:16:07.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Gene,

01:16:07.875 --> 01:16:12.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last review question is,
How can Jesus’ death benefit you?

01:16:14.465 --> 01:16:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose I should say
that it means forgiveness from my sins,

01:16:18.928 --> 01:16:20.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God is not going to forgive me.

01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:22.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes you feel that way?

01:16:22.306 --> 01:16:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t feel; I know.

01:16:24.183 --> 01:16:26.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made better choices in my business
than I did at home.

01:16:28.646 --> 01:16:30.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

01:16:32.233 --> 01:16:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gene,

01:16:33.443 --> 01:16:36.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scroll down to where it says “Explore”

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and click under
“Can Jehovah forgive even serious sins?”

01:16:41.117 --> 01:16:42.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, got it.

01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:44.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

01:16:44.787 --> 01:16:45.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

01:16:47.206 --> 01:16:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some people have committed gross sins
and wonder

01:16:51.961 --> 01:16:53.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether God can forgive them.

01:16:53.838 --> 01:16:56.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happily, the Word of God says:

01:16:56.132 --> 01:16:58.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us

01:16:58.676 --> 01:17:00.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from <i>all</i>  sin.’

01:17:01.471 --> 01:17:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins

01:17:04.307 --> 01:17:07.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have a proper, repentant attitude.”

01:17:07.977 --> 01:17:11.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even serious ones—
and he draws us to him.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

01:17:23.159 --> 01:17:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s not free.

01:17:24.827 --> 01:17:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah 1:18?

01:17:28.372 --> 01:17:29.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see it.

01:17:29.165 --> 01:17:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read it, please?

01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:34.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, now, and let us set matters straight
between us,’ says Jehovah.

01:17:34.754 --> 01:17:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Though your sins are like scarlet,
they will be made as white as snow;

01:17:39.133 --> 01:17:41.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘though they are as red as crimson cloth,

01:17:41.844 --> 01:17:44.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will become like wool.’”

01:17:45.223 --> 01:17:49.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So forgiveness of our sins is possible

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we “set matters straight.”

01:17:52.146 --> 01:17:54.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you, Gene,

01:17:54.732 --> 01:17:56.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think that means?

01:17:59.654 --> 01:18:01.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to do what’s right.

01:18:01.531 --> 01:18:02.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m trying.

01:18:03.407 --> 01:18:04.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s good.

01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:07.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also involves how we feel.

01:18:07.036 --> 01:18:09.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should feel sorry.
I am.

01:18:09.497 --> 01:18:12.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s a good sign, Gene.

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lastly,

01:18:14.377 --> 01:18:18.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let Jehovah help you with the step
that’s the hardest for many of us.

01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help you forgive yourself.

01:18:27.223 --> 01:18:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus died for me.

01:18:33.062 --> 01:18:36.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ron, I think I’m going to need
a little more time to process this.

01:18:37.525 --> 01:18:39.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all do.

01:18:39.944 --> 01:18:41.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go ahead and conclude with a prayer,

01:18:41.946 --> 01:18:46.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll specifically ask Jehovah
to strengthen your faith in the ransom

01:18:46.659 --> 01:18:49.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his forgiveness.

01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:52.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, when you pray,
you can beg him for the same thing.

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:55.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

01:18:55.793 --> 01:18:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

01:18:56.752 --> 01:18:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say a prayer.

01:18:59.046 --> 01:19:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, our heavenly Father . . .

01:19:02.508 --> 01:19:04.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gene needed convincing

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:07.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus’ sacrifice
benefited him personally.

01:19:07.888 --> 01:19:10.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not convinced of that in his heart,

01:19:10.558 --> 01:19:14.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not have the faith needed
to become Jesus’ disciple.

01:19:14.645 --> 01:19:18.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother was familiar
with the contents of the Explore section

01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:21.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and chose to discuss with Gene
the <i>Watchtower</i>  article

01:19:21.444 --> 01:19:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could best help him.

01:19:24.822 --> 01:19:28.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times, if needed,
the teacher could give the student homework

01:19:28.159 --> 01:19:32.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read an article or to watch a video
from the Explore section

01:19:32.079 --> 01:19:35.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get his observations
at the next study session.

01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:39.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video,
Ron was going to pray specifically

01:19:39.587 --> 01:19:41.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah to strengthen Gene’s faith

01:19:41.672 --> 01:19:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ransom
and in God’s forgiveness of him.

01:19:44.258 --> 01:19:47.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an excellent way
to keep helping a student

01:19:47.011 --> 01:19:51.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw close to Jehovah
and build faith in God’s Word!

01:19:52.391 --> 01:19:54.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s spirit produces faith

01:19:54.435 --> 01:19:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only in people whose heart
favors the truth over lies.

01:19:58.939 --> 01:20:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us use <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

01:20:01.651 --> 01:20:04.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

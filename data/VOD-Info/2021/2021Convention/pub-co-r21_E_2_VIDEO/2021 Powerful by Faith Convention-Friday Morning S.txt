00:00:52 How can we maintain our faith
00:00:54 during these difficult last days of this system of things?
00:00:59 We learn many lessons from a time remarkably similar to ours.
00:01:04 Please follow along in your Bible
00:01:06 as Brother Anthony Morris of the Governing Body
00:01:09 introduces and applies the dramatic Bible reading entitled
00:01:14 “Noah—Faith Moved Him to Obey.”
00:01:24 Three days before Jesus was put to death,
00:01:28 his disciples posed a question
00:01:30 that has great importance for all of us today.
00:01:34 They asked Jesus:
00:01:37 “What will be the sign of your presence
00:01:39 and of the conclusion of the system of things?”
00:01:43 In reply, Jesus foretold that a time period
00:01:46 preceding the promised new world
00:01:49 would be marked by events such as wars,
00:01:52 earthquakes, food shortages,
00:01:55 and pestilence.
00:01:57 Jesus then said:
00:02:00 “For as they were in those days
00:02:02 “before the Flood,
00:02:03 “eating and drinking,
00:02:05 “men marrying
00:02:06 “and women being given in marriage,
00:02:08 “until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
00:02:11 “and they took no note
00:02:13 “until the Flood came
00:02:15 “and swept them all away,
00:02:18 so the presence of the Son of man will be.”
00:02:23 With those words,
00:02:25 Jesus confirmed that Noah was a real person
00:02:29 and that the Flood was an actual, historical event.
00:02:33 He also warned us that the period just before the Flood
00:02:38 mirrors the period in which we live today.
00:02:42 So it’s important to consider closely what happened in Noah’s day
00:02:47 and to see what we can learn from it.
00:02:51 The opening chapters of the book of Genesis
00:02:54 give us a picture of what life was like
00:02:57 in the centuries prior to Noah
00:03:00 —after Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden of Eden.
00:03:05 Everyone spoke the same language,
00:03:08 and people had possibly developed the art of writing.
00:03:12 They had built a city, maybe several cities.
00:03:15 They had learned  how to forge copper and iron.
00:03:19 They made musical instruments
00:03:22 —harps and flutes.
00:03:24 And because they were much closer
00:03:26 to the physical perfection of Adam and Eve,
00:03:30 they lived long lives
00:03:32 —hundreds of years.
00:03:37 But all was not well.
00:03:39 People turned away from Jehovah
00:03:42 and, as a result, they became very violent and immoral.
00:03:47 Things got so bad
00:03:49 that Jehovah moved a righteous man named Enoch,
00:03:52 the seventh man
00:03:53 in the genealogical line from Adam,
00:03:56 to prophesy that God would not forever tolerate
00:04:00 a wicked and rebellious world;
00:04:02 he’d execute judgment against the ungodly.
00:04:07 Of course, the ungodly people in Enoch’s day
00:04:10 didn’t like what he was saying.
00:04:12 They hated Enoch, and they may have tried to kill him.
00:04:17 Enoch never saw the fulfillment of this prophecy.
00:04:22 Another 600 years passed,
00:04:24 and by then conditions on earth had become even worse.
00:04:31 Let’s read Genesis 6:1-7:
00:04:39 “Now when men started to grow in number
00:04:42 “on the surface of the ground
00:04:44 “and daughters were born to them,
00:04:46 “the sons of the true God began to notice
00:04:49 “that the daughters of men were beautiful.
00:04:51 “So they began taking as wives all whom they chose.
00:04:55 “Then Jehovah said:
00:04:57 “‘My spirit will not tolerate man indefinitely,
00:05:01 “‘because he is only flesh.
00:05:03 “Accordingly, his days will amount to 120 years.’
00:05:08 “The Nephilim were on the earth
00:05:10 “in those days and afterward.
00:05:12 “During that time the sons of the true God
00:05:15 “continued to have relations with the daughters of men,
00:05:18 “and these bore sons to them.
00:05:20 “They were the mighty ones of old times,
00:05:24 “the men of fame.
00:05:26 “Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness
00:05:29 “was great on the earth
00:05:31 “and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart
00:05:34 “was only bad all the time.
00:05:37 “Jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth,
00:05:41 “and his heart was saddened.
00:05:43 “So Jehovah said:
00:05:45 “‘I am going to wipe men whom I have created
00:05:48 “‘off the surface of the ground,
00:05:50 “‘man together with domestic animals,
00:05:53  “‘creeping animals,
00:05:55 “‘and flying creatures of the heavens,
00:05:57 for I regret that I have made them.’”
00:06:02 During that time,
00:06:04 some angels from heaven
00:06:06 noticed beautiful human women
00:06:09 and developed lustful feelings for them.
00:06:13 These angels rebelled against God
00:06:16 by coming to earth and taking on human bodies
00:06:20 in order to have sex with the women.
00:06:24 They became selfish, wicked demons.
00:06:27 They may have been charming,
00:06:29 intelligent, handsome,
00:06:32 and they had supernatural powers.
00:06:35 They must have been irresistible,
00:06:37 especially to women who themselves had no love of God.
00:06:43 Perhaps the angels took some women by force.
00:06:47 Whatever the case, the angels took “all whom they chose.”
00:06:53 What human on earth at that time
00:06:56 could hope to stop demons?
00:06:59 To these godless creatures,
00:07:01 people lost their daughters,
00:07:03 their sisters,
00:07:05 and possibly even their wives.
00:07:10 The women became pregnant
00:07:12 and gave birth to sons,
00:07:15 but their sons were not like other boys.
00:07:18 They were stronger.
00:07:20 They were bullies —aggressive, fierce, and brutal.
00:07:26 Those qualities stayed with them as they grew.
00:07:30 The boys became men,
00:07:32 but they were unusually cruel.
00:07:35 They were called Nephilim,
00:07:37 possibly meaning “those who cause others to fall down,”
00:07:42 and people feared them.
00:07:44 Like their fathers, the Nephilim had no love for God,
00:07:49 and they cared only about their fame
00:07:53 for being strong and vicious.
00:07:56 The materialized angels and their savage offspring
00:08:01 dominated the world of that time,
00:08:04 and people followed their lead.
00:08:08 Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was rampant
00:08:12 “and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart
00:08:15 was only bad all the time.”
00:08:20 How Satan must have delighted
00:08:22 to see most humans reject Jehovah
00:08:26 and become more and more corrupt!
00:08:31 But in that world of depraved people,
00:08:35 there was a man who was faithful to Jehovah.
00:08:39 Let’s read about him at Genesis 6:8:
00:08:47 “But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
00:08:51 “This is the history of Noah.
00:08:54 “Noah was a righteous man.
00:08:56 “He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries.
00:09:00 “Noah walked with the true God.
00:09:03 “In time Noah became father to three sons,
00:09:07 “Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
00:09:10 “But the earth had become ruined
00:09:12 “in the sight of the true God,
00:09:14 “and the earth was filled with violence.
00:09:17 “Yes, God looked upon the earth,
00:09:20 “and it was ruined;
00:09:22 all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”
00:09:27 Some people today say that there was no such person as Noah
00:09:32 and that the account of the ark and the Flood
00:09:35 are just a legend or a fairy tale.
00:09:38 But the Bible writer knew that Noah really existed
00:09:43 and that the Flood truly happened.
00:09:46 The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel both refer to Noah.
00:09:51 Ezra, the writer of First Chronicles,
00:09:54 and the Gospel writer Luke
00:09:56 both include Noah in the chronologies they compiled.
00:10:00 The apostles Peter and Paul both confirm
00:10:04 the Genesis account of the Flood.
00:10:07 And, as we mentioned earlier,
00:10:09 the Son of God himself testified
00:10:13 that Noah was a real person
00:10:15 and that the Flood really happened.
00:10:21 Noah’s faith was outstanding.
00:10:24 He lived in an evil world
00:10:27 —a world dominated by materialized angels,
00:10:30 their violent offspring, and a society of ungodly people.
00:10:35 Noah lacked
00:10:37 many of the things we have today
00:10:39 to help us keep our faith strong.
00:10:42 He had no Bible to help him to love Jehovah
00:10:45 and to understand his ways.
00:10:47 He didn’t know about all the faithful men and women
00:10:50 who would live after him.
00:10:53 And Noah had no congregation of fellow believers
00:10:57 to encourage him and to strengthen his faith.
00:11:01 Yet, Noah knew much.
00:11:06 He knew what happened in the garden of Eden,
00:11:09 and he could see the tragic results.
00:11:12 He saw that people grew old and died.
00:11:15 He knew that the way to the garden of Eden was barred
00:11:19 and the ground outside had been cursed.
00:11:22 He understood what his great-grandfather Enoch
00:11:26 had foretold.
00:11:28 And Noah knew that his father, Lamech,
00:11:31 had given him a name likely meaning “rest” or “consolation”
00:11:35 because he would, as his father foretold,
00:11:38 “bring us comfort from our labor
00:11:41 “and from the painful toil of our hands
00:11:44 because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.”
00:11:49 Surely, Noah wondered about these prophecies.
00:11:54 How would he bring comfort?
00:11:57 How and when would God act
00:11:59 against the wicked ones who surrounded him?
00:12:03 For hundreds of years, Noah prayed and he wondered.
00:12:09 By the time he had lived well over 500 years,
00:12:12 he had married and had a family —three sons.
00:12:18 Though he lived in a wicked world,
00:12:21 Noah remained faithful to God,
00:12:24 and he helped his family to do the same.
00:12:28 Then Jehovah delivered a message
00:12:30 that surely must have stunned Noah.
00:12:34 Let’s continue reading from Genesis 6:13:
00:12:43 “After that God said to Noah:
00:12:47 “‘I have decided to put an end to all flesh,
00:12:51 “‘because the earth is full of violence on account of them,
00:12:55 “‘so I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.
00:13:00 ‘‘‘Make for yourself an ark from resinous wood.
00:13:04 “‘You will make compartments in the ark
00:13:06 “‘and cover it with tar inside and outside.
00:13:11 “‘This is how you will make it:
00:13:13 “‘The ark should be 300 cubits long,
00:13:16 “‘50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.
00:13:21 “‘You will make a window for light for the ark,
00:13:25 “‘one cubit from the top.
00:13:27 “‘You should put the entrance of the ark in its side
00:13:30 “‘and make it with a lower deck,
00:13:32 “‘a second deck, and a third deck.
00:13:36 “‘As for me, I am going to bring
00:13:39 “‘floodwaters upon the earth
00:13:41 “‘to destroy from under the heavens
00:13:43 “‘all flesh that has the breath of life.
00:13:46 “‘Everything on the earth will perish.
00:13:50 “‘And I am establishing my covenant with you,
00:13:53 “‘and you must go into the ark,
00:13:55 “‘you, your sons, your wife,
00:13:58 “‘and your sons’ wives with you.
00:14:00 “‘And bring into the ark
00:14:02 “‘two of every sort of living creature
00:14:05 “‘in order to preserve them alive with you,
00:14:08 “‘a male and a female;
00:14:10 “‘of the flying creatures according to their kinds,
00:14:13 “‘the domestic animals according to their kinds,
00:14:17 “‘and all creeping animals of the ground
00:14:20 “‘according to their kinds,
00:14:22 “‘two of each will go in there to you
00:14:25 “‘to preserve them alive.
00:14:27 “‘For your part,
00:14:29 “‘you are to collect and take with you
00:14:31 “‘every kind of food to eat,
00:14:33 “to serve as food for you and for the animals.’
00:14:39 “And Noah did according to all
00:14:42 “that God had commanded him.
00:14:44 He did just so.”
00:14:48 Noah had long wondered
00:14:50 how Jehovah would act against an ungodly world.
00:14:54 Now he knew;
00:14:56 a catastrophic flood would cleanse the earth.
00:15:00 Noah also knew what he and his family must do.
00:15:05 So much depended on him!
00:15:09 The thought must have been overwhelming.
00:15:13 The ark would be gigantic.
00:15:17 Now new questions occupied his mind.
00:15:21 Trees, a great many trees,
00:15:24 would have to be felled
00:15:26 and the timber hauled, shaped, and joined.
00:15:29 How would he do that?
00:15:31 How would he gather so many kinds of animals?
00:15:35 How would he get food supplies
00:15:37 for the animals and for his family?
00:15:42 And what about the godless people around him?
00:15:45 What would they think?
00:15:48 Noah knew what had happened
00:15:51 to the righteous men who preceded him.
00:15:54 Abel had been killed by his brother Cain.
00:15:57 And Enoch likely was
00:15:59 in such danger of being slain by ungodly ones
00:16:02 that God mercifully cut his life short
00:16:05 so that he wouldn’t fall into their hands.
00:16:09 People would see
00:16:10 what he was doing,
00:16:12 and they’d soon learn why he was doing it.
00:16:16 These God-dishonoring, Nephilim-influenced people
00:16:19 might react violently.
00:16:22 Yet, Noah trusted in Jehovah,
00:16:25 and he got to work.
00:16:28 He did all that God had commanded him.
00:16:31 It took a long time
00:16:33 for Noah’s family to build the ark,
00:16:35 perhaps some 40 or 50 years.
00:16:39 There must have been challenges,
00:16:41 but we never read that Noah complained.
00:16:45 The family had no support from others.
00:16:48 Remember that Jesus said that the people
00:16:51 “took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away.”
00:16:56 Of course, people took note that Noah was building an ark.
00:17:01 His neighbors must have asked him
00:17:04 why he was building such an enormous structure.
00:17:08 And Noah explained to them why he was building it.
00:17:11 But Noah’s contemporaries took no note
00:17:15 that Jehovah was blessing Noah
00:17:17 and his construction efforts.
00:17:20 They took no note of what this would mean for them.
00:17:24 Instead, the people were caught up in everyday affairs
00:17:28 —eating, drinking, and marrying;
00:17:31 those were the things that concerned them.
00:17:35 To those godless people,
00:17:37 Noah and his family were fools —crackpots.
00:17:40 They were the butt of ridicule, jeers,
00:17:43 and probably threats.
00:17:47 The ark was finally completed.
00:17:51 We can imagine Noah and his family looking at it with pride
00:17:56 and remembering how God had helped them.
00:18:00 Jehovah always directs his servants when needed.
00:18:05 Now Jehovah spoke again to Noah.
00:18:08 Let’s read chapter 7, starting with verse 1:
00:18:14 “After that Jehovah said to Noah:
00:18:16 “‘Go into the ark,
00:18:18 “‘you and all your household,
00:18:20 “‘because you are the one I have found
00:18:23 “‘to be righteous before me among this generation.
00:18:25 “‘You must take with you
00:18:27 “‘every kind of clean animal by sevens,
00:18:30 “‘the male and its mate;
00:18:33 “‘and of every animal that is not clean just two,
00:18:37 “‘the male and its mate;
00:18:39 “‘also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens,
00:18:43 “‘male and female,
00:18:45 “‘to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth.
00:18:49 “‘For in just seven days,
00:18:51 “‘I will make it rain on the earth
00:18:53 “‘for 40 days and 40 nights,
00:18:55 “‘and I will wipe from the surface of the ground
00:18:58 “every living thing that I have made.’
00:19:01 “Then Noah did everything
00:19:03 that Jehovah had commanded him.”
00:19:07 There was no time to lose.
00:19:10 There was urgent work to do.
00:19:13 In seven days, the rains would come.
00:19:16 Animals, many animals, had to be situated in the ark.
00:19:20 Supplies had to be secured.
00:19:22 Noah listened, and he obeyed.
00:19:26 For the second time in this inspired account,
00:19:29 we are told that Noah did all that he was commanded to do.
00:19:34 Now please turn to Genesis 7:6:
00:19:41 “Noah was 600 years old
00:19:43 “when the floodwaters came upon the earth.
00:19:46 “So Noah, along with his sons,
00:19:49 “his wife, and his sons’ wives,
00:19:51 “went into the ark ahead of the floodwaters.
00:19:55 “Of every clean animal
00:19:58 “and of every animal that is not clean
00:20:00 “and of the flying creatures
00:20:02 “and of everything that moves on the ground,
00:20:05 “they went inside the ark to Noah by twos,
00:20:09 “male and female,
00:20:12 “just as God had commanded Noah.
00:20:15 “And seven days later
00:20:17 “the floodwaters came upon the earth.
00:20:21 “In the 600th year of Noah’s life,
00:20:23 “in the second month,
00:20:25 “on the 17th day of the month,
00:20:28 “on that day all the springs
00:20:31 “of the vast watery deep burst open
00:20:34 “and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
00:20:37 “And the rain poured down on the earth
00:20:40 “for 40 days and 40 nights.
00:20:43 “On that very day,
00:20:45 “Noah went into the ark along with his sons,
00:20:48 “Shem, Ham, and Japheth,
00:20:51 “and his wife and the three wives of his sons.
00:20:55 “They went in with every wild animal
00:20:58 “according to its kind,
00:21:00 “and every domestic animal according to its kind,
00:21:03 “and every creeping animal of the earth
00:21:06 “according to its kind,
00:21:08 “and every flying creature according to its kind,
00:21:11 “every bird, every winged creature.
00:21:14 “They kept going to Noah inside the ark,
00:21:17 “two by two,
00:21:19 “of every sort of flesh that has the breath of life.
00:21:23 “So they went in,
00:21:25 “male and female of every sort of flesh,
00:21:28 “just as God had commanded him.
00:21:31 “After that Jehovah shut the door behind him.
00:21:35 “The flooding continued for 40 days on the earth,
00:21:39 “and the waters kept increasing
00:21:42 “and began carrying the ark,
00:21:44 “and it was floating high above the earth.
00:21:48 “The waters became overwhelming
00:21:50 “and kept increasing greatly upon the earth,
00:21:54 “but the ark floated on the surface of the waters.
00:21:58 “The waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly
00:22:02 “that all the tall mountains
00:22:04 “under the whole heavens were covered.
00:22:07 “The waters rose up to 15 cubits
00:22:10 “above the mountains.
00:22:12 “So all living creatures
00:22:14 “that were moving on the earth perished
00:22:17 “—the flying creatures, the domestic animals,
00:22:20 “the wild animals, the swarming creatures,
00:22:23 “and all mankind.
00:22:26 “Everything on dry land
00:22:28 “that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
00:22:32 “So He wiped every living thing
00:22:35 “from the surface of the earth,
00:22:37 “including man, animals, creeping animals,
00:22:41 “and the flying creatures of the sky.
00:22:43 “They were all wiped off the earth;
00:22:47 “only Noah and those with him in the ark survived.
00:22:51 “And the waters continued overwhelming the earth
00:22:56 for 150 days.”
00:23:00 If Noah had wondered how he would collect all those animals,
00:23:04 he now knew.
00:23:06 They would come to him.
00:23:08 Jehovah would bring them.
00:23:11 Noah didn’t have to go looking for them.
00:23:14 The animals did come
00:23:16 —every kind of animal, some by sevens and some by twos.
00:23:23 Just imagine dozens and dozens of animals
00:23:28 strutting, hopping, slithering,
00:23:30 and waddling into the ark!
00:23:33 We can imagine Noah’s family finding places for them all,
00:23:37 stroking the soft fur of some animals as they passed
00:23:41 while avoiding the rough hides or spines of others
00:23:45 and making sure to get out of the way
00:23:47 of the large animals as they lumbered past.
00:23:51 The birds came too —fluttering, soaring.
00:23:55 What colors!
00:23:57 What smells!
00:23:58 What sounds!
00:24:00 Noah and his family must have shouted
00:24:03 to hear one another above the din.
00:24:07 When all were inside, Jehovah shut the door.
00:24:13 Can you picture the family huddling together inside the ark
00:24:17 —listening, straining to hear?
00:24:21 Then it came.
00:24:23 Rain!
00:24:25 Perhaps it began almost imperceptibly,
00:24:28 but soon it came in torrents.
00:24:31 The sound was deafening.
00:24:34 What they had long anticipated
00:24:36 was now happening!
00:24:38 They were tired, exhausted,
00:24:42 but there was likely little sleep that night.
00:24:47 There were animals to check.
00:24:49 There was the din of the rain.
00:24:52 And how they prayed!
00:24:56 Did their thoughts turn to those outside?
00:24:59 Certainly.
00:25:01 They knew those people and had preached to them.
00:25:05 Many were relatives.
00:25:07 How sad for them!
00:25:10 Like Jehovah,
00:25:12 Noah took no delight in the death of the wicked.
00:25:17 It saddened him that so many had to die,
00:25:21 but he knew that those who perished
00:25:24 had ample warning of what was to come.
00:25:27 Even if they hadn’t seen the ark Noah was building,
00:25:32 they would have heard about it.
00:25:34 They’d know why he was building it.
00:25:37 Now it was too late for them.
00:25:39 Jehovah had shut the door.
00:25:45 Noah’s family listened as the rain battered the ark without letup.
00:25:53 And then came a moment they would never forget
00:25:55 —movement!
00:25:57 They felt their massive wooden ark lifting from the ground.
00:26:02 It was floating!
00:26:05 Their hearts were beating loud and fast.
00:26:08 Would their vessel hold together?
00:26:12 Let’s resume our reading
00:26:14 from Genesis 8:1
00:26:18 to see what happened next.
00:26:21 “But God gave attention to Noah
00:26:24 “and to all the wild animals and domestic animals
00:26:27 “that were with him in the ark,
00:26:29 “and God caused a wind to blow over the earth,
00:26:33 “and the waters began to subside.
00:26:36 “The springs of the watery deep
00:26:38 “and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up,
00:26:41 “so the rain from the heavens stopped falling.
00:26:45 “Then the waters began
00:26:47 “to recede progressively from the earth.
00:26:50 “By the end of 150 days,
00:26:53 “the waters had subsided.
00:26:55 “In the seventh month,
00:26:57 “on the 17th day of the month,
00:26:59 “the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
00:27:03 “And the waters were steadily decreasing
00:27:07 “until the tenth month.
00:27:09 “In the tenth month, on the first of the month,
00:27:12 “the tops of the mountains appeared.
00:27:15 “So at the end of 40 days,
00:27:17 “Noah opened the window that he had made in the ark
00:27:20 “and sent out a raven;
00:27:23 “it continued flying outside and returning,
00:27:26 “until the waters dried off the earth.
00:27:29 “Later he sent out a dove
00:27:32 “to see whether the waters had receded
00:27:34 “from the surface of the ground.
00:27:36 “The dove did not find any resting-place to perch,
00:27:39 “so it returned to him into the ark
00:27:42 “because the waters were still covering
00:27:44 “the surface of the whole earth.
00:27:47 “So he reached his hand out
00:27:49 “and brought it inside the ark.
00:27:52 “He waited seven more days,
00:27:54 “and once again he sent out the dove from the ark.
00:27:58 “When the dove came to him toward evening,
00:28:00 “he saw that there was
00:28:02 “a freshly plucked olive leaf in its bill!
00:28:06 “So Noah knew that the waters
00:28:08 “had receded from the earth.
00:28:10 “He waited still another seven days.
00:28:13 “Then he sent out the dove,
00:28:16 but it did not return to him anymore.”
00:28:21 For 40 days and 40 nights,
00:28:24 the noise of torrential rain filled the ark,
00:28:27 and then it stopped.
00:28:30 Imagine Noah and his family peering out of the ark
00:28:33 and seeing nothing but water,
00:28:35 no land anywhere.
00:28:37 A wind blew, and the waters subsided.
00:28:42 Finally, 150 days after the downpour began,
00:28:47 the ark settled on land.
00:28:50 What a happy day that must have been!
00:28:54 Was it safe to go out?
00:28:56 No.
00:28:59 The waters had to subside further.
00:29:02 There was plenty to do to keep the family busy.
00:29:06 There were animals to feed and to care for.
00:29:10 Still, Noah’s family must have longed to be outside,
00:29:14 to be free of the confinement,
00:29:16 to feel the ground under their feet.
00:29:19 Patience was needed.
00:29:22 Picture the family spending time together,
00:29:25 planning what they’d do when they came out of the ark.
00:29:29 Another 73 days passed.
00:29:33 Now they could see the tops of the mountains.
00:29:38 Now was it safe to exit?
00:29:41 Noah peered out of a window.
00:29:43 He selected from the birds a raven,
00:29:46 and he sent it out, but it kept returning.
00:29:50 Noah put the raven back in its place
00:29:52 and selected a dove.
00:29:54 It too flew and returned,
00:29:57 not having found a place to perch.
00:30:00 A week later, he released it again,
00:30:02 and it returned with an olive leaf in its bill.
00:30:07 Seven days later, Noah sent it again.
00:30:10 This time it did not return.
00:30:14 What next?
00:30:17 Let’s continue reading from chapter 8, verse 13:
00:30:24 “Now in the 601st year, in the first month,
00:30:28 “on the first day of the month,
00:30:30 “the waters had drained from the earth;
00:30:33 “and Noah removed the covering of the ark
00:30:36 “and saw that the surface of the ground was drying.
00:30:40 “In the second month,
00:30:42 “on the 27th day of the month,
00:30:44 “the earth had dried off.
00:30:46 “God now said to Noah:
00:30:49 “‘Go out of the ark, you, your wife,
00:30:52 “‘your sons, and your sons’ wives.
00:30:55 “‘Bring out with you all the living creatures
00:30:58 “‘of every sort of flesh,
00:31:00 “‘of the flying creatures and of the animals
00:31:02 “‘and of all the creeping animals of the earth,
00:31:04 “‘that they may multiply on the earth
00:31:07 “and be fruitful and become many on the earth.’
00:31:10 “So Noah went out, together with his sons,
00:31:14 “his wife, and his sons’ wives.
00:31:17 “Every living creature, every creeping animal
00:31:21 “and every flying creature,
00:31:23 “everything that moves on the earth,
00:31:25 “went out of the ark by families.
00:31:28 “Then Noah built an altar to Jehovah
00:31:31 “and took some of all the clean animals
00:31:34 “and of all the clean flying creatures
00:31:36 “and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
00:31:40 “And Jehovah began to smell a pleasing aroma.
00:31:44 “So Jehovah said in his heart:
00:31:48 “‘Never again will I curse the ground
00:31:50 “‘on man’s account,
00:31:52 “‘for the inclination of the heart of man
00:31:54 “‘is bad from his youth up;
00:31:57 “‘and never again will I strike down
00:31:59 “‘every living thing as I have done.
00:32:02 “‘From now on,
00:32:04 “‘the earth will never cease to have
00:32:06 “‘seed-sowing and harvest,
00:32:08 “‘cold and heat,
00:32:10 “‘summer and winter,
00:32:12 and day and night.’”
00:32:17 When the dove didn’t return,
00:32:20 Noah removed part of the roof of the ark.
00:32:24 Now he could see that much of the land had dried out.
00:32:28 Possibly, he could see vegetation growing and flourishing
00:32:32 in a way that it hadn’t been possible
00:32:34 in the days before the Flood, when the earth had been cursed.
00:32:38 Still, Noah waited for Jehovah’s direction.
00:32:43 And then it came, Jehovah’s command:
00:32:48 “Go out of the ark.”
00:32:50 At last!
00:32:53 What a joyful day that must have been!
00:32:57 They’d been in the ark for 370 days.
00:33:01 Picture the family coming out of the ark
00:33:04 —laughing, breathing fresh air,
00:33:08 eager to adjust to their new life.
00:33:11 The animals came out too,
00:33:14 and the family watched as they dispersed in all directions.
00:33:18 Some they had drawn close to,
00:33:20 but now it was farewell
00:33:23 —a happy farewell.
00:33:26 There were no materialized angels,
00:33:28 no Nephilim, and no wicked people.
00:33:33 How grateful they were to Jehovah!
00:33:38 Noah wasted no time.
00:33:40 He built an altar and sacrificed to Jehovah,
00:33:44 and God expressed his pleasure.
00:33:48 Jehovah assured the family
00:33:50 that he would never again strike down every living thing.
00:33:56 But he did more than that.
00:33:59 He concluded a covenant with Noah and his sons
00:34:03 and gave them a sign that we too can observe.
00:34:08 Let’s read about it at Genesis chapter 9,
00:34:11 starting with verse 8:
00:34:15 “Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
00:34:19 “‘I am now establishing my covenant with you
00:34:23 “‘and with your offspring after you,
00:34:26 “‘and with every living creature that is with you,
00:34:29 “‘the birds, the animals,
00:34:31 “‘and all the living creatures of the earth with you,
00:34:34 “‘all those that came out of the ark
00:34:37 “‘—every living creature of the earth.
00:34:40 “‘Yes, I establish my covenant with you:
00:34:43 “‘Never again will all flesh be destroyed
00:34:46 “‘by the waters of a flood,
00:34:48 “and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.’
00:34:52 “And God added:
00:34:54 “‘This is the sign of the covenant
00:34:56 “‘that I am making between me and you
00:34:59 “‘and every living creature that is with you,
00:35:01 “‘for all future generations.
00:35:05 “‘I put my rainbow in the cloud,
00:35:08 “‘and it will serve as a sign of the covenant
00:35:11 “‘between me and the earth.
00:35:13 “‘Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth,
00:35:16 “‘then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.
00:35:20 “‘And I will certainly remember my covenant
00:35:23 “‘that I made between me and you
00:35:26 “‘and every living creature of every kind;
00:35:29 “‘and never again will the waters
00:35:31 “‘become a flood to destroy all flesh.
00:35:34 “‘And the rainbow will occur in the cloud,
00:35:37 “‘and I will certainly see it
00:35:39 “‘and remember the everlasting covenant
00:35:42 “‘between God and every living creature
00:35:45 of every kind on the earth.’”
00:35:49 What a magnificent sign Jehovah gave!
00:35:54 Every rainbow would remind
00:35:56 both God and man of his promise.
00:36:00 How Noah’s family must have marveled
00:36:03 to see the colors spanning across the sky
00:36:08 —violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red!
00:36:15 Never again will a flood deluge the earth.
00:36:21 But Jehovah is not one to tolerate wickedness forever.
00:36:26 Let’s read what the apostle Peter wrote.
00:36:30 Please turn to 2 Peter 2:5.
00:36:36 The apostle wrote:
00:36:38 “And he [God] did not refrain
00:36:41 “from punishing an ancient world,
00:36:43 “but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness,
00:36:47 “safe with seven others when he brought a flood
00:36:50 upon a world of ungodly people.”
00:36:56 Today, we live in a world that resembles the one before the Flood.
00:37:01 There’s violence,
00:37:03 and people do all sorts of things that Jehovah hates.
00:37:08 People are concerned with the everyday affairs of life
00:37:12 and take no note of the message of salvation
00:37:17 that we proclaim.
00:37:20 Ridiculers of God’s people mockingly say:
00:37:23 “Where is this promised presence of his?
00:37:27 “Why, . . . all things are continuing exactly
00:37:30 as they were from creation’s beginning.”
00:37:34 They are wrong.
00:37:37 Jehovah acted against wickedness in the time of Noah,
00:37:41 and He’ll act again.
00:37:44 But, like Noah, the faithful will be saved.
00:37:49 God’s Word assures us:
00:37:52 “Jehovah knows how to rescue
00:37:54 “people of godly devotion out of trial,
00:37:58 “but to reserve unrighteous people
00:38:01 to be destroyed on the day of judgment.”
00:38:06 Jehovah will make the earth a paradise,
00:38:09 just as he originally purposed.
00:38:13 The Paradise will be inhabited by good people.
00:38:16 There will be no people who rebel against God.
00:38:20 And what of the rebellious spirit creatures?
00:38:24 When the flood deluged the earth in Noah’s day,
00:38:27 the rebellious angels left their human bodies
00:38:30 and returned to the spirit realm in disgrace.
00:38:36 However, these demons have continued to exert
00:38:39 an evil influence on humans down to this day.
00:38:44 But when Jehovah acts again,
00:38:46 the demons and their ruler, Satan,
00:38:50 will be put out of action.
00:38:55 The Word of God says this:
00:38:58 “By faith Noah,
00:39:00 “after receiving divine warning
00:39:02 “of things not yet seen,
00:39:04 “showed godly fear and constructed an ark
00:39:07 for the saving of his household.”
00:39:11 Faith moved Noah to obey Jehovah.
00:39:14 As a result, he and his family survived the Flood.
00:39:19 Noah lived a long life, some 950 years.
00:39:25 But when that faithful man is resurrected,
00:39:28 he’ll have the prospect of living forever.
00:39:34 If we display the faith of Noah and obey Jehovah,
00:39:38 we too can walk with Jehovah as our Friend
00:39:42 —and that friendship can last forever!
00:39:49 The Bible account of Noah reminds us
00:39:52 how close we are to the end of this system
00:39:55 and how soon Jehovah will reward our faith.

00:40:12 Just as Jehovah safeguarded Noah and his family in the days before the Flood,
00:40:17 He is now safeguarding us.
00:40:21 What can help us stay close to Jehovah
00:40:24 despite any trials we face?
00:40:27 In what ways does he come to our aid?
00:40:31 Please pay close attention
00:40:33 to Brother Kenneth Cook of the Governing Body
00:40:35 as he answers these questions in the talk
00:40:38 “Have Faith and Do Not Doubt.”
00:40:49 We depend on many powerful man-made things
00:40:53 to deliver the items that we need.
00:40:55 For example, a powerful freight train can climb steep hills
00:40:59 and deliver its freight on time.
00:41:02 A powerful cargo ship can withstand high seas and deliver its cargo.
00:41:07 But there is a limit to what man’s ingenuity can do.
00:41:11 When it comes to our most crucial needs, such as true peace,
00:41:15 real security, and lasting happiness,
00:41:18 humans promise what they do not have the power to deliver.
00:41:23 Political, religious, and financial institutions
00:41:27 have proved to be untrustworthy.
00:41:29 With so many promises broken,
00:41:32 we’re not surprised that many people are skeptical about the future.
00:41:37 But in contrast to such failures,
00:41:40 Jehovah’s promises never fail.
00:41:43 And we are made more powerful when we trust in his promises.
00:41:48 He always delivers on his word.
00:41:51 Jehovah promises to sustain us through any trials,
00:41:55 no matter how intense they may become.
00:41:58 Consider Jesus’ example.
00:42:00 No human has faced trials more intense than what he experienced.
00:42:05 Yet, Jesus had faith that delivered
00:42:08 —powerful faith that carried him through.
00:42:11 With freeness of speech, Jesus encouraged his followers
00:42:14 to have faith and not to doubt.
00:42:17 For example,
00:42:19 on one occasion while traveling near Bethany with his disciples,
00:42:22 Jesus used a fig tree to provide an object lesson
00:42:27 on the need to have faith in God.
00:42:30 The account in Matthew chapter 21
00:42:33 tells us that the fig tree was barren except for leaves.
00:42:37 In verses 19 and 20, Jesus said to the tree:
00:42:41 “‘Let no fruit come from you ever again.’
00:42:44 And the fig tree withered instantly.”
00:42:48 Now, as a result, the disciples were amazed and they asked Jesus:
00:42:53 “How is it that the fig tree withered instantly?”
00:42:56 As we read Jesus’ reply to them in verses 21 and 22,
00:43:03 please keep in mind that Jesus is providing
00:43:06 an object lesson for them.
00:43:09 So let’s pull out the lesson about faith
00:43:11 as we read verses 21 and 22:
00:43:15 “In answer Jesus said to them: ‘Truly I say to you,
00:43:19 “‘if you have faith and do not doubt,
00:43:21 “‘not only will you do what I did to the fig tree,
00:43:25 “‘but even if you say to this mountain,
00:43:27 “‘“Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,” it will happen.
00:43:31 “‘And all the things you ask in prayer, having faith,
00:43:34 you will receive.’”
00:43:38 That was a powerful object lesson on faith,
00:43:41 especially in view of the trials that his disciples would soon experience.
00:43:46 But do you see any more object lessons in this example?
00:43:50 There’s another connection between what happened to the fig tree
00:43:54 and having faith.
00:43:56 You see, the nation of Israel, like that fig tree,
00:43:59 had a deceptive appearance.
00:44:02 Although the nation was in a covenant relationship with God,
00:44:05 it proved to be without faith
00:44:07 and it was barren of good fruitage.
00:44:10 It even rejected God’s own Son.
00:44:13 So by causing the unproductive fig tree to wither,
00:44:17 Jesus demonstrated what the end result would be
00:44:20 for those without faith.
00:44:23 To benefit from this object lesson today,
00:44:26 we also need to have faith and not doubt.
00:44:30 In this talk, we will discuss four situations
00:44:33 that show how prayer, study,
00:44:36 and meditation can help us to rely fully on Jehovah’s promises.
00:44:41 With each situation, we will look at the challenge we face,
00:44:45 the promise we’ve received,
00:44:47 and our reason for faith in that promise.
00:44:51 Here’s the first situation:
00:44:53 It is when we are tempted.
00:44:57 What is the challenge?
00:44:59 The challenge is to avoid giving in to temptation.
00:45:03 There are many things that can tempt us
00:45:05 to go down a wrong path and show a lack of faith.
00:45:09 We could be tempted by immoral desires
00:45:11 that violate God’s laws and principles.
00:45:14 We could be tempted to set spiritual interests aside
00:45:18 and pursue material things.
00:45:20 We could be tempted to become prideful
00:45:23 and ambitiously try to outdo others.
00:45:27 We must never allow that to happen.
00:45:31 The fact is that there are many things that could tempt us
00:45:34 to show a lack of faith and of trust in Jehovah.
00:45:37 So now, there is the challenge; here is the promise.
00:45:42 Let’s see Jehovah’s promise in his Word.
00:45:44 It is twofold, or two-part,
00:45:47 and we find it at 1 Corinthians 10:13.
00:45:52 As we read it, look for the promise.
00:45:56 Verse 13:
00:45:58 “No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.
00:46:02 “But God is faithful,
00:46:04 “and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear,
00:46:08 “but along with the temptation he will also make the way out
00:46:11 so that you may be able to endure it.”
00:46:14 What is the promise here?
00:46:17 First, Jehovah will not let us “be tempted
00:46:20 beyond what [we] can bear,” or handle.
00:46:23 Also, Jehovah will help us.
00:46:26 He will “make the way out” for us, it said
00:46:29 —that is, out of any temptation if we rely on him.
00:46:34 We must have faith and not doubt.
00:46:38 So far, we’ve considered the challenge and the promise.
00:46:42 Now let’s examine our reason for faith in that promise.
00:46:46 Our reason for faith is this:
00:46:49 Jehovah knows us better than we know ourselves,
00:46:52 and his Word says that we can remain faithful.
00:46:56 At Deuteronomy 30:11,
00:46:59 Jehovah told the Israelites that what he required of them
00:47:03 was “not too difficult” nor was it “beyond [their] reach,” he said.
00:47:07 So for good reason,
00:47:09 he expected them to show faith and to obey.
00:47:13 He expects no less of his servants today.
00:47:18 Let’s consider some practical steps that will help us to resist temptations.
00:47:23 We will list them first, and then we will look
00:47:25 more closely at two of the steps.
00:47:28 First, pray regularly for the needed strength.
00:47:32 Second, study and meditate
00:47:35 so as to keep your mind fixed on Jehovah’s promises.
00:47:39 Third, know your weaknesses.
00:47:42 And fourth, avoid situations that would increase temptation.
00:47:47 Now let’s look more closely at steps three and four.
00:47:51 They are the need to know our weaknesses
00:47:54 and how to avoid situations that cause temptation for us.
00:47:59 We’re going to begin with a chain.
00:48:02 It’s a fact that a chain
00:48:04 is only as strong as its weakest link, true?
00:48:08 Where it is weak is where it will break first.
00:48:11 Like a chain, we have weaknesses that others may not see,
00:48:16 but we should know our weaknesses.
00:48:20 Make certain that you know yourself
00:48:22 and that you know where you are most vulnerable.
00:48:25 When we know our weaknesses, we know what to guard against.
00:48:28 In other words, we know where the weak link is.
00:48:33 When we know our weaknesses,
00:48:35 then we’re able to stand “firm in the faith.”
00:48:38 One sister said: “When I face temptation, I reject it immediately.
00:48:43 “Letting the mind dwell on the possibilities
00:48:46 is what gets you into trouble in the first place.”
00:48:49 So, again, know your weaknesses
00:48:52 and guard against those weaknesses.
00:48:55 Another important step that we listed
00:48:57 is to avoid situations that increase temptation.
00:49:01 Stay away from people whose speech and conduct
00:49:05 make wrongdoing look attractive.
00:49:07 Remove yourself from situations
00:49:10 where you know you’re going to face temptations.
00:49:13 Surround yourself with friends who encourage you to do what is right.
00:49:18 Proverbs 22:3 says:
00:49:21 “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,
00:49:25 but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.”
00:49:30 We prove to be shrewd when we trust that inspired statement
00:49:34 and avoid temptation.
00:49:37 So in review of when we are tempted,
00:49:40 we looked at the challenge, the promise,
00:49:43 and our reason for faith in that promise.
00:49:46 Then we considered what will help us to succeed,
00:49:49 which included the need to pray regularly
00:49:52 and to study and meditate on God’s Word.
00:49:55 With each of the next three situations,
00:49:58 we will follow the same pattern.
00:50:01 The next situation in which we must rely on Jehovah’s promise
00:50:05 has to do with when we face opposition.
00:50:09 Here’s the challenge: Avoid compromising under pressure.
00:50:14 No doubt all of us think at times about how we would handle various problems
00:50:19 that may eventually confront us.
00:50:21 Such mental exercises can be helpful,
00:50:25 provided that we remember that Jehovah
00:50:28 will always be with us when we are doing his will,
00:50:31 which brings us to his promise
00:50:33 that Jehovah will give us his holy spirit
00:50:36 so that we can endure opposition.
00:50:39 Jesus is one who trusted in that promise.
00:50:43 He also urged his followers to remain calm
00:50:46 and show trust.
00:50:48 Consider what he said at Luke 12:11, 12.
00:50:52 Now, as we read Jesus’ words,
00:50:55 have in mind that the scribes and the Pharisees
00:50:58 were putting extreme pressure on him with many questions
00:51:02 in an effort to use Jesus’ words against him.
00:51:06 Of course, they failed.
00:51:08 And Jesus here gives assurance that, like him,
00:51:11 we too will succeed when persecution comes
00:51:15 if we have faith and do not doubt.
00:51:18 At Luke 12:11, 12, Jesus said:
00:51:22 “When they bring you in before public assemblies,
00:51:25 “government officials, and authorities,
00:51:27 “do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense
00:51:32 “or what you will say,
00:51:34 “for the holy spirit will teach you in that very hour
00:51:37 the things you should say.”
00:51:40 How can we receive the benefits
00:51:43 of this promise when opposition comes?
00:51:46 By listening carefully to Jesus’ words there:
00:51:50 “Do not become anxious.”
00:51:52 Jesus said to remain calm, “for the holy spirit will teach you.”
00:51:57 Show trust.
00:51:59 Jesus is the greatest example of one
00:52:02 who lived by those very words, and we can too.
00:52:06 But it takes faith.
00:52:08 So, again, we’ve looked at the challenge and the promise.
00:52:12 Now let’s examine our reason for faith
00:52:15 in that promise, and it is this:
00:52:18 Jehovah is more powerful
00:52:21 —infinitely more powerful— than any opposer.
00:52:25 Here are three things all centered on Jehovah
00:52:29 that will help us to face persecution and opposition.
00:52:33 First, pray regularly, and when doing so,
00:52:37 express your fears to Jehovah
00:52:40 and ask for the “peace of God.”
00:52:43 In the book of Lamentations, the inspired writer urged God’s people
00:52:47 to “pour out [their] heart like water.”
00:52:50 Water can flow quickly,
00:52:52 and like water flowing out of a large bucket,
00:52:56 we should not hold back when praying to our heavenly Father,
00:53:01 especially whenever we are faced with opposition and persecution.
00:53:05 Pour out your heart to him,
00:53:08 and Jehovah promises that he will help you.
00:53:11 We must have faith in Jehovah’s power
00:53:14 to help us and trust in that promise.
00:53:17 As Jesus said: “Do not become anxious.”
00:53:21 Strong faith will help us to avoid such anxiety.
00:53:25 Second, we are also helped to face opposition when we study
00:53:29 and meditate on God’s Word.
00:53:32 Daily Bible reading helps to strengthen our conviction that Jehovah loves us
00:53:36 and that he will never abandon us.
00:53:39 Focus on his tender qualities as you read his words.
00:53:44 Feel Jehovah’s love for you in the things that he says and does.
00:53:50 As you meditate on the words and works of Jehovah,
00:53:54 reflect on your own experience in his service.
00:53:57 You’ll likely be able to list many things that our heavenly Father
00:54:01 has done for you since you started to serve him.
00:54:05 Yes, Bible reading and meditation draw us closer to Jehovah,
00:54:10 our Source of strength.
00:54:12 And the more your confidence in him grows,
00:54:15 the stronger your bond with him will become
00:54:18 and the stronger your faith in him will become.
00:54:21 Now, related to what we just mentioned,
00:54:23 a third thing that will help you when opposition comes
00:54:26 is to reflect on how Jehovah has helped you through trials in the past,
00:54:31 and that is exactly what David did.
00:54:35 At Psalm 18:6, he said:
00:54:38 “In my distress I called on Jehovah,
00:54:41 “to my God I kept crying for help.
00:54:44 “From his temple he heard my voice,
00:54:48 and my cry to him for help reached his ears.”
00:54:52 So did David recall Jehovah’s help?
00:54:55 Yes, he did.
00:54:56 “He heard my voice,” David said,
00:54:59 “and my cry to him for help reached his ears.”
00:55:03 David not only remembered what had happened
00:55:05 but he had faith that Jehovah heard him.
00:55:10 David was still putting that blessing to work
00:55:12 because he never forgot all that Jehovah had done for him.
00:55:17 When you know that Jehovah has helped you
00:55:20 —when you just know it—
00:55:23 never forget it.
00:55:25 We show gratitude when we remember,
00:55:28 and such experiences strengthen us
00:55:30 to face the trials yet ahead of us.
00:55:34 Now, so far we’ve considered the need for faith
00:55:37 when we are tempted and when we face opposition.
00:55:41 Now we will again follow the same pattern with the third situation:
00:55:46 when we are afflicted with illness.
00:55:50 What is the challenge?
00:55:52 The challenge we face when we are seriously ill is to avoid questioning
00:55:57 whether Jehovah will care for us.
00:56:00 We must continue to remind ourselves that Jehovah loves us
00:56:05 and that he will never abandon us.
00:56:07 Remember the promise:
00:56:09 Jehovah will sustain his loyal ones who are sick.
00:56:13 And that promise is not just a general feeling
00:56:16 that you get from reading his Word.
00:56:18 That promise is a clear statement
00:56:21 found at Psalm 41:3.
00:56:24 We invite you to read it at Psalm 41:3.
00:56:29 But is it a promise to cure us?
00:56:31 Notice what it says:
00:56:33 “Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed;
00:56:38 during his sickness you will completely change his bed.”
00:56:43 Did Jehovah use the word “cure” here?
00:56:46 No, he said “sustain.”
00:56:49 “Jehovah will sustain [us].”
00:56:52 The cure will come later.
00:56:55 But his promise to sustain his servants is a promise that we can trust.
00:57:00 Here is our reason for faith in that promise:
00:57:03 We know that Jehovah has compassion
00:57:06 for those who are disadvantaged by poor health, among other things.
00:57:11 In verse 1 of that same psalm,
00:57:13 we are assured that Jehovah will rescue “the lowly one.”
00:57:17 Jehovah makes a similar loving expression
00:57:20 at Isaiah 57:15.
00:57:24 There he says:
00:57:26 “I reside in the high and holy place,
00:57:29 “but also with those crushed and lowly in spirit,
00:57:33 “to revive the spirit of the lowly [one]
00:57:36 and to revive the heart of those being crushed.”
00:57:40 “I reside in the . . . holy place,” he said,
00:57:44 “but also with those crushed and lowly in spirit.”
00:57:49 Jehovah cares deeply for us, doesn’t he?
00:57:52 In his compassion, he draws close to his faithful ones who are ill.
00:57:57 But while we should have faith that Jehovah will sustain us
00:58:02 (and that is true, of course, whenever we face serious illness),
00:58:06 what steps must we take to cope?
00:58:09 Here are three things that we can do to work along
00:58:12 with Jehovah’s loving support.
00:58:15 First, pray regularly for practical wisdom
00:58:19 to deal with your illness.
00:58:21 James 1:6 says:
00:58:24 “Keep asking in faith, not doubting at all.”
00:58:28 Earlier, Jesus said: “Have faith and do not doubt.”
00:58:33 One sister with strong faith saw the need to do her part
00:58:37 when she found out that she was seriously ill.
00:58:40 She said:
00:58:42 “When I learned that I had cancer in my lung and colon,
00:58:45 “I thought that I had just received a death sentence.
00:58:48 “But after I got home from the doctor, I thought,
00:58:51 “‘OK, it’s not what I expected,
00:58:54 but I have to find a way to deal with this.’”
00:58:58 So, what did she do?
00:59:00 She prayed —and not just any prayer.
00:59:04 She says: “I never pray, ‘Make me better.’
00:59:08 “I always pray,
00:59:10 ‘Help me to be strong and endure my illness.’”
00:59:13 —beautiful example.
00:59:15 That sister understands Psalm 41:3, doesn’t she?
00:59:20 If we do not recover from an illness,
00:59:23 we have faith that the cure is coming in God’s new world.
00:59:28 In the meantime, we also have faith in Jehovah’s promise
00:59:31 that he will sustain us through any trial, any illness.
00:59:35 He will “change [our] bed,” as the verse said,
00:59:39 meaning that Jehovah will see to it that our sickbed
00:59:43 will not be one of hopelessness.
00:59:46 Rather, we will endure with faith and hope.
00:59:51 Many have found that their greatest comfort comes from heartfelt prayer
00:59:55 and from reading such comforting passages in God’s Word.
00:59:59 When we do this, Jehovah will give us strength
01:00:03 and he will bring comforting thoughts to our mind.
01:00:06 That brings us to the second thing that we can do
01:00:10 to work along with Jehovah’s promise and his loving support,
01:00:14 and it is this: Study and meditate on Jehovah’s promises
01:00:18 in order to strengthen your conviction
01:00:21 in the new world where you will have perfect health.
01:00:26 That time is coming,
01:00:28 as Isaiah 33:24 foretells:
01:00:32 “No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”
01:00:36 But we can meditate on such wonderful promises
01:00:39 only if we take the time to read them.
01:00:43 So take time to read a portion of God’s Word every day.
01:00:48 Give close attention to the Psalms
01:00:51 and to what Jesus did during his earthly ministry.
01:00:55 Such accounts provide real-life examples not only of coping
01:00:59 but also of godly compassion for those who are ill.
01:01:03 And we also have such real-life examples of compassion among us today.
01:01:08 So the third thing that those who are afflicted with illness can do
01:01:12 is benefit from association with fellow believers
01:01:16 to the extent possible.
01:01:18 We’ve come to appreciate this even more
01:01:21 after living through a pandemic, isn’t that true?
01:01:24 One sister who has coped with serious illness says this:
01:01:28 “Do not isolate yourself.
01:01:30 “Allow friends to help you.
01:01:33 “There may be times when you feel alone,
01:01:35 but don’t isolate yourself.”
01:01:38 That’s wise advice, and it is Scriptural advice.
01:01:43 Always remember that the love we see among Jehovah’s people
01:01:47 is just a reflection of how he feels about us.
01:01:51 After all, he gave us the ability to love others,
01:01:55 and his people show that godlike love for one another every day.
01:02:00 So put your faith in Jehovah’s sustaining power.
01:02:04 Put your faith in the comfort from the Scriptures
01:02:08 as well as the loving support of family and friends.
01:02:12 Put your faith in Jehovah’s sure promises,
01:02:17 and hold on to the assurance that life is worth living,
01:02:21 even when you are afflicted with a serious illness.
01:02:26 In all that we have considered about Jehovah’s promises,
01:02:30 we see that faith is the essential quality that we need to have.
01:02:34 We need faith when we are tempted, faith when we face opposition,
01:02:39 and faith when we are afflicted with serious illness.
01:02:43 We also need faith when we face economic hardship.
01:02:48 After all, we must have certain things to survive from day to day
01:02:52 and to continue on in our service to Jehovah.
01:02:57 The question is, How well do we cope
01:03:00 when getting the necessities of life
01:03:02 becomes difficult for us?
01:03:04 Food, clothing, shelter, transportation, and so forth
01:03:08 —you see, when these things become hard to get,
01:03:11 it can cause anxiety.
01:03:13 That’s a fact. It can.
01:03:15 And avoiding such anxiety is a challenge we may face.
01:03:19 If we ever face that challenge, what must we call to our mind?
01:03:23 Jehovah’s promise.
01:03:26 Jehovah promises that if we put the Kingdom first,
01:03:29 he will provide the things that we need.
01:03:33 We must have faith in that promise
01:03:35 —strong faith in that promise.
01:03:38 It’s a promise that Jesus made very clear for us.
01:03:42 God’s Son understood that in this system of things,
01:03:45 economic hardship would sometimes befall God’s people.
01:03:48 And he made it a point to include some comments about this challenge
01:03:53 in his well-known Sermon on the Mount.
01:03:55 But along with the challenge,
01:03:57 he provided Jehovah’s promise.
01:04:00 Please follow along as we read Matthew chapter 6
01:04:04 and verse 33
01:04:07 —Matthew 6:33.
01:04:10 Jesus lived as a human,
01:04:14 and here’s a point we want to keep in mind
01:04:16 as we get ready to read this verse.
01:04:18 He grew up in a hardworking family.
01:04:22 It may be that acquiring the necessities of life
01:04:25 did not always come easy for them,
01:04:28 but they trusted in Jehovah, and they had what they needed to serve him.
01:04:32 So, what Jesus later said here at Matthew 6:33,
01:04:36 he said as a real person
01:04:38 —a human— who knew what people faced at times.
01:04:42 So with that context, he had just urged his listeners to stop being anxious
01:04:47 and to trust in Jehovah’s ability to help them.
01:04:50 And then he gave the promise in verse 33:
01:04:53 “Keep on, then,” he said, “seeking first the Kingdom and his righteousness,
01:04:58 “and all these other things
01:05:00 will be added to you.”
01:05:04 The conviction in that statement
01:05:07 “will be added”
01:05:09 stems from the certainty of the promise.
01:05:13 Jehovah cannot lie, and his Son does not lie.
01:05:17 If we put the interests of the Kingdom first,
01:05:21 we will experience the blessings that come from that promise.
01:05:25 We have many reasons to have faith in those words.
01:05:29 Consider: Jehovah provides daily
01:05:32 for the needs of plants and of birds.
01:05:36 So how much more so for his faithful servants!
01:05:39 We know that this is true not only because the Scriptures tell us so
01:05:43 but also because we see it for ourselves.
01:05:46 At Matthew 6:26-29,
01:05:49 just before urging his disciples to put the Kingdom first,
01:05:53 Jesus invited them to “observe intently the birds of heaven.”
01:05:58 Why?
01:06:00 What did he want his disciples to see?
01:06:04 He wanted them to see how our heavenly Father cares
01:06:07 for those little creatures
01:06:09 —how he looks after them and sees that they have their daily food.
01:06:13 They have what they need.
01:06:15 Birds do not spend their days feeling anxious,
01:06:18 and neither should we.
01:06:20 Jesus rhetorically asked: “Are you not worth more than they are?”
01:06:25 Such lessons remind us that we should trust Jehovah’s promise
01:06:30 and in his ability and desire to keep it.
01:06:34 We learned from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount that real happiness and security
01:06:39 do not depend on material things.
01:06:42 What matters is our friendship with our heavenly Father.
01:06:46 So there are the lessons.
01:06:48 But in practical terms,
01:06:50 how can you avoid anxiety over economic hardship?
01:06:54 Remember to pray continually.
01:06:57 When anxiety takes hold of a person, he or she might overlook things
01:07:01 that they normally would never overlook.
01:07:04 Keep praying, and have faith in Jehovah’s promise.
01:07:08 He listens to our prayers.
01:07:11 And pray just as Jesus taught us, not for financial security,
01:07:15 but for our daily needs, “our bread for this day,” as he said.
01:07:20 And along with prayer,
01:07:22 remember to study and meditate on God’s Word each day.
01:07:26 This too can be overlooked when one feels overwhelmed.
01:07:30 Don’t let that happen to you.
01:07:32 Jehovah will see your effort,
01:07:34 and he will bless you for relying on him.
01:07:38 Study and meditate in order to strengthen your conviction
01:07:41 that Jehovah will take care of you.
01:07:43 He promises to do so.
01:07:46 In all of this, don’t forget your past blessings.
01:07:50 Just as Jehovah sustained his people in the past,
01:07:53 reflect on how Jehovah has helped you.
01:07:56 He has not changed.
01:07:58 Use that experience to build up your faith and your conviction
01:08:02 that Jehovah will go on helping you through difficult times.
01:08:08 We live in a largely faithless and skeptical world, isn’t that true?
01:08:13 We need faith, and when we have it, we must keep it strong.
01:08:18 When we have faith in Jehovah’s promises and do not doubt,
01:08:22 we are helped to face whatever may come our way.
01:08:25 We are helped when we are tempted,
01:08:28 when we face opposition,
01:08:30 when we are afflicted with illness,
01:08:33 and when we experience economic hardship.
01:08:37 In these critical last days,
01:08:39 all of us—each one of us— needs to keep growing in faith.
01:08:44 Cultivate the yearning that Jesus’ apostles had toward growing in faith.
01:08:48 We can see their desire in what they said to Jesus
01:08:52 at Luke 17:5
01:08:56 —Luke 17:5.
01:08:58 Please go to that verse,
01:08:59 and we will also read Jesus’ reply to them in verse 6.
01:09:05 After hearing Jesus warn about those who caused stumbling,
01:09:09 we read starting in verse 5:
01:09:12 “The apostles said to the Lord: ‘Give us more faith.’
01:09:17 “Then the Lord said: ‘If you had faith the size of a mustard grain,
01:09:21 “‘you would say to this black mulberry tree,
01:09:24 “‘“Be uprooted and planted in the sea!”
01:09:28 and it would obey you.’”
01:09:30 In other words:
01:09:32 “Have faith and do not doubt,” he was telling them.
01:09:36 Now, it is extremely unlikely
01:09:39 that you will ever need to command a black mulberry tree
01:09:43 to uproot itself and be planted in the sea.
01:09:47 So, then, what was Jesus’ point?
01:09:49 It is this: We are powerful by faith.
01:09:54 Challenges that may seem equally impossible
01:09:57 have been overcome, or defeated, by our faith in God’s power.
01:10:02 Faith helps us to conquer any temptation that we face,
01:10:07 faith helps us to defeat any opposition that rises up against us,
01:10:12 faith sustains us through any illness we may experience,
01:10:16 and faith strengthens us to trust in Jehovah’s promise to support us
01:10:21 during economic hardship.
01:10:23 In other words, uproot the mulberry tree, and plant it in the sea.
01:10:29 As we considered in each of those situations,
01:10:32 we reviewed how prayer, study,
01:10:35 and meditation will help us to stay close to Jehovah,
01:10:38 the One who will grant us more faith.
01:10:42 Pray for it each day.
01:10:44 Imitate examples of faith found in God’s Word
01:10:48 as well as those serving along with us today.
01:10:51 Remain focused on Jehovah who fulfills all of his promises,
01:10:56 and he will bless your efforts
01:10:59 to have faith and not to doubt.
01:11:04 Thank you, Brother Cook, for that warm assurance
01:11:07 that Jehovah will always do what he has promised.
01:11:12 To conclude this session, we invite you to sing a song
01:11:16 that expresses our need for Jehovah’s help and our reliance on him.
01:11:20 It’s song number 118, entitled “Give Us More Faith,”
01:11:25 after which you may have the closing prayer at your individual locations.
01:11:30 Again, that’s song number 118.

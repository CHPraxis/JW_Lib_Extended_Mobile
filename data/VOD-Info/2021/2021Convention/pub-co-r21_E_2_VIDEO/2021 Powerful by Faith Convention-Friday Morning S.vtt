during these difficult
last days of this system of things?

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn many lessons
from a time remarkably similar to ours.

Please follow along in your Bible

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Brother Anthony Morris
of the Governing Body

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
introduces and applies
the dramatic Bible reading entitled

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah—Faith Moved Him to Obey.”

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three days before Jesus was put to death,

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his disciples posed a question

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has great importance
for all of us today.

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:37.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked Jesus:

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What will be the sign of your presence

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the conclusion
of the system of things?”

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In reply, Jesus foretold that a time period

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preceding the promised new world

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be marked by events such as wars,

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
earthquakes, food shortages,

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pestilence.

00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:00.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus then said:

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For as they were in those days

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before the Flood,

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“eating and drinking,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men marrying

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and women being given in marriage,

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:11.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the day that Noah entered into the ark,

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they took no note

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the Flood came

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:18.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and swept them all away,

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the presence of the Son of man will be.”

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With those words,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus confirmed
that Noah was a real person

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Flood
was an actual, historical event.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also warned us
that the period just before the Flood

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mirrors the period in which we live today.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s important to consider closely
what happened in Noah’s day

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see what we can learn from it.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening chapters of the book of Genesis

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give us a picture of what life was like

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the centuries prior to Noah

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after Adam and Eve were expelled
from the garden of Eden.

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone spoke the same language,

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:12.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people had possibly
developed the art of writing.

00:03:12.337 --> 00:03:15.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had built a city, maybe several cities.

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:19.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had learned 
how to forge copper and iron.

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made musical instruments

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—harps and flutes.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:26.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because they were much closer

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the physical perfection of Adam and Eve,

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:32.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they lived long lives

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—hundreds of years.

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:39.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all was not well.

00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People turned away from Jehovah

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:47.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result,
they became very violent and immoral.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things got so bad

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah moved
a righteous man named Enoch,

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the seventh man

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the genealogical line from Adam,

00:03:56.632 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prophesy that God
would not forever tolerate

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wicked and rebellious world;

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d execute judgment against the ungodly.

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
the ungodly people in Enoch’s day

00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t like what he was saying.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hated Enoch,
and they may have tried to kill him.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch never saw the fulfillment
of this prophecy.

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another 600 years passed,

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:28.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by then conditions on earth
had become even worse.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Genesis 6:1-7:

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now when men started to grow in number

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:44.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the surface of the ground

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:46.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and daughters were born to them,

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:49.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the sons of the true God began to notice

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the daughters of men were beautiful.

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:55.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they began taking as wives all whom they chose.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jehovah said:

00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My spirit will not tolerate man indefinitely,

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because he is only flesh.

00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Accordingly, his days will amount to 120 years.’

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Nephilim were on the earth

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in those days and afterward.

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:15.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During that time the sons of the true God

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continued to have relations with the daughters of men,

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:20.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and these bore sons to them.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were the mighty ones of old times,

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:26.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the men of fame.

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:29.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:31.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was great on the earth

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:37.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was only bad all the time.

00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:41.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth,

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:43.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his heart was saddened.

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jehovah said:

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am going to wipe men whom I have created

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘off the surface of the ground,

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:53.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘man together with domestic animals,

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 “‘creeping animals,

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and flying creatures of the heavens,

00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I regret that I have made them.’”

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:04.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time,

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:06.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some angels from heaven

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:09.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
noticed beautiful human women

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:13.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and developed lustful feelings for them.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:16.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These angels rebelled against God

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:20.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by coming to earth and taking on human bodies

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:24.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to have sex with the women.

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:27.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became selfish, wicked demons.

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:29.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have been charming,

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:32.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intelligent, handsome,

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had supernatural powers.

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:37.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have been irresistible,

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:42.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially to women
who themselves had no love of God.

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps the angels took some women by force.

00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:52.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever the case,
the angels took “all whom they chose.”

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What human on earth at that time

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could hope to stop demons?

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To these godless creatures,

00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people lost their daughters,

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:05.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their sisters,

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and possibly even their wives.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The women became pregnant

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:15.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave birth to sons,

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their sons were not like other boys.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were stronger.

00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were bullies
—aggressive, fierce, and brutal.

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:30.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those qualities stayed with them
as they grew.

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:32.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boys became men,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were unusually cruel.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were called Nephilim,

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:42.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly meaning
“those who cause others to fall down,”

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people feared them.

00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:49.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like their fathers,
the Nephilim had no love for God,

00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:53.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they cared only about their fame

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for being strong and vicious.

00:07:56.955 --> 00:08:01.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The materialized angels
and their savage offspring

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dominated the world of that time,

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:06.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people followed their lead.

00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw
that man’s wickedness was rampant

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:15.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that every inclination
of the thoughts of his heart

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:18.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was only bad all the time.”

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Satan must have delighted

00:08:22.814 --> 00:08:26.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see most humans reject Jehovah

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:29.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become more and more corrupt!

00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:35.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in that world of depraved people,

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a man who was faithful to Jehovah.

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:44.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about him at Genesis 6:8:

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:51.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the history of Noah.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah was a righteous man.

00:08:56.598 --> 00:09:00.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries.

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:03.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah walked with the true God.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:07.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In time Noah became father to three sons,

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

00:09:10.153 --> 00:09:12.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the earth had become ruined

00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the sight of the true God,

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the earth was filled with violence.

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:20.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, God looked upon the earth,

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:22.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it was ruined;

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:25.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:32.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people today say
that there was no such person as Noah

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:35.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the account
of the ark and the Flood

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are just a legend or a fairy tale.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible writer knew
that Noah really existed

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Flood truly happened.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel
both refer to Noah.

00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra, the writer of First Chronicles,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Gospel writer Luke

00:09:56.032 --> 00:10:00.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both include Noah
in the chronologies they compiled.

00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:04.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostles Peter and Paul both confirm

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Genesis account of the Flood.

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:09.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as we mentioned earlier,

00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of God himself testified

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:15.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Noah was a real person

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:19.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Flood really happened.

00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:24.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s faith was outstanding.

00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:27.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lived in an evil world

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a world dominated
by materialized angels,

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:34.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their violent offspring,
and a society of ungodly people.

00:10:35.864 --> 00:10:37.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah lacked

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of the things we have today

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us keep our faith strong.

00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:45.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had no Bible to help him
to love Jehovah

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to understand his ways.

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:50.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t know
about all the faithful men and women

00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:53.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would live after him.

00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah had no congregation
of fellow believers

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage him
and to strengthen his faith.

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:04.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Noah knew much.

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:09.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew what happened in the garden of Eden,

00:11:09.147 --> 00:11:12.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could see the tragic results.

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:15.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw that people grew old and died.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that the way
to the garden of Eden was barred

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:22.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ground outside had been cursed.

00:11:22.994 --> 00:11:26.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He understood
what his great-grandfather Enoch

00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:28.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had foretold.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah knew that his father, Lamech,

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:35.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had given him a name
likely meaning “rest” or “consolation”

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he would, as his father foretold,

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:41.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“bring us comfort from our labor

00:11:41.263 --> 00:11:44.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and from the painful toil of our hands

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:48.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the ground
that Jehovah has cursed.”

00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:54.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely, Noah wondered about these prophecies.

00:11:54.901 --> 00:11:57.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he bring comfort?

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How and when would God act

00:11:59.364 --> 00:12:02.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the wicked ones who surrounded him?

00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For hundreds of years,
Noah prayed and he wondered.

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:12.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time he had lived well over 500 years,

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:16.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had married and had a family
—three sons.

00:12:18.508 --> 00:12:21.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though he lived in a wicked world,

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:24.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah remained faithful to God,

00:12:24.222 --> 00:12:26.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he helped his family to do the same.

00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah delivered a message

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:33.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that surely must have stunned Noah.

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:39.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading from Genesis 6:13:

00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:47.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that God said to Noah:

00:12:47.078 --> 00:12:51.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I have decided to put an end to all flesh,

00:12:51.082 --> 00:12:55.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because the earth is full of violence on account of them,

00:12:55.629 --> 00:13:00.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.

“that God had commanded him.

He did just so.”

00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:50.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah had long wondered

00:14:50.785 --> 00:14:54.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah would act
against an ungodly world.

00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he knew;

00:14:56.666 --> 00:15:00.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a catastrophic flood would cleanse the earth.

00:15:00.962 --> 00:15:05.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah also knew
what he and his family must do.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much depended on him!

00:15:09.512 --> 00:15:13.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought must have been overwhelming.

00:15:13.475 --> 00:15:16.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ark would be gigantic.

00:15:17.812 --> 00:15:21.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now new questions occupied his mind.

00:15:21.065 --> 00:15:24.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trees, a great many trees,

00:15:24.444 --> 00:15:26.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have to be felled

00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:29.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the timber hauled, shaped, and joined.

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he do that?

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:35.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he gather so many kinds of animals?

00:15:35.413 --> 00:15:37.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he get food supplies

00:15:37.624 --> 00:15:40.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the animals and for his family?

00:15:42.587 --> 00:15:45.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the godless people around him?

00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:47.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would they think?

00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:51.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah knew what had happened

to the righteous men who preceded him.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel had been killed by his brother Cain.

00:15:57.685 --> 00:15:59.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Enoch likely was

00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:02.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such danger of being slain
by ungodly ones

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God mercifully cut his life short

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he wouldn’t fall into their hands.

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:10.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People would see

00:16:10.907 --> 00:16:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was doing,

00:16:12.617 --> 00:16:16.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’d soon learn why he was doing it.

00:16:16.454 --> 00:16:19.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These God-dishonoring,
Nephilim-influenced people

00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:21.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might react violently.

00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Noah trusted in Jehovah,

00:16:25.713 --> 00:16:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he got to work.

00:16:28.007 --> 00:16:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did all that God had commanded him.

00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:33.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took a long time

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Noah’s family to build the ark,

00:16:35.932 --> 00:16:39.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps some 40 or 50 years.

00:16:39.435 --> 00:16:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There must have been challenges,

00:16:41.938 --> 00:16:45.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never read that Noah complained.

00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:48.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family had no support from others.

00:16:48.695 --> 00:16:51.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Jesus said that the people

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“took no note until the Flood came
and swept them all away.”

00:16:56.953 --> 00:17:01.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, people took note
that Noah was building an ark.

00:17:01.499 --> 00:17:04.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His neighbors must have asked him

00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:08.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he was building
such an enormous structure.

00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:11.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah explained to them
why he was building it.

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:15.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Noah’s contemporaries took no note

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:17.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was blessing Noah

00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:20.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his construction efforts.

00:17:20.727 --> 00:17:24.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took no note
of what this would mean for them.

00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:28.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, the people
were caught up in everyday affairs

00:17:28.735 --> 00:17:31.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—eating, drinking, and marrying;

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:35.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those were the things that concerned them.

00:17:35.033 --> 00:17:37.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To those godless people,

00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:40.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah and his family were fools
—crackpots.

00:17:40.747 --> 00:17:43.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the butt of ridicule, jeers,

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:46.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably threats.

00:17:47.712 --> 00:17:51.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ark was finally completed.

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imagine Noah and his family
looking at it with pride

00:17:56.512 --> 00:18:00.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remembering how God had helped them.

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:04.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always directs
his servants when needed.

00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:08.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Jehovah spoke again to Noah.

00:18:08.441 --> 00:18:13.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read chapter 7, starting with verse 1:

00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:16.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that Jehovah said to Noah:

00:18:16.908 --> 00:18:18.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go into the ark,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you and all your household,

00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because you are the one I have found

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:25.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to be righteous before me among this generation.

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:27.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You must take with you

00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:30.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘every kind of clean animal by sevens,

00:18:30.672 --> 00:18:33.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the male and its mate;

00:18:33.257 --> 00:18:37.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and of every animal that is not clean just two,

00:18:37.303 --> 00:18:39.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the male and its mate;

00:18:39.764 --> 00:18:43.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens,

00:18:43.643 --> 00:18:45.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘male and female,

00:18:45.687 --> 00:18:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For in just seven days,

00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:53.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will make it rain on the earth

00:18:53.778 --> 00:18:55.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for 40 days and 40 nights,

00:18:55.863 --> 00:18:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will wipe from the surface of the ground

00:18:58.408 --> 00:19:01.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every living thing that I have made.’

00:19:01.452 --> 00:19:03.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Noah did everything

00:19:03.663 --> 00:19:05.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had commanded him.”

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:10.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no time to lose.

00:19:10.503 --> 00:19:13.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was urgent work to do.

00:19:13.214 --> 00:19:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In seven days, the rains would come.

00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animals, many animals,
had to be situated in the ark.

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supplies had to be secured.

00:19:22.765 --> 00:19:26.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah listened, and he obeyed.

00:19:26.352 --> 00:19:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the second time in this inspired account,

00:19:29.313 --> 00:19:34.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are told that Noah did all
that he was commanded to do.

00:19:34.944 --> 00:19:39.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now please turn to Genesis 7:6:

00:19:41.242 --> 00:19:43.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah was 600 years old

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:46.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when the floodwaters came upon the earth.

If Noah had wondered
how he would collect all those animals,

he now knew.

and waddling into the ark!

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:37.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imagine Noah’s family
finding places for them all,

stroking the soft fur

What sounds!

Noah and his family must have shouted

Then it came.

00:24:23.274 --> 00:24:25.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rain!

00:24:25.693 --> 00:24:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps it began almost imperceptibly,

00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:31.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but soon it came in torrents.

00:24:31.449 --> 00:24:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sound was deafening.

00:24:34.201 --> 00:24:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they had long anticipated

00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was now happening!

00:24:38.748 --> 00:24:42.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were tired, exhausted,

00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:46.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was likely little sleep that night.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were animals to check.

00:24:49.925 --> 00:24:52.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was the din of the rain.

00:24:52.094 --> 00:24:54.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how they prayed!

00:24:56.432 --> 00:24:59.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did their thoughts turn to those outside?

00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:01.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly.

00:25:01.687 --> 00:25:05.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew those people
and had preached to them.

00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:07.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many were relatives.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad for them!

00:25:10.988 --> 00:25:12.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jehovah,

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah took no delight
in the death of the wicked.

00:25:17.578 --> 00:25:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It saddened him that so many had to die,

00:25:21.248 --> 00:25:24.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he knew that those who perished

00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:27.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had ample warning of what was to come.

00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:32.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if they hadn’t seen
the ark Noah was building,

00:25:32.134 --> 00:25:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would have heard about it.

00:25:34.637 --> 00:25:37.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d know why he was building it.

00:25:37.348 --> 00:25:39.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it was too late for them.

00:25:39.892 --> 00:25:43.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had shut the door.

00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:50.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s family listened as the rain
battered the ark without letup.

00:25:53.364 --> 00:25:55.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then came a moment
they would never forget

00:25:55.991 --> 00:25:57.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—movement!

00:25:57.993 --> 00:26:02.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They felt their massive wooden ark
lifting from the ground.

00:26:02.415 --> 00:26:05.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was floating!

00:26:05.126 --> 00:26:08.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their hearts were beating loud and fast.

00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:11.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would their vessel hold together?

00:26:12.466 --> 00:26:14.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s resume our reading

00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:18.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Genesis 8:1

00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:20.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what happened next.

00:26:21.767 --> 00:26:24.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God gave attention to Noah

00:26:24.103 --> 00:26:27.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to all the wild animals and domestic animals

00:26:27.398 --> 00:26:29.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that were with him in the ark,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and God caused a wind to blow over the earth,

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the waters began to subside.

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:38.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The springs of the watery deep

00:26:38.534 --> 00:26:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up,

00:26:41.537 --> 00:26:45.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so the rain from the heavens stopped falling.

00:26:45.332 --> 00:26:47.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the waters began

00:26:47.334 --> 00:26:50.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to recede progressively from the earth.

00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:53.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By the end of 150 days,

00:26:53.174 --> 00:26:55.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the waters had subsided.

00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:57.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the seventh month,

00:26:57.386 --> 00:26:59.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the 17th day of the month,

00:26:59.763 --> 00:27:03.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.

00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:07.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the waters were steadily decreasing

00:27:07.104 --> 00:27:09.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the tenth month.

00:27:09.148 --> 00:27:12.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the tenth month, on the first of the month,

00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:15.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the tops of the mountains appeared.

00:27:15.321 --> 00:27:17.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So at the end of 40 days,

00:27:17.573 --> 00:27:20.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah opened the window that he had made in the ark

00:27:20.868 --> 00:27:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and sent out a raven;

00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it continued flying outside and returning,

00:27:26.749 --> 00:27:29.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the waters dried off the earth.

00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:32.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Later he sent out a dove

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:34.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to see whether the waters had receded

00:27:34.715 --> 00:27:36.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the surface of the ground.

00:27:36.884 --> 00:27:39.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dove did not find any resting-place to perch,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so it returned to him into the ark

00:27:42.431 --> 00:27:44.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because the waters were still covering

00:27:44.808 --> 00:27:47.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the surface of the whole earth.

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:49.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he reached his hand out

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and brought it inside the ark.

00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:54.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He waited seven more days,

00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:58.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and once again he sent out the dove from the ark.

00:27:58.531 --> 00:28:00.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the dove came to him toward evening,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw that there was

00:28:02.952 --> 00:28:06.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a freshly plucked olive leaf in its bill!

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Noah knew that the waters

00:28:08.332 --> 00:28:10.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had receded from the earth.

00:28:10.834 --> 00:28:13.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He waited still another seven days.

00:28:13.879 --> 00:28:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he sent out the dove,

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:20.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it did not return to him anymore.”

00:28:21.387 --> 00:28:24.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 40 days and 40 nights,

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:27.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the noise of torrential rain filled the ark,

00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:29.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it stopped.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Noah
and his family peering out of the ark

00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:35.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing nothing but water,

00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:37.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no land anywhere.

00:28:37.903 --> 00:28:41.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wind blew, and the waters subsided.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:47.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, 150 days after the downpour began,

00:28:47.871 --> 00:28:50.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ark settled on land.

00:28:50.332 --> 00:28:53.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a happy day that must have been!

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it safe to go out?

00:28:56.964 --> 00:28:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:02.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The waters had to subside further.

00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:06.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was plenty to do
to keep the family busy.

00:29:06.932 --> 00:29:10.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were animals to feed and to care for.

00:29:10.144 --> 00:29:14.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, Noah’s family
must have longed to be outside,

00:29:14.148 --> 00:29:16.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be free of the confinement,

00:29:16.692 --> 00:29:19.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel the ground under their feet.

00:29:19.903 --> 00:29:22.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Patience was needed.

00:29:22.323 --> 00:29:25.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture the family spending time together,

00:29:25.492 --> 00:29:29.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
planning what they’d do
when they came out of the ark.

00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:33.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another 73 days passed.

00:29:33.459 --> 00:29:36.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they could see the tops of the mountains.

00:29:38.005 --> 00:29:41.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now was it safe to exit?

00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:43.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah peered out of a window.

00:29:43.969 --> 00:29:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He selected from the birds a raven,

00:29:46.555 --> 00:29:50.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sent it out, but it kept returning.

00:29:50.434 --> 00:29:52.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah put the raven back in its place

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and selected a dove.

00:29:54.772 --> 00:29:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It too flew and returned,

00:29:57.066 --> 00:30:00.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not having found a place to perch.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A week later, he released it again,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it returned
with an olive leaf in its bill.

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:10.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seven days later, Noah sent it again.

00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time it did not return.

00:30:14.917 --> 00:30:17.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What next?

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:22.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading
from chapter 8, verse 13:

“Now in the 601st year, in the first month,

“the waters had drained from the earth;

“the earth had dried off.

“Then Noah built an altar to Jehovah

00:32:17.372 --> 00:32:20.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the dove didn’t return,

00:32:20.542 --> 00:32:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah removed part of the roof of the ark.

00:32:24.254 --> 00:32:28.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he could see
that much of the land had dried out.

00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:32.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, he could see
vegetation growing and flourishing

00:32:32.513 --> 00:32:34.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that it hadn’t been possible

00:32:34.681 --> 00:32:38.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the days before the Flood,
when the earth had been cursed.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, Noah waited for Jehovah’s direction.

00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:48.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it came, Jehovah’s command:

00:32:48.153 --> 00:32:50.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go out of the ark.”

00:32:50.155 --> 00:32:52.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last!

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyful day that must have been!

00:32:57.037 --> 00:33:00.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d been in the ark for 370 days.

00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:04.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture the family coming out of the ark

00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:08.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—laughing, breathing fresh air,

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eager to adjust to their new life.

00:33:11.552 --> 00:33:14.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The animals came out too,

00:33:14.137 --> 00:33:18.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the family watched
as they dispersed in all directions.

00:33:18.767 --> 00:33:20.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some they had drawn close to,

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:23.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now it was farewell

00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:26.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a happy farewell.

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:28.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were no materialized angels,

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:32.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no Nephilim, and no wicked people.

00:33:33.949 --> 00:33:37.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful they were to Jehovah!

00:33:38.495 --> 00:33:40.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah wasted no time.

00:33:40.956 --> 00:33:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He built an altar and sacrificed to Jehovah,

00:33:44.167 --> 00:33:47.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and God expressed his pleasure.

00:33:48.547 --> 00:33:50.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assured the family

00:33:50.966 --> 00:33:55.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would never again strike down
every living thing.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did more than that.

00:33:59.641 --> 00:34:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He concluded a covenant
with Noah and his sons

00:34:03.604 --> 00:34:07.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave them a sign
that we too can observe.

00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:11.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about it at Genesis chapter 9,

00:34:11.987 --> 00:34:14.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with verse 8:

00:34:15.866 --> 00:34:19.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:

00:34:19.953 --> 00:34:23.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am now establishing my covenant with you

00:34:52.778 --> 00:34:54.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And God added:

of every kind on the earth.’”

00:35:49.876 --> 00:35:54.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a magnificent sign Jehovah gave!

00:35:54.297 --> 00:35:56.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every rainbow would remind

00:35:56.925 --> 00:36:00.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both God and man of his promise.

00:36:00.846 --> 00:36:03.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Noah’s family must have marveled

00:36:03.807 --> 00:36:08.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the colors spanning across the sky

00:36:08.103 --> 00:36:13.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—violet, indigo, blue, green,
yellow, orange, and red!

00:36:15.652 --> 00:36:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never again will a flood deluge the earth.

00:36:21.616 --> 00:36:26.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah is not one
to tolerate wickedness forever.

00:36:26.997 --> 00:36:30.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what the apostle Peter wrote.

00:36:30.625 --> 00:36:35.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to 2 Peter 2:5.

00:36:36.173 --> 00:36:38.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle wrote:

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:41.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he [God] did not refrain

00:36:41.928 --> 00:36:43.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from punishing an ancient world,

00:36:43.972 --> 00:36:47.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness,

00:36:47.225 --> 00:36:50.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“safe with seven others when he brought a flood

00:36:50.729 --> 00:36:53.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon a world of ungodly people.”

00:36:56.109 --> 00:37:01.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we live in a world
that resembles the one before the Flood.

00:37:01.907 --> 00:37:03.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s violence,

00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:08.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people do
all sorts of things that Jehovah hates.

00:37:08.997 --> 00:37:12.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are concerned
with the everyday affairs of life

00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:17.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take no note of the message of salvation

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we proclaim.

00:37:20.133 --> 00:37:23.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ridiculers of God’s people mockingly say:

00:37:23.762 --> 00:37:27.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is this promised presence of his?

00:37:27.182 --> 00:37:30.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why, . . . all things are continuing exactly

00:37:30.477 --> 00:37:33.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they were from creation’s beginning.”

00:37:34.314 --> 00:37:37.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are wrong.

00:37:37.692 --> 00:37:41.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah acted against wickedness
in the time of Noah,

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He’ll act again.

00:37:44.658 --> 00:37:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, like Noah, the faithful will be saved.

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:52.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word assures us:

00:37:52.082 --> 00:37:54.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah knows how to rescue

00:37:54.668 --> 00:37:58.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“people of godly devotion out of trial,

00:37:58.713 --> 00:38:01.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but to reserve unrighteous people

00:38:01.007 --> 00:38:04.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be destroyed on the day of judgment.”

00:38:06.596 --> 00:38:09.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make the earth a paradise,

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he originally purposed.

00:38:13.103 --> 00:38:16.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Paradise will be inhabited
by good people.

00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:20.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be no people
who rebel against God.

00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:24.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what of the rebellious spirit creatures?

00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:27.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the flood deluged the earth
in Noah’s day,

00:38:27.951 --> 00:38:30.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rebellious angels left their human bodies

00:38:30.996 --> 00:38:34.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and returned to the spirit realm in disgrace.

00:38:36.209 --> 00:38:39.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, these demons have continued to exert

00:38:39.838 --> 00:38:44.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an evil influence on humans down to this day.

00:38:44.092 --> 00:38:46.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Jehovah acts again,

00:38:46.761 --> 00:38:50.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the demons and their ruler, Satan,

00:38:50.182 --> 00:38:52.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be put out of action.

00:38:55.562 --> 00:38:58.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Word of God says this:

00:38:58.064 --> 00:39:00.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Noah,

00:39:00.442 --> 00:39:02.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after receiving divine warning

00:39:02.527 --> 00:39:04.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of things not yet seen,

00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:07.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“showed godly fear and constructed an ark

00:39:07.449 --> 00:39:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the saving of his household.”

00:39:11.286 --> 00:39:14.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moved Noah to obey Jehovah.

00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:18.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
he and his family survived the Flood.

00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:24.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah lived a long life, some 950 years.

00:39:25.342 --> 00:39:28.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when that faithful man is resurrected,

00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:32.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll have the prospect of living forever.

00:39:34.601 --> 00:39:38.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we display the faith of Noah
and obey Jehovah,

00:39:38.104 --> 00:39:42.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too can walk
with Jehovah as our Friend

00:39:42.275 --> 00:39:47.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that friendship can last forever!

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible account of Noah reminds us

00:39:52.577 --> 00:39:55.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how close we are to the end of this system

00:39:55.914 --> 00:39:59.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how soon Jehovah will reward our faith.

00:40:33.326 --> 00:40:35.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother Kenneth Cook of the Governing Body

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he answers these questions in the talk

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:43.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have Faith and Do Not Doubt.”

00:40:49.884 --> 00:40:53.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We depend on many powerful man-made things

00:40:53.263 --> 00:40:55.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver the items that we need.

00:40:55.473 --> 00:40:59.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a powerful freight train
can climb steep hills

00:40:59.686 --> 00:41:02.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deliver its freight on time.

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:07.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A powerful cargo ship can withstand
high seas and deliver its cargo.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is a limit
to what man’s ingenuity can do.

00:41:11.448 --> 00:41:15.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to our most crucial needs,
such as true peace,

00:41:15.452 --> 00:41:18.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real security, and lasting happiness,

00:41:18.538 --> 00:41:23.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humans promise what they
do not have the power to deliver.

00:41:23.335 --> 00:41:27.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Political, religious,
and financial institutions

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have proved to be untrustworthy.

00:41:29.591 --> 00:41:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With so many promises broken,

00:41:32.469 --> 00:41:37.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re not surprised that many people
are skeptical about the future.

00:41:37.474 --> 00:41:40.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in contrast to such failures,

00:41:40.018 --> 00:41:43.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promises never fail.

00:41:43.146 --> 00:41:48.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we are made more powerful
when we trust in his promises.

00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always delivers on his word.

00:41:51.488 --> 00:41:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises to sustain us
through any trials,

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how intense they may become.

00:41:58.286 --> 00:42:00.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider Jesus’ example.

00:42:00.747 --> 00:42:05.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No human has faced trials more intense
than what he experienced.

00:42:05.335 --> 00:42:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jesus had faith that delivered

00:42:08.213 --> 00:42:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—powerful faith that carried him through.

00:42:11.383 --> 00:42:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With freeness of speech,
Jesus encouraged his followers

00:42:14.803 --> 00:42:17.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have faith and not to doubt.

00:42:17.263 --> 00:42:19.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:22.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on one occasion while traveling
near Bethany with his disciples,

00:42:22.977 --> 00:42:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus used a fig tree
to provide an object lesson

00:42:27.524 --> 00:42:30.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the need to have faith in God.

00:42:30.402 --> 00:42:33.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in Matthew chapter 21

00:42:33.071 --> 00:42:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that the fig tree
was barren except for leaves.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 19 and 20, Jesus said to the tree:

00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:44.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let no fruit come from you ever again.’

00:42:44.916 --> 00:42:48.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the fig tree withered instantly.”

00:42:48.461 --> 00:42:53.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as a result, the disciples
were amazed and they asked Jesus:

00:42:53.216 --> 00:42:56.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How is it that the fig tree
withered instantly?”

00:42:56.803 --> 00:43:01.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read Jesus’ reply to them
in verses 21 and 22,

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please keep in mind that Jesus is providing

00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:09.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an object lesson for them.

00:43:09.482 --> 00:43:11.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s pull out the lesson about faith

00:43:11.734 --> 00:43:15.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read verses 21 and 22:

00:43:15.613 --> 00:43:19.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In answer Jesus said to them:
‘Truly I say to you,

00:43:19.117 --> 00:43:21.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you have faith and do not doubt,

00:43:21.828 --> 00:43:25.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘not only will you do
what I did to the fig tree,

00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:27.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but even if you say to this mountain,

00:43:27.792 --> 00:43:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,”
it will happen.

00:43:31.254 --> 00:43:34.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And all the things you ask in prayer,
having faith,

00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:36.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive.’”

00:43:38.136 --> 00:43:41.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a powerful object lesson on faith,

00:43:41.723 --> 00:43:46.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in view of the trials
that his disciples would soon experience.

00:43:46.686 --> 00:43:50.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see any more
object lessons in this example?

00:43:50.982 --> 00:43:54.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another connection
between what happened to the fig tree

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having faith.

00:43:56.738 --> 00:43:59.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the nation of Israel,
like that fig tree,

00:43:59.824 --> 00:44:02.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a deceptive appearance.

00:44:02.035 --> 00:44:05.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the nation was
in a covenant relationship with God,

00:44:05.622 --> 00:44:07.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it proved to be without faith

00:44:07.957 --> 00:44:10.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was barren of good fruitage.

00:44:10.585 --> 00:44:13.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It even rejected God’s own Son.

00:44:13.796 --> 00:44:17.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by causing
the unproductive fig tree to wither,

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus demonstrated
what the end result would be

00:44:20.553 --> 00:44:23.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those without faith.

00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:26.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To benefit from this object lesson today,

00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also need to have faith and not doubt.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we will discuss four situations

00:44:33.858 --> 00:44:36.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that show how prayer, study,

00:44:36.694 --> 00:44:41.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation can help us
to rely fully on Jehovah’s promises.

00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:45.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each situation, we will look
at the challenge we face,

00:44:45.703 --> 00:44:47.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the promise we’ve received,

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our reason for faith in that promise.

00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:53.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first situation:

00:44:53.628 --> 00:44:57.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is when we are tempted.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the challenge?

00:44:59.509 --> 00:45:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge is to avoid
giving in to temptation.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things that can tempt us

00:45:05.974 --> 00:45:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go down a wrong path
and show a lack of faith.

00:45:09.185 --> 00:45:11.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be tempted by immoral desires

00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:14.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that violate God’s laws and principles.

00:45:14.816 --> 00:45:18.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be tempted to set
spiritual interests aside

00:45:18.444 --> 00:45:20.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pursue material things.

00:45:20.947 --> 00:45:23.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be tempted to become prideful

00:45:23.616 --> 00:45:27.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ambitiously try to outdo others.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:31.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must never allow that to happen.

00:45:31.124 --> 00:45:34.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that there are
many things that could tempt us

00:45:34.085 --> 00:45:37.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show a lack of faith
and of trust in Jehovah.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:42.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, there is the challenge;
here is the promise.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see Jehovah’s promise in his Word.

00:45:44.804 --> 00:45:47.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is twofold, or two-part,

00:45:47.432 --> 00:45:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we find it at 1 Corinthians 10:13.

00:45:52.437 --> 00:45:56.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read it, look for the promise.

00:45:56.024 --> 00:45:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13:

00:45:58.234 --> 00:46:02.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No temptation has come upon you
except what is common to men.

00:46:02.488 --> 00:46:04.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God is faithful,

00:46:04.532 --> 00:46:08.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear,

00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:11.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but along with the temptation
he will also make the way out

00:46:11.789 --> 00:46:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may be able to endure it.”

00:46:14.584 --> 00:46:17.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the promise here?

00:46:17.128 --> 00:46:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jehovah will not let us “be tempted

00:46:20.423 --> 00:46:23.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond what [we] can bear,” or handle.

00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Jehovah will help us.

00:46:26.262 --> 00:46:29.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will “make the way out” for us, it said

00:46:29.223 --> 00:46:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, out of any temptation
if we rely on him.

00:46:34.187 --> 00:46:38.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have faith and not doubt.

00:46:38.358 --> 00:46:42.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far, we’ve considered
the challenge and the promise.

00:46:42.028 --> 00:46:46.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s examine our
reason for faith in that promise.

00:46:46.324 --> 00:46:49.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our reason for faith is this:

00:46:49.035 --> 00:46:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows us better
than we know ourselves,

00:46:52.455 --> 00:46:56.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Word says
that we can remain faithful.

00:46:56.918 --> 00:46:59.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Deuteronomy 30:11,

00:46:59.796 --> 00:47:03.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told the Israelites
that what he required of them

00:47:03.174 --> 00:47:07.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was “not too difficult” nor was it
“beyond [their] reach,” he said.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for good reason,

00:47:09.722 --> 00:47:13.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he expected them to show faith and to obey.

00:47:13.393 --> 00:47:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He expects no less of his servants today.

00:47:18.147 --> 00:47:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some practical steps
that will help us to resist temptations.

00:47:23.152 --> 00:47:25.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will list them first,
and then we will look

00:47:25.738 --> 00:47:28.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more closely at two of the steps.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray regularly
for the needed strength.

00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:35.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, study and meditate

00:47:35.248 --> 00:47:39.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to keep your mind fixed
on Jehovah’s promises.

00:47:39.585 --> 00:47:42.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, know your weaknesses.

00:47:42.088 --> 00:47:47.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And fourth, avoid situations
that would increase temptation.

00:47:47.093 --> 00:47:51.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look more closely
at steps three and four.

00:47:51.597 --> 00:47:54.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are the need to know our weaknesses

00:47:54.267 --> 00:47:59.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to avoid situations
that cause temptation for us.

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:02.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to begin with a chain.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a fact that a chain

00:48:04.986 --> 00:48:08.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is only as strong as its weakest link, true?

00:48:08.406 --> 00:48:11.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where it is weak
is where it will break first.

00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:16.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like a chain, we have weaknesses
that others may not see,

00:48:16.164 --> 00:48:20.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we should know our weaknesses.

00:48:20.001 --> 00:48:22.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make certain that you know yourself

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you know
where you are most vulnerable.

00:48:25.173 --> 00:48:28.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we know our weaknesses,
we know what to guard against.

00:48:28.551 --> 00:48:33.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
we know where the weak link is.

00:48:33.556 --> 00:48:35.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we know our weaknesses,

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re able to stand “firm in the faith.”

00:48:38.936 --> 00:48:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister said: “When I face temptation,
I reject it immediately.

00:48:43.566 --> 00:48:46.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Letting the mind dwell on the possibilities

00:48:46.277 --> 00:48:49.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what gets you into trouble
in the first place.”

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:52.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, again, know your weaknesses

00:48:52.325 --> 00:48:55.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and guard against those weaknesses.

00:48:55.286 --> 00:48:57.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another important step that we listed

00:48:57.747 --> 00:49:01.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to avoid situations
that increase temptation.

00:49:01.876 --> 00:49:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay away from people
whose speech and conduct

00:49:05.254 --> 00:49:07.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make wrongdoing look attractive.

00:49:07.632 --> 00:49:10.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remove yourself from situations

00:49:10.635 --> 00:49:13.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you know
you’re going to face temptations.

00:49:13.679 --> 00:49:18.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surround yourself with friends
who encourage you to do what is right.

00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:21.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 22:3 says:

00:49:21.103 --> 00:49:25.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger
and conceals himself,

00:49:25.233 --> 00:49:30.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the inexperienced keep right on going
and suffer the consequences.”

00:49:30.238 --> 00:49:34.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prove to be shrewd
when we trust that inspired statement

00:49:34.951 --> 00:49:37.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid temptation.

00:49:37.453 --> 00:49:40.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review of when we are tempted,

00:49:40.998 --> 00:49:43.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we looked at the challenge, the promise,

00:49:43.793 --> 00:49:46.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our reason for faith in that promise.

00:49:46.379 --> 00:49:49.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we considered
what will help us to succeed,

00:49:49.423 --> 00:49:52.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included the need to pray regularly

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to study and meditate on God’s Word.

00:49:55.555 --> 00:49:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each of the next three situations,

00:49:58.641 --> 00:50:01.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will follow the same pattern.

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:05.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next situation in which we
must rely on Jehovah’s promise

00:50:05.982 --> 00:50:09.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to do with when we face opposition.

00:50:09.902 --> 00:50:14.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the challenge:
Avoid compromising under pressure.

00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:19.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt all of us think at times about how
we would handle various problems

00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:21.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may eventually confront us.

00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such mental exercises can be helpful,

00:50:25.001 --> 00:50:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided that we remember that Jehovah

00:50:28.004 --> 00:50:31.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will always be with us
when we are doing his will,

00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:33.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which brings us to his promise

00:50:33.968 --> 00:50:36.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will give us his holy spirit

00:50:36.554 --> 00:50:39.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can endure opposition.

00:50:39.223 --> 00:50:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is one who trusted in that promise.

00:50:43.019 --> 00:50:46.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also urged his followers to remain calm

00:50:46.314 --> 00:50:48.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show trust.

00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:52.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what he said at Luke 12:11, 12.

00:50:52.445 --> 00:50:55.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we read Jesus’ words,

00:50:55.615 --> 00:50:58.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have in mind that the scribes
and the Pharisees

00:50:58.409 --> 00:51:02.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were putting extreme pressure
on him with many questions

00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:06.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an effort to use Jesus’ words against him.

00:51:06.292 --> 00:51:08.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they failed.

00:51:08.377 --> 00:51:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus here gives
assurance that, like him,

00:51:11.714 --> 00:51:15.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too will succeed when persecution comes

00:51:15.092 --> 00:51:18.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have faith and do not doubt.

00:51:18.346 --> 00:51:22.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 12:11, 12, Jesus said:

00:51:22.516 --> 00:51:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they bring you
in before public assemblies,

00:51:25.394 --> 00:51:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“government officials, and authorities,

00:51:27.897 --> 00:51:32.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not become anxious about how
or what you will speak in defense

00:51:32.234 --> 00:51:34.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or what you will say,

00:51:34.236 --> 00:51:37.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the holy spirit will
teach you in that very hour

00:51:37.531 --> 00:51:39.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the things you should say.”

00:51:40.826 --> 00:51:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we receive the benefits

00:51:43.412 --> 00:51:46.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this promise when opposition comes?

00:51:46.666 --> 00:51:50.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By listening carefully to Jesus’ words there:

00:51:50.336 --> 00:51:52.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not become anxious.”

00:51:52.338 --> 00:51:57.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said to remain calm,
“for the holy spirit will teach you.”

00:51:57.259 --> 00:51:59.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show trust.

00:51:59.804 --> 00:52:02.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is the greatest example of one

00:52:02.765 --> 00:52:06.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lived by those very words,
and we can too.

00:52:06.435 --> 00:52:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it takes faith.

00:52:08.771 --> 00:52:12.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, again, we’ve looked
at the challenge and the promise.

00:52:12.316 --> 00:52:15.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s examine our reason for faith

00:52:15.236 --> 00:52:18.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that promise, and it is this:

00:52:18.447 --> 00:52:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is more powerful

00:52:21.117 --> 00:52:25.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—infinitely more powerful—
than any opposer.

00:52:25.997 --> 00:52:29.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three things all centered on Jehovah

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us to face
persecution and opposition.

00:52:33.337 --> 00:52:37.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray regularly, and when doing so,

00:52:37.717 --> 00:52:40.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
express your fears to Jehovah

00:52:40.386 --> 00:52:43.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for the “peace of God.”

00:52:43.347 --> 00:52:47.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the book of Lamentations,
the inspired writer urged God’s people

00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:50.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “pour out [their] heart like water.”

00:52:50.896 --> 00:52:52.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Water can flow quickly,

00:52:52.898 --> 00:52:56.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like water flowing out of a large bucket,

00:52:56.569 --> 00:53:01.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should not hold back
when praying to our heavenly Father,

00:53:01.157 --> 00:53:05.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially whenever we are faced
with opposition and persecution.

00:53:05.619 --> 00:53:08.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pour out your heart to him,

00:53:08.581 --> 00:53:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah promises that he will help you.

00:53:11.834 --> 00:53:14.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have faith in Jehovah’s power

00:53:14.962 --> 00:53:17.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us and trust in that promise.

00:53:17.715 --> 00:53:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said: “Do not become anxious.”

00:53:21.177 --> 00:53:25.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith will help us
to avoid such anxiety.

00:53:25.765 --> 00:53:29.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we are also helped
to face opposition when we study

00:53:29.602 --> 00:53:32.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on God’s Word.

00:53:32.354 --> 00:53:36.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daily Bible reading helps to strengthen
our conviction that Jehovah loves us

00:53:36.984 --> 00:53:39.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will never abandon us.

00:53:39.612 --> 00:53:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on his tender qualities
as you read his words.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:49.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feel Jehovah’s love for you
in the things that he says and does.

00:53:50.081 --> 00:53:54.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you meditate on the words
and works of Jehovah,

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:57.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on your own
experience in his service.

00:53:57.671 --> 00:54:01.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll likely be able to list
many things that our heavenly Father

00:54:01.342 --> 00:54:05.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has done for you
since you started to serve him.

00:54:05.763 --> 00:54:10.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Bible reading and meditation
draw us closer to Jehovah,

00:54:10.017 --> 00:54:12.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Source of strength.

00:54:12.645 --> 00:54:15.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the more your confidence in him grows,

00:54:15.439 --> 00:54:18.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stronger your bond with him will become

00:54:18.359 --> 00:54:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the stronger your faith
in him will become.

00:54:21.529 --> 00:54:23.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, related to what we just mentioned,

00:54:23.823 --> 00:54:26.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a third thing that will help you
when opposition comes

00:54:26.951 --> 00:54:31.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to reflect on how Jehovah
has helped you through trials in the past,

00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:35.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is exactly what David did.

00:54:35.501 --> 00:54:38.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 18:6, he said:

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In my distress I called on Jehovah,

00:54:41.632 --> 00:54:44.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to my God I kept crying for help.

00:54:44.343 --> 00:54:48.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From his temple he heard my voice,

00:54:48.222 --> 00:54:52.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my cry to him for help reached his ears.”

00:54:52.184 --> 00:54:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did David recall Jehovah’s help?

00:54:55.104 --> 00:54:56.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he did.

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He heard my voice,” David said,

00:54:59.108 --> 00:55:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and my cry to him
for help reached his ears.”

00:55:03.112 --> 00:55:05.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David not only remembered what had happened

00:55:05.823 --> 00:55:10.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he had faith that Jehovah heard him.

00:55:10.244 --> 00:55:12.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was still putting that blessing to work

00:55:12.663 --> 00:55:17.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he never forgot
all that Jehovah had done for him.

00:55:17.334 --> 00:55:20.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you know that Jehovah has helped you

00:55:20.754 --> 00:55:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when you just know it—

00:55:23.299 --> 00:55:25.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget it.

00:55:25.634 --> 00:55:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show gratitude when we remember,

00:55:28.304 --> 00:55:30.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and such experiences strengthen us

00:55:30.848 --> 00:55:33.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face the trials yet ahead of us.

00:55:34.643 --> 00:55:37.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, so far we’ve
considered the need for faith

00:55:37.605 --> 00:55:41.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are tempted
and when we face opposition.

00:55:41.775 --> 00:55:46.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we will again follow
the same pattern with the third situation:

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:50.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are afflicted with illness.

00:55:50.034 --> 00:55:52.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the challenge?

00:55:52.244 --> 00:55:57.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge we face when we are
seriously ill is to avoid questioning

00:55:57.208 --> 00:56:00.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Jehovah will care for us.

00:56:00.377 --> 00:56:05.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must continue to remind
ourselves that Jehovah loves us

00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:07.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will never abandon us.

00:56:07.676 --> 00:56:09.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the promise:

00:56:09.678 --> 00:56:13.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will sustain
his loyal ones who are sick.

00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:16.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that promise
is not just a general feeling

00:56:16.435 --> 00:56:18.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you get from reading his Word.

00:56:18.896 --> 00:56:21.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That promise is a clear statement

00:56:21.106 --> 00:56:24.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Psalm 41:3.

00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:29.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to read it at Psalm 41:3.

00:56:29.114 --> 00:56:31.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it a promise to cure us?

00:56:31.867 --> 00:56:33.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says:

00:56:33.994 --> 00:56:38.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed;

00:56:38.249 --> 00:56:42.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during his sickness
you will completely change his bed.”

00:56:43.504 --> 00:56:46.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah use the word “cure” here?

00:56:46.715 --> 00:56:49.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he said “sustain.”

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will sustain [us].”

00:56:52.054 --> 00:56:55.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The cure will come later.

00:56:55.057 --> 00:57:00.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his promise to sustain
his servants is a promise that we can trust.

00:57:00.062 --> 00:57:03.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is our reason for faith in that promise:

00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:06.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah has compassion

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:11.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who are disadvantaged
by poor health, among other things.

00:57:11.615 --> 00:57:13.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 1 of that same psalm,

00:57:13.701 --> 00:57:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are assured that Jehovah
will rescue “the lowly one.”

00:57:17.913 --> 00:57:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah makes a similar loving expression

00:57:20.749 --> 00:57:24.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 57:15.

00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:26.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he says:

00:57:26.213 --> 00:57:29.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reside in the high and holy place,

00:57:29.466 --> 00:57:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also with those
crushed and lowly in spirit,

00:57:33.095 --> 00:57:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to revive the spirit of the lowly [one]

00:57:36.223 --> 00:57:40.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to revive the heart
of those being crushed.”

00:57:40.936 --> 00:57:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reside in the . . . holy place,” he said,

00:57:44.148 --> 00:57:49.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also with those
crushed and lowly in spirit.”

00:57:49.153 --> 00:57:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cares deeply for us, doesn’t he?

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his compassion, he draws close
to his faithful ones who are ill.

00:57:57.995 --> 00:58:02.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But while we should have faith
that Jehovah will sustain us

00:58:02.041 --> 00:58:06.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that is true, of course,
whenever we face serious illness),

00:58:06.253 --> 00:58:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what steps must we take to cope?

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three things
that we can do to work along

00:58:12.843 --> 00:58:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s loving support.

00:58:15.262 --> 00:58:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray regularly for practical wisdom

00:58:19.099 --> 00:58:21.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with your illness.

00:58:21.268 --> 00:58:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:6 says:

00:58:24.021 --> 00:58:28.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep asking in faith, not doubting at all.”

00:58:28.525 --> 00:58:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, Jesus said:
“Have faith and do not doubt.”

00:58:33.322 --> 00:58:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister with strong faith
saw the need to do her part

00:58:37.284 --> 00:58:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she found out
that she was seriously ill.

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:42.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said:

00:58:42.081 --> 00:58:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I learned that I had
cancer in my lung and colon,

00:58:45.584 --> 00:58:48.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I thought that I had
just received a death sentence.

00:58:48.921 --> 00:58:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But after I got home
from the doctor, I thought,

00:58:51.924 --> 00:58:54.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘OK, it’s not what I expected,

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I have to find a way to deal with this.’”

00:58:58.222 --> 00:59:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did she do?

00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She prayed
—and not just any prayer.

00:59:04.103 --> 00:59:08.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says: “I never pray, ‘Make me better.’

00:59:08.232 --> 00:59:10.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I always pray,

00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:13.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Help me to be strong
and endure my illness.’”

00:59:13.987 --> 00:59:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beautiful example.

00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:20.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sister understands
Psalm 41:3, doesn’t she?

00:59:20.828 --> 00:59:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do not recover from an illness,

00:59:23.664 --> 00:59:28.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have faith that the cure
is coming in God’s new world.

00:59:28.293 --> 00:59:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
we also have faith in Jehovah’s promise

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will sustain us
through any trial, any illness.

00:59:35.551 --> 00:59:39.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will “change [our] bed,”
as the verse said,

00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that Jehovah
will see to it that our sickbed

00:59:43.851 --> 00:59:46.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not be one of hopelessness.

00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:51.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we will endure with faith and hope.

00:59:51.316 --> 00:59:55.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have found that their
greatest comfort comes from heartfelt prayer

00:59:55.737 --> 00:59:59.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from reading such
comforting passages in God’s Word.

00:59:59.616 --> 01:00:03.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this,
Jehovah will give us strength

01:00:03.245 --> 01:00:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will bring
comforting thoughts to our mind.

01:00:06.874 --> 01:00:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to the second thing
that we can do

01:00:10.169 --> 01:00:14.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work along with Jehovah’s promise
and his loving support,

01:00:14.047 --> 01:00:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is this: Study and meditate
on Jehovah’s promises

01:00:18.969 --> 01:00:21.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to strengthen your conviction

01:00:21.763 --> 01:00:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world where you
will have perfect health.

01:00:26.101 --> 01:00:28.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That time is coming,

01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Isaiah 33:24 foretells:

01:00:32.024 --> 01:00:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can meditate
on such wonderful promises

01:00:39.281 --> 01:00:43.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only if we take the time to read them.

01:00:43.869 --> 01:00:48.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take time to read
a portion of God’s Word every day.

01:00:48.874 --> 01:00:51.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give close attention to the Psalms

01:00:51.335 --> 01:00:55.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to what Jesus did
during his earthly ministry.

01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:59.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such accounts provide
real-life examples not only of coping

01:00:59.468 --> 01:01:03.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also of godly compassion
for those who are ill.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:08.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also have such real-life examples
of compassion among us today.

01:01:08.352 --> 01:01:12.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the third thing that those
who are afflicted with illness can do

01:01:12.564 --> 01:01:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is benefit from association
with fellow believers

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the extent possible.

01:01:18.654 --> 01:01:21.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve come to appreciate this even more

01:01:21.323 --> 01:01:24.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after living through a pandemic,
isn’t that true?

01:01:24.993 --> 01:01:28.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister who has coped
with serious illness says this:

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not isolate yourself.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Allow friends to help you.

01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:35.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There may be times when you feel alone,

01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:38.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t isolate yourself.”

01:01:38.757 --> 01:01:43.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s wise advice,
and it is Scriptural advice.

01:01:43.387 --> 01:01:47.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always remember that the love
we see among Jehovah’s people

01:01:47.474 --> 01:01:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just a reflection
of how he feels about us.

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:55.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, he gave us
the ability to love others,

01:01:55.482 --> 01:02:00.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his people show that godlike love
for one another every day.

01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:04.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put your faith
in Jehovah’s sustaining power.

01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:08.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put your faith
in the comfort from the Scriptures

01:02:08.412 --> 01:02:12.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the loving support
of family and friends.

01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:17.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put your faith in Jehovah’s sure promises,

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hold on to the assurance
that life is worth living,

01:02:21.216 --> 01:02:25.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when you are afflicted
with a serious illness.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all that we have considered
about Jehovah’s promises,

01:02:30.058 --> 01:02:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that faith is the essential quality
that we need to have.

01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:39.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need faith when we are tempted,
faith when we face opposition,

01:02:39.443 --> 01:02:43.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith when we are afflicted
with serious illness.

01:02:43.655 --> 01:02:48.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also need faith
when we face economic hardship.

01:02:48.368 --> 01:02:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, we must have certain things
to survive from day to day

01:02:52.706 --> 01:02:57.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to continue on in our service to Jehovah.

01:02:57.252 --> 01:03:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is, How well do we cope

01:03:00.255 --> 01:03:02.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when getting the necessities of life

01:03:02.674 --> 01:03:04.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becomes difficult for us?

01:03:04.926 --> 01:03:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Food, clothing, shelter,
transportation, and so forth

01:03:08.597 --> 01:03:11.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you see, when these things
become hard to get,

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:13.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can cause anxiety.

01:03:13.143 --> 01:03:15.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a fact.
It can.

01:03:15.228 --> 01:03:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And avoiding such anxiety
is a challenge we may face.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we ever face that challenge,
what must we call to our mind?

01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:26.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promise.

01:03:26.198 --> 01:03:29.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises that if we
put the Kingdom first,

01:03:29.826 --> 01:03:33.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will provide the things that we need.

01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:35.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have faith in that promise

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:38.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—strong faith in that promise.

01:03:38.752 --> 01:03:42.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a promise that Jesus
made very clear for us.

01:03:42.172 --> 01:03:45.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Son understood
that in this system of things,

01:03:45.008 --> 01:03:48.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
economic hardship would
sometimes befall God’s people.

01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:53.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he made it a point to include
some comments about this challenge

01:03:53.058 --> 01:03:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his well-known Sermon on the Mount.

01:03:55.852 --> 01:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But along with the challenge,

01:03:57.854 --> 01:04:00.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provided Jehovah’s promise.

01:04:00.774 --> 01:04:04.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along
as we read Matthew chapter 6

01:04:04.778 --> 01:04:07.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 33

01:04:07.114 --> 01:04:09.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:33.

01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:14.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus lived as a human,

01:04:14.204 --> 01:04:16.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s a point we want to keep in mind

01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:18.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we get ready to read this verse.

01:04:18.709 --> 01:04:22.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He grew up in a hardworking family.

01:04:22.212 --> 01:04:25.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that acquiring
the necessities of life

01:04:25.674 --> 01:04:28.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not always come easy for them,

01:04:28.301 --> 01:04:32.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they trusted in Jehovah,
and they had what they needed to serve him.

01:04:32.764 --> 01:04:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what Jesus later
said here at Matthew 6:33,

01:04:36.768 --> 01:04:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said as a real person

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:42.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a human—
who knew what people faced at times.

01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:47.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that context, he had just urged
his listeners to stop being anxious

01:04:47.112 --> 01:04:50.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to trust in Jehovah’s ability
to help them.

01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:53.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he gave the promise in verse 33:

01:04:53.618 --> 01:04:58.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on, then,” he said, “seeking first
the Kingdom and his righteousness,

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:00.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all these other things

01:05:00.792 --> 01:05:03.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be added to you.”

01:05:04.713 --> 01:05:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conviction in that statement

01:05:07.299 --> 01:05:09.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be added”

01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:13.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stems from the certainty of the promise.

01:05:13.263 --> 01:05:17.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cannot lie, and his Son does not lie.

01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:21.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we put the interests of the Kingdom first,

01:05:21.438 --> 01:05:25.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will experience the blessings
that come from that promise.

01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:29.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many reasons
to have faith in those words.

01:05:29.654 --> 01:05:32.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider: Jehovah provides daily

01:05:32.532 --> 01:05:36.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the needs of plants and of birds.

01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:39.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how much more
so for his faithful servants!

01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:43.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that this is true
not only because the Scriptures tell us so

01:05:43.168 --> 01:05:46.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also because we see it for ourselves.

01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:49.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 6:26-29,

01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:53.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before urging his disciples
to put the Kingdom first,

01:05:53.845 --> 01:05:58.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus invited them to “observe intently
the birds of heaven.”

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:06:00.852 --> 01:06:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he want his disciples to see?

01:06:04.231 --> 01:06:07.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted them to see
how our heavenly Father cares

01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:09.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those little creatures

01:06:09.736 --> 01:06:13.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how he looks after them
and sees that they have their daily food.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have what they need.

01:06:15.742 --> 01:06:18.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Birds do not spend
their days feeling anxious,

01:06:18.912 --> 01:06:20.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neither should we.

01:06:20.914 --> 01:06:25.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus rhetorically asked:
“Are you not worth more than they are?”

01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:30.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such lessons remind us
that we should trust Jehovah’s promise

01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:34.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his ability and desire to keep it.

01:06:34.678 --> 01:06:39.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned from Jesus’ Sermon
on the Mount that real happiness and security

01:06:39.307 --> 01:06:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not depend on material things.

01:06:42.018 --> 01:06:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What matters is our friendship
with our heavenly Father.

01:06:46.022 --> 01:06:48.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are the lessons.

01:06:48.149 --> 01:06:50.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in practical terms,

01:06:50.151 --> 01:06:54.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you avoid anxiety
over economic hardship?

01:06:54.197 --> 01:06:57.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember to pray continually.

01:06:57.325 --> 01:07:01.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When anxiety takes hold of a person,
he or she might overlook things

01:07:01.538 --> 01:07:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they normally would never overlook.

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:08.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep praying,
and have faith in Jehovah’s promise.

01:07:08.378 --> 01:07:11.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He listens to our prayers.

01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:15.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And pray just as Jesus taught us,
not for financial security,

01:07:15.927 --> 01:07:20.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for our daily needs,
“our bread for this day,” as he said.

01:07:20.557 --> 01:07:22.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And along with prayer,

01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:26.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to study and meditate
on God’s Word each day.

01:07:26.354 --> 01:07:30.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This too can be overlooked
when one feels overwhelmed.

01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:32.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let that happen to you.

01:07:32.861 --> 01:07:34.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will see your effort,

01:07:34.863 --> 01:07:38.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will bless you for relying on him.

01:07:38.533 --> 01:07:41.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Study and meditate in order
to strengthen your conviction

01:07:41.453 --> 01:07:43.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will take care of you.

01:07:43.705 --> 01:07:46.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promises to do so.

01:07:46.958 --> 01:07:50.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of this,
don’t forget your past blessings.

01:07:50.295 --> 01:07:53.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah sustained
his people in the past,

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on how Jehovah has helped you.

01:07:56.593 --> 01:07:58.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has not changed.

01:07:58.595 --> 01:08:02.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use that experience to build up
your faith and your conviction

01:08:02.474 --> 01:08:07.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will go on helping you
through difficult times.

01:08:08.688 --> 01:08:13.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a largely faithless
and skeptical world, isn’t that true?

01:08:13.318 --> 01:08:18.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need faith, and when we have it,
we must keep it strong.

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:22.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we have faith
in Jehovah’s promises and do not doubt,

01:08:22.077 --> 01:08:25.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are helped to face
whatever may come our way.

01:08:25.914 --> 01:08:28.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are helped when we are tempted,

01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:30.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we face opposition,

01:08:30.961 --> 01:08:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are afflicted with illness,

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:37.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we experience economic hardship.

01:08:37.092 --> 01:08:39.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these critical last days,

01:08:39.844 --> 01:08:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us—each one of us—
needs to keep growing in faith.

01:08:44.307 --> 01:08:48.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cultivate the yearning that Jesus’ apostles
had toward growing in faith.

01:08:48.728 --> 01:08:52.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see their desire
in what they said to Jesus

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 17:5

01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:58.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Luke 17:5.

01:08:58.363 --> 01:08:59.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to that verse,

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:04.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will also read
Jesus’ reply to them in verse 6.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:09.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After hearing Jesus warn
about those who caused stumbling,

01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:12.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read starting in verse 5:

01:09:12.085 --> 01:09:17.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The apostles said to the Lord:
‘Give us more faith.’

01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:21.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the Lord said: ‘If you had faith
the size of a mustard grain,

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you would say to this black mulberry tree,

01:09:24.848 --> 01:09:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Be uprooted and planted in the sea!”

01:09:28.184 --> 01:09:30.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it would obey you.’”

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:32.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words:

01:09:32.772 --> 01:09:36.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have faith and do not doubt,”
he was telling them.

01:09:36.901 --> 01:09:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it is extremely unlikely

01:09:39.654 --> 01:09:43.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will ever need
to command a black mulberry tree

01:09:43.658 --> 01:09:47.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to uproot itself and be planted in the sea.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what was Jesus’ point?

01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:54.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is this: We are powerful by faith.

01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Challenges that may seem equally impossible

01:09:57.464 --> 01:10:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been overcome,
or defeated, by our faith in God’s power.

01:10:02.385 --> 01:10:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith helps us to conquer
any temptation that we face,

01:10:07.223 --> 01:10:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith helps us to defeat
any opposition that rises up against us,

01:10:12.228 --> 01:10:16.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faith sustains us through
any illness we may experience,

01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:21.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith strengthens us to trust
in Jehovah’s promise to support us

01:10:21.404 --> 01:10:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during economic hardship.

01:10:23.406 --> 01:10:28.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, uproot the mulberry tree,
and plant it in the sea.

01:10:29.245 --> 01:10:32.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we considered in each of those situations,

01:10:32.373 --> 01:10:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we reviewed how prayer, study,

01:10:35.251 --> 01:10:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation will help us
to stay close to Jehovah,

01:10:38.922 --> 01:10:42.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One who will grant us more faith.

01:10:42.133 --> 01:10:44.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for it each day.

01:10:44.677 --> 01:10:48.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate examples of faith found in God’s Word

01:10:48.473 --> 01:10:51.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as those serving along with us today.

01:10:51.935 --> 01:10:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain focused on Jehovah
who fulfills all of his promises,

01:10:56.898 --> 01:10:59.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will bless your efforts

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:02.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have faith and not to doubt.

01:11:04.614 --> 01:11:07.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Cook,
for that warm assurance

01:11:07.534 --> 01:11:11.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will always do
what he has promised.

01:11:12.288 --> 01:11:16.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude this session,
we invite you to sing a song

01:11:16.084 --> 01:11:20.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that expresses our need
for Jehovah’s help and our reliance on him.

01:11:20.255 --> 01:11:25.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s song number 118,
entitled “Give Us More Faith,”

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:30.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after which you may have the closing prayer
at your individual locations.

01:11:30.014 --> 01:11:33.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 118.

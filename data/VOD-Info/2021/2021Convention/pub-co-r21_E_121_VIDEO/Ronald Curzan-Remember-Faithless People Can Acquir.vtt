00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Impossible!

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:07.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will never happen—not in a million years!’

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:10.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought that way
about someone coming into the truth?

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that might be
our limited view of a person.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:17.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does Jehovah view him or her?

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is his view of all humans,
even faithless ones?

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his limitless view

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Timothy 2:4.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says: “. . . God, whose will is
that all sorts of people should be saved

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Jehovah’s desire?

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s his will that all hear the message

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be allowed to make changes and be saved.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to us that might be impossible,

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know
“with God all things are possible.”

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can stir the heart,
and he can motivate anyone.

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it’s true that “faith
is not [the] possession of all people,”

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is a possession
of millions around the world,

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:09.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can be for those
who choose to acquire it.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that the Bible
contains many examples

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of men and women
who at one time lacked faith

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but later acquired it,
and the same is true today.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not impossible.

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will help us
to remember this fact:

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithless people can acquire faith

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have Jehovah’s view of them

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:33.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow all sorts of people

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hear God’s Word and make adjustments.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will discuss four groups
of people in this symposium:

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ninevites, Jesus’ fleshly brothers,

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prominent ones, and nonreligious people.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in each one of these symposium talks,

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will consider
what helped former unbelievers

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:59.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to acquire faith
and what we can learn from that.

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s consider
the example of the Ninevites.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you recall, they were Assyrians

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who lived in the capital city of Nineveh,

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was founded by Nimrod.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was referred to
as “the city of bloodshed.”

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that history and backdrop,

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can imagine what the people were like.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They worshipped gods of war.

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
War was their religion.

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:26.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were aggressive.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were violent people,

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they took pleasure
in sadistically torturing their captives.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, their reputation was known

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all the surrounding nations,
including God’s people.

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s why Jehovah sent his prophet Jonah

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go there and proclaim their destruction.

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we notice this first video,

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine how Jonah must have felt
going into Nineveh

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—going through the streets
and observing the people of Nineveh

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contemplating his warning message.

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jonah view his assignment?

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at this time,
he did not have Jehovah’s view.

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was afraid of the Ninevites
—maybe what they thought of him

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what they would do
once they heard his message.

00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jonah was human.

00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had feelings like ours.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A human tendency is to judge people

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what we see or what we hear about them.

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:34.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were alive then

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:38.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave you
this assignment instead of Jonah,

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how might you have reacted?

00:04:40.342 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you have thought about the Ninevites

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their cruelty
and their wickedness and say,

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:46.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They can change”?

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would you feel: ‘It’s impossible!

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will never happen—not in a million years’?

00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:54.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s how Jonah felt.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah corrected
his view of his assignment

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as his view of the people.

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:05.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took that message
and that counsel from Jehovah to heart,

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he proclaimed the message
to the people of Nineveh.

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly got the Ninevites’ attention,

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he might have thought to himself,

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, this is the end for me.’

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did they respond?

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:24.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jonah 3:5;

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:26.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:05:26.346 --> 00:05:29.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the men of Nineveh put faith in God.”

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this surprised even Jonah himself.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king made a proclamation
to all the people

00:05:35.522 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they should do
to demonstrate their faith.

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:40.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 8; it says:

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:44.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let them be covered with sackcloth,
both man and beast;

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:47.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let them call out earnestly to God

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:51.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and turn from their evil ways
and from the violence they practice.

00:05:51.872 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who knows
whether the true God may reconsider

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what he intends to do
and turn from his burning anger,

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we may not perish?”

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:07.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped the Ninevites
to change, to acquire faith?

00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:11.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a direct result
of Jonah accomplishing his assignment

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—boldly preaching God’s message.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were given the opportunity to change,

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jonah’s surprise, they did.

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:24.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jonah had to make changes too.

00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:27.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to take his limited view
of his assignment and the people

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:31.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and change it to the limitless view
that Jehovah had

00:06:31.286 --> 00:06:35.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that people can change,
and Jehovah can stir their hearts.

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:40.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jonah had to look at himself
and relook at his assignment.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not the judge.

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:43.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not the jury.

00:06:43.882 --> 00:06:45.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a messenger.

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:49.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having Jehovah’s view changes everything

00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how we view others, how we view ourselves,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we view our assignments today.

00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are ministers who have a message.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not the judges.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah is the Judge.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did he judge
the Ninevites worthy

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being saved and having his mercy?

00:07:09.408 --> 00:07:14.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jonah 3:10;

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:18.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“When the true God saw what they did,

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how they had turned back
from their evil ways,

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:25.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he reconsidered the calamity
that he said he would bring on them,

00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:29.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did not bring it.”

00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:31.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:35.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the changes that the Ninevites
made and how they benefited.

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:24.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you Jonah?

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am.

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:27.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:40.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Ninevites certainly changed
from the first video that we watched.

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:43.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Changes that they made on the inside

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowed them to make changes on the outside

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:49.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how they viewed their fellow Ninevites,
and how they treated them.

00:08:49.174 --> 00:08:52.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even their dispositions changed from gloomy,

00:08:52.677 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unhappy faces to smiling, happy ones.

00:08:56.348 --> 00:08:59.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were appreciative
of Jonah’s warning message

00:08:59.768 --> 00:09:02.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as Jehovah’s mercy.

00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:05.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:07.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same lesson that Jonah learned:

00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:11.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to show compassion as Jehovah does.

00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:13.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means more than just noticing

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:16.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone needs help but taking the time

00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:20.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having the desire
to try to relieve that pain.

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:22.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help them.

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:26.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate
Jehovah’s compassion today?

00:09:26.044 --> 00:09:29.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s by putting compassion into action.

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:32.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do by our preaching.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do this for <i>all </i> persons

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:38.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—giving them an opportunity
to change and not being judgmental—

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:41.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by viewing them as potential sheep

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:44.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as our future brother or sister.

Like the Ninevites, many today

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are taught wrong beliefs
and attitudes from childhood.

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:55.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it may be difficult
to change but not impossible.

00:09:55.657 --> 00:09:58.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help them change?

00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:00.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 4:12 says

00:10:00.537 --> 00:10:02.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the word of God” can help.

00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:05.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of God is alive and exerts power.”

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:12.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us are living proof
of the Bible’s power to change us.

00:10:12.132 --> 00:10:14.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before learning the truth,

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:18.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of us might have been
violent, immoral, faithless.

00:10:18.263 --> 00:10:23.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the apostle Paul said:
“That is what some of you were.”

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They changed back then.

00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:27.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are changing today.

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:30.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the help of God’s Word
and his holy spirit,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can help others change.

00:10:32.736 --> 00:10:34.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot read hearts,

00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:36.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know that Jehovah can,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can stir the heart
and motivate anyone.

00:10:40.869 --> 00:10:43.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do in the meantime?

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:45.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can remember to follow

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:50.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Romans 10:16 says.

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:52.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assignment is to be a messenger.

00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:54.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 16:

00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:59.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless, they did not
all obey the good news.

00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:03.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For Isaiah says: ‘Jehovah, who has put faith
in the thing heard from us?’

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:07.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So faith follows the thing heard.

00:11:07.229 --> 00:11:10.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, what is heard
is through the word about Christ.”

00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:13.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faith follows the thing heard.”

00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:16.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What motivated the Ninevites to change?

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:19.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was only after they heard
Jonah’s warning message.

00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:24.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is our hope and prayer
that many will put faith in God

00:11:24.204 --> 00:11:26.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the warning message that we give.

00:11:26.873 --> 00:11:29.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we be like Jonah.

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:33.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be compassionate but bold
in preaching the good news to all.

00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:34.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who knows?

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:37.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Faith may follow the things heard.’

00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:40.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it is possible.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:44.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithless people can acquire faith.

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:51.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next part of this symposium,

00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:54.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember—Faithless People
Can Acquire Faith!

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:57.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus’ Fleshly Brothers.”

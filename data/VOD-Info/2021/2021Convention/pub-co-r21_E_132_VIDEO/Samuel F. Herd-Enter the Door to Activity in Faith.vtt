Moving to serve where the need
for Kingdom preachers is greater

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be intimidating.

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before moving, we cannot know all the details

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:13.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what our life will be like.

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the Bible can give us
the wisdom to successfully meet

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any challenges we face after moving.

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must put faith in it.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith can motivate us

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seize opportunities to serve Jehovah.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate Hebrews 11:8-10.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abram’s willingness to leave

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was comfortable and familiar

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move to a new land
when he was in his 70’s

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a powerful demonstration of faith.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Hebrews 11:8-10:

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Abraham, when he was called,

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“obeyed by going out to a place

00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was to receive as an inheritance;

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he went out, although
not knowing where he was going.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith he lived as a foreigner in the land

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the promise as in a foreign land,

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“living in tents with Isaac and Jacob,

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the heirs with him of the very same promise.

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For he was awaiting
the city having real foundations,

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose designer and builder is God.”

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t even know where
he was being assigned, but he went.

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on his faith, he knew

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the real life was not back home.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not in his new assignment.

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looked for the fulfillment
of future promises.

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Abraham and Sarah face
any difficulties along the way?

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they did.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unexpected circumstances
were thrust upon them.

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did Jehovah see them through?

00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Genesis 20:3-7.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To protect his life, Abraham
called Sarah his sister.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the king of Gerar

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt he could take her as his wife.

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a difficult time
for Abraham and Sarah.

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah work things out?

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Genesis 20:3-7:

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Afterward, God came by night

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to Abimelech in a dream and said to him:

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:34.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here you are as good as dead
because of the woman

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘whom you have taken, since she is married

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and belongs to another man.’

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, Abimelech had not gone near her.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he said: ‘Jehovah,

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will you kill a nation
that is really innocent?

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Did he not say to me, “She is my sister,”

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and did she too not say,
“He is my brother”?

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I did this with an honest heart

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and innocent hands.’

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the true God said to him in the dream:

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I know that you did this
with an honest heart,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so I held you back from sinning against me.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:18.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That is why I did not allow
you to touch her.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now return the man’s wife,

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:24.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for he is a prophet,
and he will make supplication

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you and you will keep living.

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But if you are not returning her,

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘know that you will surely die,

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:36.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and all who are yours.’”

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will be with us too

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we act in faith to expand our ministry.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will get through the surprises

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the rewards
of reaching out in this way.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we cannot know all the challenges

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we may encounter,

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:02.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can take practical steps
to choose a location

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare to make adjustments.

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:10.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Jesus’ words at Luke 14:28?

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:15.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He indicated that a person
who wanted “to build a tower”

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would first “calculate the expense

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:20.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if he has enough to complete it.”

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was practical.

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:27.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do the same
when contemplating relocating

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the need is greater.

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can get a taste of the blessings
we will experience

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by participating in preaching campaigns

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
organized by the branch office or working

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seldom-worked territory.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:44.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might you have the circumstances

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move where the need is greater?

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re interested
in serving in another land,

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do careful research and speak
to your congregation elders.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can forward your letter
to the branch office

00:04:57.317 --> 00:05:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the country that interests you.

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:03.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re unable to move to another land,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is another option?

00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:09.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can, through your elders,

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:12.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
write to the local branch office 
for information

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:16.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about congregations that have a need.

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:19.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your circuit overseer can provide information

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:23.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about nearby congregations
that may need help.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how one brother

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:31.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcame his fear of serving
where the need is greater.

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had told me two years ago that I’d 

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:37.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be moving to where the need was greater,

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would have laughed.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started when they announced
a special preaching campaign.

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Samuel
encouraged me to apply with him.

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:56.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, 

00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:59.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, but you enjoy that.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re going to love it.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I got you a form as well,
all right?

00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:03.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do this!

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:05.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:12.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do more,
but I was comfortable.

00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:14.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:18.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:06:18.815 --> 00:06:21.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to examine my heart.

00:06:25.113 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I read about Abraham’s faith
at Hebrews 11:8,

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:32.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like the words jumped off the page.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:35.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He went out although

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not knowing where he was going.”

00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:43.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who better to be in control
of my life than Jehovah?

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A door was opened to me.

00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just needed to go through it.

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:51.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do it, man.

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the campaign were incredible!

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the experience pushed me
out of my comfort zone.

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:16.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Gabriel is going to try some food.

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:18.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try, try, try!

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on, go on, give it a try, Gabriel!

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:25.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good, yeah—really good!

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:37.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the ministry in a new way,
and I wanted to do more.

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:48.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I calculated the cost

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked

00:07:50.782 --> 00:07:52.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my local elders
to write to the branch office.

00:08:07.591 --> 00:08:09.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:13.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed about it
and did research before choosing.

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:16.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many unknowns,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t wait!

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:21.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends,

00:08:25.108 --> 00:08:29.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was ready for whatever
Jehovah had in store for me.

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:42.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how faith was shown

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:45.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what blessings resulted?

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:47.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young brother admitted he was

00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a comfort zone.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:55.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another brother invited him to join
in a special preaching campaign.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother was hesitant to reach out.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he read about Abraham.

00:09:01.978 --> 00:09:04.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he conclude?

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:09.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

about the good things

consider if you can move

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:13.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the need is greater.

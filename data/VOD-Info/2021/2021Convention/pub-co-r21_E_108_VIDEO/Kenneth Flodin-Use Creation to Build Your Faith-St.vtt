In each of the parts of this symposium,

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the speaker will help us to see

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only the wonder of creation

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also the thunder of creation.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will hear Jehovah’s words
like thunder—loud and clear.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Nehemiah 9:6 with me,

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the faith-strengthening effect

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that creation has on the angels above.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah 9:6:

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:37.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You alone are Jehovah;

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you made the heavens,
yes, the heaven of the heavens

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all their army,
the earth and all that is on it,

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the seas and all that is in them.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you preserve all of them alive,

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the army of the heavens
are bowing down to you.”

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that verse
extols Jehovah as the Creator.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice the expression

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the heaven of the heavens”?

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that refers to the complete extent
of the physical heavens

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the atmospheric heavens,
the heavens of outer space.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the top
of the heavens’ outer space, that rim,

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is the heaven of the heavens
—the highest heavens.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we look at the heavens,
what do we see?

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we feel?

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:36.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in that verse,
did you notice it mentions (first time)

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the heavens and all their army”?

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s referring
to the physical army of the heavens

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the stars, the planets, the galaxies.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice in the last sentence

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:51.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is another “army of the heavens”?

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that refers to the holy angels of God.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just contemplating the physical creation,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angels are moved
to bow down or worship Jehovah.

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:12.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contemplating the creation
can have a similar effect on us.

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, each talk of this symposium will discuss

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:20.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how meditating on an aspect of creation

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will build our faith in Jehovah’s promises.

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a video about the stars,

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we will have
a faith-strengthening application

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our resurrection hope.

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:45.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sun is considered an average star.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, the energy from the sun

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reaches the earth is thousands of times

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:00.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world’s total energy use.

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our unaided eyes,

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might see about 3,000 stars

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a dark night

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:23.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many in a fuzzy band.

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Milky Way galaxy

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is where our sun
is just one of perhaps

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
200 to 400 billion stars.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Astronomers think the Milky Way galaxy

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:49.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is clustered together
with around 100,000 large galaxies

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a massive structure called a supercluster

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:59.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that together with an estimated
two trillion galaxies

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make up the known physical universe.

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Countless stars

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread over unfathomable distances,

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
releasing immense amounts of energy

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be impossible to grasp for us

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not for Jehovah.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He counts the number of the stars;

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:27.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he calls all of them by name.

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:32.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Lord is great and is mighty in power.”

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:43.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a two-minute video about the stars,

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see the awesome wonder,

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:49.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do we hear the thunder?

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:54.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we hear the clear, undeniable application

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:56.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah, our Creator?

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I invite you
to turn with me to Isaiah 40:26, please.

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:06.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we come to appreciate about Jehovah

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:09.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by pondering the magnitude

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the magnificence of the stars?

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:17.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at Isaiah 40:26,
Jehovah says to look at the stars.

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“Lift up your eyes to heaven and see.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:27.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who has created these things [the wonder]?

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the One who brings
out their army by number;

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he calls them all by name.

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:38.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of his vast dynamic energy
and his awe-inspiring power,

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:41.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of them is missing.”

00:05:42.237 --> 00:05:44.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the video we saw,

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:46.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it estimated that there are

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two trillion galaxies in outer space,

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each with billions of stars.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do the math.

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:59.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many names of inanimate objects

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does Jehovah have in his memory?

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:06.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many can he possibly contain?

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice
that at the end of that verse,

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that “not one of them are missing”?

00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:21.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is said that there are
a billion, trillion stars.

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:23.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I have to ask you,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would Jehovah remember your name?

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:28.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your loved one’s name?”

00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not one of them is missing.”

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:33.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not one star goes missing to Jehovah.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how about our dead loved ones?

00:06:38.377 --> 00:06:40.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they go missing?

00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:44.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My favorite verses
when a faithful servant of Jehovah dies

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Romans 14:7-9.

00:06:48.637 --> 00:06:51.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 8, it says:

00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:53.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we live

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or] if we die,

00:06:55.602 --> 00:06:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we belong to Jehovah.”

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:02.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The status with Jehovah
does not change at death.

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:06.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That person did not go missing.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about those of us
who have loved ones

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:12.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who at the time of their death,

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had not come to learn
about or put faith in Jehovah?

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:18.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about that?

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:23.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about this:
If Jehovah had the ability, the power,

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create those huge stars and galaxies,

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:30.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can recreate all

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:33.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all—those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:35.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find John 5:28, 29.

00:07:35.976 --> 00:07:38.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s verify that so that all of us,

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:40.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether the dead loved one

00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:44.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was previously a faithful Witness or not,

00:07:44.109 --> 00:07:48.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us, can entertain
the hope of the resurrection.

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:50.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:28, 29:

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:55.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:58.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the hour is coming in which all

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[all] those in the memorial tombs
will hear his voice and come out,

00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:08.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those who did good things
to a resurrection of life,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those who practiced
[you see, even] vile things

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:19.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they’ll be restored to life
and they’ll have the opportunity

00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:23.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to love the One who gifted them

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the miracle of a resurrection.

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:30.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in our video,
right at the end (on screen),

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:34.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a quotation of Psalm 147:4, 5.

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:38.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 4, it says
that ‘Jehovah counts all the stars’

00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:41.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the billions, trillions, or more of them.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that he named each one
—the billions or trillions of them.

00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:49.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is amazing indeed.

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:52.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’d like to learn
another lesson from the book of Job.

00:08:52.844 --> 00:08:56.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Job 14, please,
we’re going to read verses 13 and 15.

00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a star burns out,

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:04.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it does not go missing to Jehovah.

00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:07.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt he remembers its name,

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:10.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he is not motivated to resurrect

00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:13.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that star back to light

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:18.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it can again
twinkle in a dark night sky.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about humans?

00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:23.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were created in the image

00:09:23.917 --> 00:09:26.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 14:13,

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:31.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job says:

00:09:31.883 --> 00:09:35.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O that in the Grave you would conceal me,

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:40.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you would hide me
until your anger passes by,

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:44.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you would set a time limit
for me and remember me!”

00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:48.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 14, it’s obviously
talking about the resurrection.

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:52.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would Job, in effect,
just become a burned-out star?

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:54.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:57.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike a burned-out star,

00:09:57.576 --> 00:10:02.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah yearns—he longs—to call back
each human to life

00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:07.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can again see
that starlike twinkle in their eyes.

00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:09.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now verse 15:

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:15.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You [that’s Jehovah] will call,
 and I will answer you.”

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:18.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, from the grave, “I will answer you.”

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:21.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will long for the work of your hands.”

00:10:22.893 --> 00:10:27.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has the memory
to bring back people.

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:31.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has the power to bring back people,

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:35.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has the longing
to bring back people to life.

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:41.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends, observe the stars.

00:10:41.745 --> 00:10:46.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have faith that you will see
your resurrected loved ones.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, Brother Patrick LaFranca,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:56.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue this symposium with his talk,

00:10:56.092 --> 00:11:00.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith—Oceans.”

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you own a car or a motorbike

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other type of vehicle?

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, you realize that it brings with it

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a serious responsibility.

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, it costs quite a bit of money
to buy a vehicle,

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also you need to keep on spending money
to keep it running.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to that,
there is another serious responsibility

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes with owning a vehicle.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the responsibility
to maintain it safely

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it doesn’t break down,
doesn’t cause accidents

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,
doesn’t cause loss of life.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if you have a maintenance program,

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not just going to wait
for something to fall off the vehicle

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps for it just to stop.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, ahead of time,
you have to have a checklist

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see that everything is working properly.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in a similar way, spiritually speaking,

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each one of us needs a maintenance program

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our spirituality.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What sort of maintenance program
are we talking about?

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s take our Bibles, please,

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn to the second book of Corinthians

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 13 and verse 5,

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians 13:5;

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there it says:

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep testing whether you are in the faith;

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“keep proving what you yourselves are.

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:43.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or do you not recognize
that Jesus Christ is in union with you?

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unless you are disapproved.”

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice right in the beginning
of that verse, it says

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “keep testing” and “keep proving.”

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that really mean?

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:00.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at the study note
associated with verse 5,

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us this:

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One lexicon states that the word
Paul here uses for ‘testing’

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“means ‘to endeavor to discover

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:13.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the nature or character of someth[ing].’

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They could discover the nature
of their own spiritual standing

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by comparing their daily conduct,
attitudes, and decisions

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the sacred truths they were taught.

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Doing such testing would help them

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to keep proving
that they were true Christians.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:35.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For ‘proving,’ Paul uses a word

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that could refer to testing
whether something is genuine,

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one might test metals.”

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see the point
of what this verse tells us?

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Christians,
we need to ‘keep testing continually

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re in the faith.’

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what does this word “faith” mean
in this context?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just referring
to the quality of faith

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, it involves
all the Christian teachings

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we find in God’s Word, the Bible.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having that in mind,
“keep testing” and “keep proving” really mean

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to look at ourselves

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if we’re really living up

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what the Bible tells us to do.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a very serious
maintenance program.

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just as we do a maintenance program
for a vehicle

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we might have a checklist,

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:34.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there a checklist that we can use

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:38.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re testing and proving
that we’re in the faith?

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:39.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there is.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say there are three things.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:45.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, we need to ask

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:50.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heart-searching questions
about our relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the first point:

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask the questions
that will search through our heart.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:04:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we have to answer honestly.

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:04.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, whatever we see
as an answer to those questions,

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to have a correct answer.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, finally,
we need to seek Jehovah’s help

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making whatever adjustments
we need to make

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can maintain our spirituality

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strong and in good standing

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:25.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that our relationship
with Jehovah is good.

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:31.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that in mind, let’s go back
to the illustration we started with

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a vehicle, a car, or a motorbike.

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:37.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were to compare

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:42.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Christian faith or our beliefs
or our conduct

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:45.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a vehicle and the need to maintain it,

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sort of things would you make
as a comparison?

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps the first thing
we might think about is the engine.

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:57.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You certainly need to make sure
the engine works correctly

00:04:57.234 --> 00:05:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s what gives the vehicle
the power to keep moving.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:05.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good for us to ask the question,

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it that moves us or motivates us

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:13.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we serve Jehovah acceptably?

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer is found in the Scriptures.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we turn together
to the first book of Timothy

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 4 and verse 8

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:28.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s 1 Timothy 4:8—

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see if you can discern
what it is that we could liken

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:35.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the engine in a car.

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us:

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:42.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For physical training
is beneficial for a little,

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:47.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but godly devotion
is beneficial for all things,

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:50.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as it holds promise of the life now

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the life that is to come.”

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:58.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see what the scripture tells us
is so important?

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:01.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly devotion.

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we need to understand
what godly devotion is.

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:07.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we also need to appreciate

00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:11.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this beautiful expression
in the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:06:11.683 --> 00:06:15.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many other Bibles just simply translate this

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:19.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “godliness”—“godliness is beneficial.”

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps they say “godly training”

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:26.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “being religious,”

00:06:26.073 --> 00:06:29.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even one version says “mental training.”

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the <i>New World Translation</i>  captures

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:35.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the meaning of the original word here,

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you can train, or program, a robot

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:42.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do a certain job,

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:46.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you can’t program it
to have godly devotion.

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:47.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:52.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because godly devotion involves
how we feel about Jehovah.

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:54.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means our loyalty to him

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:59.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on a heart
full of love and appreciation.

00:06:59.773 --> 00:07:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it says godly devotion is important,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really involves <i>why</i>  we do things,

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:09.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just <i>what</i>  we do.

00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:15.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s think back
to our illustration of the vehicle.

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:18.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to test the engine.

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:22.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do to check the engine
to see if it’s OK?

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one thing you might do
is keep an eye on the temperature gauge,

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if the engine is overheating,
you know there’s a problem.

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:36.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps you might check the oil
to see if there’s enough oil.

00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:41.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may check to see
if you’ve changed the oil regularly enough.

00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when the engine is idling,

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:46.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might listen carefully to it

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:50.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if it’s running smoothly or roughly

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:55.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, you’d be interested
if there are any strange sounds or noises.

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:58.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the type of thing
you would have on a checklist

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:03.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re trying to see
if an engine is working properly.

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:07.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, none of that applies
to godly devotion, does it?

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what could be on our checklist

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to test godly devotion

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:17.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if it’s healthy and strong or not?

00:08:17.934 --> 00:08:20.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, the Bible helps us.

00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:24.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me
this time to the book of Psalms,

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:28.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look at Psalm 40:8

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s Psalm 40:8.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it tells us:
“To do your will, O my God,

00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:41.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is my delight,

00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:44.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your law is deep within me.”

00:08:45.295 --> 00:08:49.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a test of our godly devotion.

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:51.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:54.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we need to ask ourselves:

00:08:54.262 --> 00:08:59.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is my service to God
something that I really delight in,

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:01.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or is it simply a chore?

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:05.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is it something that I do as a mere routine

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:08.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—something that I just
keep on doing regularly

00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:13.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t really have
a strong desire to accomplish?’

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we were thinking

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:21.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our godly devotion
was not so good, not so strong,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps we were just doing things
out of routine

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than for our love for Jehovah,

00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:29.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to take action,

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:34.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the same as if we heard
that the engine had a knocking sound

00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:38.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we saw that it was overheating.

00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:41.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly
what Jesus told the brothers

00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back in the first century
in the congregation in Ephesus.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:49.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
to the book of Revelation,

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:52.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation chapter 2.

00:09:53.655 --> 00:09:57.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll remember that this section
of the book of Revelation

00:09:57.701 --> 00:10:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a series of messages
that Jesus gives to different congregations.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:07.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first congregation mentioned
is in Ephesus.

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:09.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at chapter 2 of Revelation

00:10:09.963 --> 00:10:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we glance through verses 2 and 3,

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:15.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you notice?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus says to the brothers:

00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:20.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know your deeds,
and your labor and endurance.”

00:10:20.849 --> 00:10:22.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds good, doesn’t it?

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:27.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he goes on to say
that they didn’t “tolerate bad men.”

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:31.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 3,
he mentions that they “persevered”

00:10:31.234 --> 00:10:34.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they “[had] not grown weary.”

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we assume from these two verses?

00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:40.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That our brothers back then
in the first century

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation in Ephesus

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:46.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were busy doing the work of Jehovah.

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:48.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were active.

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:50.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t giving up.

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then what does Jesus say in verse 4?

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:58.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless, I hold this against you,

00:10:58.386 --> 00:11:01.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have left the love
you had at first.”

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:05.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see the point?

00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:09.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, it shows us that Jehovah and Jesus

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:13.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not just interested in <i>what</i>  we do

00:11:13.818 --> 00:11:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also <i>why </i> we do it.

00:11:17.113 --> 00:11:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they want us to serve our God, Jehovah,

00:11:22.118 --> 00:11:25.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that shows that we love him
and that we’re loyal to him,

00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:28.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the same as Jesus loves his Father

00:11:28.708 --> 00:11:31.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is loyal to him.

00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:33.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is so important!

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul highlighted this.

00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:39.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to 1 Corinthians chapter 13,

00:11:41.179 --> 00:11:43.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians chapter 13,

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:47.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what Paul says under inspiration

00:11:47.727 --> 00:11:49.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 3:

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And if I give all my belongings
to feed others,

00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:59.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and if I hand over my body
so that I may boast,

00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:02.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but [I] do not have love,

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:05.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not benefit at all.”

00:12:07.205 --> 00:12:11.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we look across
at the study note on this verse,

00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:13.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice that it says:

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Speaking hypothetically,

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:18.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul says that if instead of love,

00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:21.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such pride were his motive,

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:25.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he would give everything he owned
to feed others

00:12:25.098 --> 00:12:29.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or would even die a martyr’s death
as a witness to the truth,

00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:33.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he would not benefit at all.”

00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:36.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that food for thought?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thinking about this expression,
“godly devotion,”

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:43.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s interesting that one Bible scholar

00:12:43.908 --> 00:12:46.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
defined the original word this way:

00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:51.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that it is
“a very practical awareness of God

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every aspect of life.”

00:12:54.544 --> 00:12:58.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we were to check our godly devotion

00:12:58.632 --> 00:13:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see
that perhaps it’s not really working

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as it should,

00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe it needs maintenance.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What sort of maintenance would we give it?

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:14.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, surely we would need
to think of Jehovah

00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:16.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more often every day

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see him as part of our life.

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:23.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, meditating on what Jehovah
has done for us

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:27.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
builds up appreciation and love for him,

00:13:27.327 --> 00:13:29.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that motivates us

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:33.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what Jehovah wants us to do
out of love,

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, a heart full of appreciation.

00:13:37.253 --> 00:13:41.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, offering prayers regularly
to Jehovah

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:43.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps to strengthen that relationship.

00:13:45.345 --> 00:13:48.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we learned so far
in our discussion?

00:13:48.848 --> 00:13:53.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just like the engine of a vehicle
needs to be maintained,

00:13:53.353 --> 00:13:57.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to be aware
of whether or not it’s operating correctly.

00:13:57.357 --> 00:14:00.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way, we need to ask ourselves

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:02.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honest questions

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—questions that search our hearts

00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our godly devotion:

00:14:09.035 --> 00:14:11.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is our service to Jehovah

00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:15.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘based simply on routine and a sense of duty?

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:17.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do we view it just as a chore,

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:21.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or does our heart show

00:14:21.297 --> 00:14:25.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s filled with appreciation and love
for Jehovah?’

00:14:25.343 --> 00:14:28.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we build up that appreciation
—that love—

00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:32.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be sure
that our godly devotion is good.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s well maintained.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first point of comparison
that we’d like to make

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:42.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the maintenance schedule for a vehicle

00:14:42.694 --> 00:14:45.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for our spirituality.

00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:48.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s think of another comparison.

00:14:48.074 --> 00:14:51.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another very important part of any vehicle

00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:53.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the brakes.

00:14:53.788 --> 00:14:55.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we think of the brakes,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re absolutely necessary
—aren’t they?—

00:14:57.792 --> 00:15:01.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because someone could jump
in front of your vehicle.

00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:06.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There could be someone
who perhaps is coming too quickly,

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have to avoid them,

00:15:08.428 --> 00:15:10.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you need to use those brakes.

00:15:11.848 --> 00:15:15.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think
we could compare the brakes to

00:15:15.101 --> 00:15:18.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our service to Jehovah

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:20.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our relationship with him?

00:15:20.607 --> 00:15:22.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible gives us a clue.

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:26.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read Psalm 111,

00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:28.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see the answer to that question.

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:32.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we turn there to Psalm 111,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see what verse 10 tells us:

00:15:37.874 --> 00:15:42.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah
is the beginning of wisdom.

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those observing his orders
show good insight.

00:15:47.717 --> 00:15:50.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His praise endures forever.”

00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:54.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do you see what could be likened

00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:57.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the brakes of a vehicle?

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it that stops us

00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:03.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from doing something
that displeases Jehovah?

00:16:03.316 --> 00:16:06.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our fear of Jehovah.

00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:11.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just as you need to maintain
the brakes in a vehicle,

00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:14.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also need to make sure
that our love for Jehovah

00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our fear of Jehovah

00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:19.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is strong and well maintained.

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:23.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, we need to think:
‘What do we mean by fear of Jehovah?

00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do we mean shaking all the time,

00:16:25.296 --> 00:16:28.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worried that he’s going to do
something wrong to us?’

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:29.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:32.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we could liken it to a chef

00:16:32.387 --> 00:16:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has a razor-sharp knife.

00:16:35.306 --> 00:16:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this knife, when used properly,

00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help him to attain
all sorts of wonderful things.

00:16:41.938 --> 00:16:46.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if he misuses it, then he has a problem.

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:50.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in a similar way, if our relationship
is strong with Jehovah,

00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:53.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no need for us
to be shaking in our boots, as it were.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, we need to remember always
that Jehovah is with us.

00:16:58.246 --> 00:17:01.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so a healthy fear of Jehovah

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means that we don’t want
to displease him in any way.

00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:10.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a fear of Jehovah helps us
so that as we’re moving along,

00:17:10.884 --> 00:17:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if anything comes our way,

00:17:13.344 --> 00:17:15.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re ready to stop

00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:19.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we shouldn’t engage in that activity.

00:17:19.142 --> 00:17:24.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s think for a few moments
about the maintenance check for the brakes.

00:17:24.856 --> 00:17:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you check
if the brakes are OK or not?

00:17:29.402 --> 00:17:31.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, mechanics tell us

00:17:31.404 --> 00:17:33.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if you’re applying pressure
to the brakes

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you find the steering wheel
is starting to shake,

00:17:37.452 --> 00:17:40.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s a sign that maybe they need attention.

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if you apply pressure to the brakes

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:47.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the vehicle starts to veer off
to one side,

00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:51.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, it’s not a good sign.

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or as you press the brake pedal,

00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:58.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you find there’s very little resistance
and you have to start pumping it,

00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:01.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, that’s a problem.

00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, like with the engine,

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:07.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you start to hear
strange, grinding noises,

00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:10.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is never a good sign, is it?

00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about our fear of Jehovah?

00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:18.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we test whether or not

00:18:18.117 --> 00:18:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fear of Jehovah is at the right level?

00:18:22.497 --> 00:18:24.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know that Satan and his world

00:18:24.874 --> 00:18:27.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constantly throw things at us:

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:31.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
temptations, wrong thinking, and so on.

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:33.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just like when you’re driving
in a vehicle

00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:38.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and someone jumps out in front of you
or an animal runs across the road

00:18:38.096 --> 00:18:41.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s when we need those brakes.

00:18:41.182 --> 00:18:44.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do we apply them?

00:18:44.435 --> 00:18:47.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does our godly fear help us?

00:18:47.689 --> 00:18:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s turn to the book of 2 Corinthians

00:18:51.275 --> 00:18:53.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see a very interesting point

00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:57.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is mentioned to the brothers
back there in Corinth.

00:18:57.156 --> 00:19:00.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So 2 Corinthians chapter 10

00:19:00.368 --> 00:19:02.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to look at verse 5.

00:19:03.913 --> 00:19:06.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the context of this chapter

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:10.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is where Paul is talking
about wrong teachings.

00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:13.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the principle as outlined in this verse

00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:16.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be applied also to our reaction

00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:19.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wrong thoughts and immoral thoughts

00:19:19.554 --> 00:19:24.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or all sorts of things
that are not in harmony with Jehovah’s will.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:27.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s see if we can see
what the principle is,

00:19:27.437 --> 00:19:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians 10:5:

00:19:32.692 --> 00:19:35.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we are overturning reasonings

00:19:35.278 --> 00:19:39.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God,

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we are bringing every thought
into captivity

00:19:44.454 --> 00:19:47.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it obedient to the Christ.”

00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:50.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do we see the point?

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:53.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what sort of thought it is

00:19:53.671 --> 00:19:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if it’s an immoral thought,

00:19:55.923 --> 00:19:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a temptation to do something wrong,

00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:03.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that’s not neutral
with regard to the political situation—

00:20:03.014 --> 00:20:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what does it say here?

00:20:04.515 --> 00:20:06.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to react quickly.

00:20:06.517 --> 00:20:10.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just as if we put on the brakes.

00:20:10.063 --> 00:20:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have to overturn
all these sort of things

00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:16.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be going on in our mind.

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously, it’s important for us

00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to test our godly fear
in the sense of thinking:

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I normally react

00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if I’m faced with a situation
that perhaps tempts me?

00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I quick to react?

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:34.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do the brakes work properly,

00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:37.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is my godly fear compromised?’

00:20:37.757 --> 00:20:40.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an interesting question.

00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:45.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, another illustration:
Just imagine that in your car

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you find a whole lot of poisonous spiders.

00:20:48.976 --> 00:20:51.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not good, is it?

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, you’d get someone
to help you get rid of those spiders.

00:20:55.191 --> 00:20:58.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after you’ve paid that person
to do the job,

00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:00.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would you feel if they said:
“Well, we got most of them.

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:03.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There could be one or two left”?

00:21:03.074 --> 00:21:05.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think you’d be very happy
—would you?—

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you want
all of those poisonous spiders

00:21:08.204 --> 00:21:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the car.

00:21:10.206 --> 00:21:13.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it tell us here in verse 5?

00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:16.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that we have to get

00:21:16.295 --> 00:21:20.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the things that are out of harmony
with Jehovah

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under control.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:25.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we could find that even though

00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:28.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of the things are under control,

00:21:28.057 --> 00:21:30.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there could be just a few areas

00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we haven’t gotten them under control.

00:21:33.729 --> 00:21:35.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could even be that it’s

00:21:35.773 --> 00:21:38.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if we’re going in the wrong direction.

00:21:38.943 --> 00:21:41.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do you need to do if you find out

00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:44.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re driving on the highway
in the wrong direction?

00:21:44.991 --> 00:21:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, turn around,
and go the opposite direction.

00:21:49.078 --> 00:21:51.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So isn’t that exactly what we should do

00:21:51.914 --> 00:21:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to this matter
of checking our godly fear?

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:59.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we see that in any way

00:21:59.213 --> 00:22:02.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re a little slow in reacting

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:06.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when immoral temptations come our way
or other wrong thinking,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to strengthen
our fear of Jehovah.

00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our fear of Jehovah
helps us to resist these things.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s something that can help
to strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, the Bible
gives us an indication.

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, we find it
in the book of Proverbs,

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:31.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 8:13.

00:22:31.245 --> 00:22:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll notice that this is
a little definition, or formula, for us.

00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:40.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 8:13:

00:22:41.881 --> 00:22:44.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah

00:22:44.383 --> 00:22:47.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means the hating of bad.”

00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:52.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is it that can help us
strengthen our fear of Jehovah?

00:22:52.892 --> 00:22:56.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to hate what is bad.

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:59.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for a moment,
let me ask you this question:

00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:03.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there some type of food
that you really hate?

00:23:03.653 --> 00:23:08.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I can think of a couple of things
that I just really can’t eat,

00:23:08.366 --> 00:23:10.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I hate them.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:14.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone tries to tempt you
to eat that food,

00:23:14.872 --> 00:23:16.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you going to give in easily?

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:20.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not, because you hate
that type of food.

00:23:20.878 --> 00:23:23.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how much more important it is for us

00:23:23.714 --> 00:23:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop within ourselves a hatred

00:23:26.842 --> 00:23:28.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what is bad.

00:23:28.844 --> 00:23:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have to make sure

00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:34.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we see things that Jehovah hates,

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:37.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we feel the same way
—that we don’t accept them.

00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:40.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never would we allow gradualism

00:23:40.856 --> 00:23:42.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to change our feelings

00:23:42.942 --> 00:23:46.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to what Jehovah says is wrong.

00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:52.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we read on,
looking back at Proverbs 8:13,

00:23:52.451 --> 00:23:56.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice it says: “The fear of Jehovah
means the hating of bad.”

00:23:56.455 --> 00:24:01.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it says:
“I hate self-exaltation and pride

00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:06.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the evil way and perverse speech.”

00:24:06.674 --> 00:24:11.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to make sure
that we take out of our hearts

00:24:11.429 --> 00:24:13.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any sort of pride

00:24:13.848 --> 00:24:18.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could interfere
with our relationship with Jehovah.

00:24:18.102 --> 00:24:23.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very important,
and that’s part of hating what Jehovah hates.

00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:26.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think for a moment:
As we’re doing this checklist

00:24:26.694 --> 00:24:31.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how our fear of Jehovah is
—is it strong or weak?—

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to think:

00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What things do I really feel proud about?’

00:24:37.747 --> 00:24:40.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there something deep inside you
that you feel,

00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:45.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Mmm, yes, I feel really proud about this’?

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:50.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, never forget David’s son Absalom.

00:24:50.384 --> 00:24:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was proud about his hair.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the end, it was his hair
that caused him the problem,

00:24:56.474 --> 00:25:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he ended up dying because of his hair
being caught in the branches.

00:25:01.437 --> 00:25:04.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never would we want to be like Absalom

00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:07.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow the thing that we are proud of

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to actually cause us a serious problem.

00:25:11.864 --> 00:25:14.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s been interesting
—hasn’t it?—

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:16.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking at a second comparison

00:25:16.494 --> 00:25:19.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the maintenance of a car

00:25:19.246 --> 00:25:23.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the maintenance of our godly fear.

00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:25.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like the brakes,

00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:28.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
godly fear can help us to stop

00:25:28.506 --> 00:25:32.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we do something
that would displease Jehovah.

00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:35.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, when we’re thinking
of this matter

00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:39.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of comparing the maintenance of a vehicle

00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:41.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the maintenance of our spirituality,

00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:46.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are so many different comparisons
that we could make.

00:25:46.148 --> 00:25:49.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your mind is
probably already going there thinking,

00:25:49.068 --> 00:25:52.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, will we make this comparison
or that one?’

00:25:52.405 --> 00:25:55.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we only have time
for one more comparison.

00:25:55.449 --> 00:25:59.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you probably won’t think of the one
that we’re going to talk about

00:25:59.161 --> 00:26:02.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, the horn.

00:26:02.456 --> 00:26:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in some parts of the world,
drivers say

00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:08.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the horn is just as important
as the brakes.

00:26:08.921 --> 00:26:10.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:26:10.172 --> 00:26:14.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they need to let people know
they’re driving along the road.

00:26:14.218 --> 00:26:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be that someone is beside them

00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:19.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re about to change lanes
and crash into them.

00:26:19.557 --> 00:26:21.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the horn can help.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or it could be that someone is distracted
and they’re crossing the road.

00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:28.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the horn will help.

00:26:28.065 --> 00:26:31.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a horn used correctly

00:26:31.026 --> 00:26:33.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can save lives.

00:26:33.362 --> 00:26:36.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think
we’re going to compare the horn to

00:26:36.407 --> 00:26:40.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our spiritual activities?

00:26:40.035 --> 00:26:43.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we read 1 Timothy together,

00:26:43.581 --> 00:26:48.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Timothy 4:16,

00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:51.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see what the comparison is.

00:26:51.714 --> 00:26:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 4:16:

00:26:57.261 --> 00:27:01.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay constant attention to yourself
and to your teaching.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Persevere in these things, for by doing this

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:09.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will save both yourself
and those who listen to you.”

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:12.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we could say

00:27:12.735 --> 00:27:17.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just as a horn is important
with regard to a vehicle,

00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:22.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likewise our sounding out the message
of the good news

00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:27.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our teaching others and telling them
about the nearness of Jehovah’s day—

00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:30.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can result in lives being saved.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, if you were to check a horn,

00:27:34.507 --> 00:27:39.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you be looking for
or perhaps more importantly listening to?

00:27:39.178 --> 00:27:43.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for a start, you’d try
to test the horn and honk it.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if no sound comes out,
you know you have a problem.

00:27:46.977 --> 00:27:50.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, on the other hand,
if the sound is too soft

00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nobody can hear it,

00:27:52.608 --> 00:27:54.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that likewise is a problem.

00:27:55.694 --> 00:27:57.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what about us?

00:27:57.988 --> 00:28:00.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we need to think

00:28:00.074 --> 00:28:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our proclamation
of “the good news” is?

00:28:02.952 --> 00:28:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:28:04.453 --> 00:28:09.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take not just the normal activities
we’re involved with with our preaching work,

00:28:09.583 --> 00:28:11.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what about informal witnessing?

00:28:11.877 --> 00:28:13.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the opportunity?

00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:17.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think,
‘Yes, I need to talk to this person,’

00:28:17.132 --> 00:28:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and

00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:21.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing happens.

00:28:21.136 --> 00:28:25.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The horn is not working in a symbolic sense.

00:28:25.057 --> 00:28:28.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps we do have the opportunity
and we take it,

00:28:28.894 --> 00:28:32.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the message is not clear.

00:28:32.189 --> 00:28:35.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So persons don’t really understand
what we’re saying.

00:28:36.652 --> 00:28:39.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if either of those were the case,

00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:43.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d need to see that maintenance is required

00:28:43.158 --> 00:28:46.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to this symbolic horn.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would we do?

00:28:48.122 --> 00:28:50.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it could involve praying to Jehovah

00:28:50.874 --> 00:28:53.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for courage
—yes, boldness—

00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:55.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to witness to others,

00:28:55.337 --> 00:28:58.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s informally,
telephone witnessing,

00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:01.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other forms of witnessing.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then if we’re not so clear, or coherent,

00:29:04.722 --> 00:29:07.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to how we present the message,

00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:11.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how important it is for us
to practice ahead of time,

00:29:11.395 --> 00:29:15.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have special sessions
where we practice what we’ll say!

00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:19.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in this way, we can be ready
to give a clear message

00:29:19.236 --> 00:29:21.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who listen.

00:29:22.197 --> 00:29:25.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s been
a very interesting exercise, hasn’t it?

00:29:25.534 --> 00:29:27.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we see?

00:29:27.286 --> 00:29:31.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re using this comparison,
this illustration, of a vehicle,

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:33.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could say that the engine of a vehicle

00:29:33.959 --> 00:29:37.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like our godly devotion.

00:29:37.171 --> 00:29:41.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our devotion to Jehovah
needs to come from our hearts.

00:29:41.008 --> 00:29:43.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brakes of a vehicle

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could liken to our fear of Jehovah.

00:29:45.971 --> 00:29:49.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we hate what is bad
the same as Jehovah does,

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:52.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will stop us, just like brakes do.

00:29:52.728 --> 00:29:57.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then finally, we discussed this matter
of having a horn

00:29:57.316 --> 00:29:59.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sounds the message properly.

00:29:59.318 --> 00:30:02.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to make sure
that we ask for Jehovah’s help

00:30:02.696 --> 00:30:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain our witnessing in such a way

00:30:06.116 --> 00:30:10.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can clearly help others
to hear the message.

00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:13.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we’ve gone through this,
I’m sure (as we’ve already mentioned)

00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:16.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can think of many other comparisons.

00:30:16.835 --> 00:30:19.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is

00:30:19.004 --> 00:30:21.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a wise driver

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:25.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not just drive his car

00:30:25.177 --> 00:30:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or motorbike or whatever vehicle it is.

00:30:29.098 --> 00:30:33.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wise driver also checks to make sure

00:30:33.268 --> 00:30:36.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the vehicle is safe to use.

00:30:36.313 --> 00:30:38.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So likewise for us,

00:30:38.524 --> 00:30:41.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as 2 Corinthians 13:5 says,

00:30:41.777 --> 00:30:44.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to “keep testing.”

00:30:44.613 --> 00:30:48.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to “keep proving”
that we are in the faith.

00:30:48.367 --> 00:30:52.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, keep checking
that we really are Christians,

00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:55.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are really living up
to what we believe

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we teach others to do.

00:30:58.711 --> 00:31:03.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, what is it
that can be a problem for us?

00:31:03.173 --> 00:31:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, if we turn
to the book of Corinthians,

00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:08.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time 1 Corinthians

00:31:08.554 --> 00:31:11.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 10 and verse 12,

00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:14.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see what the problem can be.

00:31:15.394 --> 00:31:19.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 1 Corinthians 10:12:

00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the one who thinks he is standing

00:31:24.194 --> 00:31:26.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

00:31:27.573 --> 00:31:32.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, just thinking everything is OK
(there are no problems)

00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:35.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thinking that we’re just going on fine

00:31:35.414 --> 00:31:40.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without testing ourselves
and proving that we’re in the truth

00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:42.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that can be a problem,

00:31:42.087 --> 00:31:45.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like lack of maintenance to a vehicle

00:31:45.132 --> 00:31:49.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can result in not only damage
with regard to the vehicle

00:31:49.219 --> 00:31:51.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also loss of life.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important then it is
that we continue to keep testing

00:31:56.643 --> 00:32:00.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether or not we are in the faith,
or in the truth!

00:32:01.398 --> 00:32:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we do these tests regularly

00:32:04.526 --> 00:32:07.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we check to see:
How is our godly devotion going?

00:32:07.696 --> 00:32:11.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is our fear of Jehovah?
our hatred for what is bad?

00:32:11.658 --> 00:32:14.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is our sounding out of the message going?

00:32:14.578 --> 00:32:18.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we see some weaknesses,

00:32:18.165 --> 00:32:20.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we need to do?

00:32:20.292 --> 00:32:24.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our final scripture
takes us back to our theme scripture.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, that was 2 Corinthians 13:5,

00:32:29.968 --> 00:32:33.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:
“Keep testing . . . keep proving

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you yourselves are.”

00:32:37.976 --> 00:32:42.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then if we look down a little further
to verse 11,

00:32:42.898 --> 00:32:46.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll notice what it tells us
that we need to do

00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:49.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we see some problems.

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:51.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 11, it tells us:

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:56.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, brothers, continue to rejoice,

00:32:56.578 --> 00:32:58.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be readjusted.”

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does it mean “to be readjusted”?

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at verse 9,

00:33:05.712 --> 00:33:08.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see the same expression is used there

00:33:08.173 --> 00:33:10.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of verse 9.

00:33:10.175 --> 00:33:13.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the study note to that verse
tells us this:

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says the word is “used to describe

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:20.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the restoring of something
to a proper condition.

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:23.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For instance, at Mt 4:21,

00:33:23.313 --> 00:33:26.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the [word] . . . is used to describe
‘mending’ nets.”

00:33:26.775 --> 00:33:29.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So nets that are damaged
or have holes in them

00:33:29.862 --> 00:33:33.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mending them is just like readjusting them.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Galatians 6:1, the same verb is used

00:33:36.702 --> 00:33:38.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the need to spiritually readjust

00:33:38.996 --> 00:33:42.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fellow believer who has taken a false step.

00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:46.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The term is sometimes used in medical text

00:33:46.253 --> 00:33:50.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to describe the setting of a bone,
a limb, or a joint.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do this checklist
—go through it—

00:33:56.555 --> 00:33:58.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see that somehow

00:33:58.682 --> 00:34:02.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our godly devotion is not as strong
as it should be

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:04.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are just doing things out of routine

00:34:04.771 --> 00:34:07.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our love for Jehovah is no longer strong,

00:34:07.733 --> 00:34:09.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we find that our fear of Jehovah

00:34:09.943 --> 00:34:13.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not stopping us from doing what is wrong,

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we are finding that we just are not

00:34:16.241 --> 00:34:19.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thoroughly bearing witness to the good news,

00:34:19.494 --> 00:34:21.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to take action.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it involve?

00:34:23.582 --> 00:34:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as it says here,

00:34:25.334 --> 00:34:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first of all, identifying what the problem is

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:31.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then readjusting, repairing,

00:34:31.632 --> 00:34:35.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (in some places) replacing activities.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers and sisters,
let’s always remember

00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:41.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter how long
we’ve been in the truth,

00:34:41.808 --> 00:34:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what privileges we have,

00:34:44.394 --> 00:34:47.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to keep looking at that checklist.

00:34:47.522 --> 00:34:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to “keep testing” and “proving”

00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:53.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we <i>are</i>  in the faith.

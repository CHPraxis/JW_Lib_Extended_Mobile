Proverbs 10:22 states:

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
that makes one rich,

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He adds no pain with it.”

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blesses those he loves
with gifts of divine approval,

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
guidance, and spiritual prosperity.

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we enter
‘a door of Kingdom activity’ in faith,

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are putting ourselves in line
for a rich blessing from Jehovah.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of those doors
is the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what just came to your mind
when you heard that?

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think: ‘Well, that’s a great school

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you have special circumstances
to apply for it,’

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘I’m too old for that,’
or ‘I’m too young for that,’

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘I’m already serving
where the need is great; I’m needed here,’

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘They could send me anywhere
after the school,

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m not really comfortable with that’?

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:56.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are honest feelings—and understandable.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we want to be careful that feelings
don’t turn into stumbling stones

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would prevent us
from receiving a blessing from Jehovah.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s use Timothy as an example

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who entered
‘a door of Kingdom activity’

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received Jehovah’s rich blessing.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy received a personal invitation

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the apostle Paul to expand his ministry.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first glance,
the two men probably looked nothing alike.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So imagine that scene.

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was older, a man of experience.

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:34.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was young,
probably in his late teens or early 20’s.

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was bold in his speech,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tireless in his ministry,
and resilient to opposition.

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, on the other hand,

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Scriptures indicate
that young Timothy was perhaps shy,

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:50.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hesitant, and lacked self-confidence.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What stumbling stones

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have existed
in Timothy’s mind

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he pondered Paul’s invitation?

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles
to 2 Timothy chapter 3

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read verses 10 and 11,
and we’ll find out—

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Timothy chapter 3,

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 10 and 11.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice that Paul wrote this to Timothy
many years later,

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let’s see what we can learn

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 10:

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you have closely followed my teaching,

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my course of life,

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my purpose, my faith,
my patience, my love, my endurance,

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the persecutions and sufferings

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such as I experienced
in [now notice] Antioch,

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:42.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Iconium, [and] in Lystra.”

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, where was Timothy from?

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lystra.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young man likely witnessed
how Paul suffered ruthless beatings in Lystra

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the hands of opposers.

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you feel Timothy’s possible hesitation

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he now looks at Paul
extending his hand out to him,

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:04.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even eyeing the scars of Paul,

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:06.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Paul says, “Come with me”?

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy had to wonder:
‘If I go with you, it’s not going to be easy.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will I suffer as you suffered?’

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:20.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another possible stumbling stone for Timothy

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the fact that he was already serving

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:26.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a capable way
in the newly formed congregation in Lystra

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “was well-reported-on by the brothers.”

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Paul was asking him to leave it all,

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including his family and friends.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy could have reasoned:

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They need me; my mother needs me;
my grandmother needs me here.

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:45.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I can join Paul in a few years
when I gain more experience.’

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps yet another stumbling stone
for Timothy could have been the fact

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he did not know
where his assignment would take him.

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lystra was a small,
rustic town secluded in a valley.

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew the people, the landscape,
the food, the language, the culture.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy knew that accompanying Paul
meant venturing into the unknown.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to wonder:
‘Am I really ready for this?

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:15.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I have a weak stomach,
and it’s already feeling weaker

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just thinking about going with Paul.’

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see yourself in Timothy?

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He no doubt had some real concerns
before accepting Paul’s offer.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did Timothy’s faith
allow him to see?

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read again
Paul’s words at 2 Timothy,

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:40.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time verse 11, but verse 11b

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Timothy 3:11b:

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I endured these persecutions.”

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:54.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now note this:
“And the Lord rescued me from them all.”

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:58.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy witnessed firsthand

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah rescued and strengthened Paul.

00:05:01.822 --> 00:05:06.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, in faith Timothy
did enter the door of activity,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had worked together
with Paul for many years.

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think of the blessings he received
because of his decision to join Paul.

00:05:15.544 --> 00:05:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed how Paul navigated
through each trial

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Paul kept his inner peace.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:27.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy saw not just the inconveniences
or the sufferings of Paul,

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he had observed Paul’s stabilizing joy.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he witnessed how Jehovah
helped him each step of the way.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:05:37.733 --> 00:05:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy stretched
beyond his somewhat shy, hesitant nature

00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:43.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach his full potential

00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:47.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a zealous overseer
in support of the truth.

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the following video,
note what reasoning helped Gabriel

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decide to apply
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:10.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At our convention, they had the meeting
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:14.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:15.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Gabriel.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hi, Anton.

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you coming?

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, to what?

00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:19.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The SKE meeting.

00:06:19.858 --> 00:06:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, no.

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:22.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t planning on it,

00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:25.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all right, yeah, sure.

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:26.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go.

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:28.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, then, and afterward, I can . . .

00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:33.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went, but I felt conflicted.

00:06:33.872 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:39.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I already have an assignment,
one that I love.’

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:44.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t fully understand
the incredible privilege of attending SKE.

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:49.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked the circuit overseer
a few more questions.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:52.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt like, this is it!

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:57.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed right,
and all I had to do was apply online.

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was months ago.

00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s holding you back?

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:06.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like Jehovah led me here,

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:08.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve never been happier.

00:07:10.242 --> 00:07:14.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now another door has opened,
and the fear is back.

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:17.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how far you’ve come.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear of the unknown can be overwhelming.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:24.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is leading you in the right direction.

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one to keep in mind

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Philippians 4:13.

00:07:29.803 --> 00:07:34.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read it, and just think
about how far Jehovah has taken you.

00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:48.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:50.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:12.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in control.

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:14.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was I so afraid of?

00:08:27.652 --> 00:08:29.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, SKE is for two months.

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re just alike you two,

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing every last thing with you.

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:44.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I—can I leave this with you?

00:08:44.753 --> 00:08:48.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been on a few adventures,
but it’s still great for traveling.

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:51.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, please.

00:08:51.718 --> 00:08:54.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows, you might need it sometime soon.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no other organization
that compares to Jehovah’s organization.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything the organization provides
and helps with is free of charge.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah invites all of us to give to him

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or contribute our material resources

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to what we personally decide.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:23.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is this “giving” a matter of faith?

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be that we hold back because

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) we might fear that if we are generous,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might not have enough for our own needs?

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To think this way is understandable.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is unpredictable, and nobody knows

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the future holds and what
our material needs might be tomorrow.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it be that we hold back because

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we feel that our personal contribution

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so small and, therefore, insignificant?

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we have very little materially
because we live in a poor country

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we struggle to cover
our expenses for other reasons.

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see that our giving

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really depends on how
we connect this with Jehovah.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our view of Jehovah
and our friendship with Jehovah

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs to influence our actions,

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this requires faith.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, let us briefly look
at these two concerns

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might impact our generosity
and how faith can help us.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first concern was the uncertainty
of our own future needs.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:37.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, let us open our Bible
to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in our theme scripture,

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul provides
a principle to follow

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we consider donations.

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is 1 Corinthians 16,
and we’ll read verse 2:

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the first day of every week,

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:57.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each of you should set something aside
according to his own means,

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that collections
will not take place when I arrive.”

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the apostle Paul encouraged Christians

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to plan ahead to give.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, Paul wanted them
to consider their circumstances

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to decide
on a certain contribution amount.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was convinced

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:19.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this would not result
in their lacking material necessities.

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He himself had experienced
the help from Jehovah,

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew that God would care for them.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generous giving would further allow Jehovah

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for them in a generous way.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we now see how planning ahead
is an expression of our faith?

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:43.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this, we are putting Jehovah
to the test in a good way.

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:45.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to experience how it feels

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah
sees us setting the right priorities

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:53.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in turn, becomes our Protector
and our Rewarder.

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are displaying this kind of faith.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you set something aside

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can contribute
when you come to the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others consider their expenses
and their financial means,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:12.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they decide
to regularly donate electronically.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:15.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when circumstances have not allowed you

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to donate the way you have done in the past,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you still find a way
to give your contribution to Jehovah.

00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:26.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for our needs.

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we really believe that?

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, our faith

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:36.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to give generously.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a second concern that might
hold us back from giving generously.

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might consider our circumstances and feel

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:47.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the contribution we can make is so small

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it makes no difference.

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you still have 1 Corinthians 16:2 open?

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:55.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we read there?

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:59.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us read it again, 1 Corinthians 16:2:

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the first day of every week,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each of you should set something aside

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:11.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to his own means.”

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Paul
did not specify a certain minimum amount?

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:20.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, he mentioned
the Macedonian Christians

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they were in deep poverty.

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:26.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, they begged for the privilege of giving.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were happy to give

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even beyond their means
because they were giving to Jehovah.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:40.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being poor meant
that they individually could not give much,

00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:43.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they understood
that giving materially

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an expression of our worship.

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you brothers and sisters
are like those in Macedonia

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:53.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you have very little.

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:57.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, we see your faith
by your contributing generously

00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to your circumstances.

00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:04.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how small the amount might be,

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you imitate our generous God, Jehovah.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you experience what
one sister described in a letter.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wrote,

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All these years I’ve been unable to give

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:22.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but small amounts of money
at the Kingdom Hall.”

00:05:22.134 --> 00:05:24.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet she continued,

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah God has given me back

00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:30.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much more than I have given.”

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even our young children can learn

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:40.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set something aside and give to Jehovah.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Warwick,
we occasionally receive notes and letters

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these young ones
who want to give to Jehovah,

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:50.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they tell us how they appreciate

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the organization is doing,
especially the videos.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really touches our hearts,

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:02.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can only imagine
how happy it must make Jehovah.

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves us for giving
the best that we have.

00:06:09.097 --> 00:06:12.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He values even our small contributions.

00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:15.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even small donations do make a difference

00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are noticed by Jehovah.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our faith in action.

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:24.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note what moved

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one couple to greater acts of generosity.

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a disaster struck
in the north of the country,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we immediately answered the call for help.

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing our brothers and sisters
in need was heartbreaking.

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:04.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what really touched our heart
was the spirit

00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:06.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the local brothers and sisters.

00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:08.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like the Macedonians.

00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:12.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have much,
but they gave generously from the heart.

00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:34.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got home,

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Madeline and I resolved
to show the same kind of spirit.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:45.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our appreciation led us

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:48.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to review our contribution
to the worldwide work.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:51.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve come up with this figure.

00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:53.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this right?

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just thank Jehovah.

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:11.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We looked for ways to be generous

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:13.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those around us.

00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:25.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discovered that we had

00:08:25.984 --> 00:08:29.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the means to give more,
so we didn’t hold back.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then,
our congregation was invited to help

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a special preaching campaign.

00:08:55.889 --> 00:08:59.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . reach as many
as possible with the good news.

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:04.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think we could do a bit more?

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:06.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d really like to.

00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:10.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was within our power to help,

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:13.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s exactly what we did!

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:19.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much?

00:09:19.246 --> 00:09:21.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not.

00:09:35.053 --> 00:09:39.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what role
faith played in this couple’s giving?

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:41.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:43.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they put their faith in Jehovah’s promise

00:09:43.728 --> 00:09:45.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for them in times of need,

00:09:45.772 --> 00:09:48.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so they sat down

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:51.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reconsidered
their ability to generously give.

00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:55.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayerfully, they decided
on their contribution.

00:09:55.323 --> 00:09:57.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In line with our theme,

they “set something aside.”

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,

00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:05.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they shared materially
with their brothers and sisters

00:10:05.876 --> 00:10:08.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—food items, and a nice meal.

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:13.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They realized what a blessing it is
to be used by Jehovah

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in caring for others.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we live in the most exciting time in history

00:10:21.057 --> 00:10:25.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with never-to-be-repeated opportunities
to demonstrate our faith.

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:30.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul compared this
with ‘a large door

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:32.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that opened up.’

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, think for a moment.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has a door to activity opened for you

00:10:38.074 --> 00:10:40.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn a new language?

00:10:40.285 --> 00:10:43.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or does it look more like the door leads you

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:45.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move to where the need is greater?

00:10:45.957 --> 00:10:49.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did this symposium remind you
of the door that is open

00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to receive training
at the School for Kingdom Evangelizers?

00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:57.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or did it direct you to the door

00:10:57.219 --> 00:11:01.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for assisting
with a theocratic building project?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe this concluding part
has reminded all of us 

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:09.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our privilege of generously supporting
the Kingdom work

00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:12.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making donations, even if they are small.

00:11:14.694 --> 00:11:17.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What door is open to you

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:20.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you are able to expand your ministry?

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:24.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t feel bad if you hesitate to enter
—this is normal.

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:26.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, please,

00:11:26.748 --> 00:11:30.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not delay entering unnecessarily.

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:33.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t think you can always reach out later.

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For we all do not know
what our life will be like tomorrow.

00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:39.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
the door to wonderful blessings

00:11:39.594 --> 00:11:44.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is open today might be closed tomorrow.

00:11:44.432 --> 00:11:46.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be courageous,

00:11:46.518 --> 00:11:50.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter the door to activity in faith.

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:52.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like many of your brothers and sisters

00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:54.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have already
made these steps in the past,

00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:57.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have no regrets.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:00.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us all demonstrate our faith

00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing all that we can
for our Friend and God, Jehovah,

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:08.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will enjoy a rich life now,

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll be blessed
with unending life in the future.

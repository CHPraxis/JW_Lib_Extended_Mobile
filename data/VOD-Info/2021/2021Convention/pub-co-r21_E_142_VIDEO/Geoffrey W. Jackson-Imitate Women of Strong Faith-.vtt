00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:04.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah chose the young woman Mary

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:06.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a difficult assignment.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a unique assignment,

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one that required great faith.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was to care for and raise

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only-begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing privilege that was!

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, it required strong faith
on the part of Mary

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only because this was
a very serious responsibility

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would involve quite a number of years

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because initially Mary,
before accepting this assignment,

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had some concerns, no doubt.

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them would have been the concern

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to the reaction of her friends,

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neighbors, relatives and, yes, of course,
her fiancé, Joseph.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, the angel didn’t say to her:
“Don’t worry.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ll go and inform this
to all the ones involved

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they don’t get upset.”

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was a very difficult

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overwhelming assignment for Mary.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine
how she approached this assignment?

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to help us do that,
let’s watch this short video.

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was engaged to marry Joseph.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we would have
a simple and quiet life.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:28.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, suddenly, everything changed.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that God sometimes asks us
to do what is difficult.

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this seemed impossible,
beyond anything we could handle.

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I was safe in Jehovah’s hands.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:43.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we remained loyal to Him

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and did our best
to care for his precious Son,

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would always be loyal to us

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give us what we needed.

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we think of Mary’s situation,

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that she was interested in was having
a quiet, simple life.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then suddenly everything changed for her,

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may have seemed impossible for her

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:11.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to accept that assignment.

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, what was her reaction?

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, please take your Bibles,
and turn with me

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:21.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the first chapter of Luke and verse 38

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Luke 1:38.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we see Mary’s reaction: “Look!

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s slave girl!

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:37.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May it happen to me
according to your declaration.”

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, in full faith and with humility,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she accepted this difficult assignment.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She knew that Jehovah would be with her

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he would help her.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was it that gave Mary
such a strong faith?

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we get a clue if we look down

00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the same chapter but at verse 46.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:04.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s Luke 1:46.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re not going to read the verse

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the study note associated with the verse.

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice it says: “Mary’s words of praise

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that follow in verses 46-55

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“contain well over 20 references to

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:23.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or allusions to the Hebrew Scriptures . . .

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:26.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mary’s words give evidence
of her spirituality

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and her knowledge of the Scriptures.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:32.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They show her appreciative attitude.

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:35.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her words also reveal
the depth of her faith,

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as she spoke of Jehovah as abasing
the haughty and powerful

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as helping the lowly and poor
who seek to serve him.”

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Mary’s faith

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was based on her knowledge of God’s Word,

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Holy Scriptures that she had.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:57.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it seems that she
didn’t have personal copies

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these writings.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:02.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, she must have memorized

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what she heard being read at the synagogue.

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:07.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Mary’s heart was full

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all of these expressions
from the Hebrew Scriptures

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:18.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so much so that when
she spontaneously praised Jehovah,

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these expressions came out

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she had treasured them in her heart.

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:27.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, Mary had strong faith

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:30.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was based on the Holy Writings,

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is what made her qualified
for this assignment.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about us?

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate this strong faith of Mary?

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look at this dramatization,

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:48.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice that although
our assignments may be different,

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we likewise need to have
that same strong faith.

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:59.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they first told me,
I thought it must have been a mistake.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, me

00:05:01.822 --> 00:05:05.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—oversee a department
at an international convention?

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:17.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like it was just too much to handle,

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:29.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I remembered that I thought
the same thing years ago

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:33.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was asked to serve
on a Disaster Relief Committee

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I served
on the Hospital Liaison Committee.

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I’ve always felt that way

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I’ve received
an assignment from Jehovah.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I’ve learned is

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:27.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s always ready to help.

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:42.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jehovah asks me
to do something that seems difficult,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just remind myself

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pray,

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay loyal,

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:50.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith

00:07:08.115 --> 00:07:10.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’ll give me what I need.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you feel sorry for that young brother?

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:24.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we can really understand
his expressions,

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:29.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When they told me of the assignment,
I thought it was a mistake.’

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt some of us have felt
the same way at times too.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped this young brother?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he remembered how Jehovah
had helped him

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:41.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in similar situations in the past.

00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:44.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember how he
thought back to the time

00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:47.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was with the Disaster Committee?

00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there he was, standing as a young man,
and all these other men

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were looking to him for some direction.

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:55.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was very overwhelming.

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:59.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what about when he was
to make the presentation

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:01.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an HLC member?

00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:04.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember him sitting there
in the corridor by himself,

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then this young woman
ushers him into the room.

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:09.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t look very friendly at all,
did she?

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:13.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And certainly the medical staff
didn’t look very friendly.

00:08:13.138 --> 00:08:16.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So assignments like that can be overwhelming.

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did the young brother say?

00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:22.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that the things
that helped him were prayer,

00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:27.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
staying loyal, and having faith.

00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:30.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, like Mary,

00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:34.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we likewise can have this strong faith
that pleases Jehovah.

00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:37.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to display humility

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:40.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have absolute confidence in Jehovah,

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:44.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a type of confidence that’s expressed
in the book of Psalms.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Psalm 56:3, 4

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:56.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 56:3, 4.

00:08:57.057 --> 00:09:01.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.

00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In God
—whose word I praise—

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:08.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can mere man do to me?”

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, just like the psalmist
and just like Mary,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can have full confidence in Jehovah.

00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:24.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, let us demonstrate this strong faith

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:26.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are faced with difficult assignments,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting in Jehovah,
knowing that he will bless us

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same as he blessed Mary.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next part in our symposium

00:09:36.138 --> 00:09:38.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be handled by Brother Leonard Myers,

00:09:38.807 --> 00:09:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s a helper to the Writing Committee.

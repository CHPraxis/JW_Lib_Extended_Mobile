Jesus compared our days
with the days of Noah.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus would know because he was in heaven

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watched the days of Noah
go from bad to worse.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how bad were the days of Noah?

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Genesis 6:5 for a description:

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Consequently, Jehovah saw

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that man’s wickedness was great on the earth

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that every inclination of the thoughts

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his heart was only bad all the time.”

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wickedness on the earth was made worse

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by wicked angels
that abandoned their role in heaven

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and materialized
into human bodies to marry women on earth.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These unholy marriages produced sons

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:52.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were giants called Nephilim.

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, parents, we could ask,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine what it must have been like

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Noah and his wife
to raise a family in that ungodly world?

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you don’t really need
to imagine it, do you?

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one look around us and we can all see

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we live in a world
that fits the same description,

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if not worse, than the days of Noah.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Noah’s faith was tested,

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your faith will likely be tested too

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:26.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you raise a family in this ungodly world.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:30.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please do not allow the pressures at work,

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from relatives, or from others
make you think that material things

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:39.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are more important
than your family’s relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can remain faithful

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by imitating Noah, not his neighbors.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
note how a parent’s faith is tested.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:59.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another busy day:

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter is going to preach,

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:04.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m off to work,
and it’s Family Worship night.

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye, Dad.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a good day, Sweetie.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:17.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, listen up!

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got an announcement for everybody.

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting this Monday . . .

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?
More required overtime?

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:25.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, that’s it.
That’s all I’ve got.

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:26.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s get back to work!

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s extra money.

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:32.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can I do it <i>and</i>  take care of Regina?

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . to your local channel 17,
where news comes first.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad, isn’t it Family Worship night?

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:51.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . to affect millions
as economies are . . .

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe a little later, Sweetie.

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the worst financial crisis in decades.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violence and looting continue . . .

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, but I was spent

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:03.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again.

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:07.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother knew it was Family Worship night,

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but extra work and the pressures of life
were dragging him down.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith was being tested.

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he imitate Noah or his neighbors?

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:21.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s neighbors lacked faith.

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not do what was needed
to save their families.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, Jesus said they were so distracted

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:30.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their daily lives, “eating and drinking”

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting married
that “they took no note

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the Flood came
and [took] them all away.”

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, Noah took note.

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah acted in faith to save his household.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the beautiful description
of Noah’s faith

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Hebrews 11:7:

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Noah,
after receiving divine warning

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of things not yet seen, showed godly fear

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and constructed an ark
for the saving of his household;

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through this faith
he condemned the world,

00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he became an heir of the righteousness

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that results from faith.”

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s actions saved his household.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be sure it was not always easy

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Noah to explain to his sons

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why they were building an ark
and no one else was

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:33.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or why building it was more important
than anything else they had to do.

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:36.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His three boys would have seen the Nephilim.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah and his wife
could hardly have shielded their boys

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from all the stories
that circulated about those giants.

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:49.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine some of the discussions
that Noah and his wife had with their boys.

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The materialized wicked angels
and their Nephilim sons

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were men of fame and admired by everyone

00:04:57.192 --> 00:05:00.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their superhuman capabilities.

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:03.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even today, people
are fascinated with stories

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:06.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and movies of humans with superpowers.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:13.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those wicked angels
and their sons, the Nephilim,

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:16.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were nothing to be admired or imitated.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah taught his sons
not to admire or copy them.

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:22.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to help their boys see

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah felt hurt by the violence
and rebellion in the world.

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:32.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boys needed to learn
to love Jehovah and imitate him.

00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:38.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, take the time to teach your children

00:05:38.025 --> 00:05:42.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hate what Jehovah hates
and to love what Jehovah loves.

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:46.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hates liars, cheaters,

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:49.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bullies, selfishness, and greed.

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:52.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, Jehovah loves honesty,

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:56.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace, love, sharing, and self-control.

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah, like any good father,

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:04.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to make sure his family
had a comfortable place to live

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:06.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and good food to eat.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the houses that Noah and his sons
could have built for themselves.

00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:13.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They certainly had
the construction experience.

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:17.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was not Noah’s focus.

00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:20.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s life had more meaning and purpose

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:23.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than building houses, eating, and drinking.

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:29.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah taught by example and kept his focus

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on saving his household
from the coming Flood.

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likely had times
when he felt tired or overwhelmed

00:06:38.293 --> 00:06:42.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the sheer size
and scope of building an ark.

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Noah
did not allow his day-to-day life

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:49.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to crowd out his service to Jehovah.

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:53.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made sure that no matter what else
was happening in his life,

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:56.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work of building the ark
kept moving forward.

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother we saw in the video

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he was tired and overwhelmed
by his work and job.

00:07:05.153 --> 00:07:08.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us can identify with how he feels.

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:11.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in this system is hard.

00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate the hard work and effort

00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:16.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you parents are making

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep a good spiritual routine
for your family.

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:25.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know how tempting it can be to say:

00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:27.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, we’ll study later”

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:30.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “We’ll pick it up again next week.”

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See the danger.

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Putting off our spiritual routine this week

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:39.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can easily lead to three weeks

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:43.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then six weeks and then not at all.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:49.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah took care
of Noah and his family’s material needs,

00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:53.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can be confident that Jehovah
will take care of you and your family.

00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:57.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will bless you for your obedience.

00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:00.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how our brother imitates Noah’s faith.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violence and looting continue
despite curfews . . .

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world is such a mess.

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:12.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s everything Jesus said it would be.

00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:15.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so good

00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:18.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spiritually-minded like her mother was.

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:23.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I expect she’ll stay that way on her own?

00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:32.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . rise in the wake
of a massive earthquake

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:34.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a magnitude of 8.1, which struck . . .

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leaders from around the world
have come together

and made notable statements 
on social media today

00:08:40.165 --> 00:08:42.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing confidence.

Sadly, our community has been affected
by a soar in gun violence.

As of right now, . . .

If it is just like Noah’s day,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to show faith like he did.

Let’s do our family worship.

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:28.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:09:31.007 --> 00:09:34.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to show faith in Jehovah

00:09:34.886 --> 00:09:38.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work hard to save my family.

00:09:42.936 --> 00:09:46.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
how our brother acted in faith?

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother imagined
what could happen to his daughter

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:57.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she lost her spirituality
and adopted the lifestyle of the world.

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:00.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he saw really scared him.

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:04.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He immediately turned off the TV

00:10:04.082 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and joined his daughter for family worship.

00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:10.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah knew that building the ark

00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:13.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would save his family from the coming Flood

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:18.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but only if they were in the ark with him.

00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:23.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not want to see his sons
adopt the lifestyle of his neighbors.

00:10:23.643 --> 00:10:26.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah did everything he could to make sure

00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he taught his sons to love Jehovah

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by his words and his actions.

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:36.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, by imitating Noah,

00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:40.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can save both yourself and your family.

Brother Seth Hyatt,
a helper with the Service Committee,

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:50.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:10:50.587 --> 00:10:55.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate the Faithful,
Not the Faithless—Moses, Not Pharaoh.”

00:00:01.438 --> 00:00:04.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to use your imagination
for a moment.

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:08.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to when you were having
a conversation

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone who you respect,
and they’re in a position of authority.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, during the conversation,
this person says to you

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(coming up to certain points),

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they say: “Remember.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to remember this.”

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is what Jehovah has done for us
in this symposium.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When somebody says “remember,”

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then most people stop and they refocus

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and concentrate even more.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does Jehovah want us to remember
with this specific part?

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many people who are not religious

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can acquire faith.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you think about how every year

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are people
who were atheists or agnostics

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have come into the truth.

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the lesson in this part is this:

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not hold back

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from witnessing to people
who are nonreligious.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t want to take the position
as if we’re the judge of this:

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, they wouldn’t be interested
—they’re an atheist; they’re an agnostic;

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re wrapped up with materialism.’

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:25.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not our position to take.

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be individuals

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who Jehovah believes will try to help

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:33.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these nonreligious individuals.

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what Paul writes here

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Romans chapter 10.

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll find out
how some have changed their mind

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after an exposure to the truth

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jehovah’s teaching.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the only way
that they could acquire faith

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when this is done.

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice carefully and pay attention,

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 10:13-15:

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For ‘everyone who calls
on the name of Jehovah

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be saved.’

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, how will they call on him

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if they have not put faith in him?

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How, in turn, will they put faith in him

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about whom they have not heard?

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How, in turn, will they hear

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“without someone to preach?

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How, in turn, will they preach

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“unless they have been sent out?

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as it is written:

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How beautiful are the feet

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:36.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘of those who declare good news

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of good things!’”

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:44.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how an individual acquires faith,

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by answering these questions
—very penetrating questions—

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of us want to remember

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to witnessing to people

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are nonreligious.

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need someone
to share the good news with them

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:04.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to do it in such a way
that touches their heart.

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:05.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep that in mind.

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It isn’t always just what we say;

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:13.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s how we say it that matters.

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody has to share
the good news with them

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:18.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they’re going to acquire faith.

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question arises here,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we share Bible truths in a way

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nonreligious people

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:30.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are more likely to accept?

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good question.

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in helping nonreligious people
acquire faith,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s an important point
that the apostle Paul shared with us

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his first letter to the Corinthians.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So find 1 Corinthians

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 9, if you would, please

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:50.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians chapter 9.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the 22nd verse:

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:57.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the weak I became weak,

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:00.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to gain the weak.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:07.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might by all possible means

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
save some.”

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:10.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example the apostle Paul was

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:17.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with adapting to his audience!

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:20.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d speak one way to the Jews,

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referencing the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then different to the Greeks,

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who didn’t know about Jehovah God.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the message is

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak to them about topics
that might interest them.

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had to share this issue with you.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:42.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The July 2019, <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 22-23.

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these are some points

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:50.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can keep in mind
when it comes to witnessing

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:53.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to nonreligious people

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very, very good advice.

00:04:57.192 --> 00:05:01.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the point here
when it comes to nature.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:05.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of people, they might even be
atheists or agnostics,

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love nature.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So using that as a basis

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a conversation
is the course of wisdom.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say something like:
“You probably know

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:19.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that many inventions came about

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:24.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when scientists copied things
that already existed in nature.

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:27.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For instance, microphone designers

00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:29.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“study ears,

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:33.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and camera designers study eyes.

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:36.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What comes to your mind
when you think of nature?

00:05:36.982 --> 00:05:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you think that it is a marvelous force,

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a person, or something else?”

00:05:42.237 --> 00:05:45.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now listen attentively
when you ask questions like that.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then add, maybe:

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:52.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When engineers learn
from the design of ears and eyes,

00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:56.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we might wonder whom they are learning from.

00:05:56.335 --> 00:06:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was intrigued by something
an ancient poet [said].”

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is wise because the poet is

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:07.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the psalmist from Psalm 94:9, 10.

00:06:07.262 --> 00:06:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you could say ancient poet.

00:06:09.097 --> 00:06:10.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s appropriate.

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:12.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s the quote:

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One who made the ear, can he not hear?

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One who formed the eye,
can he not see?

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:24.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . He is the One who imparts knowledge
to people!”

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:26.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:29.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good questions to ask and discuss

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:31.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with nonreligious people.

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:36.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we have
the marvelous website, jw.org;

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:39.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve got
the “Viewpoints on the Origin of Life,”

00:06:39.378 --> 00:06:43.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a number of videos that can help them.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the same time, we want to have
compassion, empathy,

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:49.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try to reach their heart.

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:53.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were some key points,
just to pass them on to you

00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you want to keep in mind talking
—giving a witness to nonreligious people):

00:06:58.814 --> 00:07:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be positive.

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:04.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind that “every year
 there are nonreligious people

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who [have] become Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is important.

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be kind and tactful,

00:07:11.868 --> 00:07:14.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because people will listen

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:18.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘not just because of what we say,
but how we say it.’

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re going to reach a heart,

00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:23.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak from the heart.

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:25.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be kind and tactful,

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:29.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imitate Jesus in the way he witnessed.

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such compassion and love was always evident.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:35.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then this point:

00:07:35.392 --> 00:07:39.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be understanding and listen.

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so crucial to remember to listen.

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:47.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes (and sincere Witnesses do it),

00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:49.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we talk too much.

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:53.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask a question,
and they have two seconds to answer.

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next thing, we’re talking already,

00:07:55.537 --> 00:07:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have to listen.

00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:01.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are not being listened to today.

00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:04.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let that be us.

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:07.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be understanding and listen to them.

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:10.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let them express themselves,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you show you have
empathy and love for them.

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:18.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep these thoughts in mind,
and Jehovah will bless your efforts.

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:22.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the following video,

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:26.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what has attracted nonreligious people

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:28.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the truth.

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:33.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My family were nonpracticing Catholics,

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:37.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so I was never taught to believe in God.

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:41.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trusted my teachers more than anyone else,

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:47.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I accepted
and loved the theory of evolution.

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 19, a childhood friend

00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:55.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had become one
of Jehovah’s Witnesses started to call on me.

00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:01.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked talking to him, but when
he spoke to me about God, I told him,

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:04.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, stop talking about God
because I don’t believe in him.”

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up on me.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked, “Why won’t you,

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:15.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just for a moment,
entertain a conversation about God?”

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This question made me think.

00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:24.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had rejected his arguments
without even listening to them.

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:26.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to give the impression

00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being arrogant or stubborn.

00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:34.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Why not let him speak?’

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the book <i>Life</i>—<i>How Did It Get Here?</i>

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>By Evolution or by Creation?</i>

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:47.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if a veil
had been lifted from my eyes.

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:50.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment Jehovah

00:09:50.068 --> 00:09:52.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
introduced himself to me.

00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, I understood
that my life has a purpose.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:00.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I regret that I didn’t know Jehovah

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first 20 years of my life.

00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:07.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:10.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most precious thing I have.

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:12.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am determined to witness

00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:14.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah to everyone I meet,

00:10:14.843 --> 00:10:19.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially to those without faith,

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:21.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they too can appreciate

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:24.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wonderful qualities of our Creator.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:31.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:36.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonreligious people are accepting the truth.

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:38.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can acquire faith,

00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:43.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those beautiful experiences
prove that point.

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:46.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again we say, “Remember

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:50.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Faithless People Can Acquire Faith!”

00:10:50.795 --> 00:10:54.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think back to the Ninevites,

00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:58.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ fleshly brothers, and prominent Jews

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they all made great changes.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:05.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today as in the past,
here’s what is happening

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned here in 1 Timothy chapter 2

00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:13.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Timothy chapter 2,

00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:17.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it mentions in the fourth verse
about Jehovah’s will:

00:11:17.697 --> 00:11:21.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . whose will is that all sorts of people

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:24.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be saved
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Jehovah’s will.

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:31.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve dedicated our lives to him
to do Jehovah’s will.

00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:33.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all sorts of people

00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are acquiring faith in Jehovah

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:39.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
year after year.

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:44.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we encourage you to give
a bold but tactful witness

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:47.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your unbelieving relatives

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as to prominent ones

00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:53.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to nonreligious people.

00:11:54.651 --> 00:11:57.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we continue to preach to all,

00:11:57.612 --> 00:11:59.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make it grow.

00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:03.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless our efforts.

00:12:03.618 --> 00:12:06.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jehovah can stir

00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:09.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hearts of any person

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause them to acquire faith.

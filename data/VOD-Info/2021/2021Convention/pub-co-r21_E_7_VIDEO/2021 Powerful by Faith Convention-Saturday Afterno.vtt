00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good day, brothers and sisters!

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will begin this convention session

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by enjoying another music-video presentation.

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video highlights the power
that faith can have in our lives.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the video.

00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:36.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our opening song expresses
our joy in practicing true worship.

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:38.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing song number 24,

00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:42.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Come to Jehovah’s Mountain.”

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:44.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s song number 24.

00:13:27.243 --> 00:13:30.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genuine faith moves us to action.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be seen in the lives
of our brothers and sisters earth wide.

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:37.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the following video

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that features experiences
from six different regions.

00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:44.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how our brothers are showing faith.

00:13:52.435 --> 00:13:56.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Through faith they defeated kingdoms,

00:13:56.564 --> 00:13:59.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“brought about righteousness,

00:13:59.484 --> 00:14:01.903 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“obtained promises,

00:14:01.903 --> 00:14:04.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“stopped the mouths of lions,

00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:07.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“quenched the force of fire,

00:14:07.325 --> 00:14:10.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“escaped the edge of the sword,

00:14:10.203 --> 00:14:13.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“from a weak state were made powerful,

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:16.126 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“became mighty in war,

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:19.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
routed invading armies.”

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:23.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith in Jehovah has allowed ordinary people

00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:27.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do extraordinary things.

00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:31.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This kind of faith is still active today

00:14:31.057 --> 00:14:33.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still has the power to help us

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:35.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through any difficulty.

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:39.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s travel across the globe

00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:42.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how deep reliance on Jehovah

00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:47.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped many overcome their unique trials.

00:14:47.407 --> 00:14:49.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we visit each land,

00:14:49.826 --> 00:14:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll enjoy a story of faith

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:56.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared both from the perspective
of close friends

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:59.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the individuals involved.

00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:03.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to our first destination.

00:15:10.847 --> 00:15:13.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
South Africa is full of contrasts 

00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:15.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and diversity.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:19.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Big, modern cities mix
with poorer remote areas.

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:22.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many volunteers
in Kingdom Hall construction,

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:24.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this presents wonderful opportunities

00:15:24.903 --> 00:15:28.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also unique challenges that require faith

00:15:28.573 --> 00:15:30.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah.

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:34.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example of that
is our young friend Namhla.

00:15:34.954 --> 00:15:36.581 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I really appreciated

00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:37.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the faith she showed

00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:39.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to make herself available

00:15:39.834 --> 00:15:42.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep her joy in her assignment.

00:15:43.254 --> 00:15:46.966 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m the only Jehovah’s Witness in my family.

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:51.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What my mother desired the most for me

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:53.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to grow up,

00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:55.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to college

00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in time, get a high-paying job.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My congregation was busy
building a Kingdom Hall,

00:16:04.651 --> 00:16:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I would sometimes also go to help.

00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to see and feel the joy
that those brothers were having

00:16:12.992 --> 00:16:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
building Kingdom Halls.

00:16:15.745 --> 00:16:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom didn’t like it when she heard

00:16:17.747 --> 00:16:21.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was going to help
with Kingdom Hall construction.

00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:24.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She felt that I was wasting my time.

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I arrived on-site,
everything I did was for the first time.

00:16:30.885 --> 00:16:34.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have skills,
and I had never done this work before.

00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:37.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not easy.

00:16:37.517 --> 00:16:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I get tired

00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:42.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mentally exhausted
and even physically exhausted.

00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:47.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s difficult
to even read the Bible.

00:16:47.318 --> 00:16:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to wash up and go to sleep.

00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:57.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was important for Namhla
to find her spiritual balance

00:16:57.412 --> 00:17:00.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because her spirituality

00:17:00.832 --> 00:17:02.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was more important

00:17:02.834 --> 00:17:05.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than working hard on-site.

00:17:05.545 --> 00:17:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to be really determined

00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:12.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because my spirituality
was not the same as before.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that I needed to make a change.

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:21.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made it a priority to read the Bible first

00:17:21.269 --> 00:17:23.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to think about the things I read.

00:17:24.397 --> 00:17:28.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also made sure that I was regular
in going out in the ministry.

00:17:30.612 --> 00:17:32.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer helped a lot

00:17:32.614 --> 00:17:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because prayer is the best way
for me to tell Jehovah

00:17:35.783 --> 00:17:38.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that concern me.

00:17:38.411 --> 00:17:42.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen for myself
how Jehovah God has sustained me.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen that she is much more balanced.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom would phone and ask,

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:51.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Namhla, how is the project going?”

00:17:51.883 --> 00:17:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she would say,

00:17:54.093 --> 00:17:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If this makes you happy,
then I am also happy.”

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:01.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I had my fears,

00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but faith made me confident

00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:05.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God would always be there

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:09.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support me in everything I do.

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:30.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
C anada is a diverse country

00:18:30.838 --> 00:18:32.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both the landscape

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, because of immigration,
the people and their languages.

00:18:36.302 --> 00:18:39.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to share Bible truth
with these ones,

00:18:39.472 --> 00:18:42.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many brothers are learning a new language,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like my friend Shaquille.

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:49.107 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Shaquille got invited to Bethel,

00:18:49.107 --> 00:18:50.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had the privilege of serving

00:18:50.775 --> 00:18:52.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the Canada branch at the time.

00:18:52.777 --> 00:18:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was such a pleasure
to see this young man

00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:58.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had all these wonderful goals
and to see one by one

00:18:58.324 --> 00:19:00.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah opening those doors to him.

00:19:00.618 --> 00:19:03.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had made a promise to Jehovah
as a young person.

00:19:04.664 --> 00:19:08.001 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I want to help those

00:19:08.001 --> 00:19:10.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that don’t have anyone to help them.

00:19:11.087 --> 00:19:13.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw good in me,

00:19:13.089 --> 00:19:15.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he invested in me,
and he was very patient with me,

00:19:15.341 --> 00:19:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saw it through every brother and sister
who sincerely reached out to help me.

00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:23.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditating on Jehovah’s qualities
—you want to imitate him.

00:19:23.016 --> 00:19:26.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to show the kindness that he
has shown toward you and toward others.

00:19:26.394 --> 00:19:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a foreign language, I feel
like there is a giant opportunity to do that.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to learn Punjabi,
and I never regretted it.

00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:35.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It changed my service to Jehovah.

00:19:39.657 --> 00:19:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a time period in my Bethel service

00:19:42.785 --> 00:19:45.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was really, really sick,

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:47.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was a kind of sickness

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:49.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I didn’t know why it was happening.

00:19:49.709 --> 00:19:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doctor could tell me why it was happening.

00:19:52.128 --> 00:19:54.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It affected my physical appearance,

00:19:54.213 --> 00:19:57.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it seemed liked torment
throughout each and every day.

00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:02.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of times, I would have rather
not been seen.

00:20:03.765 --> 00:20:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So serving in a foreign language now
when you’re one of the people

00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:09.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is spiritually supposed
to be strengthening others,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’re going
through a hard time yourself,

00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:13.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a massive challenge for me.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of his friends
just really appreciated

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:21.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith that he had to overcome that.

00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:25.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though it was
a very low point in his life,

00:20:25.244 --> 00:20:27.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he really hung on to Jehovah.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m in this assignment and I’ve seen
that Jehovah has blessed me,

00:20:32.126 --> 00:20:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would lead me to conclude
that he’s going to stop?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t sleep; he just couldn’t continue
at Bethel either.

00:20:40.343 --> 00:20:42.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had left Bethel.

00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, my health was decreasing,
and it was getting really bad.

00:20:45.348 --> 00:20:47.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was getting to the point that doctors

00:20:47.391 --> 00:20:49.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed concern
about maybe an organ failing

00:20:49.602 --> 00:20:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things like that.

00:20:51.687 --> 00:20:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they did not give me any way out.

00:20:54.857 --> 00:20:56.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no way out.

00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:58.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept making progress

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:02.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though there were certainly
some really difficult times for him.

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:06.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to take a realistic approach
toward my new situation,

00:21:06.744 --> 00:21:11.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to figure out, “OK, how
am I going to put Kingdom interests first

00:21:11.332 --> 00:21:14.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while materially taking care of myself

00:21:14.293 --> 00:21:17.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and hopefully figure out why I’m sick

00:21:17.922 --> 00:21:20.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if I can do anything about it?”

00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:23.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, he decided
to stick with the foreign language.

00:21:25.388 --> 00:21:28.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something I really learned
from Shaquille is

00:21:28.307 --> 00:21:33.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he really took the Scriptures
and made it personal.

00:21:33.312 --> 00:21:37.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would read it as if he was the person
in the Scriptures,

00:21:37.817 --> 00:21:39.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would meditate on it,

00:21:39.819 --> 00:21:43.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he could see how,
even though he didn’t know the answers,

00:21:43.656 --> 00:21:46.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would help him
through his difficult times.

00:21:46.784 --> 00:21:49.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what am I going to do?

00:21:49.412 --> 00:21:52.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to live up
to what I promised to Jehovah.

00:21:52.456 --> 00:21:55.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, he serves with his wife
in the Punjabi field.

00:21:56.752 --> 00:22:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a loving shepherd, and he
even instructs Punjabi-language classes.

00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:25.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Indonesia, people work very hard.

00:22:25.865 --> 00:22:29.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They seek stability through a secure job.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can have a powerful influence
on the brothers and sisters

00:22:32.496 --> 00:22:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they may feel
that they can’t expand their ministry.

00:22:37.126 --> 00:22:41.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I met the Jatmikos,
they were working toward pioneer service.

00:22:42.798 --> 00:22:45.092 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When they started, I asked them,

00:22:45.092 --> 00:22:46.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to be used

00:22:46.928 --> 00:22:48.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more fully by Jehovah?”

00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:51.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was confused.

00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:55.102 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We felt that the pioneer service itself was

00:22:55.102 --> 00:22:57.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already a big accomplishment.

00:22:57.563 --> 00:23:02.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I encouraged them to think
about the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:23:03.277 --> 00:23:07.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never imagined applying for SKE.

00:23:07.698 --> 00:23:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was tempting.

00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to be used by Jehovah,

00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:14.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but

00:23:14.997 --> 00:23:18.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would happen to us after graduation?

00:23:19.627 --> 00:23:22.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we be assigned?

00:23:22.713 --> 00:23:25.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would be our assignment?

00:23:26.509 --> 00:23:28.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed more faith,

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:33.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we prayed a lot about that.

00:23:33.557 --> 00:23:35.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered my prayers

00:23:35.935 --> 00:23:38.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the brothers and sisters
in the congregation.

00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:43.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mardha had a prestigious job.

00:23:43.317 --> 00:23:45.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was even being offered many scholarships

00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:48.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she could pursue higher education

00:23:48.489 --> 00:23:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and further advance her career.

00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:55.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters
never criticized Mardha’s work choice.

00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:58.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they showed us the joys

00:23:58.749 --> 00:24:01.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving Jehovah more fully.

00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:05.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was still deciding what to do,

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:08.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of them asked me
about my spiritual goals

00:24:08.634 --> 00:24:11.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what I could see myself doing.

00:24:11.262 --> 00:24:14.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking about such questions

00:24:14.307 --> 00:24:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
convinced me to choose SKE.

00:24:19.645 --> 00:24:22.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were invited to attend the school.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to leave their jobs, their house,

00:24:25.776 --> 00:24:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the comforts of the place and city
where they lived.

00:24:28.904 --> 00:24:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were assigned to a small congregation.

00:24:32.074 --> 00:24:34.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to pray even more

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask Jehovah God
for guidance and direction.

00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:41.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they’re serving in the traveling work,

00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:44.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a circuit.

00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced

00:24:46.756 --> 00:24:50.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was not due
to any greatness on our part

00:24:50.551 --> 00:24:52.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because of Jehovah’s help.

00:24:53.512 --> 00:24:55.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to be used by Jehovah

00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:58.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we want to serve him,

00:24:58.476 --> 00:25:03.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can use us in many different ways.

00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fiji is a beautiful place.

00:25:28.714 --> 00:25:31.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, one thing that is common here

00:25:31.884 --> 00:25:33.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is poverty.

00:25:34.845 --> 00:25:39.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That is the situation Sister Bakata faces.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband was a hard worker.

00:25:45.564 --> 00:25:50.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were out in the water,
he cried out from the mangroves.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went and found him,

00:25:54.323 --> 00:25:58.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that it was a stroke.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to take on both roles
as husband and wife.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:07.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would farm; I would fish.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a difficult life.

00:26:14.593 --> 00:26:17.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a sister was sick.

00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:22.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though Sister Bakata faced challenges,

00:26:22.977 --> 00:26:27.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was any washing or cleaning
needed for the sick sister,

00:26:27.982 --> 00:26:31.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was happy to go and help with that too.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think back to when a cyclone hit Kadavu

00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:39.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Cyclone Keni.

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:47.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared by the damage
it did to our house.

00:26:47.209 --> 00:26:50.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our outdoor kitchen was blown off.

00:26:51.505 --> 00:26:54.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard about the things
that happened to the brothers,

00:26:54.925 --> 00:26:57.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so sorry for them.

00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their roofs were blown away,

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:04.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the walls had fallen down.

00:27:08.147 --> 00:27:11.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about what Sister Bakata did.

00:27:11.484 --> 00:27:13.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had 20 Fijian dollars.

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the only money she had,

00:27:21.952 --> 00:27:26.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she decided to give all of that
to the brothers.

00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:32.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have any other way to help them.

00:27:33.797 --> 00:27:36.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is “the God of love.”

00:27:36.383 --> 00:27:38.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like it says at 1 John 4:8,

00:27:38.928 --> 00:27:41.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his main quality is love.

00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:44.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that love,

00:27:44.016 --> 00:27:46.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gave the money from the bottom of my heart.

00:27:49.438 --> 00:27:53.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that even though we are poor,

00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:56.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still be generous
to assist our brothers.

00:27:59.823 --> 00:28:01.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I gave,

00:28:01.825 --> 00:28:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more Jehovah gave back to me.

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:07.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Till today,

00:28:07.957 --> 00:28:11.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve always had what we’ve needed.

00:28:33.315 --> 00:28:36.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Peru, like many places around the world,

00:28:36.026 --> 00:28:39.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters need to work hard.

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:48.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benjamín and Doris have to make
good use of their resources

00:28:48.747 --> 00:28:51.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to provide for their family.

00:28:53.586 --> 00:28:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to give our children
a spiritual heritage.

00:28:57.464 --> 00:28:59.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We want them to be able to serve Jehovah

00:28:59.925 --> 00:29:02.094 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by watching how we are doing it.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We watch a lot of videos that help us.

00:29:05.889 --> 00:29:07.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often remember the video

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Abilio and Ulla.

00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:12.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also had three children.

00:29:12.688 --> 00:29:16.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They moved to another place and grew up
in a very nice, spiritual atmosphere.

00:29:18.068 --> 00:29:20.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are serving Jehovah now as adults.

00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:23.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we asked ourselves,

00:29:23.657 --> 00:29:26.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Could we move to another place
where the need is greater?’

00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:32.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It takes faith to go to an unfamiliar place.

00:29:32.082 --> 00:29:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One video on jw.org that helped us a lot

00:29:35.711 --> 00:29:38.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about the family from England
who moved to Ecuador.

00:29:38.714 --> 00:29:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, they went for one month.

00:29:40.924 --> 00:29:43.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we said
that we should also go visit first.

00:29:43.844 --> 00:29:47.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going to another country
would have been exciting

00:29:47.014 --> 00:29:49.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been super,

00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:54.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our economic situation
wouldn’t allow us to go that far.

00:29:55.105 --> 00:29:59.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We took a trip together with our children
to visit a territory that had a need

00:29:59.568 --> 00:30:01.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called Calango.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes about an hour and a half
to get there.

00:30:04.823 --> 00:30:06.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They liked the geography of the area

00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:09.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the vegetation.

00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:11.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many things
that captured their attention.

00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:16.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things that I like in Calango
are playing and preaching.

00:30:19.672 --> 00:30:23.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were unable to move to the city of Calango

00:30:23.842 --> 00:30:27.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the economic situation
that the people face there.

00:30:27.388 --> 00:30:29.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to get a job there.

00:30:30.015 --> 00:30:32.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for that reason,

00:30:32.017 --> 00:30:36.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we decided to travel to Calango
on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays

00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:38.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work the other days here in Pachacamác.

00:30:39.817 --> 00:30:43.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have felt that Jehovah is helping us

00:30:43.028 --> 00:30:46.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he has made it possible to work here.

00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:49.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the money that we earn in those days

00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:52.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows us to be with our brothers there.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.000 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We needed to know how to keep things simple.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that from the videos on jw.org.

00:31:01.171 --> 00:31:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hard work that they do proves to me
that they really love Jehovah.

00:31:06.176 --> 00:31:09.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fully trust that Jehovah is our Father.

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:11.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the Dad.

00:31:11.181 --> 00:31:14.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Dad
always comes through for his children.

00:31:14.601 --> 00:31:18.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that faith is something
that greatly motivates them.

00:31:18.564 --> 00:31:20.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The videos on jw.org had given us

00:31:20.816 --> 00:31:22.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the push that we needed.

00:31:23.944 --> 00:31:26.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed those videos
in order to take action

00:31:26.947 --> 00:31:29.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move to another area.

00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:49.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Across Russia,

00:31:49.386 --> 00:31:52.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers have successfully faced decades

00:31:52.848 --> 00:31:55.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of persecution and ban.

00:31:56.143 --> 00:31:59.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Budenchuks, like so many families there,

00:31:59.229 --> 00:32:02.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still face these challenges today.

00:32:04.026 --> 00:32:06.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On June 12, 2018,

00:32:06.737 --> 00:32:09.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at 5:30 a.m.,

00:32:09.907 --> 00:32:12.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
armed men burst into our home.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They threw my husband to the floor
and handcuffed him.

00:32:19.833 --> 00:32:23.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, they sent my husband
to a pretrial detention facility

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 11 months.

00:32:26.048 --> 00:32:29.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was frightening
just imagining certain things.

00:32:29.676 --> 00:32:33.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t find it easy and shed many tears.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really worried
about how I would care for the children

00:32:37.643 --> 00:32:40.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I would fulfill
their needs spiritually,

00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:42.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and physically.

00:32:44.775 --> 00:32:46.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer calmed me down

00:32:46.777 --> 00:32:50.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I wanted, of course,
to react very emotionally

00:32:50.447 --> 00:32:54.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everything
—to the injustice that we were facing.

00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:58.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the court hearings were going on,

00:32:58.038 --> 00:33:00.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters would come.

00:33:00.374 --> 00:33:04.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a support
—so strengthening!

00:33:07.714 --> 00:33:11.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On September 19, 2019,

00:33:11.093 --> 00:33:14.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the court convicted my husband

00:33:14.388 --> 00:33:16.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sent him to a prison colony

00:33:16.723 --> 00:33:19.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for three and a half years.

00:33:22.437 --> 00:33:24.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In January 2020,

00:33:24.982 --> 00:33:26.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new disaster hit us.

00:33:28.485 --> 00:33:32.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1:00 a.m., our house burned to the ground.

00:33:33.532 --> 00:33:35.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stood there near the house,

00:33:36.952 --> 00:33:40.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my son, Yegor, suggested saying a prayer.

00:33:41.915 --> 00:33:43.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t remember the prayer,

00:33:43.834 --> 00:33:45.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but afterward I felt calmer.

00:33:47.212 --> 00:33:49.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then cars started coming to the house.

00:33:49.298 --> 00:33:51.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was our brothers and sisters.

00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:55.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was frozen, shaking from the cold,

00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:57.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they dressed me like a small child.

00:33:58.682 --> 00:34:01.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought us hot tea, food

00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:03.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything of the highest quality.

00:34:12.863 --> 00:34:15.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one month after the fire,

00:34:18.785 --> 00:34:21.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they took my husband
to the prison colony,

00:34:21.955 --> 00:34:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
officers there beat him up.

00:34:27.794 --> 00:34:30.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I found out about it,
it was so hard for me

00:34:33.508 --> 00:34:36.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I didn’t know how to help my husband

00:34:36.094 --> 00:34:38.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how he was feeling.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tanya copes with hardships very courageously.

00:34:45.687 --> 00:34:48.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah, sometimes all night.

00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:52.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt as though Jehovah gave me

00:34:52.277 --> 00:34:55.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
painkillers to dull my pain.

00:34:56.657 --> 00:34:59.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Aleksey,
tries to take care of us.

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:01.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the pretrial detention facility,
for example,

00:35:01.578 --> 00:35:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each day he wrote
letters of encouragement to us,

00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:06.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we read together as a family.

00:35:07.334 --> 00:35:11.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dear family: Remember the qualities
that we need right now

00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:14.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—endurance, courage, calmness

00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:17.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important, faith.

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:21.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like the thought that after winter,
summer always comes;

00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the night, the day arrives;

00:35:24.601 --> 00:35:29.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after the darkest days,
there will definitely come a sunny one.

00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:34.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout all these trials,
having a good spiritual schedule

00:35:34.361 --> 00:35:37.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reading the Bible
has given me strength.

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:42.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we prepare for meetings
and participate in the ministry.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really afraid to do it,

00:35:45.372 --> 00:35:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this situation has helped me
to see Jehovah’s support.

00:35:50.293 --> 00:35:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have realized
that even in my circumstances,

00:35:53.463 --> 00:35:55.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still help others.

00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:59.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah
has already given us his support,

00:35:59.636 --> 00:36:02.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we believe
that he will continue to support us.

00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:05.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their example of courage

00:36:05.225 --> 00:36:09.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and steadfast faith
in the face of difficulties and trials

00:36:09.229 --> 00:36:11.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that we can also remain faithful.

00:36:11.898 --> 00:36:13.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can make Jehovah happy

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue to serve him
without becoming discouraged.

00:36:16.903 --> 00:36:19.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have learned to trust more in Jehovah

00:36:19.948 --> 00:36:23.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to panic
when a difficult situation arises.

00:36:23.702 --> 00:36:26.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These difficulties have made me stronger,

00:36:26.455 --> 00:36:29.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to overcome
many of the fears I used to have,

00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:34.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthened my faith
and my desire to help others.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we have seen,

00:36:42.554 --> 00:36:44.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers the world over

00:36:44.765 --> 00:36:47.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to show strong faith.

00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:51.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they do it?

00:36:54.483 --> 00:36:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A regular study of God’s Word,

00:36:59.404 --> 00:37:02.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time spent in deep meditation,

00:37:03.658 --> 00:37:07.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeking His direction in prayer.

00:37:07.245 --> 00:37:10.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did this allow them to accomplish?

00:37:11.249 --> 00:37:15.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through faith, our brothers handled
theocratic building assignments;

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learned foreign languages;

00:37:18.048 --> 00:37:20.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended theocratic schools;

00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:24.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though poor, remained generous;

00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:26.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served where the need was greater;

00:37:26.765 --> 00:37:30.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and preached despite persecution.

00:37:30.685 --> 00:37:34.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows we can do the same.

00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:39.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we let faith move us to action,

00:37:39.486 --> 00:37:43.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those actions will strengthen our faith.

00:37:48.578 --> 00:37:52.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those experiences
warm our hearts and move us

00:37:52.207 --> 00:37:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imitate the faith
of our brothers and sisters.

00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:58.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some ways in which we can do so?

00:37:58.964 --> 00:38:01.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following symposium will discuss

00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:04.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five opportunities to show our faith,

00:38:04.469 --> 00:38:09.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will help us to overcome
obstacles that could hold us back.

00:38:09.474 --> 00:38:13.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will introduce the one to follow.

00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:17.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Schafer,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:38:17.274 --> 00:38:20.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the first talk entitled

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:25.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith
—Learn a New Language.”

00:38:32.164 --> 00:38:35.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see faith?

00:38:35.167 --> 00:38:37.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to Mark chapter 2,

00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:40.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what the Bible says about this.

00:38:40.797 --> 00:38:45.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this account, Jesus is teaching
in a crowded house in Capernaum,

00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:48.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Mark 2:2-5 he tells us:

00:38:48.972 --> 00:38:51.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And so many gathered

00:38:51.558 --> 00:38:54.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there was no more room,
not even around the door,

00:38:54.728 --> 00:38:57.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he began to speak the word to them.

00:38:57.439 --> 00:39:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they brought him a paralytic
carried by four men.

00:39:01.443 --> 00:39:05.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But they could not bring him right to Jesus
because of the crowd,

00:39:05.989 --> 00:39:10.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so they removed the roof above Jesus,

00:39:10.952 --> 00:39:13.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and after digging an opening,

00:39:13.246 --> 00:39:17.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they lowered the stretcher
on which the paralytic was lying.

00:39:17.125 --> 00:39:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Jesus saw their faith,

00:39:21.838 --> 00:39:25.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said to the paralytic:
‘Child, your sins are forgiven.’”

00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:28.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, faith can be seen.

00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s seen in the way we act.

00:39:30.847 --> 00:39:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like other invisible things,
faith is measured by its effects.

00:39:35.685 --> 00:39:38.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, James 2:26 says

00:39:38.688 --> 00:39:41.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “faith without works is dead.”

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:45.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is, Can others see my faith?

00:39:45.987 --> 00:39:48.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What effect is my faith

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
producing in me?

00:39:51.534 --> 00:39:56.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:59.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One effect that faith has on people

00:39:59.125 --> 00:40:03.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it moves them to expand
their activity in Kingdom service.

00:40:03.046 --> 00:40:05.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul expressed this

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 16:9:

00:40:08.843 --> 00:40:13.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because a large door that leads to activity

00:40:13.306 --> 00:40:17.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been opened to me,
but there are many opposers.”

00:40:17.686 --> 00:40:22.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul took advantage
of such opportunities to show his faith.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has Jehovah opened
the door to activity for you?

00:40:26.736 --> 00:40:30.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,
we’re going to discuss five ways

00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:33.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which a temporary opportunity
leading to great activity

00:40:33.827 --> 00:40:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making disciples might present itself.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be in the form
of learning a new language,

00:40:39.958 --> 00:40:42.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moving to where the need is greater,

00:40:42.127 --> 00:40:45.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assisting with a theocratic building project,

00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:52.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or donating generously
to support the Kingdom work.

00:40:52.387 --> 00:40:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is faith needed
to seize such opportunities,

00:40:56.766 --> 00:41:00.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what blessings do we receive when we do?

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, why is faith needed

00:41:03.398 --> 00:41:07.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn a new language
in order to make disciples?

00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please, to Zechariah chapter 8

00:41:10.572 --> 00:41:12.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Zechariah chapter 8.

00:41:12.824 --> 00:41:15.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes faith

00:41:15.076 --> 00:41:19.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discern that current events
are fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:22.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes faith to understand 

00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:24.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we can act in harmony with God’s purpose

00:41:24.377 --> 00:41:27.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as revealed in that prophecy.

00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:31.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zechariah 8:22 says:

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:34.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And many peoples and mighty nations

00:41:34.721 --> 00:41:39.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will come to seek
Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem 

00:41:39.684 --> 00:41:43.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to beg for the favor of Jehovah.”

00:41:43.938 --> 00:41:48.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 23 says:
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘In those days ten men

00:41:51.071 --> 00:41:54.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘out of all the languages of the nations

00:41:54.657 --> 00:41:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will take hold, yes, they will take
firm hold of the robe of a Jew,

00:41:59.162 --> 00:42:01.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘saying: “We want to go with you,

00:42:01.873 --> 00:42:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for we have heard
that God is with you people.”’”

00:42:06.628 --> 00:42:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ten men”

00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:12.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people who recognize that the only way
to gain Jehovah’s approval

00:42:12.926 --> 00:42:15.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to associate
with those who already have it.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:20.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “Jew” is also referred to here
as “you people.”

00:42:20.392 --> 00:42:21.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which people?

00:42:21.976 --> 00:42:25.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, not the people
who refuse to pronounce God’s name

00:42:25.313 --> 00:42:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or those who remove it altogether
from their Bible translations.

00:42:28.316 --> 00:42:29.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:42:29.275 --> 00:42:32.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This refers to those who worship 

00:42:32.237 --> 00:42:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah by name

00:42:34.697 --> 00:42:38.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spirit-anointed Christians,
“the Israel of God”

00:42:38.576 --> 00:42:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referred to at Galatians 6:16.

00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:45.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because ten
can represent earthly completeness,

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:49.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “ten men” represent all men and women

00:42:49.337 --> 00:42:51.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have the hope of living forever on earth.

00:42:51.673 --> 00:42:55.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice that they come
not simply from all the nations

00:42:55.927 --> 00:42:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but from “all the languages of the nations”

00:42:59.889 --> 00:43:01.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to learn Jehovah’s requirements.

00:43:01.933 --> 00:43:04.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how will they hear

00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:08.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the voice of the “Jew” in their language?

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That might just be

00:43:11.734 --> 00:43:15.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your door to activity.

00:43:15.363 --> 00:43:18.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some might hesitate
to learn a new language.

00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:21.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they hold back because of the time
and energy that are required.

00:43:21.453 --> 00:43:23.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others feel that they lack the ability.

00:43:23.621 --> 00:43:25.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while it’s true
that before making any decision

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to calculate the expense,

00:43:27.792 --> 00:43:30.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the question here is one of faith.

00:43:30.879 --> 00:43:34.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can the God who gave ability to Bezalel,

00:43:34.257 --> 00:43:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who made the sun stand still for Joshua,

00:43:36.926 --> 00:43:40.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who gave power to Samson
also give you the ability,

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time, and energy to help those

00:43:43.057 --> 00:43:47.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are begging for the favor of Jehovah?

00:43:47.437 --> 00:43:50.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Matthew 17:20:

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith
the size of a mustard grain, . . .

00:43:54.986 --> 00:43:57.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:43:57.906 --> 00:44:00.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And according to Philippians 2:13,

00:44:00.366 --> 00:44:03.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holy spirit can give us even “the desire”

00:44:03.745 --> 00:44:07.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach to those
who speak another language.

00:44:07.123 --> 00:44:11.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that spirit drawing you now?

00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, too, that through his organization,

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides much help
for those who are learning a new language.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW.ORG contains reading material,

00:44:20.553 --> 00:44:22.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
audio recordings, and videos

00:44:22.597 --> 00:44:26.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more languages than any other website.

00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:29.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we have the <i>JW Language </i> app

00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and language classes
arranged by the branch office.

00:44:32.815 --> 00:44:35.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When faith motivates us

00:44:35.443 --> 00:44:38.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sacrifices to serve Jehovah,

00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:42.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will help us to succeed
and he will reward us

00:44:42.075 --> 00:44:44.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many blessings.

00:44:44.327 --> 00:44:48.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, a couple in their 60’s
kept finding Chinese people

00:44:48.957 --> 00:44:52.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who accepted their invitations
to attend congregation meetings.

00:44:52.252 --> 00:44:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they decided to learn Chinese,

00:44:55.171 --> 00:44:57.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and within ten years, they studied

00:44:57.257 --> 00:45:00.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 112 Chinese people.

00:45:00.635 --> 00:45:03.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, but with so many languages,

00:45:03.096 --> 00:45:06.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do I know
which language to start learning?

00:45:06.724 --> 00:45:09.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zechariah 8:22,

00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:13.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is ‘begging for the favor of Jehovah’?

00:45:13.273 --> 00:45:16.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can learn about the needs in your area

00:45:16.234 --> 00:45:19.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by consulting with the elders
and the circuit overseer.

00:45:19.737 --> 00:45:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how one couple

00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:26.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responds to a need in the field.

00:45:35.712 --> 00:45:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, honestly, you shouldn’t have.

00:45:38.923 --> 00:45:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to need it.

00:45:43.052 --> 00:45:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gabriel’s leaving to serve where 

00:45:45.054 --> 00:45:48.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need is greater made us feel like we

00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:51.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had missed the chance to expand our ministry.

00:45:54.105 --> 00:45:56.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we start now?

00:45:56.107 --> 00:45:58.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not getting any younger.

00:45:58.151 --> 00:45:59.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:45:59.152 --> 00:46:01.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could ask the circuit overseer for advice

00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:05.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his next visit,
but I’m worried he’s going to say

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should . . .

00:46:07.452 --> 00:46:09.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . join the new language group.

00:46:09.954 --> 00:46:12.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a big need in our circuit.

00:46:12.373 --> 00:46:14.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve never felt like the right people

00:46:14.709 --> 00:46:17.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve in a foreign language.

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lindstrom
shared Zechariah 8:23 with us,

00:46:20.715 --> 00:46:23.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helped us see how we could have a hand

00:46:23.968 --> 00:46:26.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping “men out of all
the languages of the nations”

00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn about Jehovah.

00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning was a struggle at first.

00:46:47.742 --> 00:46:50.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help, we made progress

00:46:50.828 --> 00:46:52.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—slowly.

00:46:57.335 --> 00:46:59.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!
You did it!

00:47:11.557 --> 00:47:13.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the language was a challenge,

00:47:15.436 --> 00:47:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving our new family was not.

00:47:33.496 --> 00:47:35.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, uhh.

00:47:47.135 --> 00:47:50.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t—I don’t understand.

00:47:57.645 --> 00:47:59.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say again what you say.

00:47:59.063 --> 00:48:00.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, uh.

00:48:11.576 --> 00:48:12.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come.

00:48:12.994 --> 00:48:14.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:48:14.328 --> 00:48:16.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank—thank you!

00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:22.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we aren’t getting any younger.

00:48:25.214 --> 00:48:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why we’re so glad

00:48:27.216 --> 00:48:30.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we took the chance to expand our ministry.

00:48:35.308 --> 00:48:40.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Elliott and Corrine
showed faith and how they were blessed?

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:42.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They talked to their circuit overseer,

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:46.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who revealed a big need
in a foreign-language group in their circuit.

00:48:46.652 --> 00:48:50.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then showed them Zechariah 8:23.

00:48:50.281 --> 00:48:52.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They read that scripture again later,

00:48:52.784 --> 00:48:55.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they prayed about it together,

00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:59.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then came
the measurable effect of their faith.

00:48:59.457 --> 00:49:01.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They put forth great efforts to learn.

00:49:01.626 --> 00:49:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, with humility and courage,
they used their new language skills

00:49:05.254 --> 00:49:07.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the meetings and in the ministry,

00:49:07.548 --> 00:49:09.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were able to help those

00:49:09.884 --> 00:49:13.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were ‘begging for the favor of Jehovah.’

00:49:13.137 --> 00:49:15.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how it works.

00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:16.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simple?

00:49:16.933 --> 00:49:20.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, but if we invest the time and effort

00:49:20.728 --> 00:49:23.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn a new language
in order to do more for Jehovah,

00:49:23.731 --> 00:49:27.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be confident
that Jehovah will bless us

00:49:27.068 --> 00:49:29.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a rewarding ministry.

00:49:29.153 --> 00:49:31.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a couple from Britain said:

00:49:31.656 --> 00:49:34.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The ministry in the foreign-language field

00:49:34.492 --> 00:49:37.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is one of the most exciting
we have experienced

00:49:37.161 --> 00:49:40.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during our 40 years of Kingdom service.”

00:49:40.706 --> 00:49:42.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did they do it?

00:49:42.708 --> 00:49:45.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because people who are seeking Jehovah

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

During a meeting held in Vietnamese,
a man stood up

00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:57.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said with tears in his eyes:

00:49:57.765 --> 00:50:00.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you, thank you for the efforts

00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you are making
to learn my difficult language.

00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:05.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am so grateful to learn

00:50:05.314 --> 00:50:09.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many wonderful things
from the Bible in my old age.”

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After attending a circuit assembly
in his native Albanian,

00:50:13.489 --> 00:50:17.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man in his 70’s
living in New York City, said:

00:50:17.076 --> 00:50:20.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the best day of my life!”

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made arrangements
that very day to start studying the Bible

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a pioneer who had learned his language,

00:50:26.377 --> 00:50:31.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and within just a few years,
he began serving as a ministerial servant.

00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:36.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are blessings for exercising faith.

00:50:36.137 --> 00:50:41.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith is measured by the way we act.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you enter
this door to activity in faith?

00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:48.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Samuel Herd,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:50:48.274 --> 00:50:51.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider the next talk
of this symposium,

00:50:51.402 --> 00:50:54.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith

00:50:54.113 --> 00:50:57.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Move to Where the Need Is Greater.”

00:51:04.081 --> 00:51:08.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moving to serve where the need
for Kingdom preachers is greater

00:51:08.169 --> 00:51:10.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be intimidating.

00:51:10.212 --> 00:51:13.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before moving, we cannot know all the details

00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:16.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what our life will be like.

00:51:16.093 --> 00:51:20.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the Bible can give us
the wisdom to successfully meet

00:51:20.806 --> 00:51:24.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any challenges we face after moving.

00:51:24.018 --> 00:51:26.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must put faith in it.

00:51:26.228 --> 00:51:28.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith can motivate us

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seize opportunities to serve Jehovah.

00:51:31.484 --> 00:51:35.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate Hebrews 11:8-10.

00:51:35.613 --> 00:51:38.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abram’s willingness to leave

00:51:38.407 --> 00:51:40.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was comfortable and familiar

00:51:40.826 --> 00:51:44.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move to a new land
when he was in his 70’s

00:51:44.956 --> 00:51:48.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a powerful demonstration of faith.

00:51:49.543 --> 00:51:54.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Hebrews 11:8-10:

00:51:54.173 --> 00:51:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Abraham, when he was called,

00:51:57.093 --> 00:51:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“obeyed by going out to a place

00:51:59.762 --> 00:52:02.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was to receive as an inheritance;

00:52:02.682 --> 00:52:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he went out, although
not knowing where he was going.

00:52:06.769 --> 00:52:09.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith he lived as a foreigner in the land

00:52:09.855 --> 00:52:13.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the promise as in a foreign land,

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:16.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“living in tents with Isaac and Jacob,

00:52:16.153 --> 00:52:19.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the heirs with him of the very same promise.

00:52:19.323 --> 00:52:23.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For he was awaiting
the city having real foundations,

00:52:23.285 --> 00:52:26.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose designer and builder is God.”

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:32.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t even know where
he was being assigned, but he went.

00:52:32.837 --> 00:52:35.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on his faith, he knew

00:52:35.798 --> 00:52:39.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the real life was not back home.

00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:42.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not in his new assignment.

00:52:42.096 --> 00:52:46.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looked for the fulfillment
of future promises.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Abraham and Sarah face
any difficulties along the way?

00:52:50.771 --> 00:52:53.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they did.

00:52:53.274 --> 00:52:56.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unexpected circumstances
were thrust upon them.

00:52:56.986 --> 00:52:59.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did Jehovah see them through?

00:52:59.655 --> 00:53:04.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Genesis 20:3-7.

00:53:04.368 --> 00:53:08.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To protect his life, Abraham
called Sarah his sister.

00:53:08.873 --> 00:53:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the king of Gerar

00:53:11.167 --> 00:53:15.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt he could take her as his wife.

00:53:15.212 --> 00:53:18.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a difficult time
for Abraham and Sarah.

00:53:18.924 --> 00:53:21.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jehovah work things out?

00:53:21.677 --> 00:53:26.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Genesis 20:3-7:

00:53:26.432 --> 00:53:29.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Afterward, God came by night

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to Abimelech in a dream and said to him:

00:53:32.313 --> 00:53:36.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here you are as good as dead
because of the woman

00:53:36.442 --> 00:53:40.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘whom you have taken, since she is married

00:53:40.279 --> 00:53:43.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and belongs to another man.’

00:53:43.115 --> 00:53:46.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, Abimelech had not gone near her.

00:53:46.535 --> 00:53:48.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he said: ‘Jehovah,

00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:52.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will you kill a nation
that is really innocent?

00:53:52.416 --> 00:53:56.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Did he not say to me, “She is my sister,”

00:53:56.295 --> 00:54:00.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and did she too not say,
“He is my brother”?

00:54:00.174 --> 00:54:04.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I did this with an honest heart

00:54:04.095 --> 00:54:06.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and innocent hands.’

00:54:06.388 --> 00:54:09.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the true God said to him in the dream:

00:54:09.642 --> 00:54:13.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I know that you did this
with an honest heart,

00:54:13.354 --> 00:54:17.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so I held you back from sinning against me.

00:54:17.024 --> 00:54:20.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That is why I did not allow
you to touch her.

00:54:20.444 --> 00:54:23.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now return the man’s wife,

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:26.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for he is a prophet,
and he will make supplication

00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:29.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you and you will keep living.

00:54:29.411 --> 00:54:32.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But if you are not returning her,

00:54:32.373 --> 00:54:36.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘know that you will surely die,

00:54:36.085 --> 00:54:38.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and all who are yours.’”

00:54:41.173 --> 00:54:43.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will be with us too

00:54:43.676 --> 00:54:48.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we act in faith to expand our ministry.

00:54:48.013 --> 00:54:50.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will get through the surprises

00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:55.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the rewards
of reaching out in this way.

00:54:55.354 --> 00:54:58.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we cannot know all the challenges

00:54:58.357 --> 00:55:00.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we may encounter,

00:55:00.401 --> 00:55:04.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can take practical steps
to choose a location

00:55:04.488 --> 00:55:07.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare to make adjustments.

00:55:08.576 --> 00:55:13.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Jesus’ words at Luke 14:28?

00:55:13.164 --> 00:55:17.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He indicated that a person
who wanted “to build a tower”

00:55:17.585 --> 00:55:20.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would first “calculate the expense

00:55:20.212 --> 00:55:22.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if he has enough to complete it.”

00:55:22.673 --> 00:55:25.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was practical.

00:55:25.176 --> 00:55:29.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do the same
when contemplating relocating

00:55:29.513 --> 00:55:32.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the need is greater.

00:55:32.308 --> 00:55:35.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can get a taste of the blessings
we will experience

00:55:35.853 --> 00:55:38.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by participating in preaching campaigns

00:55:38.647 --> 00:55:41.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
organized by the branch office or working

00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:44.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seldom-worked territory.

00:55:44.236 --> 00:55:47.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might you have the circumstances

00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:49.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move where the need is greater?

00:55:49.658 --> 00:55:53.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re interested
in serving in another land,

00:55:53.037 --> 00:55:57.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do careful research and speak
to your congregation elders.

00:55:57.166 --> 00:55:59.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can forward your letter
to the branch office

00:55:59.627 --> 00:56:02.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the country that interests you.

00:56:02.504 --> 00:56:06.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re unable to move to another land,

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is another option?

00:56:08.552 --> 00:56:11.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can, through your elders,

00:56:11.722 --> 00:56:14.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
write to the local branch office 
for information

00:56:14.767 --> 00:56:18.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about congregations that have a need.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your circuit overseer can provide information

00:56:21.523 --> 00:56:25.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about nearby congregations
that may need help.

00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:29.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how one brother

00:56:29.281 --> 00:56:33.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcame his fear of serving
where the need is greater.

00:56:35.371 --> 00:56:37.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had told me two years ago that I’d 

00:56:37.957 --> 00:56:39.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be moving to where the need was greater,

00:56:39.708 --> 00:56:41.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would have laughed.

00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:50.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started when they announced
a special preaching campaign.

00:56:50.928 --> 00:56:53.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Samuel
encouraged me to apply with him.

00:56:53.722 --> 00:56:55.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:56:55.683 --> 00:56:58.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, 

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:01.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, but you enjoy that.

00:57:01.355 --> 00:57:03.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re going to love it.

00:57:03.148 --> 00:57:05.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I got you a form as well,
all right?

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do this!

00:57:05.985 --> 00:57:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:57:10.698 --> 00:57:14.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do more,
but I was comfortable.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:57:16.662 --> 00:57:21.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:23.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to examine my heart.

00:57:27.423 --> 00:57:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I read about Abraham’s faith
at Hebrews 11:8,

00:57:30.467 --> 00:57:34.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like the words jumped off the page.

00:57:34.596 --> 00:57:37.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He went out although

00:57:37.975 --> 00:57:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not knowing where he was going.”

00:57:41.103 --> 00:57:45.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who better to be in control
of my life than Jehovah?

00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A door was opened to me.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just needed to go through it.

00:57:51.405 --> 00:57:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:57:54.199 --> 00:57:55.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do it, man.

00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the campaign were incredible!

00:58:06.378 --> 00:58:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the experience pushed me
out of my comfort zone.

00:58:16.597 --> 00:58:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Gabriel is going to try some food.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try, try, try!

00:58:21.268 --> 00:58:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on, go on, give it a try, Gabriel!

00:58:25.564 --> 00:58:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good, yeah—really good!

00:58:36.325 --> 00:58:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the ministry in a new way,
and I wanted to do more.

00:58:48.337 --> 00:58:51.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I calculated the cost

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked

00:58:53.133 --> 00:58:55.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my local elders
to write to the branch office.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:59:11.652 --> 00:59:15.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed about it
and did research before choosing.

00:59:16.573 --> 00:59:19.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many unknowns,

00:59:19.159 --> 00:59:20.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t wait!

00:59:20.661 --> 00:59:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends,

00:59:27.418 --> 00:59:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was ready for whatever
Jehovah had in store for me.

00:59:42.182 --> 00:59:44.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how faith was shown

00:59:44.685 --> 00:59:47.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what blessings resulted?

00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young brother admitted he was

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a comfort zone.

00:59:52.818 --> 00:59:57.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another brother invited him to join
in a special preaching campaign.

00:59:57.739 --> 01:00:01.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother was hesitant to reach out.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he read about Abraham.

01:00:04.288 --> 01:00:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he conclude?

01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “Who better to be
in control of my life than Jehovah?”

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He thoroughly enjoyed the experience
of the special campaign.

01:00:18.051 --> 01:00:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It fired him up!

01:00:20.095 --> 01:00:22.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the next thing we know,

01:00:22.389 --> 01:00:27.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is relocating to another congregation
that needed help.

01:00:27.436 --> 01:00:31.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although you will need to make sacrifices

01:00:31.148 --> 01:00:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you may face unexpected challenges,

01:00:34.234 --> 01:00:37.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will gain many blessings,

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drawing ever closer to Jehovah.

01:00:40.866 --> 01:00:43.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no need to worry

01:00:43.327 --> 01:00:47.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the good things
you may be denied temporarily.

01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows what you presently need

01:00:51.043 --> 01:00:54.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will supply it to you

01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on time.

01:00:56.256 --> 01:00:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 12:31 advises:

01:00:59.843 --> 01:01:02.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep seeking [God’s] Kingdom,

01:01:02.221 --> 01:01:06.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [all the] things [you need]
will be added to you.”

01:01:06.683 --> 01:01:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a single person or as a family,

01:01:09.978 --> 01:01:12.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider if you can move

01:01:12.356 --> 01:01:15.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the need is greater.

01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Noumair,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:25.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

01:01:25.619 --> 01:01:29.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith

01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:34.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers.”

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:44.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 10:22 states:

01:01:44.471 --> 01:01:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
that makes one rich,

01:01:47.182 --> 01:01:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He adds no pain with it.”

01:01:49.226 --> 01:01:53.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blesses those he loves
with gifts of divine approval,

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
guidance, and spiritual prosperity.

01:01:56.316 --> 01:02:00.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we enter
‘a door of Kingdom activity’ in faith,

01:02:00.153 --> 01:02:04.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are putting ourselves in line
for a rich blessing from Jehovah.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of those doors
is the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what just came to your mind
when you heard that?

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:16.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think: ‘Well, that’s a great school

01:02:16.253 --> 01:02:19.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you have special circumstances
to apply for it,’

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘I’m too old for that,’
or ‘I’m too young for that,’

01:02:24.052 --> 01:02:27.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘I’m already serving
where the need is great; I’m needed here,’

01:02:27.973 --> 01:02:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘They could send me anywhere
after the school,

01:02:30.559 --> 01:02:33.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m not really comfortable with that’?

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:37.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are honest feelings—and understandable.

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:42.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we want to be careful that feelings
don’t turn into stumbling stones

01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:46.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would prevent us
from receiving a blessing from Jehovah.

01:02:46.283 --> 01:02:49.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s use Timothy as an example

01:02:49.244 --> 01:02:52.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who entered
‘a door of Kingdom activity’

01:02:52.372 --> 01:02:55.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received Jehovah’s rich blessing.

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:58.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy received a personal invitation

01:02:58.545 --> 01:03:02.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the apostle Paul to expand his ministry.

01:03:02.132 --> 01:03:06.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first glance,
the two men probably looked nothing alike.

01:03:06.219 --> 01:03:08.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So imagine that scene.

01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:10.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was older, a man of experience.

01:03:10.724 --> 01:03:15.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was young,
probably in his late teens or early 20’s.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was bold in his speech,

01:03:17.022 --> 01:03:20.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tireless in his ministry,
and resilient to opposition.

01:03:20.984 --> 01:03:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, on the other hand,

01:03:22.986 --> 01:03:26.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Scriptures indicate
that young Timothy was perhaps shy,

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:30.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hesitant, and lacked self-confidence.

01:03:30.577 --> 01:03:32.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What stumbling stones

01:03:32.954 --> 01:03:35.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have existed
in Timothy’s mind

01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:39.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he pondered Paul’s invitation?

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:43.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles
to 2 Timothy chapter 3

01:03:43.632 --> 01:03:47.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read verses 10 and 11,
and we’ll find out—

01:03:47.302 --> 01:03:49.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Timothy chapter 3,

01:03:49.846 --> 01:03:52.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 10 and 11.

01:03:52.265 --> 01:03:56.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice that Paul wrote this to Timothy
many years later,

01:03:56.687 --> 01:03:59.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let’s see what we can learn

01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:01.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 10:

01:04:01.525 --> 01:04:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you have closely followed my teaching,

01:04:05.153 --> 01:04:07.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my course of life,

01:04:07.322 --> 01:04:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my purpose, my faith,
my patience, my love, my endurance,

01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:14.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the persecutions and sufferings

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:17.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such as I experienced
in [now notice] Antioch,

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:22.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Iconium, [and] in Lystra.”

01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, where was Timothy from?

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lystra.

01:04:26.842 --> 01:04:31.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young man likely witnessed
how Paul suffered ruthless beatings in Lystra

01:04:31.805 --> 01:04:33.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the hands of opposers.

01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:37.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you feel Timothy’s possible hesitation

01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:41.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he now looks at Paul
extending his hand out to him,

01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:44.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even eyeing the scars of Paul,

01:04:44.693 --> 01:04:47.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Paul says, “Come with me”?

01:04:47.028 --> 01:04:52.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy had to wonder:
‘If I go with you, it’s not going to be easy.

01:04:52.033 --> 01:04:55.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will I suffer as you suffered?’

01:04:55.996 --> 01:05:00.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another possible stumbling stone for Timothy

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the fact that he was already serving

01:05:02.919 --> 01:05:07.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a capable way
in the newly formed congregation in Lystra

01:05:07.132 --> 01:05:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “was well-reported-on by the brothers.”

01:05:10.177 --> 01:05:12.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Paul was asking him to leave it all,

01:05:12.971 --> 01:05:15.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including his family and friends.

01:05:15.307 --> 01:05:17.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy could have reasoned:

01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:21.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They need me; my mother needs me;
my grandmother needs me here.

01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:25.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I can join Paul in a few years
when I gain more experience.’

01:05:27.319 --> 01:05:31.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps yet another stumbling stone
for Timothy could have been the fact

01:05:31.031 --> 01:05:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he did not know
where his assignment would take him.

01:05:35.118 --> 01:05:39.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lystra was a small,
rustic town secluded in a valley.

01:05:39.664 --> 01:05:44.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew the people, the landscape,
the food, the language, the culture.

01:05:44.085 --> 01:05:48.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy knew that accompanying Paul
meant venturing into the unknown.

01:05:48.507 --> 01:05:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to wonder:
‘Am I really ready for this?

01:05:52.135 --> 01:05:55.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I have a weak stomach,
and it’s already feeling weaker

01:05:55.889 --> 01:05:58.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just thinking about going with Paul.’

01:05:59.851 --> 01:06:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see yourself in Timothy?

01:06:02.729 --> 01:06:07.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He no doubt had some real concerns
before accepting Paul’s offer.

01:06:08.443 --> 01:06:13.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did Timothy’s faith
allow him to see?

01:06:13.448 --> 01:06:16.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read again
Paul’s words at 2 Timothy,

01:06:16.743 --> 01:06:20.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time verse 11, but verse 11b

01:06:20.539 --> 01:06:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Timothy 3:11b:

01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:29.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I endured these persecutions.”

01:06:29.714 --> 01:06:34.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now note this:
“And the Lord rescued me from them all.”

01:06:36.137 --> 01:06:38.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy witnessed firsthand

01:06:38.515 --> 01:06:42.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah rescued and strengthened Paul.

01:06:42.143 --> 01:06:46.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, in faith Timothy
did enter the door of activity,

01:06:46.731 --> 01:06:50.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had worked together
with Paul for many years.

01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:55.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think of the blessings he received
because of his decision to join Paul.

01:06:55.866 --> 01:07:00.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed how Paul navigated
through each trial

01:07:00.203 --> 01:07:03.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Paul kept his inner peace.

01:07:03.248 --> 01:07:08.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy saw not just the inconveniences
or the sufferings of Paul,

01:07:08.253 --> 01:07:11.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he had observed Paul’s stabilizing joy.

01:07:11.631 --> 01:07:16.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he witnessed how Jehovah
helped him each step of the way.

01:07:16.011 --> 01:07:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

01:07:18.054 --> 01:07:22.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy stretched
beyond his somewhat shy, hesitant nature

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach his full potential

01:07:24.144 --> 01:07:27.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a zealous overseer
in support of the truth.

01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:34.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the following video,
note what reasoning helped Gabriel

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:38.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decide to apply
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:51.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At our convention, they had the meeting
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:07:51.046 --> 01:07:54.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:55.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Gabriel.

01:07:55.467 --> 01:07:56.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hi, Anton.

01:07:56.676 --> 01:07:57.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you coming?

01:07:57.761 --> 01:07:58.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, to what?

01:07:58.845 --> 01:08:00.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The SKE meeting.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, no.

01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:02.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t planning on it,

01:08:02.724 --> 01:08:05.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all right, yeah, sure.

01:08:05.727 --> 01:08:06.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go.

01:08:06.728 --> 01:08:08.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, then, and afterward, I can . . .

01:08:11.483 --> 01:08:14.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went, but I felt conflicted.

01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:16.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,

01:08:16.196 --> 01:08:19.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I already have an assignment,
one that I love.’

01:08:19.658 --> 01:08:24.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t fully understand
the incredible privilege of attending SKE.

01:08:26.998 --> 01:08:29.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked the circuit overseer
a few more questions.

01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:33.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt like, this is it!

01:08:33.296 --> 01:08:37.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed right,
and all I had to do was apply online.

01:08:38.718 --> 01:08:41.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was months ago.

01:08:41.805 --> 01:08:44.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s holding you back?

01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:47.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like Jehovah led me here,

01:08:47.018 --> 01:08:49.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve never been happier.

01:08:50.563 --> 01:08:54.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now another door has opened,
and the fear is back.

01:08:54.818 --> 01:08:57.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how far you’ve come.

01:08:57.362 --> 01:09:00.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear of the unknown can be overwhelming.

01:09:00.407 --> 01:09:02.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah

01:09:02.659 --> 01:09:04.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is leading you in the right direction.

01:09:04.911 --> 01:09:07.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one to keep in mind

01:09:07.372 --> 01:09:10.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Philippians 4:13.

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:15.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read it, and just think
about how far Jehovah has taken you.

01:09:24.973 --> 01:09:28.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

01:09:49.914 --> 01:09:52.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in control.

01:09:52.333 --> 01:09:54.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was I so afraid of?

01:10:07.974 --> 01:10:09.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much.

01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:15.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, SKE is for two months.

01:10:15.023 --> 01:10:16.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re just alike you two,

01:10:16.816 --> 01:10:19.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing every last thing with you.

01:10:22.405 --> 01:10:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I—can I leave this with you?

01:10:25.075 --> 01:10:29.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been on a few adventures,
but it’s still great for traveling.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:32.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, please.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows, you might need it sometime soon.

01:10:41.966 --> 01:10:45.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how faith was shown?

01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:48.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gabriel was in fear of the unknown.

01:10:48.515 --> 01:10:52.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Philippians 4:13 touched his heart,

01:10:52.519 --> 01:10:56.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stirred his feelings,
and helped him to trust in Jehovah

01:10:56.272 --> 01:10:58.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move forward in faith

01:10:58.691 --> 01:11:02.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:11:02.362 --> 01:11:05.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you choose to enter
through the door of SKE,

01:11:05.865 --> 01:11:09.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive specialized training
so that you can be used more fully

01:11:09.828 --> 01:11:12.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah and his organization.

01:11:12.872 --> 01:11:16.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it’s not a leap of faith

01:11:16.084 --> 01:11:19.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no idea of how things might turn out.

01:11:19.254 --> 01:11:22.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is an informed decision

01:11:22.048 --> 01:11:26.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a guaranteed outcome
of blessings from Jehovah.

01:11:26.427 --> 01:11:31.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you trust that Jehovah
will help you every step of the way?

01:11:31.182 --> 01:11:33.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, like Timothy,

01:11:33.977 --> 01:11:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will experience firsthand

01:11:36.312 --> 01:11:39.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how “the blessing of Jehovah . . .
makes . . . rich.”

01:11:41.276 --> 01:11:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

01:11:44.821 --> 01:11:48.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider the next talk
of this symposium,

01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:51.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith

01:11:51.202 --> 01:11:54.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Assist With a Theocratic Building Project.”

01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to assist
with a theocratic building project?

01:12:05.175 --> 01:12:09.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may see reports regarding
branch construction and renovation

01:12:09.804 --> 01:12:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the need for new Kingdom Halls
and remote translation offices (RTOs),

01:12:14.684 --> 01:12:18.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this may cause you to wonder
if you could have a share.

01:12:18.605 --> 01:12:21.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is a wonderful goal.

01:12:21.399 --> 01:12:24.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we’ve considered in this symposium,

01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:27.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it takes faith to do more for Jehovah.

01:12:27.989 --> 01:12:30.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, faith is required

01:12:30.992 --> 01:12:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share in a theocratic building project.

01:12:33.536 --> 01:12:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that?

01:12:35.538 --> 01:12:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, generally, there are two concerns:

01:12:37.999 --> 01:12:40.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) We may lack experience.

01:12:40.877 --> 01:12:43.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may feel that we do not have
construction, design,

01:12:43.922 --> 01:12:46.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
engineering, or real estate experience,

01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:48.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus we may feel inadequate

01:12:48.718 --> 01:12:51.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist with a Local/Design
Construction Department (LDC)

01:12:51.971 --> 01:12:54.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other project.

01:12:54.015 --> 01:12:58.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or (2) we may also realize
that to begin assisting,

01:12:58.019 --> 01:13:01.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
generally, we do so on a temporary basis.

01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:04.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we may have concerns
about leaving our job

01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:08.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our family for a period of time to assist.

01:13:08.863 --> 01:13:11.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you can relate to those concerns,

01:13:11.157 --> 01:13:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, no doubt the example of Nehemiah
will build your faith.

01:13:14.994 --> 01:13:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to Nehemiah 1:2, 3

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:23.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nehemiah 1:2, 3:

01:13:23.711 --> 01:13:27.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time Hanani, one of my brothers,

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“arrived with other men from Judah,

01:13:30.093 --> 01:13:34.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I asked them about the remaining Jews
who had escaped the captivity,

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and also about Jerusalem.

01:13:36.557 --> 01:13:40.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They replied: ‘Those remaining
there in the province

01:13:40.311 --> 01:13:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who have survived the captivity
are in a terrible situation

01:13:44.148 --> 01:13:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and in disgrace.

01:13:45.733 --> 01:13:48.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

01:13:48.152 --> 01:13:51.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.’”

01:13:51.864 --> 01:13:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah here is presented with a need.

01:13:54.325 --> 01:13:55.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would he do?

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he say: ‘Oh, I hope
those skilled brothers

01:13:58.121 --> 01:14:00.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help that situation one day.’

01:14:00.415 --> 01:14:03.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at chapter 2 and verse 5:

01:14:03.418 --> 01:14:05.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I then said to the king:

01:14:05.837 --> 01:14:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If it pleases the king and if your servant
has found favor with you,

01:14:10.341 --> 01:14:15.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘send me to Judah, to the city
where my forefathers are buried,

01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I may rebuild it.’”

01:14:18.057 --> 01:14:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Nehemiah was moved; he wanted to help.

01:14:21.644 --> 01:14:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw an opportunity
and demonstrated his faith.

01:14:25.606 --> 01:14:28.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took the initiative.

01:14:28.026 --> 01:14:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did it take faith for Nehemiah
to take this step?

01:14:31.988 --> 01:14:33.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt it did.

01:14:33.406 --> 01:14:35.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do we say that?

01:14:35.408 --> 01:14:38.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first off, what was
Nehemiah’s work assignment?

01:14:38.828 --> 01:14:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he the head
of the king’s construction project?

01:14:42.206 --> 01:14:46.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he the leading architect
or engineer or a city planner?

01:14:46.586 --> 01:14:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, rather, he was the cupbearer to the king.

01:14:51.215 --> 01:14:54.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can picture him saying:
‘Well I don’t have the experience

01:14:54.135 --> 01:14:55.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

01:14:55.762 --> 01:14:57.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I wouldn’t even know where to start.

01:14:57.555 --> 01:15:00.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I best leave that to somebody else.’

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, rather, he saw the need;

01:15:02.602 --> 01:15:07.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had the circumstances to help,
and he acted on that need.

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:11.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah did not let
his possible lack of experience

01:15:11.444 --> 01:15:12.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hold him back.

01:15:12.945 --> 01:15:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That took faith.

01:15:14.697 --> 01:15:19.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about the fact that this was
only a temporary assignment?

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Nehemiah, again, was willing to leave

01:15:21.204 --> 01:15:24.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this prestigious position
as the cupbearer to the king.

01:15:24.749 --> 01:15:26.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think about it,
he could have wondered

01:15:26.751 --> 01:15:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether his replacement
would take over his position permanently.

01:15:31.005 --> 01:15:35.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would his nice job be there
when he returned from Jerusalem?

01:15:36.427 --> 01:15:38.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Nehemiah showed faith

01:15:38.513 --> 01:15:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had loyal love
and would remember him.

01:15:42.392 --> 01:15:47.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his words at Nehemiah 1:5:

01:15:47.188 --> 01:15:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I said: ‘O Jehovah, the God of the heavens,

01:15:51.275 --> 01:15:53.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the great and awe-inspiring God

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:57.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who keeps his covenant and shows loyal love

01:15:57.323 --> 01:16:01.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who love him
and keep his commandments.’”

01:16:01.536 --> 01:16:05.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Nehemiah was confident
that Jehovah would show loyal love.

01:16:05.373 --> 01:16:07.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would work things out.

01:16:07.708 --> 01:16:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the result of Nehemiah’s faith?

01:16:10.753 --> 01:16:14.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, although at first Nehemiah
was not known as a builder,

01:16:14.674 --> 01:16:18.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used him in a mighty way
to accomplish his will.

01:16:18.428 --> 01:16:22.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Nehemiah contributed to the rebuilding
of the walls of Jerusalem

01:16:22.807 --> 01:16:25.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in significant ways.

01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:27.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

01:16:27.395 --> 01:16:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson is that we need faith

01:16:30.273 --> 01:16:34.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we are going to assist
with a theocratic building project.

01:16:34.152 --> 01:16:36.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, primarily, we need brothers and sisters

01:16:36.654 --> 01:16:40.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have a strong relationship
with Jehovah and a willing spirit.

01:16:40.575 --> 01:16:42.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the qualities we need.

01:16:42.827 --> 01:16:46.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Construction or technical skills
can be learned.

01:16:46.956 --> 01:16:51.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith will give us the confidence
that if we are invited,

01:16:51.377 --> 01:16:54.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make us equal to the task

01:16:54.088 --> 01:16:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us to develop the skills
that are needed,

01:16:57.633 --> 01:17:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith will also help us to trust

01:17:00.636 --> 01:17:04.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will care for us
when our assignment is over.

01:17:04.974 --> 01:17:09.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how Sarah
found the courage

01:17:09.437 --> 01:17:13.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist in a theocratic building project.

01:17:18.112 --> 01:17:20.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, darling, we’re back. 

01:17:20.114 --> 01:17:22.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I learned that I was invited to work

01:17:22.575 --> 01:17:27.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a few weeks on the upcoming
construction project, I was thrilled.

01:17:27.371 --> 01:17:31.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that excitement
quickly turned into anxiety

01:17:31.375 --> 01:17:33.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what I had to do.

01:17:38.382 --> 01:17:42.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah for weeks
to give me the strength

01:17:42.053 --> 01:17:44.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the conversation with my employer.

01:17:44.764 --> 01:17:47.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Sarah, come in!

01:17:57.109 --> 01:17:58.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

01:17:58.486 --> 01:18:00.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, first of all, say thank you

01:18:00.696 --> 01:18:02.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking the time to meet with me, . . .

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to explain
about the construction project

01:18:04.742 --> 01:18:06.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I had been invited to volunteer.

01:18:06.786 --> 01:18:08.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I would
really like the time to . . .

01:18:08.496 --> 01:18:11.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you want time off

01:18:11.207 --> 01:18:13.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the busiest time of our year?

01:18:15.962 --> 01:18:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, but . . .

01:18:18.005 --> 01:18:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your choice, but under no circumstances
will I hold your position.

01:18:27.515 --> 01:18:32.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege
felt like a huge risk.

01:18:32.812 --> 01:18:36.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was I making my life
more complicated by doing this?

01:18:50.746 --> 01:18:54.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the account
about the people in Nehemiah’s day.

01:18:55.876 --> 01:18:59.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their willing spirit demonstrated faith,

01:18:59.422 --> 01:19:02.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jerusalem’s walls were built by people

01:19:02.675 --> 01:19:05.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “put their heart into the work.”

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:11.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to miss out

01:19:11.392 --> 01:19:14.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the opportunity
to serve Jehovah in that way.

01:19:14.353 --> 01:19:16.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my resignation letter.

01:19:19.984 --> 01:19:24.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have faith that Jehovah
would bless my decision.

01:19:25.448 --> 01:19:28.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure what the future holds
when I get back,

01:19:28.993 --> 01:19:32.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I know Jehovah will take care of me.

01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For now, I’m going to focus

01:19:39.128 --> 01:19:42.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on putting my heart into the work.

01:19:53.225 --> 01:19:57.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you relate to when Sarah
went to meet her employer

01:19:57.229 --> 01:20:00.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how she struggled
with the decision of what to do?

01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how did Sarah resolve her concerns?

01:20:03.486 --> 01:20:06.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember, she examined
the example of Nehemiah and others,

01:20:06.781 --> 01:20:09.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this gave her courage to act

01:20:09.367 --> 01:20:13.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result, she enjoyed many blessings.

01:20:13.579 --> 01:20:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many of our brothers and sisters
have made the same choice.

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:20.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one couple
had to give up their apartment

01:20:20.795 --> 01:20:24.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and resign from their secular employment
to help with a project.

01:20:24.757 --> 01:20:27.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they said they did feel some anxiety

01:20:27.718 --> 01:20:31.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the end of their six-month assignment
neared,

01:20:31.055 --> 01:20:35.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they trusted that Jehovah
would help them, and help he did.

01:20:35.601 --> 01:20:38.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they returned,
they called their former employer.

01:20:38.562 --> 01:20:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did he offer them their job back

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was with better terms.

01:20:43.192 --> 01:20:46.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they said that within one week
of returning back,

01:20:46.278 --> 01:20:48.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had found a new apartment.

01:20:48.906 --> 01:20:53.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In another example, the LDC Department
invited a brother

01:20:53.369 --> 01:20:55.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work for a few months on a project.

01:20:55.788 --> 01:20:59.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the time, he was working full-time
with a major company.

01:20:59.834 --> 01:21:04.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had good benefits, a good salary,
a company car, housing.

01:21:04.588 --> 01:21:07.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He requested a leave of absence.

01:21:07.049 --> 01:21:09.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They denied his request.

01:21:09.218 --> 01:21:13.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother decided to take
the LDC assignment anyway.

01:21:13.097 --> 01:21:15.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was fired from his job.

01:21:15.474 --> 01:21:19.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what would he do
after he completed his assignment?

01:21:19.103 --> 01:21:22.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was actually able to find
a part-time job

01:21:22.857 --> 01:21:25.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has allowed him to stay
in full-time service,

01:21:25.609 --> 01:21:27.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he is a pioneer.

01:21:27.695 --> 01:21:31.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his wife are pioneers,
and he’s serving as a remote volunteer

01:21:31.365 --> 01:21:33.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a branch construction project.

01:21:33.617 --> 01:21:38.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similar stories are repeated over and over.

01:21:38.456 --> 01:21:41.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah foretold that during these last days

01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:44.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a great crowd” would worship him acceptably,

01:21:44.879 --> 01:21:48.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fulfillment of that prophecy
has created an urgent need

01:21:48.716 --> 01:21:50.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls,

01:21:50.718 --> 01:21:54.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
branch facilities, and RTOs.

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:58.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we understand
that the pandemic has limited

01:21:58.517 --> 01:22:02.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic building projects
to some extent at this time.

01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:05.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there is still much work to do

01:22:05.816 --> 01:22:08.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and on into the future.

01:22:08.903 --> 01:22:11.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if your health and circumstances permit,

01:22:11.947 --> 01:22:13.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make yourself available.

01:22:13.991 --> 01:22:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do so by filling out the A-19

01:22:17.244 --> 01:22:19.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and DC-50 applications.

01:22:19.789 --> 01:22:21.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your elders can help you

01:22:21.832 --> 01:22:25.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to access these on jw.org.

01:22:25.544 --> 01:22:29.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if assisting with a theocratic
building project is your goal,

01:22:29.924 --> 01:22:32.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can be confident that you too

01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:35.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will become powerful by faith.

01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:36.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take that leap.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will enjoy Jehovah’s support

01:22:39.266 --> 01:22:42.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many, many blessings.

01:22:42.937 --> 01:22:47.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

01:22:47.066 --> 01:22:50.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the final talk
of this symposium,

01:22:50.694 --> 01:22:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enter the Door to Activity in Faith

01:22:53.656 --> 01:22:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘Set Something Aside’ for Jehovah’s Work.”

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:09.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no other organization
that compares to Jehovah’s organization.

01:23:09.588 --> 01:23:14.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything the organization provides
and helps with is free of charge.

01:23:14.468 --> 01:23:17.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah invites all of us to give to him

01:23:17.388 --> 01:23:19.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or contribute our material resources

01:23:19.682 --> 01:23:22.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to what we personally decide.

01:23:22.685 --> 01:23:26.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is this “giving” a matter of faith?

01:23:26.814 --> 01:23:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be that we hold back because

01:23:30.025 --> 01:23:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) we might fear that if we are generous,

01:23:33.863 --> 01:23:36.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might not have enough for our own needs?

01:23:36.282 --> 01:23:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To think this way is understandable.

01:23:38.868 --> 01:23:41.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is unpredictable, and nobody knows

01:23:41.745 --> 01:23:46.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the future holds and what
our material needs might be tomorrow.

01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:48.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it be that we hold back because

01:23:48.586 --> 01:23:52.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we feel that our personal contribution

01:23:52.339 --> 01:23:55.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so small and, therefore, insignificant?

01:23:55.926 --> 01:24:00.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we have very little materially
because we live in a poor country

01:24:00.848 --> 01:24:05.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we struggle to cover
our expenses for other reasons.

01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:08.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see that our giving

01:24:08.439 --> 01:24:12.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really depends on how
we connect this with Jehovah.

01:24:12.192 --> 01:24:16.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our view of Jehovah
and our friendship with Jehovah

01:24:16.363 --> 01:24:18.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs to influence our actions,

01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:22.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this requires faith.

01:24:22.661 --> 01:24:26.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, let us briefly look
at these two concerns

01:24:26.624 --> 01:24:31.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might impact our generosity
and how faith can help us.

01:24:31.086 --> 01:24:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first concern was the uncertainty
of our own future needs.

01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, let us open our Bible
to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

01:24:40.763 --> 01:24:43.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in our theme scripture,

01:24:43.057 --> 01:24:46.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul provides
a principle to follow

01:24:46.185 --> 01:24:48.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we consider donations.

01:24:48.437 --> 01:24:52.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is 1 Corinthians 16,
and we’ll read verse 2:

01:24:52.816 --> 01:24:55.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the first day of every week,

01:24:55.945 --> 01:25:00.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each of you should set something aside
according to his own means,

01:25:00.616 --> 01:25:04.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that collections
will not take place when I arrive.”

01:25:04.495 --> 01:25:07.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the apostle Paul encouraged Christians

01:25:07.373 --> 01:25:09.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to plan ahead to give.

01:25:09.792 --> 01:25:13.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, Paul wanted them
to consider their circumstances

01:25:13.545 --> 01:25:16.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to decide
on a certain contribution amount.

01:25:16.924 --> 01:25:19.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was convinced

01:25:19.009 --> 01:25:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this would not result
in their lacking material necessities.

01:25:22.638 --> 01:25:25.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He himself had experienced
the help from Jehovah,

01:25:25.724 --> 01:25:29.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew that God would care for them.

01:25:29.436 --> 01:25:32.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generous giving would further allow Jehovah

01:25:32.898 --> 01:25:35.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for them in a generous way.

01:25:37.444 --> 01:25:41.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we now see how planning ahead
is an expression of our faith?

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this, we are putting Jehovah
to the test in a good way.

01:25:45.995 --> 01:25:48.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to experience how it feels

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah
sees us setting the right priorities

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:55.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in turn, becomes our Protector
and our Rewarder.

01:25:57.339 --> 01:25:59.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

01:25:59.633 --> 01:26:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are displaying this kind of faith.

01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:04.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you set something aside

01:26:04.346 --> 01:26:07.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can contribute
when you come to the Kingdom Hall.

01:26:07.933 --> 01:26:11.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others consider their expenses
and their financial means,

01:26:11.228 --> 01:26:15.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they decide
to regularly donate electronically.

01:26:15.315 --> 01:26:18.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when circumstances have not allowed you

01:26:18.402 --> 01:26:20.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to donate the way you have done in the past,

01:26:20.863 --> 01:26:24.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you still find a way
to give your contribution to Jehovah.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised

01:26:27.619 --> 01:26:29.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for our needs.

01:26:29.788 --> 01:26:32.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we really believe that?

01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:35.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, our faith

01:26:35.627 --> 01:26:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to give generously.

01:26:39.548 --> 01:26:43.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a second concern that might
hold us back from giving generously.

01:26:43.552 --> 01:26:46.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might consider our circumstances and feel

01:26:46.764 --> 01:26:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the contribution we can make is so small

01:26:50.059 --> 01:26:52.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it makes no difference.

01:26:52.811 --> 01:26:56.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you still have 1 Corinthians 16:2 open?

01:26:56.648 --> 01:26:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we read there?

01:26:58.734 --> 01:27:02.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us read it again, 1 Corinthians 16:2:

01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:06.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the first day of every week,

01:27:06.533 --> 01:27:10.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each of you should set something aside

01:27:10.037 --> 01:27:14.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to his own means.”

01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:19.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Paul
did not specify a certain minimum amount?

01:27:19.046 --> 01:27:23.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, he mentioned
the Macedonian Christians

01:27:23.175 --> 01:27:25.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they were in deep poverty.

01:27:25.511 --> 01:27:29.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, they begged for the privilege of giving.

01:27:29.681 --> 01:27:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were happy to give

01:27:32.101 --> 01:27:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even beyond their means
because they were giving to Jehovah.

01:27:38.524 --> 01:27:43.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being poor meant
that they individually could not give much,

01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:46.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they understood
that giving materially

01:27:46.532 --> 01:27:48.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an expression of our worship.

01:27:50.244 --> 01:27:54.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you brothers and sisters
are like those in Macedonia

01:27:54.206 --> 01:27:56.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you have very little.

01:27:56.208 --> 01:28:00.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, we see your faith
by your contributing generously

01:28:00.212 --> 01:28:03.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to your circumstances.

01:28:03.298 --> 01:28:07.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how small the amount might be,

01:28:07.094 --> 01:28:11.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you imitate our generous God, Jehovah.

01:28:11.682 --> 01:28:15.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you experience what
one sister described in a letter.

01:28:15.727 --> 01:28:17.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wrote,

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:21.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All these years I’ve been unable to give

01:28:21.608 --> 01:28:24.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but small amounts of money
at the Kingdom Hall.”

01:28:24.987 --> 01:28:27.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet she continued,

01:28:27.364 --> 01:28:30.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah God has given me back

01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:33.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much more than I have given.”

01:28:37.499 --> 01:28:40.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even our young children can learn

01:28:40.002 --> 01:28:43.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set something aside and give to Jehovah.

01:28:43.672 --> 01:28:47.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Warwick,
we occasionally receive notes and letters

01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:51.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these young ones
who want to give to Jehovah,

01:28:51.346 --> 01:28:53.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they tell us how they appreciate

01:28:53.682 --> 01:28:58.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the organization is doing,
especially the videos.

01:28:58.353 --> 01:29:00.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really touches our hearts,

01:29:00.898 --> 01:29:05.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can only imagine
how happy it must make Jehovah.

01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:11.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves us for giving
the best that we have.

01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:15.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He values even our small contributions.

01:29:15.537 --> 01:29:18.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even small donations do make a difference

01:29:18.665 --> 01:29:21.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are noticed by Jehovah.

01:29:21.293 --> 01:29:23.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our faith in action.

01:29:25.339 --> 01:29:27.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note what moved

01:29:27.591 --> 01:29:30.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one couple to greater acts of generosity.

01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:41.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a disaster struck
in the north of the country,

01:29:41.313 --> 01:29:44.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we immediately answered the call for help.

01:29:46.526 --> 01:29:50.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing our brothers and sisters
in need was heartbreaking.

01:30:03.543 --> 01:30:07.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what really touched our heart
was the spirit

01:30:07.381 --> 01:30:09.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the local brothers and sisters.

01:30:09.216 --> 01:30:11.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like the Macedonians.

01:30:11.468 --> 01:30:15.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have much,
but they gave generously from the heart.

01:30:35.784 --> 01:30:37.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got home,

01:30:37.786 --> 01:30:41.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Madeline and I resolved
to show the same kind of spirit.

01:30:45.585 --> 01:30:48.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our appreciation led us

01:30:48.588 --> 01:30:51.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to review our contribution
to the worldwide work.

01:30:51.758 --> 01:30:54.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve come up with this figure.

01:30:54.094 --> 01:30:56.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this right?

01:31:01.601 --> 01:31:03.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:05.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just thank Jehovah.

01:31:12.237 --> 01:31:14.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We looked for ways to be generous

01:31:14.448 --> 01:31:16.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those around us.

01:31:26.835 --> 01:31:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discovered that we had

01:31:28.837 --> 01:31:32.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the means to give more,
so we didn’t hold back.

01:31:53.403 --> 01:31:56.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then,
our congregation was invited to help

01:31:56.073 --> 01:31:58.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a special preaching campaign.

01:31:58.742 --> 01:32:02.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . reach as many
as possible with the good news.

01:32:05.332 --> 01:32:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think we could do a bit more?

01:32:07.376 --> 01:32:09.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

01:32:09.252 --> 01:32:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d really like to.

01:32:11.254 --> 01:32:13.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was within our power to help,

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:16.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s exactly what we did!

01:32:20.097 --> 01:32:22.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much?

01:32:22.099 --> 01:32:24.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not.

01:32:37.906 --> 01:32:42.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what role
faith played in this couple’s giving?

01:32:42.327 --> 01:32:44.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

01:32:44.329 --> 01:32:46.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they put their faith in Jehovah’s promise

01:32:46.581 --> 01:32:48.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for them in times of need,

01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:50.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so they sat down

01:32:50.961 --> 01:32:54.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reconsidered
their ability to generously give.

01:32:54.339 --> 01:32:58.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayerfully, they decided
on their contribution.

01:32:58.176 --> 01:33:00.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In line with our theme,

01:33:00.554 --> 01:33:03.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they “set something aside.”

01:33:03.598 --> 01:33:05.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they shared materially
with their brothers and sisters

01:33:08.728 --> 01:33:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—food items, and a nice meal.

01:33:11.481 --> 01:33:15.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They realized what a blessing it is
to be used by Jehovah

01:33:15.861 --> 01:33:17.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in caring for others.

01:33:19.573 --> 01:33:21.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we live in the most exciting time in history

01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:28.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with never-to-be-repeated opportunities
to demonstrate our faith.

01:33:29.916 --> 01:33:33.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul compared this
with ‘a large door

01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:35.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that opened up.’

01:33:35.213 --> 01:33:37.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, think for a moment.

01:33:37.632 --> 01:33:40.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has a door to activity opened for you

01:33:40.927 --> 01:33:43.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn a new language?

01:33:43.138 --> 01:33:45.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or does it look more like the door leads you

01:33:45.891 --> 01:33:48.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move to where the need is greater?

01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:52.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did this symposium remind you
of the door that is open

01:33:52.355 --> 01:33:56.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to receive training
at the School for Kingdom Evangelizers?

01:33:58.236 --> 01:34:00.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or did it direct you to the door

01:34:00.071 --> 01:34:04.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for assisting
with a theocratic building project?

01:34:04.493 --> 01:34:08.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe this concluding part
has reminded all of us 

01:34:08.205 --> 01:34:11.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our privilege of generously supporting
the Kingdom work

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:15.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making donations, even if they are small.

01:34:17.547 --> 01:34:20.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What door is open to you

01:34:20.759 --> 01:34:23.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you are able to expand your ministry?

01:34:23.678 --> 01:34:27.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t feel bad if you hesitate to enter
—this is normal.

01:34:27.474 --> 01:34:29.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, please,

01:34:29.601 --> 01:34:32.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not delay entering unnecessarily.

01:34:32.979 --> 01:34:36.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t think you can always reach out later.

01:34:36.024 --> 01:34:39.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For we all do not know
what our life will be like tomorrow.

01:34:39.236 --> 01:34:42.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
the door to wonderful blessings

01:34:42.447 --> 01:34:47.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is open today might be closed tomorrow.

01:34:47.285 --> 01:34:49.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be courageous,

01:34:49.371 --> 01:34:52.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter the door to activity in faith.

01:34:52.874 --> 01:34:55.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like many of your brothers and sisters

01:34:55.377 --> 01:34:57.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have already
made these steps in the past,

01:34:57.837 --> 01:35:00.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have no regrets.

01:35:00.131 --> 01:35:02.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us all demonstrate our faith

01:35:02.884 --> 01:35:07.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing all that we can
for our Friend and God, Jehovah,

01:35:07.347 --> 01:35:11.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will enjoy a rich life now,

01:35:11.393 --> 01:35:15.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:04.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third talk of this convention,
Brother Noumair asked:

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Have you experienced financial setback?

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Has your child faced peer pressure
[and, we could add, bullying] in school?

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a life-threatening disease?’

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like to continue that list:

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you face scorn from workmates?

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a personality issue with someone?

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do family members taunt you?

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we deal with various trials,

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might recall the words of Paul.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“The way I am aiming my blows

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so as not to be striking the air.”

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we counteract
the adversities of this system?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find 1 Samuel chapter 1.

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:55.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah had two adversities,

00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were like boom! boom!
—a one-two punch—

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
designed to drop her for the count.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is in verse 2 of chapter 1:

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:12.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Elkanah] had two wives;

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one was named Hannah,
and the other was named Peninnah.”

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s polygamy.

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Peninnah loathed, she hated, Hannah.

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was the second problem?

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It continues:
“Peninnah had children,

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Hannah had no children.”

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:31.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah was barren.

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that culture,

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was a bitter reproach for a woman.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was
devious, uncouth Peninnah really like?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 6:

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:49.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, her rival wife
taunted her relentlessly

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to upset her.”

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did this on purpose

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because Jehovah had not given her children.”

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at the end of verse 7:

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her rival would taunt her so much
that [Hannah] would weep and not eat.”

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you watch the following artwork,

00:02:07.147 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine Hannah’s distressing circumstance

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then how faith turned it all around.

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:20.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t sleep or eat.

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:24.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt my hopes and dreams slipping away.

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even if no one else really understood me,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Jehovah would.

00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:32.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him everything.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that the “God of justice”

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would set all matters right in his own time

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his own way.

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:48.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered my prayer
in such a wonderful way.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never forgot
where this incredible blessing had come from.

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:58.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no rock like our God.”

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the grief on Hannah’s face
in that first picture?

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the next piece of art,
she’s peaceful and tranquil,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she’s voicing her faith
in Jehovah, her Rock.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From despair to calmness of heart,

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did that happen?

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 10 and 11,

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she demonstrated faith in several ways.

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do the same as we face

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:31.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our own boom! boom!
—one-two punch—

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of trials and frustrations of life.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10:

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:39.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hannah was extremely bitter,

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she began to pray to Jehovah

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to weep uncontrollably.”

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:48.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was “extremely bitter,”

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she prayed.

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:55.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She cried “uncontrollably,”
but she prayed to Jehovah.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your agonizing circumstances,
no matter how agitated,

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find a quiet place (if only in your mind)

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:13.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how else did Hannah show her faith?

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:18.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in that very prayer,
she did ask Jehovah for a blessing.

00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she also promised
to give him something in return.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 11:

00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:27.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 “And she made this vow:

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:30.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Jehovah of armies,

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you look
upon the affliction of your servant

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:37.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and remember me
and you do not forget your servant

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:40.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and give to your servant a male child,

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will give him to Jehovah
all the days of his life,

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:47.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no razor will touch his head.’”

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:51.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, she was going to give her son

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a Nazirite from birth
to serve Jehovah all his days

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a sterling example of faith.

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:04.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what else
likely strengthened Hannah’s faith?

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:08.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Examples of faithful women
who came before her

00:05:08.662 --> 00:05:11.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with similar circumstances.

00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:16.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Rachel and her sister Leah?

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:18.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were both married to Jacob.

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:21.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Hannah, Rachel had no children.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were issues
between the two because of this.

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:28.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you see,
Hannah could look back on that example

00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how Jehovah helped
faithful Rachel to prosper.

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:35.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It bolstered her faith.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s another way
that Hannah showed faith?

00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, despite being distraught

00:05:42.237 --> 00:05:45.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so distraught that she “would weep”
and could “not eat”—

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she continued her spiritual routine.

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:53.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 7 says that she would go
to the tabernacle faithfully

00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:55.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“year after year.”

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:57.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 13 through 16,

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was misjudged by the high priest,

00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:04.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she continued her spiritual routine.

00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:07.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we said at the outset,

00:06:07.137 --> 00:06:11.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the punches that life throws at us
are different from Hannah’s,

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:16.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we too can have
the same strong faith that she did.

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:19.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:21.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though the trial is different,

00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:25.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how the sister
shows faith like that of Hannah.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:30.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to act like everything was fine

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:35.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I was fine,

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:43.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wasn’t.

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Praying to Jehovah,

00:07:55.912 --> 00:08:00.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just knowing he would listen and understand

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:04.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what got me through.

00:08:09.134 --> 00:08:12.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one really knew what I was going through,

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:15.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even my friends.

00:08:33.617 --> 00:08:35.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like Hannah

00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:38.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—totally misunderstood.

00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:44.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she had faith
that Jehovah would set matters straight.

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did for Hannah and for me.

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:57.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:01.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reminded me that I wouldn’t have to deal
with this illness alone.

00:09:06.942 --> 00:09:09.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister’s circumstances were different,

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:14.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she drew strength
from Hannah’s strong faith in Jehovah.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what the circumstances or trial,

00:09:17.494 --> 00:09:22.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can we imitate the example of that faith?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are many different ways,
but let’s review a few.

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:26.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:9

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:30.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan tries to beat us up
and knock us down,

00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:32.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re not alone.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are others
who experience the same trials

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 5:9:

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:46.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But take your stand against him,
firm in the faith,

00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:50.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that the same kind of sufferings
are being experienced

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:54.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the entire association
of your brothers in the world.”

00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect on Jehovah’s dealings
with other faithful ones,

00:09:57.534 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both in the past and in the present day.

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at 1 Samuel 1:12,
it says that Hannah

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“prayed for a long time before Jehovah.”

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:11.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can gain relief

00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:15.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through fervent, persistent,
and specific prayers.

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:19.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians chapter 4 says:
“Persevere in prayer.”

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:22.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray to Jehovah,

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:27.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leave it with him,
confident that he will help.

00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:30.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And recall
that “Hannah was extremely bitter.”

00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:33.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was crying “uncontrollably.”

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:36.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after she
poured her feelings out to Jehovah,

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:38.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 18 says:

00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:43.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[She] went on her way and ate,
and her face was no longer downcast.”

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:47.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after Jehovah acted in her behalf,

00:10:47.792 --> 00:10:51.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah remembered that
and she went back to Jehovah in prayer

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:56.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed the beautiful prayer
in 1 Samuel chapter 2.

00:10:57.552 --> 00:11:01.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, like Hannah, even if discouraged,

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:05.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to maintain a good spiritual routine.

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:10.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we allow distress to paralyze us,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in effect we become
a stationary punching bag for Satan.

00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:18.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay nimble on your feet spiritually

00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:21.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—active in your theocratic routine.

00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:25.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Paul, aim your blows;
do not strike the air.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fight back against Satan and his tactics.

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:32.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do all these things,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our bond with Jehovah will grow ever stronger

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah will reward our faith

00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:43.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like he did for Hannah.

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Brother Harold Corkern,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:51.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:56.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!
—The Captive Israelite Girl.”

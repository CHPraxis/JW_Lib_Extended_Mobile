00:00:05 I regularly visit my mother
00:00:07 to clean the house, to prepare meals,
00:00:10 and, well, to just spend some time with her.
00:00:13 A criminal case was initiated
00:00:15 against Vitaliy’s mother, Olga Opaleva,
00:00:18 on November 12, 2018.
00:00:22 On November 25, officers raided her apartment
00:00:25 and the homes of three other fellow believers.
00:00:28 She was 66 years old at the time.
00:00:33 They used a saw
00:00:36 to break through my door.
00:00:38 They asked me, “Why didn’t you open up?”
00:00:41 I couldn’t answer them because just the night before,
00:00:44 I had had a heart attack.
00:00:46 Neither Olga’s age nor her health condition
00:00:50 stopped the law enforcement officers’ cruel
00:00:53 and inhumane treatment.
00:00:56 One of the officers called the investigator.
00:01:00 They told him what happened
00:01:02 and that they had called an ambulance.
00:01:05 Anyway, the investigator said,
00:01:08 “Bring her in for interrogation.”
00:01:10 So they did.
00:01:12 Olga spent the next two days in a temporary detention facility.
00:01:16 After I had the heart attack,
00:01:18 I, of course, felt very ill.
00:01:20 They handcuffed me,
00:01:23 took me to court, and put me into that cage.
00:01:26 The court ordered Olga to be placed under house arrest.
00:01:32 She is accused of discussing
00:01:35 Bible topics with people,
00:01:36 and these kinds of conversations
00:01:38 are interpreted by the investigation as recruitment.
00:01:42 The prosecution doesn’t deny the fact that Olga Opaleva
00:01:46 has done no harm —no real harm to anyone.
00:01:50 On October 10, 2019,
00:01:53 Olga had to return to court.
00:01:55 When the Federal Penitentiary Service vehicle
00:01:57 arrived to take her to court, she suffered a stroke.
00:02:02 Olga was eventually taken by ambulance
00:02:04 to a local hospital and placed in intensive care.
00:02:08 According to her medical records,
00:02:10 when she was admitted to the hospital, she was in critical condition.
00:02:13 At the time of her stroke, she was under house arrest.
00:02:18 To say that I was worried when I saw her in that condition
00:02:21 would be putting it mildly.
00:02:23 When our eyes met, the first thing she did
00:02:27 was smile and then she cried.
00:02:30 A few days after Olga had the stroke,
00:02:33 her only son, Vitaliy Ilinykh,
00:02:36 was detained.
00:02:38 All of this litigation began with the criminal prosecution of my mother,
00:02:43 and now it has affected me.
00:02:45 The court imposed a restriction
00:02:47 in the form of a recognizance agreement on Vitaliy.
00:02:50 Now both mother and son
00:02:51 are named in criminal cases because of their faith.
00:02:55 As the investigator told me,
00:02:57 “If you remain one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:03:00 in essence, then you’re an ‘extremist.’”
00:03:03 The investigator refused to listen when I tried to explain the difference
00:03:07 between faith and a legal entity.
00:03:10 He said: “That doesn’t interest me at all.
00:03:14 “I’m just doing my job.
00:03:16 I’m told what to do, and I do it.”
00:03:19 It’s absurd to accuse people like Olga and Vitaliy
00:03:22 of activities of an “extremist” nature.
00:03:24 It is becoming standard practice among law enforcement agencies
00:03:28 to inflate the statistics of their so-called successful fight
00:03:32 against “extremism” by prosecuting peaceful religious believers.
00:03:35 Often when investigators have accused somebody,
00:03:38 they subsequently bring charges against their relatives.
00:03:41 Olga and Vitaliy do not intend to give up,
00:03:44 and the persecution has not caused their faith in God to waver.
00:03:48 It’s better to be in prison with God than to be free without God.

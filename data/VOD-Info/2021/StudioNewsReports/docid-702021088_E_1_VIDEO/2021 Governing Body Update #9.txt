00:00:01 Welcome, everyone!
00:00:03 In this update,
00:00:04 I thought we might reflect
00:00:06 on Jehovah’s goodness
00:00:08 and the way he’s been guiding his people during the pandemic.
00:00:12 I’m sure we all agree with the words of the psalmist
00:00:15 found at Psalm 27:13:
00:00:18 “Where would I be
00:00:21 “if I did not have faith
00:00:23 “that I would see Jehovah’s goodness
00:00:26 in the land of the living?”
00:00:29 “Where would I be?”
00:00:31 That’s something to think about, isn’t it?
00:00:33 How grateful we are to be associated with Jehovah’s organization
00:00:38 and to benefit from its direction and guidance,
00:00:42 especially when we see where we could be
00:00:45 —in the confused and divided world around us.
00:00:49 With your eyes of faith,
00:00:52 do you see Jehovah as directing his people today?
00:00:57 Now, we know he is interested in our spiritual well-being.
00:01:01 But what about our physical well-being —our health?
00:01:05 Does he care about that?
00:01:08 If he does, will he make sure that we get good advice
00:01:12 —even on health matters?
00:01:15 To answer that, let’s consider the promise Jehovah made
00:01:19 as found at Psalm 32:8.
00:01:23 This is one we know well, but let’s look at this from another perspective.
00:01:27 This is Psalm 32:8.
00:01:30 He says:
00:01:31 “I will give you insight
00:01:36 “and instruct you in the way you should go.
00:01:40 “I will give you advice
00:01:43 with my eye upon you.”
00:01:46 So here’s a promise that Jehovah will give us the advice we need.
00:01:51 But advice on what subject?
00:01:54 Think back to the days of Israel.
00:01:57 Was Jehovah interested in the health and safety of his people back then?
00:02:02 He certainly was.
00:02:04 He instructed the Israelites to quarantine the sick.
00:02:07 He told them not to eat unclean birds and animals
00:02:11 because doing so could have been harmful for their health.
00:02:14 And he insisted that they build a parapet around the flat roof of their homes
00:02:19 so no one would fall off.
00:02:21 He loved his people.
00:02:23 He wanted them to be safe.
00:02:26 Jehovah hasn’t changed.
00:02:29 He still cares about the health  and safety of his people.
00:02:33 Now, in the psalm we just read,
00:02:35 he promised to give us insight,
00:02:37 instruction, and advice.
00:02:41 How does he do that today?
00:02:44 He does it by means of his organization.
00:02:49 In some countries, there’s been considerable confusion and disagreement
00:02:54 over how to deal with the pandemic.
00:02:57 Some chafe at the idea of wearing masks,
00:03:00 and they refuse to practice physical distancing,
00:03:03 even when these precautions are required.
00:03:06 We’re reminded of Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 14:33.
00:03:11 Remember that one?
00:03:13 “God is a God not of disorder but of peace,” the Bible says.
00:03:18 The disorder we see in the world
00:03:21 is proof positive that Jehovah is not with them.
00:03:25 But from Jehovah’s organization,
00:03:27 we’ve had clear direction from the very beginning.
00:03:30 And we thank Jehovah for it.
00:03:34 For example, think of the information we’ve received
00:03:37 through recent Governing Body updates.
00:03:40 This is evidence of Jehovah’s loving direction—his goodness.
00:03:45 In last month’s update, Brother Lett made a very important point.
00:03:50 He reminded us that the information we’re receiving regarding the pandemic
00:03:54 is prepared by faithful brothers.
00:03:57 We can trust them.
00:03:59 They aren’t motivated by some personal view or political agenda.
00:04:04 They love us.
00:04:06 They want the best for us.
00:04:09 I hear someone ask, ‘What do they know?’
00:04:13 Wrong question.
00:04:15 I think the right question is, What does Jehovah know?
00:04:20 It comes down to this, friends:
00:04:22 Do I really believe
00:04:24 that Jehovah is directing this organization today?
00:04:28 Do I believe that Jehovah will give insight to his faithful people
00:04:33 so they can remain “in the land of the living,” as the psalmist said?
00:04:38 To repeat the question we often raise in field service,
00:04:41 Does God really care?
00:04:45 Would Jehovah allow the Governing Body, the helpers, missionaries,
00:04:50 a huge percentage of the worldwide Bethel family,
00:04:53 and other full-time servants to engage in practices
00:04:57 or receive a COVID-19 vaccine that would be harmful?
00:05:01 Surely Jehovah wants the brothers at world headquarters
00:05:05 to continue providing spiritual food.
00:05:08 He wants to make sure that the work continues
00:05:10 at our branch offices and in the field.
00:05:13 To do that, we have to be “in the land of the living.”
00:05:19 Now, what about the prophecy that ‘a great crowd
00:05:22 which no man can number’ will come out of the great tribulation?
00:05:26 Our God is definitely not like Pharaoh, who wanted to kill off
00:05:30 an entire generation of Jehovah’s worshippers.
00:05:33 We are convinced
00:05:35 that Jehovah cares about the health and safety of his people
00:05:40 and that he will guide us, saying, in effect:
00:05:44 “This is the way.
00:05:46 Walk in it,” you people.
00:05:49 When we embark on a certain course,
00:05:52 we always look for evidence of Jehovah’s blessing
00:05:55 to see whether we’re on the right track or not.
00:05:58 So has Jehovah blessed our efforts during this pandemic?
00:06:04 Yes, indeed.
00:06:07 Well, of course, the pandemic has slowed activities for many of our brothers,
00:06:11 especially in areas without good Internet connections.
00:06:14 Think of everything you’ve accomplished in recent months.
00:06:18 Many congregations are reporting record attendances
00:06:21 at our virtual congregation meetings.
00:06:23 Inactive ones are returning to Jehovah, and how we thank God for that!
00:06:28 Our Memorial attendance for 2021
00:06:31 reached an all-time peak
00:06:34 of 21,367,603.
00:06:41 And many branches have reported new all-time peaks
00:06:44 in the number of publishers.
00:06:46 But that’s not all.
00:06:48 You’ve shown exemplary concern and brotherly affection for one another,
00:06:53 proving that you truly are Christ’s disciples.
00:06:58 We commend you most warmly.
00:07:02 Who can deny that Jehovah is blessing your work?
00:07:07 And consider what the Bethel family has been able to accomplish
00:07:11 during the pandemic, only with Jehovah’s blessing.
00:07:15 We all appreciate our beautiful new publication, Enjoy Life Forever!
00:07:20 That was a tremendous amount of work
00:07:22 involving hundreds of hours of overtime.
00:07:26 But that’s not all that was accomplished during the pandemic.
00:07:29 What about the monthly broadcasts?
00:07:31 We never missed one.
00:07:34 Then there are the beautiful videos, our regional conventions,
00:07:39 the Gilead graduations, and the annual meetings.
00:07:42 All of this was possible
00:07:44 because the Bethel family stayed healthy.
00:07:50 Many brothers and sisters have written to express appreciation
00:07:54 for knowing what precautions we’re taking at world headquarters.
00:07:57 Why?
00:07:59 Simple.
00:08:01 Can you think of another group in Jehovah’s organization
00:08:04 that would be more at risk of infection than the Bethel family?
00:08:08 Hundreds of us live together, work together, eat together,
00:08:12 share the same surfaces day in and day out.
00:08:16 So, many brothers and sisters have concluded
00:08:18 that what works for the Bethel family is likely to work for them.
00:08:24 And now we’re moving into another phase of the pandemic.
00:08:29 Wasn’t it exciting to see
00:08:31 the recent JW News article
00:08:32 about the pilot program
00:08:34 to resume in-person congregation meetings
00:08:36 in selected lands?
00:08:38 It’s been a long time since we’ve been able to be together in person.
00:08:44 You might be wondering what led up to the pilot program.
00:08:48 Governing Body committees have been prayerfully evaluating when
00:08:52 and how to resume in-person meetings safely.
00:08:56 Earlier this year, it didn’t seem to be the right time to start.
00:09:01 Vaccines weren’t available in many lands, infection rates were high,
00:09:06 and the Delta variant was rapidly spreading.
00:09:10 But in September,
00:09:13 the situation started to appear more hopeful,
00:09:15 at least in some areas of the world.
00:09:19 In October,
00:09:21 17 branches were approved to participate in a pilot program
00:09:25 to resume in-person congregation meetings.
00:09:29 These branches represent a variety of circumstances and continents:
00:09:34 Africa, Asia, Australia,
00:09:37 Europe, North and South America.
00:09:40 Now, the Branch Committees in all these countries
00:09:42 need to consider carefully what the local government regulations are
00:09:46 for such indoor gatherings as our congregation meetings.
00:09:51 The regulations vary from country to country.
00:09:56 You might be wondering, does this mean that Zoom is going away?
00:10:02 We’re pleased to inform you that approval has been given
00:10:06 for congregations in the pilot program
00:10:08 to have the option of holding hybrid meetings,
00:10:12 where some attend in person at the Kingdom Hall
00:10:14 while others are tied in via Zoom.
00:10:18 As of November 8,
00:10:20 14 branches have already held their first meetings.
00:10:23 As you can imagine,
00:10:25 our brothers and sisters were overjoyed to meet together again.
00:10:29 Let’s hear from a few of them.
00:10:33 When it was announced
00:10:34 at the midweek meeting
00:10:35 that our congregation had been invited to hold
00:10:38 in-person meetings as part of a project,
00:10:40 I was so happy that I
00:10:42 jumped out of my chair for joy.
00:10:43 It was a tremendous emotion!
00:10:47 I couldn’t believe it,
00:10:49 that it was actually happening.
00:10:50 All of a sudden out of nowhere —we’re coming back!
00:10:52 And we walk in the hall and you’re like,
00:10:54 “These are all my brothers and sisters,
00:10:56 and we’re all together.”
00:10:57 You just felt like you were at home.
00:11:04 Being back at the meetings,
00:11:06 I feel like the fire is burning
00:11:08 in my heart because of happiness.
00:11:15 It really felt good.
00:11:17 It was lovely to see
00:11:19 the brothers and sisters coming into
00:11:20 the entranceway, and to greet them
00:11:22 was so great.
00:11:24 I wanted to go
00:11:26 and give somebody a very big hug.
00:11:28 But since I couldn’t,
00:11:30 I would go to Mom and Dad
00:11:32 and hug them and say, “This is for this person.”
00:11:43 Being able to be at the Kingdom Hall, I had to pinch myself
00:11:47 to make sure I was not dreaming.
00:11:51 On the way there,
00:11:52 we were really excited.
00:11:53 And when we finally went inside,
00:11:55 seeing the friends, hugging them
00:11:58 —it was really an indescribable feeling.
00:12:05 If you’d like to take your seats, we will get our meeting underway.
00:12:08 To hear the singing, even with the masks on,
00:12:10 was really encouraging.
00:12:18 I love the singing.
00:12:20 I think everyone got better  over the 18 months.
00:12:22 We all got to practice.
00:12:23 It was beautiful!
00:12:50 It felt like going home to my family.
00:12:55 Being able to sing together
00:12:57 with brothers and sisters in person,
00:13:00 being able to stretch my hand again
00:13:04 —all in our congregation were delighted to be part of it.
00:13:11 Being at home is more comfortable.
00:13:13 But you can be
00:13:14 distracted by any little thing.
00:13:17 But being here is much better
00:13:19 because we pay more attention to the meetings.
00:13:35 I was baptized in 2020 during the regional convention.
00:13:39 It’s now over a year since I got baptized,
00:13:43 but this is my first time at the Kingdom Hall as a baptized brother.
00:13:48 Since it is my first time at the hall
00:13:50 at a meeting in person,
00:13:51 I felt so happy and also nervous
00:13:55 because I had to meet the brothers and sisters in person.
00:13:59 I knew some of the older ones were a little bit apprehensive
00:14:02 about coming to the meetings,
00:14:04 but there they were at the meeting, loyally attending.
00:14:08 And that actually was a very encouraging experience.
00:14:18 Going back to the Kingdom Hall
00:14:20 and seeing my brothers and sisters
00:14:22 was something so beautiful.
00:14:25 Hearing their voices live and no longer from a computer
00:14:30 and seeing their eyes sparkling with joy, shiny with emotion,
00:14:34 made me feel an extraordinary emotion inside the heart.
00:14:40 Jehovah has been taking good care of us through the Governing Body,
00:14:44 and now that we got the chance to experience this,
00:14:46 we’re very thankful for the opportunity
00:14:49 to serve Jehovah, to meet together.
00:14:51 It’s been very, very nice.
00:14:54 Meeting together with brothers and sisters is what Jehovah God wants.
00:15:01 Jehovah created us for that—to be together,
00:15:04 to live in unity.
00:15:08 It was an upbuilding experience.
00:15:10 It was beautiful
00:15:12 because it strengthened the spirit of belonging
00:15:14 that we find only in Jehovah’s people.
00:15:20 And that’s why I can only say, “Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jehovah!”
00:15:31 Well, that was exciting, wasn’t it?
00:15:34 If you’re like me, I’m sure we’re all anxious
00:15:38 to get back to these in-person meetings.
00:15:41 And based on the results of this pilot program,
00:15:44 we hope that additional congregations can be approved
00:15:46 to resume in-person meetings in the months ahead.
00:15:49 In the meantime,
00:15:51 we can continue to pray for Jehovah’s guidance
00:15:55 and blessing on these arrangements.
00:15:58 So, dear friends,
00:16:01 let’s keep focusing our eyes on “the One who is invisible,”
00:16:05 trusting that our God loves us
00:16:08 and that he will never allow his people to come to harm.
00:16:12 May Jehovah continue to bless you all richly!

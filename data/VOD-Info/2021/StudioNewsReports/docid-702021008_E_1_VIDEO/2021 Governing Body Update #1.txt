00:00:01 Hello, everyone.
00:00:03 For this update, I’d like to talk
00:00:06 about what you dear brothers and sisters
00:00:08 have accomplished during the past few months.
00:00:11 Jehovah must be very proud of you
00:00:14 —your obedience, your zeal!
00:00:17 In spite of all the obstacles, you haven’t let up in your service.
00:00:22 On the contrary, we’re receiving reports from one country after another
00:00:27 of peaks in the number of publishers,
00:00:29 placements, regular pioneers,
00:00:32 Bible studies, and meeting attendance.
00:00:35 Well done, faithful servants of Jehovah!
00:00:39 Of course, all of us are anxious to get back in the door-to-door work
00:00:43 and doing public witnessing.
00:00:46 And if we’re limited to doing letter writing and telephone witnessing,
00:00:50 we might feel that we aren’t accomplishing much.
00:00:53 If that’s the way you feel, remember what we’re told
00:00:56 at Revelation 14:6.
00:01:00 I’d like you to follow along as I read this.
00:01:04 It says: “And I saw another angel
00:01:08 “flying in midheaven,
00:01:10 “and he had everlasting good news to declare
00:01:13 “to those who dwell on the earth,
00:01:15 “to every nation and tribe
00:01:18 and tongue and people.”
00:01:22 So an angel or a group of angels
00:01:24 are supervising the preaching work.
00:01:27 Now, just think: Because of our limitations,
00:01:31 the angels may be busier than ever,
00:01:34 making sure that the Kingdom message reaches the right people.
00:01:38 Otherwise, how would you explain the increases we are seeing?
00:01:42 You write a letter, and send it out.
00:01:45 The recipient reads it, but isn’t interested.
00:01:49 What have you accomplished?
00:01:51 You’ve given a witness,
00:01:53 maybe the most thorough witness that person has ever received.
00:01:58 Some people are never home when we call,
00:02:01 or they never answer the door,
00:02:03 so they have no idea what we believe
00:02:06 —until—
00:02:08 until they receive that letter.
00:02:12 But suppose someone else in the household would be interested.
00:02:16 The angels might see to it that that person reads the letter.
00:02:20 You’ve given the angels something to work with!
00:02:24 Or you dial the wrong number
00:02:29 that turns out to be the right number.
00:02:34 Were the angels involved in any of the following experiences?
00:02:38 You be the judge.
00:02:41 A sister in South America was doing telephone witnessing,
00:02:44 and she wasn’t having much success,
00:02:46 but she didn’t give up.
00:02:48 She called another number, and a man answered the phone.
00:02:53 The sister explained that she was calling to encourage her neighbors
00:02:56 who were suffering because of the pandemic.
00:02:59 And she read Jeremiah 29:11,
00:03:01 which says that Jehovah is offering us
00:03:04 “a future and a hope.”
00:03:07 Then the man said:
00:03:09 “This phone call was no coincidence
00:03:13 —it was from God.”
00:03:16 He explained that the sister had called a radio station
00:03:19 and that she was on the air.
00:03:21 A lot of people were listening to her at that very moment.
00:03:24 They had just been talking about the pandemic.
00:03:28 The sister quickly prayed for strength
00:03:31 and then shared a number of encouraging scriptures
00:03:34 with the radio audience.
00:03:36 She also told them about our website.
00:03:39 The host took note of the scriptures
00:03:41 and enthusiastically encouraged his listeners
00:03:44 to visit the website.
00:03:46 What a witness!
00:03:48 Now, ask yourself, ‘Would the sister have dialed that number
00:03:52 if she had known she’d be talking to a radio audience?’
00:03:57 Another sister in the United States was ordering a dress over the phone.
00:04:02 And she had prayed to Jehovah for the courage
00:04:04 to give a witness when the transaction was completed.
00:04:08 She followed through on her prayer.
00:04:10 First, she commended the customer service agent for her kindness
00:04:14 and then asked if she could read a scripture from the Bible.
00:04:18 The young lady agreed.
00:04:20 It turns out that she had studied the Bible years earlier,
00:04:24 but she had stopped because she had a lot going on in her life.
00:04:28 A study was started in the Teach Us  book,
00:04:31 and the young lady attended the Zoom  meeting the very next Sunday.
00:04:37 What about this one: A brother in Japan
00:04:41 wrote to 100 of his former schoolmates.
00:04:45 Now in their 30’s, many of them were facing problems in the workplace
00:04:48 and had concerns about how to raise their children properly.
00:04:53 When a talk on family life was given in the congregation,
00:04:56 29 of his former classmates attended.
00:05:00 Now he’s studying with 18 of them.
00:05:06 A sister in Brazil called a woman on the phone.
00:05:10 It turns out that the phone rang just as the woman was about to take her life.
00:05:14 She had a lot of problems, but that call convinced her
00:05:18 that God is interested in her.
00:05:20 She accepted a study and is making great progress.
00:05:26 Another sister living on an island under the France branch
00:05:29 had an appointment with a doctor.
00:05:32 After talking about her own health problems for a while,
00:05:35 she asked the doctor how he was doing.
00:05:37 He was surprised.
00:05:39 He said his patients rarely showed personal interest in him.
00:05:44 This opened the way for the sister to give a witness.
00:05:48 It turns out that the doctor never answered the door when the Witnesses called.
00:05:53 At the end of the conversation,
00:05:55 the doctor said that for the next appointment,
00:05:57 he’d schedule the sister at the end of the day
00:05:59 so that they could continue their discussion.
00:06:02 An 80-year-old sister lives in a rural area in France.
00:06:07 She called a woman living in an isolated village
00:06:10 and talked about the model prayer.
00:06:12 That turned out to be just the right subject.
00:06:16 The woman said that she had been raised by nuns
00:06:19 but had never understood the model prayer.
00:06:22 A Bible study is being conducted each week,
00:06:24 and the woman is attending our Zoom  meetings.
00:06:29 Now, what does each of these experiences have in common?
00:06:33 Someone wrote a letter, dialed the phone, or spoke up.
00:06:38 The brothers and sisters did what they could
00:06:41 and gave the angels something to work with.
00:06:44 So put the angels to work.
00:06:47 Take advantage of opportunities to witness to schoolmates,
00:06:50 medical personnel, deliverymen, shopkeepers.
00:06:54 A simple way to start any conversation is to say,
00:06:57 “I’d like to tell you about a website
00:06:59 where millions have found encouraging information.”
00:07:03 Speaking of our website, a real effort is being made
00:07:06 to provide up-to-date information on jw.org.
00:07:11 Let’s listen as Brother Herman van Selm,
00:07:14 a helper to the Writing Committee, tells us about it.
00:07:19 Something remarkable happened
00:07:21 in January of last year.
00:07:24 What was it?
00:07:25 The Writing Committee
00:07:27 together with the Coordinators’ Committee
00:07:29 decided that the home page of our website
00:07:32 should feature articles that are relevant to current events,
00:07:37 grab the viewers’ attention,
00:07:39 and provide the Bible’s explanation and advice.
00:07:43 Now, how did that decision made in January
00:07:48 prove to be timely?
00:07:50 Well, just a few months later, the pandemic began.
00:07:54 So the Writing Department immediately began to develop articles
00:07:59 that would address key questions or issues on the minds of people.
00:08:04 However, the challenge was
00:08:06 that normally preparing one issue of Awake!  or Watchtower
00:08:10 can take more than 18 months.
00:08:13 So we had to find a way to prepare articles for the home page
00:08:17 in a much shorter time.
00:08:20 Gladly, with Jehovah’s help
00:08:23 and with the help of the brothers and sisters in various departments,
00:08:27 the total time for preparing and publishing
00:08:30 one new article for the home page
00:08:32 has been reduced to five weeks.
00:08:36 We are grateful that a good number of home page articles
00:08:40 already have been published on topics related to the pandemic.
00:08:44 Which of these six articles do you think
00:08:47 received the most visitors on our home page?
00:08:51 The number one article was
00:08:54 “What Does the Bible Say About Pandemics?”
00:08:59 Now, what does that show?
00:09:02 People want to know how current events are related to the Bible.
00:09:06 And our website explains in clear language
00:09:10 how world conditions are fulfilling Bible prophecy.
00:09:14 That makes the information on our website
00:09:17 different from what people may find elsewhere.
00:09:22 Brothers and sisters around the world
00:09:24 also find the articles helpful.
00:09:28 To give one example,
00:09:30 a couple with teenage children wrote:
00:09:33 “Just when we as parents feel at a loss
00:09:37 “about how to deal with the pandemic,
00:09:39 “isolation, stress, and social unrest,
00:09:43 “an article appears that gives clear Scriptural guidance
00:09:47 “on how to handle what we are dealing with.
00:09:51 “We appreciate so much
00:09:53 “how quickly the faithful slave provides us
00:09:57 with exactly what we need.”
00:10:01 Now, many have expressed how the home page articles
00:10:04 help them in their ministry.
00:10:07 Here are some of their comments:
00:10:10 From Spain: “They are eye-catching.
00:10:14 The language is simple but powerful.”
00:10:19 Benin: “Publishers are impressed
00:10:22 “with how in tune the articles are
00:10:25 with current events.”
00:10:27 Netherlands: “They are helping publishers
00:10:31 “to stay enthusiastic in the ministry
00:10:34 during the pandemic.”
00:10:36 Scandinavia: “Publishers check the home page
00:10:40 before starting phone witnessing.”
00:10:43 Britain: “It’s exactly the right thing
00:10:47 for our current form of ministry.”
00:10:52 These recent developments with the home page
00:10:56 are a faith-strengthening example
00:10:58 of how the faithful and discreet slave
00:11:01 is providing wholesome spiritual food
00:11:05 at the proper time.
00:11:09 In closing, we would like to commend all of you once again
00:11:13 for your resourcefulness and zeal during this pandemic.
00:11:18 Keep up the good work, brothers and sisters,
00:11:20 and may Jehovah bless you richly!
00:11:24 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

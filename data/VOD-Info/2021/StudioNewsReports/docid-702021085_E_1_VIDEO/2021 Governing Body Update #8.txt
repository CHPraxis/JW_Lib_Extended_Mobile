00:00:01 Dear brothers, sisters,
00:00:04 faithful children, and interested ones,
00:00:08 it is a great pleasure  to be with you for this update.
00:00:13 We have many good things to share with you,
00:00:15 including an update
00:00:18 on our response  to several major natural disasters.
00:00:22 And at the end of this update,
00:00:24 it will be a privilege to share with you
00:00:28 our reassuring yeartext for 2022.
00:00:34 To begin, though,
00:00:36 I have some important facts
00:00:38 about COVID-19 vaccines to share with you.
00:00:43 Because we love you all very much
00:00:47 and because this is a life-and-death matter,
00:00:50 we have decided to share what we know about this with you.
00:00:56 Since June 1 in the United States,
00:01:00 1,407 publishers
00:01:03 have been hospitalized
00:01:06 because of COVID-19 or its symptoms.
00:01:10 Of these, less than 1 percent were fully vaccinated.
00:01:16 Sadly, in that same time period in the United States,
00:01:21 486 of our brothers
00:01:25 died from COVID-19.
00:01:29 Of these, less than 1 percent
00:01:33 were fully vaccinated.
00:01:35 And our understanding is
00:01:37 that the vaccinated individuals who died
00:01:41 had serious underlying health problems.
00:01:45 These statistics are very sobering.
00:01:51 We can also tell you
00:01:53 that of more than 22,000 Bethelites
00:01:56 and 44,000 special full-time servants in the field
00:02:00 who have been vaccinated,
00:02:02 we have received only four reports
00:02:07 of severe adverse reactions
00:02:10 that may be linked to the vaccination.
00:02:13 But thankfully it’s been reported
00:02:16 that all of these are stable,
00:02:19 and their condition is under control.
00:02:23 We share this information with you
00:02:26 so you can carefully consider it
00:02:29 when making your personal decision regarding vaccination.
00:02:34 We feel it would not be loving
00:02:37 to withhold these facts from you.
00:02:42 As Proverbs 3:27 says:
00:02:45 “Do not withhold good
00:02:48 from those to whom you should give it.”
00:02:53 We know it can be difficult to make a wise decision
00:02:58 when there are various opinions and conflicting reports
00:03:03 that the world provides,
00:03:05 perhaps making it hard to know what to believe.
00:03:10 But the aforementioned statistics
00:03:13 have been collected by our brothers,
00:03:17 so we can trust these figures.
00:03:21 We hope they will be useful to you.
00:03:25 We appreciate that this is not a scientific study,
00:03:29 but we can tell you  what our brothers have observed.
00:03:34 And because we have this information,
00:03:37 we want you to know what we know.
00:03:42 Of course, we also need to consider
00:03:45 the direction provided  by the superior authorities.
00:03:49 In some lands,
00:03:51 governments are enacting laws  that all of their citizens
00:03:55 must be vaccinated.
00:03:58 In other lands,  it is strongly encouraged.
00:04:02 How do we react to such direction?
00:04:05 The Remain in God’s Love  book
00:04:08 made a fine point when it said this:
00:04:12 “Today, Jehovah allows governments
00:04:17 “to have some authority,
00:04:19 “and we should respect them.
00:04:21 “They organize countries and communities
00:04:24 “so that they function smoothly
00:04:27 “and provide people with necessary services.
00:04:30 “Christians obey the instruction found
00:04:33 “at Romans 13:1-7.
00:04:37 “We respect ‘the superior authorities’
00:04:40 “and obey the laws of the country
00:04:43 “or community where we live.
00:04:46 “These laws may affect our family,
00:04:48 business, or possessions.”
00:04:52 Also, the study note
00:04:54 on Romans 13:5 says this:
00:04:58 “A Christian submits to human governments
00:05:01 when a command does not contradict God’s laws.”
00:05:07 So this is another serious factor
00:05:10 that we each should carefully  and prayerfully consider
00:05:13 in making our decision.
00:05:17 As a result of having over 99 percent
00:05:20 of the United States Bethel family  fully vaccinated,
00:05:24 we have been able to open up more activities within Bethel
00:05:28 in accord with New York State regulations.
00:05:32 This allowed the Bethel family
00:05:35 to have the Gilead meal together
00:05:37 and then the Gilead graduation on September 11.
00:05:44 No guests from outside Bethel were present for either occasion.
00:05:52 Also, fully vaccinated Bethel family members in the United States
00:05:57 have received permission to take personal time
00:06:01 to visit family and friends,
00:06:04 taking proper COVID-19 precautions while away from Bethel.
00:06:10 In fact, as of September 24,
00:06:14 over 3,975
00:06:18 fully vaccinated Bethel family members
00:06:20 in the United States have traveled
00:06:23 during August and September.
00:06:27 Upon their return to Bethel,
00:06:29 they are put on a form of adjusted quarantine
00:06:33 and a few days later are tested for COVID-19.
00:06:38 Of these 3,975,
00:06:41 we have had just four COVID cases.
00:06:45 Two got mild cases of COVID at their destination,
00:06:50 and it resolved before they returned to Bethel.
00:06:54 The other two who tested positive on return
00:06:59 also had minor symptoms that quickly resolved.
00:07:05 All four have fully recovered.
00:07:10 We’re happy to report
00:07:12 that this arrangement will soon go into effect for our Bethelites
00:07:16 at most branches around the world.
00:07:19 We are able to do this at branches where more than 90 percent
00:07:23 of the Bethel family are fully vaccinated.
00:07:28 Those branches are getting back into
00:07:30 a more normal routine.
00:07:41 But now we have a brief update
00:07:44 about how our brothers are doing
00:07:46 after recent natural disasters in Haiti
00:07:50 and in the United States.
00:07:53 As reported in JW News,
00:07:56 a magnitude 7.2 earthquake
00:07:59 struck Haiti
00:08:01 on Saturday, August 14.
00:08:05 Sadly, three Witnesses died
00:08:09 as a result.
00:08:11 Our hearts go out to the families of these ones.
00:08:17 The branch office  recently provided this report
00:08:20 on the relief efforts.
00:08:24 The earthquake destroyed approximately 130 of the homes
00:08:27 where our brothers were living
00:08:31 and damaged another 250.
00:08:35 On Monday, August 16 (two days after the earthquake),
00:08:39 tarps arrived for many of our brothers
00:08:43 just ahead of the rains of Tropical Storm Grace.
00:08:47 Since then,
00:08:49 we have distributed over 3 tons of supplies
00:08:53 and 28 tons of food to our brothers.
00:08:56 Tents, tarps, blankets,
00:08:59 mattresses, water filtration kits,
00:09:02 solar-powered flashlights,  and solar chargers have been distributed.
00:09:06 Additionally, volunteers are working hard
00:09:09 to evaluate and inspect the homes of our brothers.
00:09:14 Although in difficult economic situations themselves,
00:09:18 the local brothers in the capital of Port-au-Prince
00:09:22 have generously donated
00:09:25 tons of food.
00:09:30 The United States experienced Hurricane Ida,
00:09:33 which made landfall
00:09:34 as a Category 4 hurricane
00:09:38 on August 29.
00:09:40 The storm passed from the Gulf Coast
00:09:42 to the northeast.
00:09:44 The branch office  reports that as of September 20,
00:09:48 2,788 of our brothers
00:09:52 who evacuated are not yet able to return
00:09:56 to their homes.
00:09:58 It is estimated to be several weeks
00:10:01 before the power is restored in some areas.
00:10:05 The storm damaged over 1,800 homes of our brothers
00:10:10 and destroyed 28 more.
00:10:13 In addition, 58 Kingdom Halls
00:10:17 and 4 Assembly Halls were damaged.
00:10:21 Under the direction of the circuit overseers,
00:10:24 local brothers and sisters quickly began to stabilize
00:10:28 hundreds of homes damaged by the storm.
00:10:33 Two Disaster Relief Committees are providing tarps,
00:10:36 materials, food,
00:10:38 water, and generators
00:10:41 when local supplies are exhausted.
00:10:44 All of this activity is being carried out
00:10:46 with proper safety standards
00:10:49 and appropriate COVID-19 precautions.
00:10:54 We are grateful
00:10:56 for the hard work of all who are helping with the relief efforts,
00:11:01 including all of you who have contributed financially.
00:11:06 Thank you
00:11:08 for your generosity and kindness.
00:11:13 But now let’s discuss our 2022 yeartext.
00:11:19 When the pandemic began,
00:11:22 we had no idea it would still be of concern
00:11:26 one and a half years later.
00:11:30 It has impacted the economy of many lands.
00:11:34 As a result, people, including many of our brothers and sisters,
00:11:39 do not have much materially.
00:11:42 Some only have meager provisions,
00:11:45 including a scarcity of food.
00:11:50 It reminds us of faithful David of old.
00:11:54 He was not being hounded by a deadly virus.
00:11:58 But he was running and trying to hide from jealous King Saul,
00:12:03 who was intent on killing David and those with him.
00:12:07 Provisions were low,
00:12:10 there was very little to eat,
00:12:12 and David lost his home for a time,
00:12:15 hiding out in caves in the wilderness.
00:12:19 While things were very bleak materially,
00:12:23 it was at this time
00:12:25 that David composed the beautiful song
00:12:28 recorded in Psalm 34.
00:12:32 Was he distracted from his worship of Jehovah?
00:12:36 Was he gloomy and dejected during that difficult time?
00:12:41 Well, let’s read a few verses from Psalm 34
00:12:45 and see how David was (regarding his attitude)
00:12:50 —Psalm 34:1.
00:12:54 “I will praise Jehovah at all times;
00:12:59 his praise will be on my lips constantly.”
00:13:04 And then in verse 3,
00:13:07 he encouraged others to join him
00:13:10 in praising Jehovah.
00:13:12 In verse 3, David said:
00:13:14 “Magnify Jehovah along with me;
00:13:19 let us exalt his name together.”
00:13:23 What a beautiful attitude
00:13:26 despite the hardships he was facing at the time!
00:13:32 So many of you dear brothers and sisters are struggling economically
00:13:37 during this time of pandemic and uncertainty.
00:13:42 But the Governing Body  wanted me to share with you
00:13:45 especially verse 10 of Psalm 34
00:13:49 —verse 10.
00:13:51 “Even strong young lions
00:13:54 “have been reduced to hunger,
00:13:57 “but those seeking Jehovah
00:14:00 will lack nothing good.”
00:14:04 The last part of that verse is the yeartext for 2022.
00:14:09 “Those seeking Jehovah
00:14:12 will lack nothing good”—Psalm 34:10.
00:14:17 Now, obviously, as we’ve been discussing,
00:14:20 David was not referring
00:14:23 to an abundance of physical sustenance.
00:14:27 We remember the 23rd Psalm,
00:14:29 where David said something similar.
00:14:32 There he said: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.
00:14:37 I will lack nothing.”
00:14:40 The rest of that Psalm refers to spiritual blessings enjoyed,
00:14:44 even though he admitted he walked
00:14:48 “in the valley of deep shadow.”
00:14:52 Throughout that Psalm,
00:14:54 he extols the spiritual blessings he enjoyed.
00:14:58 He concluded by saying at Psalm 23:6:
00:15:01 “And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah
00:15:05 for all my days.”
00:15:08 And that is the prayer
00:15:10 of all of Jehovah’s faithful servants
00:15:13 in these critical times.
00:15:16 Dear friends,
00:15:18 the coronavirus is not the worst trial to strike out at all mankind,
00:15:23 and it won’t be the last.
00:15:26 We can expect things to deteriorate even further
00:15:30 as these last days
00:15:33 march on to their end.
00:15:37 Economic hardship and other trials
00:15:40 will come and go.
00:15:43 But like the psalmist,
00:15:45 we can agree that the 2022 yeartext
00:15:49 will prove true!
00:15:52 Spiritually speaking,
00:15:54 as Psalm 34:10 states:
00:15:57 “Those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.”
00:16:04 Dear brothers and sisters,
00:16:07 we truly and deeply
00:16:10 love you all very much!
00:16:15 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:01 Greetings, brothers and sisters!
00:00:03 And welcome to this update
00:00:05 on the global COVID-19 pandemic.
00:00:09 On behalf of the Governing Body,
00:00:11 I want to tell you how encouraged we are
00:00:14 when we hear about your endurance through these difficult times.
00:00:18 In this update, I’d like to speak to you parents
00:00:23 who are raising children.
00:00:25 Although all of us have had to stay vigilant
00:00:27 to protect ourselves and others,
00:00:29 you dear parents have carried a particularly heavy load.
00:00:34 We can only imagine the deep concern you’ve had
00:00:38 for your young children and teens during the pandemic.
00:00:41 You worry about their physical safety
00:00:45 and their education.
00:00:47 You’ve also been concerned
00:00:48 about the emotional impact of physical distancing
00:00:52 for many months from other children,
00:00:54 grandparents, relatives, and the congregation.
00:00:58 And you’ve handled all of this
00:01:01 while you work to provide for them
00:01:03 and keep up your family’s spiritual routine.
00:01:07 That’s a lot on your shoulders.
00:01:10 Remember that the prophecy
00:01:13 in 2 Timothy chapter 3 tells us
00:01:15 tells us that “in the last days”
00:01:18 there would be “critical times hard to deal with.”
00:01:22 So the fact that Satan is attacking the family unit
00:01:26 is no surprise to you parents.
00:01:28 The surprise, however, may be
00:01:31 when the attack takes an unexpected form
00:01:34 or perhaps feels like many attacks coming all at once.
00:01:39 That’s what the pandemic has been for many of you.
00:01:43 Now I’m going to say something that you already know:
00:01:48 Jehovah God and Jesus know how you feel.
00:01:53 Their own example leaves no doubt.
00:01:56 For instance, there were times when Jehovah stepped in to protect his Son
00:02:01 when he was on the earth.
00:02:03 He first carefully entrusted Jesus
00:02:06 to the care of loving parents.
00:02:08 And when Herod wanted to kill Jesus as a child,
00:02:11 Jehovah told Joseph and Mary to “flee to Egypt”
00:02:15 until the threat passed.
00:02:17 You could say it was like an extended “lockdown”
00:02:21 that kept them away from family and friends for some time.
00:02:25 Jesus experienced what it’s really like
00:02:29 to grow up as a child in a wicked world.
00:02:32 He knows the pressures and the dangers.
00:02:36 It’s no wonder
00:02:38 that he took a special interest in children during his ministry,
00:02:41 and today he shares your deep concern for your children.
00:02:48 But you Christian parents have other good examples to look to.
00:02:53 It’s the example of our brothers and sisters
00:02:56 who live in areas that have been hit hard by the pandemic.
00:03:00 More recently, this has been the case
00:03:03 in India and Brazil.
00:03:06 We spoke to parents in those lands
00:03:09 and asked them how this has affected their families
00:03:12 and, in particular, their children.
00:03:18 For a child, it’s been a whole year
00:03:21 without being able to play
00:03:23 with other children.
00:03:24 So they really miss being with their friends.
00:03:29 A big challenge that parents have now
00:03:31 is coming up with something fun
00:03:33 for them to do as a family
00:03:35 so that their child
00:03:36 doesn’t feel upset or sad.
00:03:39 They feel anxious to go out,
00:03:41 and it’s very challenging for us
00:03:42 to keep them motivated to stay inside.
00:03:45 Our family was infected with COVID-19.
00:03:48 It was physically and emotionally
00:03:50 very stressful for all of us.
00:03:53 We’re not able to meet the friends
00:03:55 at the Kingdom Hall anymore.
00:03:57 Neither can we see our relatives,
00:03:59 so the kids are getting really bored.
00:04:03 Right after the pandemic began,
00:04:05 we got the news that Denise had cancer.
00:04:08 Of course, one of our main concerns was our daughter.
00:04:12 She really became anxious
00:04:15 about what was going to happen to her mom.
00:04:21 Perhaps you can sympathize
00:04:23 with some of the challenges parents in India and Brazil are facing.
00:04:27 We know it’s not been easy for parents and families during the pandemic.
00:04:32 But with every trial, there are also opportunities
00:04:37 to remain loyal to Jehovah and to grow spiritually.
00:04:41 For example, many parents have said
00:04:45 that they’ve had more time with their children
00:04:47 to do what it says at Deuteronomy 6:6, 7:
00:04:54 “These words that I am commanding you today
00:04:57 “must be on your heart, and you must inculcate them
00:05:01 “in your sons and speak of them
00:05:04 “when you sit in your house
00:05:07 “and when you walk on the road and when you lie down
00:05:10 and when you get up.”
00:05:14 Many of us have had more time
00:05:17 to “sit in [our] house” during the pandemic,
00:05:19 whether we wanted to or not.
00:05:21 But if this was your circumstance,
00:05:24 hopefully you made good use of the opportunity.
00:05:28 Jehovah gave the command to Israel
00:05:31 because he knew that spiritually strong families
00:05:35 would be happy families.
00:05:37 The same is true today.
00:05:40 When your family stays close to Jehovah,
00:05:43 you bring a blessing to yourself and your congregation.
00:05:48 But you parents are not just caring for your children’s spiritual needs.
00:05:53 You have spiritual needs too.
00:05:56 Jehovah’s command in Deuteronomy chapter 6
00:05:59 said that Israelite parents must have his words on their heart.
00:06:04 Notice the benefit you gain
00:06:07 when you make time for your spirituality.
00:06:10 Proverbs 20:7
00:06:13 explains it this way:
00:06:16 “The righteous one is walking in his integrity.
00:06:20 Happy are his children who come after him.”
00:06:26 So righteous parents make for happy children.
00:06:32 Parents, we know that you know these things.
00:06:35 We commend you for what you’re doing,
00:06:38 and we’re praying for Jehovah’s holy spirit
00:06:41 to give you strength, even when you feel tired out.
00:06:45 Our spiritual routine is even more important
00:06:49 when we’re being tested.
00:06:52 The families we met from India and Brazil were aware of this too.
00:06:57 They shared what they’ve done to adapt their spiritual routine
00:07:01 to meet the challenge of the pandemic.
00:07:06 We go out in the ministry together as a family
00:07:09 much more often than we did before.
00:07:11 Saturday is a special day for us.
00:07:14 We work together as a family every Saturday morning,
00:07:17 and we make plans with other families
00:07:20 who are also close friends of our children.
00:07:23 We always have a very enjoyable time.
00:07:27 When we conduct our Bible studies, we have them sit in.
00:07:32 The kids watch us closely, and they learn from us.
00:07:36 Family worship has played a very important role.
00:07:40 It’s a relaxed atmosphere in which we can have a good time.
00:07:43 One of the games we play is you name a Bible character,
00:07:47 and the next person has to come up with someone whose name starts
00:07:51 with the last letter of the name that was just said.
00:07:54 This way, the kids are getting to know new Bible characters
00:07:57 and they’re learning a lot about them.
00:07:59 One of our projects is a model of Noah’s ark.
00:08:03 Our kids have learned almost all of the original songs.
00:08:06 We’ve played a few games using some of the activities on jw.org.
00:08:12 We made some models of Bible accounts.
00:08:14 We enacted Bible scenes and role plays of Bible characters.
00:08:19 There was one time that we wrapped our son
00:08:21 in toilet paper and he was Lazarus.
00:08:25 And we have considered timely articles appearing on jw.org.
00:08:28 We also did a project on the metal image
00:08:31 of Daniel’s prophecy.
00:08:34 Our son enjoys family worship
00:08:37 because we do things that he likes
00:08:39 —something that holds his attention.
00:08:40 And it’s fun.
00:08:41 And seeing them happy, makes us happy.
00:08:56 All this has drawn us closer to each other.
00:08:59 And it also helped us to draw closer to Jehovah.
00:09:07 With Jehovah’s help, we can get through anything.
00:09:15 Perhaps something those families are doing can work
00:09:18 or is already working for your family.
00:09:21 Let’s review some suggestions
00:09:23 that can help your family’s spiritual routine.
00:09:27 For families with young children:
00:09:30 Dramatize Bible scenes.
00:09:33 Your children may like to dress up and make props
00:09:37 to bring the account to life and remember the lessons.
00:09:41 And the good thing is you don’t need expensive props
00:09:45 to make this interesting.
00:09:47 Play memory games.
00:09:50 This could be based on recent points from the meetings
00:09:53 or something they’ve been reading or watching on JW Broadcasting®.
00:09:58 Try a jw.org activity
00:10:02 for children together.
00:10:04 These are under the “Bible Teachings” section of the website.
00:10:09 But if you have young children,
00:10:12 I suspect you’ve been there before.
00:10:14 And here are some ideas for families with teens:
00:10:19 Practice “What if . . . ?” situations.
00:10:23 Perhaps let your teen choose a situation they’re concerned about.
00:10:28 Talk about goals.
00:10:30 These can be short-term or long-term goals.
00:10:33 Let your teen tell why they chose the goal,
00:10:37 and what steps they feel will help them reach it.
00:10:40 Read or watch a life story.
00:10:44 Again, let your teen choose a life story of someone they’re interested in.
00:10:50 Remember, though, that you don’t have to use every suggestion.
00:10:54 Talk to your family, pray about it,
00:10:58 and try what you think can make a difference for you.
00:11:02 And, of course, there’s nothing wrong with watching JW Broadcasting
00:11:07 during a family worship.
00:11:09 After all, that’s why we’re here.
00:11:11 But when you do,
00:11:13 try to make it more than just watching TV.
00:11:17 Take time to talk about the program as a family,
00:11:21 either at the end of the broadcast or after each segment.
00:11:26 Those are the suggestions.
00:11:29 Now here are the necessities for your family:
00:11:33 Pray together every day.
00:11:36 Try to include the feelings and concerns of each family member.
00:11:41 Keep attending the meetings.
00:11:44 Help each other to pay attention and participate.
00:11:47 Unlike being in the Kingdom Hall,
00:11:50 we may have many distractions when we attend from home.
00:11:54 Share in the ministry together.
00:11:57 As the pandemic continues to limit how we do our preaching work,
00:12:01 talk about the different forms of the ministry you can do
00:12:05 and how each family member feels about them.
00:12:09 Listen, and encourage everyone to do their best.
00:12:14 Finally, we urge you parents
00:12:17 to keep doing what you already know is vital:
00:12:20 Be alert for signs that your children
00:12:23 are struggling with negative emotions or stress.
00:12:27 If you sense that they are,
00:12:29 please read the article
00:12:31 “Help Your Children Cope With Stress.”
00:12:34 It’s in the Awake! of July 22, 1993,
00:12:39 pages 10 and 11.
00:12:42 There you’ll find wonderful suggestions on what you can do.
00:12:47 Jehovah loves your family.
00:12:49 He knows what you’re contending with,
00:12:52 and he wants to help you.
00:12:54 The pandemic has been just one of many tests
00:12:58 we’ll face in the last days.
00:13:00 That’s not meant to discourage you; it’s just reality.
00:13:05 But with Jehovah’s help,
00:13:07 your family can come out of each test spiritually stronger
00:13:11 and more prepared to face what’s ahead.
00:13:14 Jeremiah chapter 17
00:13:17 gives us this beautiful assurance in verse 7:
00:13:23 “Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah,
00:13:27 whose confidence is in Jehovah.”
00:13:31 And verse 8 concludes saying:
00:13:34 “And in the year of drought he will not be anxious,
00:13:38 nor will he quit producing fruit.”
00:13:42 Of course, we also want these tests to end.
00:13:46 And they will!
00:13:48 When you look back at the pandemic from the new world,
00:13:52 it will seem “momentary and light,”
00:13:54 even if it doesn’t seem so now.
00:13:57 In the meantime, we continue to pray for all of you
00:14:02 —parents, children, and all in our worldwide spiritual family.
00:14:07 May Jehovah bless your love and endurance.

00:00:01 In this update, I’d like to talk with you
00:00:04 about something very close to my heart
00:00:06 —Bethel.
00:00:08 When I learned the truth as a teenager,
00:00:10 I made Bethel service a goal.
00:00:13 After I was baptized, I pioneered for two years
00:00:17 and then I came to Bethel.
00:00:19 And I’ve been here for 36 years now.
00:00:22 So I’m happy to talk to you about how things are going at Bethel
00:00:26 and how the worldwide Bethel family is coping with the pandemic.
00:00:31 No doubt you’ll be encouraged to hear
00:00:33 what helps them to remain joyful in their service.
00:00:37 Many of you have expressed appreciation,
00:00:40 saying that during this pandemic,
00:00:42 we have continued to receive spiritual food.
00:00:46 This includes our weekly meetings,
00:00:48 news articles on jw.org,
00:00:51 new publications, monthly broadcasts,
00:00:55 convention programs, and more.
00:00:58 All of this is possible because of the willing spirit
00:01:02 and hard work of our Bethel family
00:01:04 under challenging circumstances.
00:01:08 Around the world, the Bethel family has been sheltering in place,
00:01:12 in most cases, for about one year.
00:01:15 Our Bethelites have sacrificed opportunities
00:01:18 to spend time in person with family and dear friends,
00:01:22 and they’ve done this with a cooperative and willing spirit.
00:01:26 Why?
00:01:28 Because they love Jehovah and Jesus,
00:01:31 and because they love you.
00:01:33 They want to serve the needs of our worldwide brotherhood.
00:01:38 That’s been a sacrifice for them,
00:01:40 but we know that’s also been a sacrifice for all of you
00:01:44 who have family and friends at Bethel
00:01:47 because you haven’t been able to see them in person
00:01:49 during these difficult times.
00:01:52 In a sense, you’ve made a contribution to the work
00:01:56 by helping members of your family who are at Bethel
00:01:59 to be able to stay and concentrate on their work.
00:02:03 What a beautiful gift your support has been!
00:02:07 Of course, when this all began,
00:02:10 few imagined it would stretch on for so long.
00:02:14 In the following video,
00:02:16 you’ll see what some of our hardworking Bethelites have been doing
00:02:20 to maintain their joy
00:02:22 and keep the Kingdom work going without interruption.
00:02:27 Three things that I miss are traveling,
00:02:29 playing sports,
00:02:31 and taco stands.
00:02:32 I really miss my family.
00:02:35 Well, as I’m living on my own,
00:02:38 the most difficult thing for me
00:02:40 is that I miss the brothers.
00:02:42 I don’t have as much contact with them as I did before.
00:02:45 Most of all, I miss my two young nieces.
00:02:49 I am very close to them.
00:02:52 I really miss hugging the sisters
00:02:54 and the kids in the congregation.
00:02:56 Everything changed overnight
00:02:59 and very suddenly.
00:03:01 The brothers from outside Bethel who came to help us with the recordings
00:03:04 could not do this anymore, so the work increased considerably,
00:03:08 especially for the regional convention.
00:03:11 We had more work than ever.
00:03:14 Right before the pandemic, I was assigned to a new branch.
00:03:17 That means learning a brand-new culture
00:03:20 and starting again, developing friendships.
00:03:23 I didn’t feel as busy as before
00:03:26 or as busy as I would have liked to have been.
00:03:29 And I have to admit, I sometimes have the feeling
00:03:33 that I’m just not as useful as I was before.
00:03:39 My dad had to be admitted to a hospital because he became very ill,
00:03:44 and I felt helpless and guilty
00:03:46 because I couldn’t do what I really wanted to do
00:03:49 —to be with my family.
00:03:52 Because we live in an apartment right in the city center,
00:03:56 we can’t go out.
00:03:58 When you’re lonely and trapped inside four walls,
00:04:02 it’s very easy to get lost in negative thoughts.
00:04:06 I like to think
00:04:07 about the Biblical example of Joseph.
00:04:10 He did not concentrate
00:04:12 on the negative aspects of his situation,
00:04:15 but, rather, he always thought of doing his best
00:04:18 with all the assignments he was given.
00:04:20 Of course, the Bible has helped me a lot.
00:04:23 I think about Bible texts such as Psalm 94:18, 19,
00:04:27 where it says:
00:04:29 “Your loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me.
00:04:32 When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.”
00:04:36 Thinking about the Paradise,
00:04:38 I picture myself with my Mom
00:04:40 and my sister Carol, walking along the beach
00:04:42 and watching a beautiful sunset.
00:04:45 We’ll have all eternity to be together.
00:04:48 I do exercise every day,
00:04:50 and I also connect with the congregation for the preaching work.
00:04:54 Increasing the time I spend in the preaching work
00:04:58 has allowed me to focus on helping other people.
00:05:01 Auxiliary pioneering has been my window into the world outside.
00:05:05 When my friends and family ask me how I’m doing, I tell them that I’m OK.
00:05:09 We don’t try to paint an unrealistic picture
00:05:12 that all is fine
00:05:13 and that there are no challenges,
00:05:15 but we try always to be positive.
00:05:17 My wife and I tell them to remain calm
00:05:20 because at Bethel, they take good care of us.
00:05:23 But they still know that it’s not easy.
00:05:25 And every time I see them smile in a video call,
00:05:28 it’s as if they were giving my heart a big hug.
00:05:32 Also, by doing practical things for our parents,
00:05:36 for example, we would connect with them
00:05:39 and read the daily text together.
00:05:41 Being at Bethel during the pandemic is a great privilege
00:05:44 because it gives me the circumstances to be a source of encouragement
00:05:48 for those at Bethel who are going through a rough time
00:05:51 but especially for the friends who are out in the front lines of this battle.
00:05:55 Being at Bethel makes me feel deeply indebted to Jehovah.
00:05:58 He’s been taking care of us spiritually, emotionally, and physically.
00:06:03 And we are here serving at Bethel
00:06:07 (as it has been said) as the “supply line” to support the brothers.
00:06:14 I’m doing this at the most crucial moment of history.
00:06:18 And I’m seeing all of this up close.
00:06:21 That’s why every sacrifice I make for this privilege is worth it.
00:06:29 We deeply appreciate our Bethelites
00:06:32 along with their families and their congregations
00:06:35 for all the sacrifices they’re making in support of the Kingdom work.
00:06:40 We keep all of you dear brothers and sisters in our prayers.
00:06:45 As you saw from the video,
00:06:47 like you, our Bethelites deal with anxieties during the pandemic.
00:06:52 It’s normal to have these feelings.
00:06:54 We know that the trials that we’re experiencing are going to end.
00:06:59 But in the meantime, we’re dealing with very real human emotions.
00:07:04 So, what can we do to cope?
00:07:06 First, be honest about it with Jehovah
00:07:10 and express to him what you’re dealing with.
00:07:13 When David prayed to Jehovah in a time of crisis,
00:07:17 he said at Psalm 142:2:
00:07:21 “Before him I pour out my concern;
00:07:25 before him I tell about my distress.”
00:07:30 We can do the same.
00:07:33 Pour out your concerns and anxieties to Jehovah.
00:07:37 He promises to help us cope if we have faith.
00:07:41 Pray for faith each day.
00:07:43 Along with this, keep in mind
00:07:46 that today’s problems are only temporary.
00:07:49 The last days had a beginning,
00:07:51 and the last days will have an end.
00:07:54 This pandemic had a beginning,
00:07:56 and this pandemic will have an end.
00:08:00 The apostle Paul called such trials “momentary.”
00:08:04 And this is the case even more so
00:08:06 as we move toward the end of this system of things.
00:08:10 At 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, he said:
00:08:15 “For though the tribulation is momentary and light,
00:08:19 “it works out for us a glory
00:08:21 “that is of more and more surpassing greatness
00:08:25 “and is everlasting;
00:08:27 “while we keep our eyes,
00:08:29 “not on the things seen,
00:08:30 “but on the things unseen.
00:08:33 “For the things seen are temporary,
00:08:35 but the things unseen are everlasting.”
00:08:40 That inspired advice benefited the early Christians,
00:08:44 and it can benefit all of God’s people today.
00:08:48 We commend all of you for your faithful endurance
00:08:52 and for remaining busy in your service to Jehovah.
00:08:55 Through your efforts along with the power of Jehovah’s spirit
00:09:00 not only has the Kingdom work continued
00:09:03 but it’s also moving forward and expanding in exciting ways.
00:09:08 One example of that
00:09:10 is the world headquarters project at Ramapo, New York,
00:09:14 announced at the 2019 annual meeting.
00:09:18 Have you been wondering how the Ramapo project
00:09:21 has been affected by the pandemic?
00:09:24 We’re happy to share this behind-the-scenes report
00:09:28 on how things have been progressing.
00:09:38 On the January 2020 monthly broadcast,
00:09:42 our brothers around the world learned
00:09:44 that the Governing Body had determined
00:09:47 it was Jehovah’s direction
00:09:50 and approval had been given for a site dedicated primarily
00:09:53 to media production in Ramapo.
00:09:57 Well, just three months later,
00:10:00 a once-in-a-generation event, COVID-19,
00:10:04 brought grinding to a halt
00:10:06 the plans that large institutions, even nations,
00:10:10 had in mind.
00:10:12 How were the plans for Ramapo affected?
00:10:15 Was it really the right time for Jehovah’s organization
00:10:18 to start a major construction project?
00:10:22 As we review the events of 2020, look out
00:10:25 not only for clear evidence of Jehovah’s direction and blessing
00:10:30 but also the conclusion that Job once came to
00:10:34 when he said to Jehovah,
00:10:36 ‘Nothing you have in mind is impossible for you to do.’
00:10:41 For a period here in New York,
00:10:43 nonessential construction activities
00:10:45 were restricted.
00:10:46 However, at the exact time
00:10:49 our project schedule required it,
00:10:51 the town of Ramapo started holding town board meetings
00:10:54 over (you guessed it) Zoom.
00:10:57 That meant that even though we were in the midst of the unfolding global chaos,
00:11:02 we were still able to meet a milestone on July 8, 2020,
00:11:06 when we had our first project meeting with the town board.
00:11:09 And we have clearly seen Jehovah’s blessing
00:11:13 in the meetings we have had with them since then.
00:11:17 We hit a second
00:11:19 and much more significant milestone
00:11:21 on December 9, 2020,
00:11:24 when the town approved
00:11:26 our scoping document.
00:11:28 Like the homework a teacher assigns a student
00:11:31 in order to pass an important grade,
00:11:33 we now know the information we should provide the town
00:11:37 in order to obtain permission to start construction.
00:11:41 When will that be?
00:11:42 Currently, we are on course for the end of 2021.
00:11:47 That is a number of months earlier than had originally been planned for,
00:11:52 even before the pandemic.
00:11:55 So just as Job said,
00:11:57 ‘Nothing Jehovah has in mind is impossible.’
00:12:03 Since April 2019,
00:12:06 when the Construction Project Committee
00:12:08 was appointed,
00:12:09 the design of the site and the first buildings to be constructed
00:12:13 has advanced tremendously.
00:12:16 Many key lessons taken from recent large projects
00:12:20 have influenced the direction
00:12:22 that the Worldwide Design/Construction Department,
00:12:25 under the direction of the Publishing Committee,
00:12:27 have given.
00:12:29 The Ramapo site is 249 acres.
00:12:33 The buildings are about 160 feet
00:12:36 above Sterling Mine Road.
00:12:38 The primary interests off Sterling Mine Road
00:12:41 bring you first to the visitors’ center,
00:12:43 which will accommodate
00:12:45 1,200 visitors per day.
00:12:49 The studio building with its soundstages
00:12:52 is in the center of the site
00:12:54 and adjacent to the studios are workshops.
00:12:59 Over the ridgeline is the back lot
00:13:02 for outdoor sets and filming.
00:13:07 Next to the studios are the offices,
00:13:11 reception,
00:13:13 and the events building.
00:13:15 This building can be configured
00:13:17 as either a large assembly space
00:13:19 for 1,300 attendees,
00:13:22 a large dining room for 1,200 people,
00:13:25 or some yet-to-be-defined function.
00:13:29 On the west of the site are residences
00:13:32 for 1,290 volunteers.
00:13:37 Much time and energy have been invested
00:13:40 in the research of the best energy options for the site.
00:13:44 This led to the decision to use electricity
00:13:47 as the primary energy source.
00:13:50 A vast geothermal well field located beneath the studios
00:13:54 will heat and cool the entire complex,
00:13:58 and 120,000 square feet
00:14:00 of photovoltaic panels
00:14:02 will create electricity,
00:14:04 which is then stored
00:14:06 in an industrial-grade battery bank
00:14:09 and can thus be used at any time.
00:14:11 The result is that the site has its own microgrid
00:14:16 with the ability to make, to store,
00:14:20 and then to redirect energy
00:14:22 around the site where it is needed.
00:14:25 Many of us who generally work
00:14:27 in an office environment
00:14:28 have gotten used to working from home
00:14:30 during the pandemic.
00:14:32 Will that affect the need for office space on the Ramapo project?
00:14:36 Frankly, it’s impossible to predict
00:14:38 what the configuration of office space will be in the future.
00:14:42 Therefore, flexibility in the layout of future office space
00:14:46 is the most important design criteria.
00:14:48 The building is divided
00:14:50 into 10-foot by 15-foot modules.
00:14:53 Each module has a ceiling cloud above it
00:14:55 containing a heating and cooling unit and lighting.
00:14:59 Power and data wiring are in a raised floor
00:15:01 to allow for a variety of configurations
00:15:04 and reconfigurations.
00:15:06 Demountable partitions extend from the floor
00:15:09 to the deck above.
00:15:10 They can transform one module
00:15:12 into a single office
00:15:14 or small conference room.
00:15:16 Partitions can group several modules together
00:15:19 to form a larger conference room,
00:15:21 or the floor can be free of partitions
00:15:23 to work as an open-plan work area.
00:15:26 More important,
00:15:28 as these demountable partitions have no services in them,
00:15:31 these changes can be made at any time before
00:15:34 or after moving into the facility,
00:15:37 as office needs are better understood.
00:15:40 Maximizing the glass on the facades
00:15:42 and then the use of glass partitions inside the offices
00:15:45 ensures that all offices have plenty of natural light.
00:15:52 The ten residence buildings are oriented
00:15:55 in a north-south direction
00:15:57 so that all rooms will have
00:15:59 either morning or afternoon sun.
00:16:03 They are clustered around existing wetlands.
00:16:08 Careful research led to the decision
00:16:10 to pursue a different structural system
00:16:13 known as mass timber
00:16:16 —something we’ve not done on previous projects of this scale.
00:16:20 Timber is bonded in crossed directional layers
00:16:25 to form the structural elements of the building.
00:16:29 This is an increasingly familiar system.
00:16:32 Robust and safe
00:16:34 —that means that the beams, the columns, and the floors
00:16:37 can be prefabricated off-site,
00:16:41 making the structure of the building
00:16:43 faster to put up.
00:16:45 And apart from being economical, time-saving,
00:16:50 and reducing the carbon footprint of the project,
00:16:53 it should also make for some very attractive buildings.
00:17:01 As many filming
00:17:03 and recording projects
00:17:04 will be produced at the new Ramapo facility,
00:17:08 50 rooms in the residence building closest to the center of the site
00:17:12 have been designed to be smaller hotellike rooms
00:17:16 that will allow for comfortable
00:17:19 short-term stays
00:17:20 for those here to assist
00:17:22 as cast members
00:17:23 or other visitors.
00:17:26 As mentioned, many have worked from home during the pandemic,
00:17:30 and some prefer it.
00:17:32 Will it be the wave of the future?
00:17:35 We cannot say.
00:17:37 However, the majority of the residence rooms
00:17:40 will have a separate room
00:17:42 —many with a window—
00:17:43 that can be used
00:17:45 either as an additional storage room
00:17:47 or home office.
00:17:50 Future updates will feature the central focus of this new facility
00:17:54 —the new AVS studios building.
00:17:58 Although it will be the biggest we have ever constructed,
00:18:01 more important,
00:18:03 it will bring what is presently done in many different areas
00:18:07 —and, of course, our hardworking brothers and sisters—
00:18:10 all under one roof.
00:18:13 Despite a number of challenges in 2020,
00:18:17 the Ramapo project kept moving forward.
00:18:21 As we look ahead, we eagerly await
00:18:24 even further evidence
00:18:26 that nothing Jehovah has in mind
00:18:29 is impossible for him to do.
00:18:44 The amazing progress we’re making with Ramapo
00:18:48 —even in the middle of such challenging circumstances—
00:18:51 reminds us of Psalm chapter 127
00:18:54 and verse 1:
00:18:57 “Unless Jehovah builds the house,
00:19:00 it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.”
00:19:04 There’s no doubt that Jehovah is helping us
00:19:07 “[build] the house” at Ramapo!
00:19:10 You may have noted that the video mentioned future updates.
00:19:14 So, in time, you can look forward
00:19:17 to more reports about the Ramapo project.
00:19:21 When we reflect on all that’s been accomplished this past year,
00:19:25 it’s clear that Jehovah is blessing
00:19:27 the self-sacrifice of our worldwide Bethel family.
00:19:32 They’re like the ones described at Psalm 110:3,
00:19:37 where it says:
00:19:39 “Your people will offer themselves willingly.”
00:19:44 These brothers and sisters
00:19:46 are truly “[offering] themselves willingly” to Jehovah
00:19:50 day after day.
00:19:52 So please keep the Bethel family
00:19:55 and the Ramapo project in your prayers.
00:19:58 We’re confident that Jehovah will bless your hard work
00:20:02 and your endurance during this pandemic,
00:20:05 whether you’re serving in Bethel or in the field.
00:20:09 And we know that you’ll show the same zeal
00:20:12 during the campaign to invite as many as possible
00:20:16 to the special talk and Memorial of Christ’s death.
00:20:20 It’s our earnest prayer
00:20:22 that Jehovah continue to guide and strengthen you
00:20:26 in the days ahead.
00:20:28 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:20:32 this is JW Broadcasting®.

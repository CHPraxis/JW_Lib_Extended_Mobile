00:00:01 At Romans 8:35, the apostle Paul asked:
00:00:06 “Who will separate us
00:00:08 “from the love of the Christ?
00:00:10 “Will tribulation or distress or persecution
00:00:15 or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?”
00:00:20 Notice how Paul answered that question in verse 37:
00:00:25 “On the contrary, in all these things
00:00:29 “we are coming off completely victorious
00:00:32 through the one who loved us.”
00:00:35 That’s a very fitting scripture
00:00:37 for this update.
00:00:39 Many of the things Paul mentioned
00:00:42 we’ve experienced in the past year.
00:00:45 There have been many challenges.
00:00:48 Yet, through the help we receive from Jehovah,
00:00:51 “we are coming off . . . victorious.”
00:00:55 Of course, we’re all contending with the pandemic.
00:00:59 Jehovah’s organization has been complying
00:01:02 with guidance from public health officials worldwide.
00:01:06 We’ve worked hard as an organization
00:01:09 to show deep respect for the sanctity of life.
00:01:13 And we’ve watched Jehovah bless these efforts
00:01:16 as our meetings and ministry have thrived.
00:01:21 However, we are not immune
00:01:24 to the effects of the virus.
00:01:26 As of May 15, we have now lost
00:01:31 over 17,000
00:01:34 of our dear brothers and sisters
00:01:36 to COVID-19.
00:01:39 No doubt most of us have lost someone we love.
00:01:43 How comforting to know that our loved ones
00:01:47 are safe in Jehovah’s memory!
00:01:50 Even death has not separated them from Jehovah.
00:01:56 There have been many recent news reports
00:01:59 about the pandemic in India and Brazil.
00:02:03 Many of you have been asking how our brothers there are doing.
00:02:07 In the past month in India,
00:02:09 there have been ten times
00:02:12 as many new cases and deaths among the brothers
00:02:17 than there were in the previous month.
00:02:20 The disaster relief committees
00:02:22 are actively monitoring the needs of our brothers
00:02:25 and, as needed, helping them locate hospitals
00:02:29 that have available beds.
00:02:32 In Brazil, the number of cases
00:02:35 and the number of deaths continue to be high.
00:02:38 Sadly, over 400 of our brothers in Brazil
00:02:43 have died from the virus in just the past month.
00:02:47 The responsible brothers are working hard
00:02:50 to help our brothers in these lands.
00:02:53 Please keep all of our brothers
00:02:56 in India and Brazil in your prayers.
00:03:01 In various parts of the world, the virus is resurging
00:03:05 in some cases because of new variants.
00:03:08 Clearly, this pandemic is not over.
00:03:13 Please continue to be careful.
00:03:16 You may find it helpful to review
00:03:18 the 2020 Governing Body Update #9,
00:03:23 which explains how COVID-19 spreads
00:03:26 and what we can do to protect ourselves.
00:03:30 What is our view on vaccination?
00:03:34 Jehovah’s Witnesses are not against vaccination.
00:03:39 We view it as a personal decision
00:03:42 for each Christian to make.
00:03:44 Already, in cooperation with public health officials,
00:03:49 many in our Bethel families have chosen to be vaccinated.
00:03:55 In 2020, we also faced
00:03:58 an unprecedented number of natural disasters.
00:04:02 Can you imagine that in the 2020 service year
00:04:06 we have had 204 disasters?
00:04:10 That’s more than double the number of disasters
00:04:13 that we had in 2018!
00:04:17 Of course, we’ve had to cope with many disasters during the pandemic.
00:04:21 Let me remind you of some of them.
00:04:25 Central America was struck by Hurricane Eta.
00:04:29 St. Vincent has had volcanic eruptions.
00:04:33 Croatia was shaken by earthquakes.
00:04:37 Lebanon was devastated by an explosion.
00:04:42 Nigeria suffered widespread flooding.
00:04:45 Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Eloise.
00:04:49 The Philippines was pummeled
00:04:51 by Super Typhoon Goni.
00:04:54 Australia had destructive bush fires.
00:04:58 These are just a few
00:04:59 of the disasters we have faced
00:05:01 during the pandemic.
00:05:03 This is exactly what Paul was talking about
00:05:07 when he mentioned tribulation, distress,
00:05:11 hunger, nakedness, danger, or sword.
00:05:16 Would any of these things
00:05:18 “be able to separate us from God’s love”?
00:05:22 What have we seen?
00:05:24 Let’s hear some expressions from our brothers in the United States.
00:05:35 When you have a disaster
00:05:36 on top of a disaster,
00:05:38 COVID-19 on top of Hurricane Sally,
00:05:41 it’s a challenge to get through and navigate both.
00:05:45 Being homebound for so many months,
00:05:48 everybody was already feeling
00:05:49 a little bit on edge.
00:05:52 Then you add the stress of the flood on top of it.
00:05:56 The speed of the brothers
00:05:58 and sisters responding
00:05:59 was probably the most heartwarming.
00:06:02 We called them on a Wednesday to start some of their work on Friday,
00:06:07 and by Friday, they were organized and ready to go.
00:06:11 I think it’s one of the most heartwarming
00:06:13 privileges I’ve ever seen
00:06:15 —how Jehovah’s organization
00:06:17 can take care of needs,
00:06:20 whereas the world around us is falling apart.
00:06:25 There are people who think:
00:06:26 ‘I can handle this. I can handle this,’
00:06:28 you know, ‘I can do this.’
00:06:30 And you can’t do it on your own.
00:06:31 You need the friends. You need them.
00:06:34 When the call goes out, Jehovah’s people come running.
00:06:37 It’s an amazing thing to see.
00:06:39 There’s no way that Jehovah’s love can be blocked.
00:06:43 If you’re sheltered in place, wherever you are,
00:06:46 Jehovah’s love gets through.
00:06:48 We’ve been through a difficult situation,
00:06:51 but our confidence is solid
00:06:53 that he’ll continue to help us.
00:06:55 He got us through this problem;
00:06:57 he’ll get us through the next.
00:06:59 One of the reasons why our brothers are coming off victorious
00:07:03 is because of all of you.
00:07:06 You have been there to help.
00:07:09 Some of you have risked your own safety to provide relief.
00:07:13 Although most of us don’t have the circumstances to do that,
00:07:17 we’ve made donations.
00:07:20 As a result, we’ve been able to provide our brothers
00:07:23 with food, water, building materials, and medicine
00:07:28 —all because of your generosity and goodness.
00:07:33 Thank you for what you’ve done
00:07:36 to help our brothers who face these disasters.
00:07:41 That’s not the only thing that Paul talked about
00:07:44 in Romans 8:35.
00:07:47 He also mentioned persecution.
00:07:51 We certainly have had to face that.
00:07:53 It hasn’t gone away during the pandemic.
00:07:56 As of May 2021,
00:07:59 more than 155 brothers and sisters
00:08:02 are in prison for their faith.
00:08:06 Even so, there have been positive developments.
00:08:10 In recent months, we were so encouraged to learn
00:08:15 that 32 of our brothers in Eritrea
00:08:18 have been set free,
00:08:20 including Paulos, Isaac, and Negede,
00:08:24 who were imprisoned for 26 years.
00:08:28 We continue to pray
00:08:30 for the 20 brothers and sisters who are still in prison.
00:08:36 On May 8, we were delighted to learn
00:08:39 that the Turkmenistan government released from prison
00:08:42 all 16 of our brothers
00:08:44 who were imprisoned
00:08:46 for conscientious objection
00:08:48 to military service.
00:08:50 We thank Jehovah
00:08:52 for these positive developments.
00:08:56 When I went to Russia for the Supreme Court hearings in 2017,
00:09:01 it was a very sobering moment
00:09:04 when we heard the judge announce
00:09:07 that our legal entities were banned.
00:09:11 We knew Jehovah would look after our brothers,
00:09:14 but there were so many unknowns.
00:09:17 How would our brothers be affected?
00:09:20 Some, of course, have been arrested, like Brother Dennis Christensen.
00:09:25 He’s been in prison for four years
00:09:28 as of May 25, 2021.
00:09:31 Although Dennis has qualified for parole for over a year,
00:09:36 the authorities have “hardened their hearts.”
00:09:39 They have not let him go.
00:09:42 In spite of that,
00:09:44 Dennis and his wife, Irina, are in good spirits.
00:09:49 And we continue to remember our 10 brothers
00:09:51 who are in penal colonies in Russia
00:09:54 and the 48 who are in pretrial detention
00:09:58 as of May 14, 2021.
00:10:02 Now that four years have passed since the ban,
00:10:06 what do we see?
00:10:08 Our brothers have not cowered.
00:10:11 They have not backed down.
00:10:13 They continue to serve Jehovah faithfully.
00:10:17 As you watch this next video,
00:10:20 see who the authorities are attacking now.
00:10:28 In 2013,
00:10:30 our son, Igor, became ill,
00:10:32 and he got worse and worse.
00:10:36 Then, in 2014, our son died.
00:10:39 It was such a tragedy for us,
00:10:41 and words cannot describe it.
00:10:43 He was our only son and was deeply loved.
00:10:46 Then, two years later, my mother died.
00:10:50 And two years after that, my sister died.
00:10:53 Getting through all of that was beyond human strength.
00:10:59 We had just started to feel a little better
00:11:03 when on March 26,
00:11:05 2019, . . .
00:11:06 . . . 2019 . . .
00:11:09 . . . armed men in masks burst into our home.
00:11:14 It was such a shock! We went numb.
00:11:17 We couldn’t say anything.
00:11:19 We were paralyzed.
00:11:21 On May 22, 2019,
00:11:25 early in the morning at 5:45,
00:11:28 the doorbell rang.
00:11:31 I looked through the peephole and saw people
00:11:34 who showed me their identification.
00:11:37 Then those people came into my apartment,
00:11:39 made a search, and took me to the center
00:11:42 for fighting extremism.
00:11:45 It ended up with my being accused
00:11:47 of participating in extremist activity.
00:11:51 Then, in 2020,
00:11:53 the court hearings began for my case.
00:11:58 For example, for my criminal case,
00:12:01 they collected 17 volumes of evidence against me,
00:12:04 and they questioned over 200 witnesses.
00:12:07 Then the court hearings started.
00:12:09 First of all, there were Valentina’s hearings, then mine.
00:12:14 Of course, none of that is exactly pleasant,
00:12:16 but it somehow made us stronger,
00:12:19 and Jehovah supported us.
00:12:21 We even went to the court feeling joyful.
00:12:24 We felt that Jehovah was helping us, supporting us,
00:12:27 strengthening us, and encouraging us.
00:12:29 We are so grateful to him!
00:12:31 Our fellow worshippers constantly called on us
00:12:35 from all parts of the town.
00:12:37 They always supported us,
00:12:39 always called us and said strengthening things
00:12:42 and quotes from the Bible.
00:12:46 I understood that it would end up with my being a defendant.
00:12:50 It was as though inside I was already prepared for that
00:12:54 and, you know, I didn’t feel any kind of panic.
00:12:57 I just wanted to get through it in a dignified manner
00:13:00 and didn’t want to let anyone down
00:13:03 and under no circumstances
00:13:06 betray our God, Jehovah.
00:13:08 I want to say that each day for me
00:13:11 is a blessing from Jehovah.
00:13:14 I pray and ask for peace and calmness
00:13:18 in both my heart and my home.
00:13:21 And right now, the blessings far outweigh
00:13:25 all negative experiences.
00:13:27 This I value very highly.
00:13:29 The sentence might even involve time in prison
00:13:33 or it might be a suspended sentence.
00:13:36 But regardless of the outcome,
00:13:38 we need to remain faithful to God
00:13:40 and to stay on the way of truth
00:13:42 to the end.
00:13:45 No matter what happens,
00:13:46 whether I remain free
00:13:49 or they put me somewhere behind prison walls,
00:13:52 there is absolutely nothing
00:13:54 that can “separate us from God’s love.”
00:13:58 No prison walls can shut out God’s love.
00:14:01 It can penetrate everywhere
00:14:03 to all depths.
00:14:07 It was the strength that we received from God
00:14:10 that helped us to survive the death of our son
00:14:13 and many other misfortunes,
00:14:15 so we will get through this too.
00:14:17 We definitely will!
00:14:19 I have no doubt about it.
00:14:26 How shameful that the authorities are attacking
00:14:30 our elderly brothers and sisters!
00:14:32 And yet, isn’t it amazing
00:14:36 that, despite their own trials,
00:14:38 these dear older ones are not yielding to fear?
00:14:43 They say that the persecution
00:14:46 has only made them stronger in the faith.
00:14:50 You dear brothers and sisters in Russia
00:14:53 have done so well.
00:14:56 You are an inspiration to all of us.
00:15:00 We truly love you.
00:15:04 Doesn’t all of this convince us
00:15:07 of what Paul said in Romans 8:37?
00:15:12 “In all these things
00:15:14 “we are coming off completely victorious
00:15:18 through the one who loved us.”
00:15:20 That’s what we’ve seen with our brothers and sisters
00:15:23 facing the pandemic, natural disasters,
00:15:27 and persecution.
00:15:29 What conviction does this lead us to?
00:15:33 Paul continues in verses 38 and 39:
00:15:38 “For I am convinced
00:15:40 “that neither death nor life
00:15:43 “nor angels nor governments
00:15:46 “nor things now here nor things to come
00:15:49 “nor powers nor height nor depth
00:15:52 “nor any other creation
00:15:54 “will be able to separate us from God’s love
00:15:58 that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
00:16:02 Brothers and sisters,
00:16:04 we are convinced that you too
00:16:08 will continue to “[come] off completely victorious”
00:16:12 no matter what trials you face.
00:16:15 Why?
00:16:16 Because nothing can separate us
00:16:20 from Jehovah’s love.
00:16:22 Please know
00:16:24 that we love you all very much.

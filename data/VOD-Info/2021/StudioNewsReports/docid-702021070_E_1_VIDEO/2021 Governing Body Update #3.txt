00:00:01 For this update, we’re going to focus
00:00:04 on our all-important disciple-making work.
00:00:09 Despite the pandemic,
00:00:11 the Governing Body continues to look for ways
00:00:14 to make our ministry even more effective.
00:00:18 How?
00:00:19 By continuing to build on the direction
00:00:23 provided at the 2017 annual meeting.
00:00:27 At that meeting, the Governing Body
00:00:30 announced organizational adjustments
00:00:32 based on 1 Corinthians 9:26.
00:00:37 That verse says:
00:00:39 “Therefore, the way I am running
00:00:41 “is not aimlessly;
00:00:43 “the way I am aiming my blows is
00:00:46 so as not to be striking the air.”
00:00:49 How do we make our “blows” count?
00:00:53 We focus on what Acts 13:48 mentions
00:00:58 —searching for “those who [are] rightly disposed
00:01:02 for everlasting life.”
00:01:05 How have we been helped to do that?
00:01:08 Consider a few examples from the past year.
00:01:12 We reviewed Watchtower  study articles
00:01:15 that focused on helping new ones progress to baptism
00:01:19 and that reminded us to discontinue unproductive studies.
00:01:25 The 2020 regional convention program
00:01:29 devoted an entire day to the disciple-making work
00:01:33 and to helping Bible students progress to baptism.
00:01:38 Who could forget Neeta and Jade?
00:01:42 Our November campaign included a special effort
00:01:46 to provide government officials with information
00:01:49 about God’s Kingdom,
00:01:51 with the goal of reaching even more
00:01:54 “rightly disposed” ones.
00:01:57 And aren’t we excited to use the new Bible study tool,
00:02:01 Enjoy Life Forever!,
00:02:03 which features a more effective teaching style?
00:02:07 But 2020 saw another significant effort
00:02:11 to make our blows count.
00:02:14 In June 2020,
00:02:16 it was announced that all branches would evaluate
00:02:20 their foreign-language and indigenous-language pregroups,
00:02:25 groups, and congregations.
00:02:29 What was the reason for this evaluation?
00:02:33 Notice what the Governing Body conveyed
00:02:35 to the elders at that time:
00:02:39 “In recent years,
00:02:41 “Jehovah’s people have responded to the call to expand their ministry
00:02:46 “by learning another language in order to reach honesthearted ones,
00:02:51 “and publishers should be commended
00:02:54 “for their self-sacrificing efforts in this regard.
00:02:58 “Nevertheless,
00:03:01 “it has been noted that in some cases
00:03:04 “pregroups or groups show little evidence of growth,
00:03:09 “with few progressive Bible studies
00:03:11 “and few, if any, progressing to baptism.
00:03:16 “In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9:26,
00:03:20 “the Governing Body wants to be certain
00:03:23 that we are making our blows count.”
00:03:28 How were these language groups
00:03:32 and congregations evaluated?
00:03:35 Notice what happened in the first century
00:03:38 when Paul and his companions
00:03:41 wanted to expand their ministry.
00:03:44 Acts 16:6-10 explains
00:03:47 that they traveled many miles
00:03:49 and made concerted efforts to preach in various territories.
00:03:54 However, Jehovah, through his holy spirit,
00:03:59 directed them to the right area.
00:04:03 Let’s read this at Acts 16:9:
00:04:07 “And during the night
00:04:08 “a vision appeared to Paul
00:04:11 “—a Macedonian man was standing there
00:04:13 “urging him and saying:
00:04:15 ‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’”
00:04:19 How did they respond?
00:04:21 Verse 10 says:
00:04:22 “As soon as he had seen the vision,
00:04:25 “we tried to go into Macedonia,
00:04:28 “drawing the conclusion
00:04:29 “that God had summoned us
00:04:31 to declare the good news to them.”
00:04:35 When they discerned Jehovah’s direction,
00:04:38 the brothers immediately followed
00:04:41 the leading of the holy spirit.
00:04:45 Likewise, we follow the spirit’s lead.
00:04:50 Of course, it’s not provided through visions
00:04:53 but through evidence in the field.
00:04:58 The recent evaluation showed
00:05:00 that some foreign-language and indigenous-language groups
00:05:03 and congregations had existed for years
00:05:07 and yet had few or no publishers
00:05:11 who were dependent on the language.
00:05:15 In other cases, the territory was very scattered,
00:05:19 so publishers and pioneers had to travel long distances
00:05:24 to find someone who could speak the language.
00:05:29 Despite all of this effort,
00:05:31 there were few Bible studies
00:05:33 and few interested ones, if any,
00:05:37 who attended meetings.
00:05:40 What was Jehovah’s spirit telling us?
00:05:44 It would be better to use our efforts in other fields.
00:05:50 Thus, such pregroups, groups, and congregations
00:05:55 were dissolved.
00:05:58 Have you been personally impacted
00:06:01 by this evaluation?
00:06:04 If so, you’re not alone.
00:06:08 For example, as a result of the evaluation
00:06:11 in just 16 branch territories,
00:06:14 some 4,700 elders,
00:06:17 2,800 ministerial servants,
00:06:21 and 11,000 regular pioneers
00:06:24 have been made available to serve in other fields.
00:06:31 At one time, we may have thought
00:06:33 that the largest increase was taking place
00:06:36 in foreign-language or indigenous-language fields.
00:06:40 But as we’ve considered the matter more carefully,
00:06:44 it seems that congregations in the main languages of many countries
00:06:49 are experiencing the largest numbers
00:06:52 of newly baptized disciples.
00:06:56 So if you’re now returning
00:06:59 to a congregation in one of the main languages of your country,
00:07:03 remember that you are needed there!
00:07:08 Many congregations are struggling
00:07:10 to cover their large territories.
00:07:13 In major cities,
00:07:15 there may be millions of people to reach
00:07:19 but few publishers and pioneers available to preach.
00:07:25 Many pioneers and publishers are finding
00:07:28 progressive return visits and Bible studies in these fields.
00:07:34 And think of how the congregations are being strengthened
00:07:37 as so many mature ones join them!
00:07:41 More appointed brothers are now available
00:07:44 to help with shepherding,
00:07:47 to deliver meeting parts,
00:07:49 and to assist in many other ways.
00:07:53 What practical blessings are resulting
00:07:56 from this evaluation?
00:07:59 Let’s hear the thoughts of a few Branch Committee members.
00:08:05 Thanks to the wise direction
00:08:07 of the Governing Body,
00:08:08 the way we accomplish our ministry
00:08:10 has improved.
00:08:11 More publishers, qualified pioneers, and appointed brothers
00:08:15 will be able to rapidly help other congregations
00:08:19 and concentrate their efforts in the most productive language fields
00:08:22 or fields with a greater potential.
00:08:25 This evaluation has allowed us
00:08:28 to assign graduates
00:08:30 from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:08:33 and special pioneers as well,
00:08:35 to more productive territories.
00:08:38 But what we’re hearing is that this has energized
00:08:41 the ministry of these pioneers.
00:08:44 In fact, many of them are conducting progressive Bible studies now.
00:08:49 None of us find adjustments easy,
00:08:51 so it has been so encouraging
00:08:53 to see how many have been willing
00:08:55 to adapt to these changes,
00:08:57 in fact, embracing them.
00:08:59 In one language field,
00:09:01 some brothers were a little hesitant at first,
00:09:04 but they were loyal.
00:09:06 So, of course, they went along with the changes.
00:09:08 Now the circuit overseer tells us
00:09:10 that these ones have sent so many expressions of appreciation
00:09:14 thanking them for these loving adjustments.
00:09:16 Many learners have informed us
00:09:20 that it has greatly reduced their stress level.
00:09:23 This has allowed them now to be in a congregation
00:09:26 that they can concentrate more on a productive ministry
00:09:30 and take care of their own spirituality as well.
00:09:33 There’s one brother who is learning another language.
00:09:36 And he was in a congregation, and this changed
00:09:38 from being a congregation to a group.
00:09:41 And he said, “It’s as if finally someone has just released the pressure valve.”
00:09:46 Truly, our Branch Committee saw Jehovah’s spirit act
00:09:51 and is convinced he blessed this evaluation.
00:09:56 What about our pioneers and publishers?
00:09:59 Let’s hear from some who have experienced
00:10:02 these adjustments firsthand.
00:10:06 In the congregation
00:10:08 where I’m serving now in Portuguese,
00:10:10 the territory is very productive.
00:10:12 People are so receptive.
00:10:14 I had the goal of starting one Bible study when I was in the foreign language group.
00:10:18 When the adjustment came, in just a few weeks I had five studies.
00:10:23 We would drive around for hours
00:10:25 looking for just a few specific individuals.
00:10:27 Now we just preach to people,
00:10:29 and if we find foreign-language speakers,
00:10:31 we can still preach to them too.
00:10:33 I have more joy in my ministry because I feel like I’m making good use of my time.
00:10:37 Well, we loved being in foreign language,
00:10:40 but realistically it takes a lot of time.
00:10:43 So we’ve really enjoyed having more time
00:10:45 to prepare for our meeting parts and discuss the points and our application.
00:10:50 It’s been a really nice blessing.
00:10:51 I personally have really benefited from having the extra time
00:10:55 just to spend on cultivating my relationship with Jehovah.
00:10:58 Something really, really interesting
00:11:01 is what one brother said from another group.
00:11:03 He said: “OK,
00:11:05 “now I think I understand better the way that Jehovah does math.
00:11:08 “So instead of having 15 people learn a language to help one person,
00:11:13 “now just one person needs to learn a language
00:11:16 “to be able to benefit from an entire congregation
00:11:19 —100 brothers or more.”
00:11:22 The first concern that I think we all had
00:11:25 was for those who depended on the language.
00:11:28 But as it’s turned out
00:11:30 and as they’ve become part of the congregation,
00:11:33 now they have an even bigger family of brothers and sisters who care about them.
00:11:36 So in our small congregation,
00:11:38 the attendance to the Memorial
00:11:39 was usually just the publishers.
00:11:41 Now, being in this new congregation,
00:11:42 it’s very exciting because this year
00:11:45 we had almost double the amount of the publishers
00:11:48 in our congregation for the attendance.
00:11:50 So that’s very encouraging to see.
00:11:52 We feel that now we are putting our time and energy
00:11:55 into a territory that is actually productive,
00:11:59 and like 1 Corinthians 9:26 says,
00:12:02 we feel like we are making our “blows” count.
00:12:08 If you’re in the same situation as these publishers,
00:12:12 what will you do now?
00:12:15 Like Paul,
00:12:17 we need to be willing to redirect our efforts
00:12:20 based on the leadings of God’s spirit.
00:12:24 Learning another language may be one way
00:12:27 that we can expand our ministry.
00:12:29 But it’s not the only way.
00:12:34 Where is the greatest need for preachers?
00:12:38 Where is there evidence of growth?
00:12:41 It might be in the field of your primary language.
00:12:46 For practical advice on where your efforts and abilities
00:12:50 are most needed,
00:12:52 speak to your circuit overseer
00:12:54 or write to your local branch office.
00:12:58 Jehovah’s organization is on the move,
00:13:02 and it will not be stopped by the pandemic
00:13:05 or anything else!
00:13:10 Will this recent adjustment in priorities
00:13:13 lead to even greater increases?
00:13:16 Perhaps.
00:13:18 It’s too soon to say.
00:13:20 But we’re receiving positive reports.
00:13:24 One branch reported that they’ve had
00:13:27 ten consecutive peaks in the number of publishers.
00:13:31 And another branch said
00:13:33 that the number of new regular pioneers and new Bible studies
00:13:37  is growing at a pace never seen before.
00:13:43 The Governing Body has every confidence
00:13:46 that Jehovah will strengthen each of you
00:13:50 so that we can truly make our blows count.
00:13:55 We love all of you very much!

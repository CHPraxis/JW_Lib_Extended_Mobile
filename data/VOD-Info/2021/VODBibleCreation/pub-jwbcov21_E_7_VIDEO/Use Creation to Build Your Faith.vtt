Yet, the energy from the sun

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reaches the earth is thousands of times

With our unaided eyes,

00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:38.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might see about 3,000 stars

The Milky Way galaxy

00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:55.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

is just one of perhaps

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
200 to 400 billion stars.

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:07.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Astronomers think the Milky Way galaxy

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:12.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is clustered together
with around 100,000 large galaxies

00:01:12.847 --> 00:01:16.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a massive structure called a supercluster

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:22.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that together with an estimated
two trillion galaxies

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:25.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make up the known physical universe.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Countless stars

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:36.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread over unfathomable distances,

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:39.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
releasing immense amounts of energy

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be impossible to grasp for us

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not for Jehovah.

00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:48.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He counts the number of the stars;

00:01:48.427 --> 00:01:51.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he calls all of them by name.

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:55.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Lord is great and is mighty in power.”

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions of cubic meters of water

00:02:06.613 --> 00:02:10.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circulate continually around our planet.

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Near the poles, water that is colder,

00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saltier, and denser sinks,

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
creating a flow almost 100 times

that of the Amazon River.

00:02:47.114 --> 00:02:50.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This drives a massive circulation of water

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:54.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may take 1,000 years to complete

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the global ocean conveyor belt.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This enormous system distributes heat,

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helps to stabilize the weather

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:18.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and transport great quantities

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:21.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of nutrients around the world

00:03:21.442 --> 00:03:24.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that life

00:03:24.278 --> 00:03:26.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may flourish in abundance.

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:47.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah set these mechanisms in motion

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and understands them perfectly.

00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:55.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You rule over the raging of the sea;

00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:59.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when its waves surge, you calm them.”

00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trees can grow very strong

00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:13.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and withstand powerful forces.

00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:23.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if they didn’t decompose after they die,

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:26.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trees and leaves would pile up

00:04:26.052 --> 00:04:29.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their nutrients locked away inside.

00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:31.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, they do decompose.

00:04:31.683 --> 00:04:33.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:39.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most animals cannot eat
fallen wood and leaves,

00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:43.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but fungi can.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:48.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They break down the dead plant tissues,

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making them softer.

00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:53.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beetles and termites

00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:57.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bore through the wood,
exposing more surface area

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spreading the fungi inside,

00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which soften it further
so that other insects

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:05.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can enjoy the feast.

00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:10.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earthworms aerate the soil

00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:13.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pull nutrients down
where they can be used by other plants.

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:20.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Decomposers have been called

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the unsung heroes of the natural world.

00:05:26.616 --> 00:05:29.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They recycle organic matter
so that it is available

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:32.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support new life.

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:35.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through this process,

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:40.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made it possible for us
to enjoy earth’s lush beauty

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—generation after generation.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the fields

“At the same time let all the trees

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail

00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:21.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—though it is made of ice,
it is very different from snow.

00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:30.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail usually forms in warm weather

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when turbulent air produces thunderstorms

00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:36.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with powerful updrafts.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:41.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those updrafts can pull a piece of dust

00:06:41.028 --> 00:06:44.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ice high into the cloud,
where water freezes around it.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each trip up into the cloud
adds a layer of ice

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waits

00:06:51.623 --> 00:06:53.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it becomes

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:57.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a hailstone that is heavy enough to fall.

00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:05.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hailstorms can be powerfully destructive.

00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:12.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One deadly storm dropped hailstones

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weighing more than one kilogram (2 lbs) each.

00:07:18.443 --> 00:07:22.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used hail to demonstrate his power

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and defend his people,

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:27.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as during
the seventh plague against Egypt.

00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:31.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Joshua fought the Amorites,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused a great hailstorm,

00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more Amorites died from the hailstones

00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than in battle.

00:07:41.676 --> 00:07:44.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail is also mentioned among the elements

00:07:44.679 --> 00:07:47.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will use in the future

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:49.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

The largest animal alive on earth today

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

—the blue whale.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue whales can grow to be

Its heart alone may weigh
several hundred kilograms.

00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:44.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does such a large creature
find enough to eat?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blue whale migrates great distances

00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:53.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find tiny crustaceans

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known as krill.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a blue whale

00:08:58.924 --> 00:09:01.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finds a school of krill,

00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it accelerates toward the krill

00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:06.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and opens its giant mouth.

00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:12.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may engulf
hundreds of kilograms of krill

00:09:12.146 --> 00:09:16.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with each lunge

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:18.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
amounting to several tons per day.

00:09:21.698 --> 00:09:24.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue whales eat a lot.

00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:30.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah provides for them,

00:09:35.963 --> 00:09:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will provide for us.

For their weight,

Bones can compress and bend,

but sometimes they break.

A fractured bone
can heal well if properly set.

Inflammation brings
organic building blocks to the area,

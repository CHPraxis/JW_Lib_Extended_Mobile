00:00:07 Please find your seats.
00:00:08 It’s time to start our graduation program.
00:00:13 We never dreamed this would happen.
00:00:17 This is a very special day all of us have been anxiously waiting for.
00:00:21 We’re happy to see all of you here.
00:00:23 It all started a few years ago.
00:00:28 If you’d like to have the circuit overseer  and his wife for a meal . . .
00:00:32 It was during that visit and this question.
00:00:36 His theme on Tuesday is
00:00:38 “What Lessons Can We Learn
00:00:41 From Philip the Evangelizer?”
00:00:44 Hmm.
00:00:45 What could we learn from Philip?
00:00:48 Honestly, we were already busy with the right things.
00:00:51 Lilly and the girls helped out wherever they could.
00:01:01 I worked on Kingdom Hall maintenance projects.
00:01:08 And we had a regular schedule for the ministry.
00:01:14 But like in a lot of places,
00:01:16 when someone showed interest,
00:01:18 it was tough to find them again.
00:01:27 I wondered if our spiritual routine needed an update.
00:01:41 Looking forward to that talk,
00:01:43 I decided we’d research Philip for family worship
00:01:50 —Acts chapter 6.
00:01:58 Philip was one of seven brothers
00:02:00 selected to distribute food to Christian widows in Jerusalem.
00:02:15 That was an important assignment,
00:02:19 but he did so much more than that.
00:02:40 Hmm, this is interesting.
00:02:44 Because of the persecution,
00:02:46 Philip had to flee from Jerusalem to Samaria.
00:03:11 Samaria hadn’t accepted the word of Jehovah yet.
00:03:34 But Philip saw that trial as a spiritual opportunity.
00:03:43 Samaria was largely untouched by the preaching work.
00:03:48 Philip declared the good news zealously,
00:03:56 and many believed and got baptized.
00:04:02 But sometime later,
00:04:06 an angel spoke with him.
00:04:11 He told Philip to “get up and go to the south.”
00:04:30 That led him to find the Ethiopian eunuch and preach in other cities.
00:04:36 Philip was willing to serve wherever there was a need.
00:04:40 And he always kept that evangelizing spirit.
00:04:43 Some twenty years later, he was still known as “the evangelizer.”
00:04:50 By that time, his life had changed.
00:04:55 He was a family man with four daughters.
00:05:02 But that didn’t stop him from showing hospitality
00:05:06 when Paul and his companions came to visit.
00:05:16 Visits like that must have been
00:05:18 full of spiritual lessons for his daughters.
00:05:26 That night, we came up with a few things we wanted to do.
00:05:31 We started by having the circuit overseer to lunch.
00:05:34 We hadn’t made time for that in a while.
00:05:41 Alex and Carla’s experiences
00:05:43 made the girls excited to reach their own spiritual goals.
00:05:58 But like Philip, changes came that we didn’t expect.
00:06:02 I was out of work for a few months.
00:06:09 It was a stressful time
00:06:13 but also a spiritual opportunity.
00:06:21 I could visit people at different times of the day.
00:06:31 We tried to make the most of the situation and preach zealously
00:06:36 like Philip.
00:06:42 And here we are,
00:06:44 watching our girls graduate from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:06:56 Those few lessons
00:06:58 made a big difference for this family
00:07:01 of evangelizers.

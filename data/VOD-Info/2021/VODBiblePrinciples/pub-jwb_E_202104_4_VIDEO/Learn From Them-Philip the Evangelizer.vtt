Please find your seats.

00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:11.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to start our graduation program.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never dreamed this would happen.

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a very special day
all of us have been anxiously waiting for.

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to see all of you here.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started a few years ago.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to have the circuit overseer 
and his wife for a meal . . .

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was during that visit and this question.

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme on Tuesday is

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Lessons Can We Learn

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Philip the Evangelizer?”

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could we learn from Philip?

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, we were already busy
with the right things.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lilly and the girls helped out
wherever they could.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked
on Kingdom Hall maintenance projects.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had
a regular schedule for the ministry.

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like in a lot of places,

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when someone showed interest,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was tough to find them again.

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered if our spiritual routine
needed an update.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking forward to that talk,

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided we’d research Philip
for family worship

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts chapter 6.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip was one of seven brothers

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
selected to distribute food
to Christian widows in Jerusalem.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:17.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an important assignment,

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did so much more than that.

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, this is interesting.

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:46.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the persecution,

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip had to flee from Jerusalem to Samaria.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samaria hadn’t accepted
the word of Jehovah yet.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Philip saw that trial
as a spiritual opportunity.

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samaria was largely untouched
by the preaching work.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip declared the good news zealously,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many believed and got baptized.

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometime later,

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:09.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an angel spoke with him.

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told Philip
to “get up and go to the south.”

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:35.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led him to find the Ethiopian eunuch
and preach in other cities.

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip was willing to serve
wherever there was a need.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:42.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he always kept that evangelizing spirit.

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some twenty years later,
he was still known as “the evangelizer.”

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that time, his life had changed.

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a family man with four daughters.

00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that didn’t stop him
from showing hospitality

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Paul and his companions came to visit.

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:18.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Visits like that must have been

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:20.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full of spiritual lessons for his daughters.

00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:29.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night, we came up
with a few things we wanted to do.

00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:34.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started by having
the circuit overseer to lunch.

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:37.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hadn’t made time for that in a while.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex and Carla’s experiences

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:46.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made the girls excited
to reach their own spiritual goals.

00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:02.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like Philip,
changes came that we didn’t expect.

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:05.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was out of work for a few months.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a stressful time

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also a spiritual opportunity.

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:24.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could visit people
at different times of the day.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:34.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tried to make the most
of the situation and preach zealously

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Philip.

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:44.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we are,

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:48.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching our girls graduate
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those few lessons

00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:01.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a big difference for this family

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:03.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of evangelizers.

00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in Ur was comfortable.

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all the modern conveniences.

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah gave us
an assignment we never expected

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:16.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one that meant saying goodbye
to the life we loved.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather than look behind,

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham and I looked ahead.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had seen Jehovah’s hand in our lives,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we knew he would be with us

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every step of the journey.

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was in ways that surprised us

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ways we never could have imagined.

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah did more than help us;

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:42.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he fulfilled his every promise.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying goodbye

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is never easy.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we were excited
about our new LDC assignment,

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was going to take us farther
than we’d ever been.

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just a new routine;

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a whole new way of life!

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each new move and project,

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:42.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we thought about Sarah.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She focused on the good things ahead

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not on what she’d left behind.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what we tried to do.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been so good to us.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t always know
where the next project would take us,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we did know that Jehovah would be with us

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:14.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every step of the way.

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:22.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jericho was doomed.

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:24.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People were scared.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Israelite men showed up at my door,

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was barely time to think.

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:32.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew what was at stake.

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:37.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even as a young girl,
I had heard all the stories.

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:39.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wasn’t like the other gods.

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had dried up the waters of the Red Sea

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:45.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given his people victory
over the Amorites.

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:51.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I helped these men,
I knew Jehovah would help me.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time in my life,

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was standing with Jehovah’s people

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s side.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my faith was being rewarded.

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no doubt about it.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had found the truth.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:22.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why did I feel so anxious?

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:49.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They displease him.

00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some changes in my life were easy to make.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I really needed Jehovah’s help
for what I had to do next.

00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:28.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my mom so much.

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I explained that I wouldn’t celebrate
the holidays anymore,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell that she was hurt.

00:05:45.032 --> 00:05:48.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I was doing the right thing

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed that Jehovah
would help her understand.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is going to be
a holiday season like no other

00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:01.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like this 36 megapixel DSLR camera kit
for just $399.

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:06.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would you believe this 65” 4K UHD
Smart TV is only $849?

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:08.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry in before it’s gone because these . . .

00:06:28.367 --> 00:06:32.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I admit I was surprised when she said
she wanted to learn more.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing!

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:38.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, I had found the truth,

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:41.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now maybe my family would find it too.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:51.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t sleep or eat.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt my hopes and dreams slipping away.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even if no one else really understood me,

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:01.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Jehovah would.

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:04.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him everything.

00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:09.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that the “God of justice”

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:12.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would set all matters right in his own time

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:14.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his own way.

00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:20.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered my prayer
in such a wonderful way.

00:07:20.252 --> 00:07:25.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never forgot
where this incredible blessing had come from.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:29.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no rock like our God.”

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:41.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:07:41.398 --> 00:07:43.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:05.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:08:32.032 --> 00:08:35.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to act like everything was fine

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:39.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I was fine,

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wasn’t.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:01.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Praying to Jehovah,

00:09:01.061 --> 00:09:05.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just knowing he would listen and understand

00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:09.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what got me through.

00:09:14.282 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one really knew what I was going through,

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even my friends.

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like Hannah

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:43.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—totally misunderstood.

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:49.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she had faith
that Jehovah would set matters straight.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did for Hannah and for me.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:07.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reminded me that I wouldn’t have to deal
with this illness alone.

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:17.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember the day the soldiers took me away.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never felt more alone.

00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:24.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My home, my friends,

00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:26.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything I knew was gone.

00:10:27.647 --> 00:10:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I still had Jehovah.

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:36.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The master of the house was very sick.

00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in pain.

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:41.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha could help him.

00:10:41.077 --> 00:10:43.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard about Elisha’s miracles.

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:46.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had even raised the dead.

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:49.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Elisha could cure him,

00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:54.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave me the courage to speak up.

00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:04.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken from my home,

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband,

00:11:09.356 --> 00:11:11.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my spiritual family.

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:16.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was imprisoned for my faith.

00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:27.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was another world.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy staying strong.

00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:44.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I asked for a Bible,
the answer was no.

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:56.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s Word was already in my heart.

00:11:57.696 --> 00:12:00.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I did what I love the most;

00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:03.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked about God’s Kingdom.

00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:09.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of those I preached to
seemed cold at first,

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:13.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but genuine love and the warmth of God’s Word

00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:15.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just seemed to melt their hearts.

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:22.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes speaking up
took more courage than I thought I had,

00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:26.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not more courage
than Jehovah could give me.

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:44.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to look
beyond the locks and uniforms.

00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:49.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s will is that “all sorts of people”
learn about him.

00:12:50.498 --> 00:12:54.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I spoke about my God, Jehovah.

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:30.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that even behind prison bars,

00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:32.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would give me the strength

00:13:34.459 --> 00:13:36.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others.

00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:46.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was engaged to marry Joseph.

00:13:46.096 --> 00:13:48.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we would have
a simple and quiet life.

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:53.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, suddenly, everything changed.

00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that God sometimes asks us
to do what is difficult.

00:13:57.273 --> 00:14:02.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this seemed impossible,
beyond anything we could handle.

00:14:02.028 --> 00:14:05.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I was safe in Jehovah’s hands.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we remained loyal to Him

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:11.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and did our best
to care for his precious Son,

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:14.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would always be loyal to us

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give us what we needed.

00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they first told me,
I thought it must have been a mistake.

00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:28.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, me

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:31.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—oversee a department
at an international convention?

00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:43.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like it was just too much to handle,

00:14:51.953 --> 00:14:56.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I remembered that I thought
the same thing years ago

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was asked to serve
on a Disaster Relief Committee

00:15:20.356 --> 00:15:23.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I served
on the Hospital Liaison Committee.

00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:42.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I’ve always felt that way

00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:44.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I’ve received
an assignment from Jehovah.

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I’ve learned is

00:15:51.763 --> 00:15:54.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s always ready to help.

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:08.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jehovah asks me
to do something that seems difficult,

00:16:09.447 --> 00:16:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just remind myself

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pray,

00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:15.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay loyal,

00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:17.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith

00:16:34.472 --> 00:16:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’ll give me what I need.

00:16:45.316 --> 00:16:48.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I was not Jewish,

00:16:48.862 --> 00:16:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I saw that this Jesus
was no ordinary man.

00:16:52.907 --> 00:16:55.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard about his power to help others,

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my daughter was suffering.

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t take no for an answer.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t.

00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was from God.

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:07.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was nowhere else to turn.

00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:10.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had faith in Jesus.

00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:13.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he heard me, he said:

00:17:13.136 --> 00:17:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let it happen to you as you wish.”

00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:19.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it did!

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My beautiful, precious daughter

00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:25.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was healthy and smiling again.

00:17:32.697 --> 00:17:34.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought it would happen.

00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:39.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finally found what I’d been searching for

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a good relationship with God.

00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:48.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day,

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:50.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a coworker texted an article

00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:53.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that claimed to expose Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:17:59.015 --> 00:18:01.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was tempted to read it,

00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:05.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I thought back

00:18:06.898 --> 00:18:09.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to when I first met Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:18:17.825 --> 00:18:20.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so excited about what they taught me
from the Bible

00:18:21.913 --> 00:18:24.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that God’s name is Jehovah,

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom is a real government,
and so much more.

00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:35.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I want to learn
about Jehovah’s Witnesses from their enemies?

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:41.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my friends?

00:18:46.729 --> 00:18:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so much.

00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw people who really loved one another.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a real brotherhood.

00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:15.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t just the people.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the truth!

00:19:44.954 --> 00:19:49.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t need to learn
about Jehovah’s Witnesses from their enemies.

00:19:55.006 --> 00:19:57.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had seen for myself

00:19:57.008 --> 00:20:00.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they worship the true God, Jehovah.

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:08.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those first few days,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was a blur.

00:20:10.938 --> 00:20:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sister, Mary, and I
had never felt so empty and lost.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that if our Lord had been here,

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:22.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brother would not have died.

00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:25.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through the tears and the pain,

00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:30.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no doubt
that the resurrection was real,

00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:32.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someday

00:20:32.543 --> 00:20:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—someday—
he would live again.

00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:37.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who could have imagined

00:20:37.924 --> 00:20:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could happen that very day

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right before our eyes?

00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wept tears of joy

00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:49.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thanked
our loving Father in heaven, Jehovah.

00:21:29.225 --> 00:21:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I lost my son,

00:21:33.146 --> 00:21:35.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost part of myself.

00:21:43.322 --> 00:21:45.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to stay busy,

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything felt empty.

00:22:19.442 --> 00:22:21.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my darkest times,

00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:24.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

00:22:57.271 --> 00:23:01.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a day goes by
that I don’t think about Brandon

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:07.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just memories of how it was

00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:13.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even more how wonderful it’ll be
to see him soon

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s new world.

00:23:29.303 --> 00:23:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For nearly a year,

00:23:31.347 --> 00:23:35.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had been held in solitary confinement

00:23:35.142 --> 00:23:40.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tiny, filthy, bug-infested prison cell.

00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:48.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five and a half years after my arrest,

00:23:48.614 --> 00:23:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was released.

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we truly rely on Jehovah,

00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:56.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really love him

00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:59.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cry out in our heart for his help,

00:23:59.917 --> 00:24:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he did not forsake me,

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:06.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will not forsake his servants.

00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:20.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrested me

00:24:20.813 --> 00:24:23.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took me in for questioning.

00:24:23.232 --> 00:24:26.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An interrogator invited me to sign a document

00:24:26.485 --> 00:24:29.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stating that I would discontinue preaching.

00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:34.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I would rather live in prison

00:24:34.493 --> 00:24:36.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with my relationship with God intact

00:24:36.912 --> 00:24:38.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than be free and lose his approval.”

00:24:42.001 --> 00:24:44.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My determination

00:24:44.003 --> 00:24:46.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been to heed the Bible’s admonition:

00:24:46.672 --> 00:24:50.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do good.”

00:24:50.551 --> 00:24:52.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned that doing this

00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:54.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leads to receiving

00:24:54.805 --> 00:24:57.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the requests of your heart.”

00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:13.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the world went from bad to worse,

00:25:16.494 --> 00:25:19.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I dug deeper into God’s Word.

00:25:36.013 --> 00:25:37.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to stay strong,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like so many
brothers and sisters in the past.

00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:46.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who remained faithful
had no special abilities

00:25:46.524 --> 00:25:48.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were inconspicuous.

00:25:48.776 --> 00:25:53.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Surely all of us
must always trust in Jehovah

00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:55.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all our heart.”

00:25:57.785 --> 00:25:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I memorized scriptures.

00:26:00.746 --> 00:26:03.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew these words would build my faith

00:26:07.503 --> 00:26:10.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give me the strength I needed
to face what was to come.

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:34.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new wave of arrests occurred this week

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as local authorities enforce new restrictions
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:26:38.492 --> 00:26:40.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is coming just 14 days
after the Supreme Court’s ruling . . .

00:26:54.508 --> 00:26:58.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:10.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.

00:27:11.567 --> 00:27:13.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:17.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:22.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to be more discreet,

00:27:22.536 --> 00:27:24.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never stopped talking
about God’s Word.

00:27:30.085 --> 00:27:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to face many difficulties,

00:27:32.755 --> 00:27:35.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with God’s Word embedded in our hearts,

00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:39.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we faithfully endured to the end.

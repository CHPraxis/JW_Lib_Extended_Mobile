Everything happened so fast.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone thought
that because so much blood was lost,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my life was in danger
and I would need a blood transfusion.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The medical professionals

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were describing treatments

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I wasn’t familiar with.

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was (in my mind) trying to think:
‘Have I heard of this?

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:24.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I know what this is?

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have I read about it?’

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:28.716 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
She explained that it was 

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a complicated surgery

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that because I didn’t take blood,

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be obviously more serious.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:40.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love life, and in any medical situation,

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want treatments
that preserve or restore our health.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:48.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more important, we want to respect
the Creator of life and his law on blood.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:53.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God first spoke that law to Noah’s family.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Flood, God told them

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the animals could serve as food,
but he added:

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only flesh with its life
—its blood—you must not eat.”

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blood represents the life of a creature
and should not be misused.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God repeated this law to ancient Israel
with clear instructions:

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not eat it.

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should pour it out on the ground
like water.”

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the same for early Christians.

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They received written direction to

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“keep abstaining . .. from blood.”

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses still obey
that command today,

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it can be a challenge
to understand

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how that command should be applied

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the numerous medical treatments
now available.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Donated whole blood is often separated

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.828 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
into its four main components

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—red cells, white cells,

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
platelets, and plasma.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:46.961 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We abstain from blood by refusing to accept

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a transfusion of whole blood

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.090 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or of any of those four main components.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did one brother demonstrate
the strength necessary

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to abstain from blood during an emergency?

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to blood,

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to be prepared.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what I did.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I researched it, and I prayed to Jehovah

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could understand his thoughts

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow them.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I wrote down my wishes.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:19.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought that I would have
such an accident.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very thankful to Jehovah

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he helped me understand
all of these things,

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of that,

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to make and stick
to a decision that pleases him.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blood fractions are things 
that are extracted from any one 

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:41.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the four main blood components.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:42.599 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible does not provide

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.642 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
specific direction

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:45.394 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about using these fractions.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.187 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So to accept them or not

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:48.731 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is a personal decision.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some believe that a small, isolated fraction
is no longer blood.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:56.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others feel they can’t use anything
that came from blood.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did one sister make an informed decision

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about which medications
containing blood fractions to accept?

00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it came to fractions,
for me, the challenge

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was figuring out what I really felt about it
and deciding for myself

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I would or wouldn’t accept and why.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At stake is our relationship with Jehovah

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having a clean conscience before him.

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:23.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s something that no one else
could have done for me.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make clear to my doctor

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I absolutely would not accept blood

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or any of the four main components.

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I also explained to him

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what medications and other treatments
I was willing to accept.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What questions should Christians
ask themselves

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about medical procedures
involving their own blood?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if during the course

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:47.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a therapy or procedure

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:49.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of my blood will be diverted

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside my body

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the flow might be interrupted for a time?

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:55.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does my conscience allow me

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to view this blood as still part of me,

00:03:57.424 --> 00:03:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus not requiring

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it be poured “out on the ground”?

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:04.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if during a medical procedure

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of my own blood will be withdrawn,

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
modified, and directed back

00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into (or onto) my body?

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:12.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it trouble my Bible-trained conscience?

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:14.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could I accept such a procedure?

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I aware that refusing

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all medical procedures
involving the use of my own blood

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means that I would not accept a blood test,

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hemodialysis, or the use
of a heart-lung bypass machine?

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:30.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did one sister do to ensure
she made a decision

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would not disturb her conscience?

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my doctor presented me
with an effective, alternative procedure.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:39.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was something that I knew about,

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:41.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I asked her to clarify the details
to make sure

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:44.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what she was talking about
was OK with my conscience.

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I made it a personal study project,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also asked a mature friend

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help me go through all the information.

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:56.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made my decision with a clean conscience,

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I knew it would make
Jehovah’s heart glad.

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you make informed decisions
about the medical use of blood?

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for God’s wisdom and holy spirit.

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:10.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate on what the Bible teaches,

00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn about the medical treatments
that may be offered to you.

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If needed, ask for help
to understand the options.

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, put your decisions in writing.

00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:25.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God knows what is best for us.

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:27.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when our resolve to obey him is tested,

00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:30.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he doesn’t want us to feel alone.

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to help us.

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we accept this help and show respect
for life that comes from him,

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:40.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can look forward to a paradise
with perfect health and everlasting life.

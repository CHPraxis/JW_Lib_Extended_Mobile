Right about the time

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I started studying the Bible,

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:08.529 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
an opportunity came up for me

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to start doing secretarial work

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.991 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at a church.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.536 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was the one who cared for all

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the money that the church would receive.

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at that moment,
I didn’t see any problem

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:25.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with staying where I worked.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I studied the Bible
and learned that the festivals

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to participate in

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were displeasing to Jehovah.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it did not seem possible

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I would be
the only one not participating

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in those festivals.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These opportunities
brought families closer together,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were fun too.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night at a meeting,

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was talking with an elder,

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and he told me that I wouldn’t even be able

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:59.496 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to give student parts at the Kingdom Hall,

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:01.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
since I was still working

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.416 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as a secretary at the church.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.171 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That made me very sad

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I found myself
just receiving guidance from Jehovah

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learning his truths,

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was not giving back anything to him

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite what he was doing for me.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
However, I have to admit

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:23.479 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I still hadn’t

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
completely made up my mind,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
since my husband had back surgery

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wasn’t able to work at the time.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had our little daughter to care for,

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so I kept thinking: ‘What should I do?

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:36.367 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Right now,

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.661 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this is the only money we have coming in.’

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed a lot to Jehovah

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for help with this issue.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about Jehovah’s feelings.

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to do anything
that hurt Jehovah.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I stopped participating
in religious festivals,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family stopped speaking to me.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:04.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it was time for the festivals,

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made me think that they were together

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was by myself.

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at times, I cried.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I meditated

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:22.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on God’s promise at Psalm 27:10.

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:28.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised me
that if my parents abandoned me,

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:31.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would receive me as his child.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped me to stand firm.

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Personally, I tried to attend the meetings

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and participate in the ministry too.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these activities

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:49.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me feel
that the congregation is like a family

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the Father of all of us.

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I never forgot my parents.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I tried to help them
in whatever ways I could.

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took about three or four days of vacation

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go help them harvest rice.

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had great help from my instructor.

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah doesn’t force us,
she didn’t force me.

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:25.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As she told experiences and showed me

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:28.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible
what really pleases Jehovah,

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made me realize
that I had to make a decision.

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As my Bible study got deeper,

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize
that I really was already loving Jehovah

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to please him.

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.789 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before Jehovah, my conscience

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.582 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was already affecting me.

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:51.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had to make a decision on his side.

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.214 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s exactly what I did.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two weeks later, I got a job,

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was close to my home.

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:08.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to gain
a clean conscience before Jehovah.

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen this in my life:

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyone who trusts in Jehovah is not helpless.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:23.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I told my parents
that although I changed my religion,

00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still loved them,

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:30.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they started to open up
and talk to me gradually.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I invited them to attend a meeting.

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my father
attended the meeting, he said:

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh! You made a good decision, my son.”

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I was very happy.

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:50.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still hope

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my family will one day study the Bible

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worship Jehovah along with me.

I didn’t have a problem with polygamy

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I too was in a polygamous marriage.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I viewed myself as a good wife;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was the second wife.

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to work at the mines
in Carletonville, South Africa.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family lived in Botswana,
in Gaborone.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a girlfriend,
and we had three children.

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:28.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My church didn’t see
anything wrong with what I was doing

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that was a common practice.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were just married
according to Cambodian tradition.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we never legally registered our marriage.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a Bible.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I learned from it really touched me.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.410 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was wrong to be in a polygamous marriage.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother
who was studying the Bible with me

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saw a picture of my family.

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked me about the picture,

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I told him that it was
my girlfriend and my kids.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We then studied the lesson
which talks about family life,

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I realized that I
had to make changes in my life.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I wanted to start preaching,

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that Jehovah requires

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we legalize our marriage.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:32.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had prayed,

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah, if you really have drawn me

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and are pleased with me,

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“please help me get the birth certificate

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:48.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the money needed to make the trip.”

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really troubled me

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a very long time.

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another thing that made it difficult

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave him was the fact

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had ten children.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I saw that loving this man
shouldn’t prevent me

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from becoming someone worthy to God.

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said, “I’m leaving.”

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As for the local community,

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would comment about me:

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This lady is a rebel.
She stole a man’s children.”

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:26.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once I did leave,
I felt as if something

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was being lifted off of me.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went back home

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got married to my wife.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This enabled me
and my family to be together

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one place
where we could serve Jehovah

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a family.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I quit my job,
I spent a whole year unemployed.

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We planted some vegetables

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our yard,
and that helped us

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get by.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To my surprise,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Bible study conductor called me

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:59.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and invited me to go to Takeo.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very far away, really far!

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:05.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I mentioned the names of my parents,

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extended family, and relatives,

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to get my birth certificate.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We submitted

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an application for a marriage certificate

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received it two weeks later.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My previous husband eventually became

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:24.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My best friend now is the first wife
from my polygamous marriage.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so proud to see

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family serving Jehovah,

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see that they love Jehovah,

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:41.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see them obeying Jehovah’s laws.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I eventually got baptized.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also preached to my husband,

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he agreed to start studying the Bible.

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:53.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am really grateful to Jehovah.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is merciful to the poor
and to the lowliest

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like me.

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I fully relied on Jehovah,

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he made everything happen.

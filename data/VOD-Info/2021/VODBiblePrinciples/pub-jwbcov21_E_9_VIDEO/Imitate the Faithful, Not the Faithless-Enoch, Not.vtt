We’re the only ones without a gun.

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to keep a gun for protection.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how else can I protect my family?

“Faith is the assured expectation
of what is hoped for.”

I do have faith in God’s promises,

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t Jehovah understand?

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:10.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I couldn’t do that.

Enoch lived among extreme violence,

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he walked with God.

I can imitate his faith.

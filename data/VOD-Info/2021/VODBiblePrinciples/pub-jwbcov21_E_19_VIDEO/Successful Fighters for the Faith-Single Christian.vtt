Brothers, it’s hard to believe
this is our last time together.

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a packed agenda,
so let’s get started.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first point . . .

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is our last week
with our circuit overseer

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he leaves us
for his new circuit assignment.

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick has been a great circuit overseer

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spiritually mature, experienced,

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and patient with us.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom, your thought?

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers and sisters . . .

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick is single.

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sadly, there were plenty of times

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:35.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we turned that gift into a challenge

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ever since his first visit.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Jeff.

00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I have a minute.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that.

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laundry night.

00:00:57.786 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My washing machine is a clunker.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just assumed a single brother
had lots of free time.

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know how much he had to do
on his own.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:12.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a lot more I didn’t understand.

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you. Bye!

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, look!

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have something there.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like a great Bible study.

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t wait to meet her.

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.
See you then.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would be really good . . .

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what you’re waiting for.

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For what?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on!

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A single circuit overseer, a pioneer sister

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you’ve got to be looking for a C.O.’s wife.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, . . .

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teasing was so inappropriate

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was there at every visit.

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there were those trying to be,

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how should I say, <i>helpful.</i>

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to meet them,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I invited them for lunch Saturday.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick never asked for that help.

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All it did was put him

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and plenty of sisters
in an awkward situation.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he dealt with week after week.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all failed at times
to see past the single person

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the spiritual man giving Jehovah his best.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll miss you.

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just maybe not as much
as some of the sisters.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to make that mistake again

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:51.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with any single brother or sister.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rick.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeff.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned a lot from you.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I hope Jehovah blesses you
wherever you go.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!
Thanks, Rick.

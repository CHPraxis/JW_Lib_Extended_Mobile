Its wondrous thoughts
are charged with such great power;

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brings life to the “dead,”
sight to the “blind.”

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That precious book
is God’s own Holy Bible.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:37.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its words were penned
by men whom God inspired,

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By men who truly loved
their God Jehovah,

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by his holy spirit
they were fired.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wrote a record true
of God’s creations,

How by his might
this universe appeared.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also told how man
at first was sinless

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how his Paradise
then disappeared.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They further told
about a certain angel

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who challenged God
and spurned his sov’reignty.

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:22.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That challenge led to sin
and man’s great sorrow,

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But soon will come
Jehovah’s victory.

with reason for rejoicing:

Jehovah rules
by his anointed King.

So now we preach
the good news of the Kingdom

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And share the hope
of blessings it will bring.

these cheerful tidings;

A sacred banquet feast
on which to feed.

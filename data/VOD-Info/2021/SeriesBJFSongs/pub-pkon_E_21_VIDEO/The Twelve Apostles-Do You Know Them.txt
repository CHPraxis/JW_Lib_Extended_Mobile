00:00:08 When Jesus was on earth, he had some very special friends.
00:00:17 They were called apostles, and there were twelve of them.
00:00:24 They were there when Jesus healed the sick, the blind, the deaf, and lame.
00:00:33 Now let’s try to remember all twelve of them by name.
00:00:40 There was Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Judas, Matthew,
00:00:56 The other James, Simon, and Thaddaeus, And don’t forget Bartholomew.
00:01:08 They were men who spent their time with Jesus preaching.
00:01:17 They were working hard to listen to Jesus’ teachings.
00:01:24 But one of them disobeyed; he did not keep his faith.
00:01:33 Now let’s try to remember all twelve of them by name.
00:01:41 There was Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Judas, Matthew,
00:01:56 The other James, Simon, and Thaddaeus, And don’t forget Bartholomew.

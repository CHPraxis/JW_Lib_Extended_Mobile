00:00:12 Life had changed for Naomi, For she had lost her sons.
00:00:21 Though Ruth was sad, she comforted Naomi with her love.
00:00:31 Ruth truly was a friend On whom Naomi could depend.
00:00:41 Ruth said when needed most: “Where you go I will go.”
00:00:53 “Where you go I will go.”
00:00:59 They stuck together side by side, Living for the truth.
00:01:09 Jehovah saw and blessed the love That was shown by Ruth.
00:01:18 There is so much to learn from them, Like how to be a loyal friend.
00:01:29 These words I will echo: “Where you go I will go.”
00:01:38 When my friends are sad, I’ll stick to them.
00:01:43 That’s when I’m needed most.
00:01:47 I’ll be a shoulder to cry on, Someone to rely on.
00:01:53 I’ll be a true friend.
00:02:01 “Where you go I will go.”
00:02:11 “Where you go I will go.”

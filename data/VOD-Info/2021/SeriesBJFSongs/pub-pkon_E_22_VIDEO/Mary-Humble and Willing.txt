00:00:06 To Mary’s home in Galilee, Jehovah’s angel came one day.
00:00:14 That angel’s name was Gabriel, And this is what he had to say:
00:00:22 ‘Jehovah chose you as the one To be the mother of his Son.
00:00:30 The power of God will be with you, And there is nothing he can’t do.’
00:00:38 So Mary kept these words in her heart, And she agreed to do her own part.
00:00:47 I can learn from Mary; I can be as faithful;
00:00:51 I can have a part in things God does— Listen and obey and make Jehovah happy.
00:00:59 I can be like Mary was.
00:01:03 Inside her was a miracle; It was the seed of Jesus’ life.
00:01:12 Then Joseph did as he was told, And Mary then became his wife.
00:01:20 The child was born in Bethlehem, With just a manger for his bed.
00:01:28 It all came true as prophesied; It happened just as God had said.
00:01:36 And so they raised him up as a boy, And Jesus brought his parents much joy.
00:01:45 I can learn from Mary; I can be as faithful;
00:01:49 I can have a part in things God does— Listen and obey and make Jehovah happy.
00:01:57 I can be like Mary was.
00:02:00 I can learn from Mary; I can be as faithful;
00:02:05 I can have a part in things God does— Listen and obey and make Jehovah happy.
00:02:14 I can be like Mary was.

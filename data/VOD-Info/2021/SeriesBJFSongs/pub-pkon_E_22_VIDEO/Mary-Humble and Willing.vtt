To Mary’s home in Galilee,
Jehovah’s angel came one day.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That angel’s name was Gabriel,
And this is what he had to say:

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah chose you as the one
To be the mother of his Son.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The power of God will be with you,
And there is nothing he can’t do.’

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Mary kept these words in her heart,
And she agreed to do her own part.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:51.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can learn from Mary;
I can be as faithful;

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can have a part in things God does—
Listen and obey and make Jehovah happy.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can be like Mary was.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside her was a miracle;
It was the seed of Jesus’ life.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:20.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Joseph did as he was told,
And Mary then became his wife.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:28.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The child was born in Bethlehem,
With just a manger for his bed.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all came true as prophesied;
It happened just as God had said.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they raised him up as a boy,
And Jesus brought his parents much joy.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:49.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can learn from Mary;
I can be as faithful;

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:57.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can have a part in things God does—
Listen and obey and make Jehovah happy.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:00.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can be like Mary was.

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can learn from Mary;
I can be as faithful;

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can have a part in things God does—
Listen and obey and make Jehovah happy.

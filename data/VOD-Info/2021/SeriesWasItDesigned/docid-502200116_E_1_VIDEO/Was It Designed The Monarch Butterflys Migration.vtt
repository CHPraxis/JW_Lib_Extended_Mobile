Every spring

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the eastern monarch butterfly
begins a migration

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:16.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that rivals that of some birds and whales.

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:23.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does such a delicate insect
make such a long trip?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Monarchs are strong, efficient flyers

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to their wing shape
and the way they flap them.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may also glide
on air currents for an extra boost.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spring, millions of monarch butterflies

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leave central Mexico.

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.031 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They fly northeast

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:53.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for several hundred miles,

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:54.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where they reach

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the end of their lifespan.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, the end of their life

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t mean the end of the journey.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before they die, they lay eggs.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:17.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next generation hatches, matures,

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeps flying north again and again

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:24.439 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until up to four generations later

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.731 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when the great

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.984 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and great-great grandchildren

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:29.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the original monarchs

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:31.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
occupy their summer home

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:32.238 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
mostly throughout

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:33.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the northeastern United States.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They perform this multigenerational relay

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no training, no map,

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a brain no larger than the head of a pin.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, one thing they do have is

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:50.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a solar compass.

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells them what direction to fly

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relative to the sun

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when it’s behind clouds.

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:04.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A clock in their antennae
adjusts their heading

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the sun moves across the sky.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:12.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Monarchs also have an annual clock

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that tells them when to begin their journey

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back to Mexico
before the weather turns too cold.

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the trip home is not so easy.

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:23.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need more than efficient flying

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and good navigation to succeed

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:28.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this generation

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:30.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will fly the entire journey back,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stretching over almost 3,000 miles.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The monarchs prepare for their journey

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:38.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an unexpected way.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They stop producing eggs temporarily

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:44.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and instead build muscle and store fat.

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:46.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They grow larger,

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:48.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can fly almost ten times as far,

00:02:48.982 --> 00:02:51.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and live up to eight times as long.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re a butterfly “super generation.”

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their compass heading
flips from north to south.

00:02:59.576 --> 00:03:01.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And off they go.

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.789 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In about two months,

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:05.957 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they arrive back

00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:08.293 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to their point of origin in Mexico

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:11.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a place neither they nor their parents,

00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:13.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grandparents,

00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:15.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor perhaps even their great-grandparents

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have ever seen.

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:21.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Researchers hope that a better understanding
of the monarch butterfly

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:25.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help create
efficient, long-range, micro-air vehicles.

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:29.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the monarch butterfly’s ability

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:32.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to migrate long distances evolve?

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:34.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

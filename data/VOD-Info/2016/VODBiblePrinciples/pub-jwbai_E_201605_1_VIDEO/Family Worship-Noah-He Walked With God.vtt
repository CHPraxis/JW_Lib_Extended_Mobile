00:00.784 --> 00:03.219
An important aspect

00:03.219 --> 00:06.956
of keeping 
the family’s spiritual health intact

00:06.956 --> 00:11.561
is by making full use 
of the Family Worship arrangement.

00:11.561 --> 00:14.831
In this dramatization, 
pay attention

00:14.831 --> 00:18.101
to how the family head 
is aware of the needs of the family

00:18.101 --> 00:20.704
and how he plans accordingly.

00:20.704 --> 00:24.174
Hi, my name is Joe.

00:24.174 --> 00:26.776
A few weeks ago, 
we all sat together for supper.

00:28.111 --> 00:32.582
I was so tired, and my wife, 
Jenny, felt the same way.

00:32.582 --> 00:36.920
She always does it all, 
taking care of the children so well,

00:36.920 --> 00:39.289
but it was not easy 
for her in recent weeks.

00:39.289 --> 00:43.693
Sarah felt that we are too restrictive 
on how she dresses.

00:43.693 --> 00:45.829
She just does not understand.

00:45.829 --> 00:47.964
It was hard to convince her.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.500
And to motivate her 
to share in the field service

00:50.500 --> 00:52.502
is becoming a challenge.

00:52.502 --> 00:54.537
It was not always like this.

00:54.537 --> 00:57.073
She used to enjoy 
going out in field service.

00:57.073 --> 01:00.009
And Tom, 
he is such a good boy,

01:00.009 --> 01:03.213
but all of a sudden, 
he was raving about the games

01:03.213 --> 01:06.082
his classmates 
have on their phones.

01:06.082 --> 01:09.619
It’s always 
about having supernatural powers,

01:09.619 --> 01:12.889
and it fascinated him, 
even though he is small.

01:12.889 --> 01:15.558
But when I asked him 
to take out the garbage,

01:15.558 --> 01:18.161
suddenly 
his superpowers left him.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.064
And Mike,

01:21.064 --> 01:23.733
our smallest,

01:23.733 --> 01:25.835
it was hard 
to get him to go to bed

01:25.835 --> 01:29.072
or clean up his room.

01:29.072 --> 01:33.076
I realized there are a few things 
we need to speak about.

01:34.844 --> 01:39.382
Joe came to me, and we talked 
a lot about our children that same evening.

01:39.382 --> 01:41.885
We wondered, 
‘What would be the best for them?’

01:41.885 --> 01:44.888
We prayed together.

01:44.888 --> 01:47.557
Then we had an idea!

01:48.825 --> 01:52.061
The following day 
we asked our children

01:52.061 --> 01:55.799
if we could consider Noah 
as the theme for our next family worship.

01:55.799 --> 01:58.067
All of us liked the idea.

01:58.067 --> 02:00.436
Each one of us 
should prepare something.

02:02.338 --> 02:04.674
Mike, Tom, and I 
wanted to build the ark.

02:13.016 --> 02:16.286
And, of course, 
we need the animals.

02:18.688 --> 02:21.524
And Sarah 
should collect pictures

02:21.524 --> 02:25.395
for the story 
from our publications.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.532
I also had to take time 
to think again about the story of Noah

02:29.532 --> 02:32.869
and how it 
can help our family.

02:32.869 --> 02:36.206
Jenny and Sarah were responsible 
for the wardrobe and food.

02:36.206 --> 02:38.608
While preparing, 
I got the chance

02:38.608 --> 02:43.012
to speak with Sarah about her dress 
in a more relaxed setting.

02:43.012 --> 02:45.515
She understood that, 
like Noah,

02:45.515 --> 02:49.452
when it comes to Jehovah’s commands, 
we need to do “just so.”

02:51.054 --> 02:54.724
Then the evening arrived.

02:54.724 --> 02:57.994
We talked about 
how it was before the Flood

02:57.994 --> 03:01.264
and what kind of world 
Noah and his family lived in.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.901
Noah’s family needed 
real courage to preach.

03:04.901 --> 03:09.239
They had to explain about the rain 
and how the ark would be needed

03:09.239 --> 03:14.010
to survive the Flood
—something that had never happened before.

03:14.010 --> 03:18.181
All the people 
thought they were crazy!

03:18.181 --> 03:21.451
And while we were talking 
about this, it came out

03:21.451 --> 03:26.122
that Sarah felt embarrassed when she met 
a schoolmate in the field service recently.

03:26.122 --> 03:31.027
I realized Noah must have felt 
the same as me,

03:31.027 --> 03:33.763
and yet, 
he was so courageous.

03:33.763 --> 03:36.900
Dad read Genesis 6:9:

03:36.900 --> 03:40.036
“Noah walked with the true God.”

03:40.036 --> 03:43.306
So he could have every confidence 
in his Friend, Jehovah.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.509
I want to be just like that!

03:46.509 --> 03:50.079
For Tom, 
I found a great picture.

03:50.079 --> 03:53.816
Dad told us that the world 
at this time was very bad.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.486
People were fighting 
and many were afraid,

03:56.486 --> 03:59.155
and that is why 
Jehovah brought the Flood.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.425
It made me think 
about the games from my schoolmates.

04:02.425 --> 04:06.496
I like to play those games, 
but I know that Jehovah does not like that.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.798
So why do I?

04:08.798 --> 04:13.202
And the best part 
was when we got inside the ark!

04:14.871 --> 04:17.874
Then I read Genesis 6:19:

04:17.874 --> 04:19.876
“And bring into the ark

04:19.876 --> 04:23.379
two of every sort 
of living creature.”

04:23.379 --> 04:26.516
Dad showed us 
how the animals went into the ark.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.118
Each one had its own place,

04:29.118 --> 04:33.856
and they went inside 
two at a time without any chaos.

04:33.856 --> 04:38.661
I explained that we also need 
to keep our rooms clean like the ark.

04:38.661 --> 04:42.432
I saw that Mike got the point.

04:42.432 --> 04:46.769
We wanted 
to keep in mind Genesis 6:22:

04:46.769 --> 04:50.907
“And Noah did according to all 
that God had commanded him.

04:50.907 --> 04:54.410
He did just so.”

04:54.410 --> 04:57.847
And then the rain came, 
but we survived!

04:57.847 --> 04:59.849
That was great!

04:59.849 --> 05:02.118
We all realized

05:02.118 --> 05:05.188
Noah also must have been 
tired sometimes,

05:05.188 --> 05:07.190
but he never gave up.

05:07.190 --> 05:11.194
This was a good lesson for us.

05:11.194 --> 05:14.197
We must take care 
of our family as Noah did,

05:14.197 --> 05:17.533
also by having 
a regular family worship

05:17.533 --> 05:19.869
like this.

05:21.938 --> 05:24.073
That example really showed

05:24.073 --> 05:27.610
many of the great benefits 
of family worship.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.879
In addition to the obvious

05:29.879 --> 05:33.349
—coming together to learn 
more about our heavenly Father

05:33.349 --> 05:36.285
—we saw how family worship 
gave the daughter

05:36.285 --> 05:38.821
an opportunity 
to open up about matters

05:38.821 --> 05:40.823
that had been bothering her.

05:40.823 --> 05:42.959
And thanks to the good work 
of the parents,

05:42.959 --> 05:45.094
all of the children 
learned something

05:45.094 --> 05:58.401
they could apply 
in their daily lives.

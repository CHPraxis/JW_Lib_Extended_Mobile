00:14 That’s my roommate, Camille.
00:18 And, well,
00:21 that’s me.
00:24 I haven’t felt like myself recently.
00:27 I started regular pioneering  a couple of years ago.
00:31 At first, I was really zealous.
00:37 But somewhere down the line,
00:40 I lost that good feeling.
00:46 Soon, I was losing my joy  for almost everything.
00:58 I honestly didn’t know  what was wrong.
01:03 It wasn’t like I was doing  anything bad.
01:07 I thought,
01:09 ‘Maybe I’m just tired.’
01:14 But it wasn’t getting better.
01:19 I tried to assess what was going on with myself.
01:23 I felt love for Jehovah.
01:26 I felt love for the congregation,
01:29 but I felt unmotivated in my service.
01:33 I felt like something was missing.
01:47 As my enthusiasm waned,
01:50 my meeting attendance suffered too.
01:58 Thankfully, the loving elders  in my congregation noticed,
02:05 and help was on the way.
02:12 The brothers visited  to see how I was doing.
02:18 They really listened to me,
02:23 and they asked about  my spiritual routine.
02:27 Well, I read the Bible every day,
02:29 but, I admitted,  I’m not a natural study person.
02:33 They reminded me  about the example of Mary,
02:37 Jesus’ mother.
02:39 At first, I didn’t see the link,
02:42 but as we read from the Bible,  it became more clear.
02:54 Mary was known   for being a faithful woman.
03:00 But what kept her faith strong?
03:11 The Bible account said  that Mary paid careful attention
03:15 to words that had  deep spiritual meaning
03:18 and later took time to meditate,
03:21 “drawing conclusions in her heart.”
03:31 By meditating on spiritual things,
03:35 Mary strengthened her faith  and zeal for serving Jehovah.
03:44 I understand now.
03:46 I was reading spiritual food,  but I wasn’t taking time to digest it,
03:50 so it wasn’t sinking  down into my heart.
03:53 As a result,  I was on a direct path
03:57 to spiritual burnout  if I didn’t change something quick!
04:01 I began by taking control  of my busy schedule.
04:04 I made it a priority  to start my day with Bible reading.
04:09 I sought out quiet places
04:12 where I could meditate on what I read.
04:15 Meaningful Bible study reinvigorated
04:18 my passion for serving Jehovah,
04:23 and prayerful meditation
04:25 helped me to refocus.
04:32 Over time,  making these changes
04:35 helped me to find joy  in my service to Jehovah again.
04:47 The Bible says when we make time
04:50 to read and meditate on spiritual things,
04:54 we will become  “like a tree planted by streams of water,”
04:59 with foliage that never withers.
05:02 And everything we do will succeed.

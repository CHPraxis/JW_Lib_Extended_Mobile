00:14.368 --> 00:18.121
That’s my roommate, Camille.


00:18.122 --> 00:21.542
And, well, 


00:21.542 --> 00:24.379
that’s me.


00:24.378 --> 00:27.798
I haven’t felt like myself recently. 


00:27.798 --> 00:31.968
I started regular pioneering 
a couple of years ago.


00:31.968 --> 00:35.000
At first, I was really zealous. 


00:37.975 --> 00:40.518
But somewhere down the line, 


00:40.518 --> 00:43.000
I lost that good feeling. 


00:46.442 --> 00:51.000
Soon, I was losing my joy 
for almost everything.


00:58.537 --> 01:01.000
I honestly didn’t know 
what was wrong. 


01:03.875 --> 01:07.128
It wasn’t like I was doing 
anything bad.


01:07.128 --> 01:09.130
I thought, 


01:09.130 --> 01:12.000
‘Maybe I’m just tired.’


01:14.803 --> 01:17.000
But it wasn’t getting better. 


01:19.683 --> 01:23.645
I tried to assess
what was going on with myself. 


01:23.645 --> 01:26.773
I felt love for Jehovah. 


01:26.773 --> 01:29.401
I felt love for the congregation, 


01:29.402 --> 01:33.280
but I felt unmotivated in my service. 


01:33.280 --> 01:37.000
I felt like something was missing.


01:47.628 --> 01:50.338
As my enthusiasm waned, 


01:50.338 --> 01:54.000
my meeting attendance suffered too. 


01:58.513 --> 02:03.000
Thankfully, the loving elders 
in my congregation noticed, 


02:05.520 --> 02:08.000
and help was on the way.


02:12.068 --> 02:16.000
The brothers visited 
to see how I was doing. 


02:18.825 --> 02:23.330
They really listened to me, 


02:23.330 --> 02:27.583
and they asked about 
my spiritual routine.


02:27.583 --> 02:29.503
Well, I read the Bible every day, 


02:29.503 --> 02:33.923
but, I admitted, 
I’m not a natural study person. 


02:33.923 --> 02:37.803
They reminded me 
about the example of Mary, 


02:37.803 --> 02:39.805
Jesus’ mother.


02:39.805 --> 02:42.140
At first, I didn’t see the link, 


02:42.140 --> 02:46.000
but as we read from the Bible, 
it became more clear.


02:54.903 --> 02:59.000
Mary was known  
for being a faithful woman. 


03:00.617 --> 03:04.000
But what kept her faith strong?


03:11.420 --> 03:15.465
The Bible account said 
that Mary paid careful attention 


03:15.465 --> 03:18.677
to words that had 
deep spiritual meaning 


03:18.677 --> 03:21.472
and later took time to meditate, 


03:21.472 --> 03:25.000
“drawing conclusions in her heart.”


03:31.898 --> 03:35.235
By meditating on spiritual things, 


03:35.235 --> 03:39.000
Mary strengthened her faith 
and zeal for serving Jehovah.


03:44.620 --> 03:46.622
I understand now. 


03:46.622 --> 03:50.834
I was reading spiritual food, 
but I wasn’t taking time to digest it, 


03:50.833 --> 03:53.461
so it wasn’t sinking 
down into my heart.


03:53.462 --> 03:57.257
As a result, 
I was on a direct path 


03:57.257 --> 04:01.010
to spiritual burnout 
if I didn’t change something quick!


04:01.010 --> 04:04.932
I began by taking control 
of my busy schedule. 


04:04.932 --> 04:09.645
I made it a priority 
to start my day with Bible reading. 


04:09.645 --> 04:12.647
I sought out quiet places 


04:12.647 --> 04:15.817
where I could meditate on what I read.


04:15.817 --> 04:18.904
Meaningful Bible study reinvigorated 


04:18.903 --> 04:21.000
my passion for serving Jehovah, 


04:23.408 --> 04:25.451
and prayerful meditation 


04:25.452 --> 04:28.000
helped me to refocus.


04:32.333 --> 04:35.586
Over time, 
making these changes 


04:35.587 --> 04:39.000
helped me to find joy 
in my service to Jehovah again.


04:47.390 --> 04:50.602
The Bible says when we make time 


04:50.602 --> 04:54.272
to read and meditate on spiritual things, 


04:54.272 --> 04:59.194
we will become 
“like a tree planted by streams of water,” 


04:59.193 --> 05:02.405
with foliage that never withers. 


05:02.405 --> 05:25.450
And everything we do will succeed.

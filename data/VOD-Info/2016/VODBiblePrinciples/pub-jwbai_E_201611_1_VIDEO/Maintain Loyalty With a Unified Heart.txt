00:14 My name is Gabriella.
00:17 Ben and I have always enjoyed
00:19 attending the meetings.
00:21 But lately,
00:23 it’s been difficult.
00:25 Something was missing
00:29 —our son.
00:43 It was like watching a movie  of someone else’s family.
00:55 I couldn’t believe  this was happening to us.
01:26 Our son, Levi,
01:28 was no longer  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:36 The elders and friends  in the congregation
01:40 were so supportive  and understanding.
01:43 Many of them  watched Levi grow up,
01:47 give his first talk,
01:49 get baptized.
02:12 I was so torn.
02:14 I was disappointed in Levi  for leaving Jehovah,
02:18 but I was  more disappointed in myself.
02:23 I felt like we  failed him somehow.
02:31 I kept wondering  how he was doing.
02:34 Was he OK?
02:45 Then, as hard  as the past few weeks had been,
02:49 it just got harder.
02:52 I knew what the Bible said
02:54 about “quit mixing in company  with anyone”
02:58 who is not living  according to Christian standards.
03:01 But I never thought that scripture  would one day apply to me.
03:07 Later that evening,  a brother was talking
03:10 about the example  of Korah’s sons.
03:24 Jehovah confirmed that He  was using Moses
03:27 to lead His people,  not Korah.
03:31 When the people were told  to move away
03:33 from the rebels’ tents,  what would Korah’s sons do?
03:37 Would they put loyalty to family  ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?
03:47 The Bible tells us  that his sons remained loyal
03:50 to Jehovah  and were blessed for it.
03:56 That night,  after the meeting,
03:58 I told Ben about the text  I received from Levi.
04:02 I told him everything
04:05 —how I missed Levi so much,
04:08 but that I also wanted to be loyal  to Jehovah like Korah’s sons.
04:13 Ben admitted that he too
04:15 had been struggling  with feelings like mine.
04:19 But then he said something
04:21 that I hadn’t thought of.
04:23 If we were to stand between Levi
04:26 and the discipline he needs,
04:28 we would, in effect,  be blocking
04:31 an expression of Jehovah’s love
04:33 from reaching him.
04:35 In fact,  it’s our very loyalty
04:38 to Jehovah  that could save his life.
04:42 We agreed to continue  to put our trust
04:44 in Jehovah  and stay loyal to him.
05:08 It’s been five years now,
05:10 and while Levi  still hasn’t returned to Jehovah,
05:14 I haven’t given up hope on him.
05:17 Until that day,
05:19 I’m staying busy as a regular pioneer  and focusing my energies
05:24 on helping others  learn about Jehovah.
05:28 I’ve come to experience firsthand
05:31 the truth of Psalm 97:10.
05:34 Jehovah really does guard  his loyal ones.

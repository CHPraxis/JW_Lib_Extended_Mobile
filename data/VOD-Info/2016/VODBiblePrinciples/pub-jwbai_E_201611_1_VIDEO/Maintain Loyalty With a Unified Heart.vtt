00:14.075 --> 00:17.078
My name is Gabriella. 


00:17.078 --> 00:19.206
Ben and I have always enjoyed 


00:19.207 --> 00:21.584
attending the meetings. 


00:21.583 --> 00:23.585
But lately, 


00:23.585 --> 00:25.628
it’s been difficult. 


00:25.628 --> 00:28.000
Something was missing


00:29.467 --> 00:31.000
—our son.


00:43.730 --> 00:48.000
It was like watching a movie 
of someone else’s family.


00:55.492 --> 00:59.000
I couldn’t believe 
this was happening to us.


01:26.982 --> 01:28.984
Our son, Levi, 


01:28.983 --> 01:32.000
was no longer 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


01:36.867 --> 01:40.037
The elders and friends 
in the congregation 


01:40.037 --> 01:43.207
were so supportive 
and understanding. 


01:43.207 --> 01:46.000
Many of them 
watched Levi grow up, 


01:47.377 --> 01:49.547
give his first talk, 


01:49.547 --> 01:52.000
get baptized.


02:12.903 --> 02:14.905
I was so torn. 


02:14.905 --> 02:18.992
I was disappointed in Levi 
for leaving Jehovah, 


02:18.992 --> 02:21.000
but I was 
more disappointed in myself. 


02:23.622 --> 02:27.000
I felt like we 
failed him somehow.


02:31.255 --> 02:34.592
I kept wondering 
how he was doing. 


02:34.592 --> 02:37.000
Was he OK?


02:45.727 --> 02:49.357
Then, as hard 
as the past few weeks had been, 


02:49.357 --> 02:52.902
it just got harder.


02:52.902 --> 02:54.904
I knew what the Bible said 


02:54.903 --> 02:58.198
about “quit mixing in company 
with anyone”


02:58.198 --> 03:01.535
who is not living 
according to Christian standards. 


03:01.535 --> 03:05.000
But I never thought that scripture 
would one day apply to me.


03:07.708 --> 03:10.293
Later that evening, 
a brother was talking 


03:10.293 --> 03:13.000
about the example 
of Korah’s sons.


03:24.475 --> 03:27.477
Jehovah confirmed that He 
was using Moses 


03:27.477 --> 03:31.690
to lead His people, 
not Korah. 


03:31.690 --> 03:33.775
When the people were told 
to move away 


03:33.775 --> 03:37.612
from the rebels’ tents, 
what would Korah’s sons do? 


03:37.612 --> 03:41.000
Would they put loyalty to family 
ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?


03:47.957 --> 03:50.792
The Bible tells us 
that his sons remained loyal 


03:50.792 --> 03:53.000
to Jehovah 
and were blessed for it.


03:56.215 --> 03:58.800
That night, 
after the meeting, 


03:58.800 --> 04:02.095
I told Ben about the text 
I received from Levi. 


04:02.095 --> 04:05.265
I told him everything


04:05.265 --> 04:08.643
—how I missed Levi so much, 


04:08.643 --> 04:13.148
but that I also wanted to be loyal 
to Jehovah like Korah’s sons. 


04:13.148 --> 04:15.650
Ben admitted that he too 


04:15.650 --> 04:18.000
had been struggling 
with feelings like mine.


04:19.153 --> 04:21.573
But then he said something 


04:21.573 --> 04:23.741
that I hadn’t thought of. 


04:23.742 --> 04:26.870
If we were to stand between Levi 


04:26.870 --> 04:28.955
and the discipline he needs, 


04:28.955 --> 04:31.292
we would, in effect, 
be blocking 


04:31.292 --> 04:33.127
an expression of Jehovah’s love 


04:33.127 --> 04:35.170
from reaching him. 


04:35.170 --> 04:38.298
In fact, 
it’s our very loyalty 


04:38.298 --> 04:42.593
to Jehovah 
that could save his life.


04:42.593 --> 04:44.596
We agreed to continue 
to put our trust 


04:44.597 --> 04:47.000
in Jehovah 
and stay loyal to him.


05:08.245 --> 05:10.663
It’s been five years now, 


05:10.663 --> 05:14.793
and while Levi 
still hasn’t returned to Jehovah, 


05:14.793 --> 05:17.503
I haven’t given up hope on him. 


05:17.503 --> 05:19.923
Until that day, 


05:19.923 --> 05:24.343
I’m staying busy as a regular pioneer 
and focusing my energies 


05:24.343 --> 05:27.000
on helping others 
learn about Jehovah.


05:28.515 --> 05:31.185
I’ve come to experience firsthand 


05:31.185 --> 05:34.897
the truth of Psalm 97:10. 


05:34.897 --> 06:03.405
Jehovah really does guard 
his loyal ones.

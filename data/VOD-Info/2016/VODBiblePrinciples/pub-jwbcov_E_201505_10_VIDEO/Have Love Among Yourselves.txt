01:01 I am so tired.
01:04 I’m really not up to talking  to anyone tonight.
01:08 All I want to do  is just find my seat
01:11 and enjoy the meeting.
01:13 I know Jehovah  will understand if I just . . .
01:16 Joanne!  I am so glad to see you!
01:18 I could really use your help with preparing  for my next Bible study with Lori.
01:21 Well, actually, you know,  I was trying to just get to my . . .
01:23 OK, so let me tell you . . .
01:24 Wow,  she didn’t even hear me.
01:29 I don’t need this right now.
01:32 This is really trying my patience.
01:35 . . . not saying a word.
01:36 But how many times was Jesus
01:40 interrupted when he was tired?
01:42 “Love is patient and kind.”
01:46 Let me listen closely  to what she has to say.
01:49 That’s when I remembered  what you told me.
01:51 Really?  What did I say?
01:53 Remember, you said,  “Always be patient and kind.”
01:56 So I kindly pointed out  the key words in the scripture,
01:59 and then after asking her  the question again,
02:01 I patiently waited  for her to give me an answer
02:03 —which, by the way,  is not the easiest thing for me to do.
02:07 But, just when I thought  that I couldn’t wait any longer,
02:09 she gave me the right answer.
02:11 She got the point!  I was so excited!
02:13 But now I’m  kind of wondering,
02:15 ‘Does she really believe  what she said?
02:18 And if not, how am I going to help her  to see the truth of the matter?’
02:21 And that’s where  I need your help, Joanne.
02:22 I’ve been trying to look for articles;  I can’t find anything.
02:25 Joanne, can you please  help me with finding an article
02:27 on how to reason  with a Bible student?
02:29 Angela, of course,  I’d be glad to help you.
02:32 Um, could we get together,  maybe, tomorrow afternoon?
02:35 Thank you so much, Joanne,  for being willing to help me.
02:37 I really appreciate it.
02:39 Thank you.
02:50 Bill.
02:51 Carl, how are you?
02:53 Good.  How are you feeling?
02:53 Good.
02:54 Awesome.  Alex . . .
02:55 Hey.
02:55 I didn’t get a chance  to tell you last week,
02:57 but that was a really nice job  you did on your talk.
02:58 Yeah, good job.
02:59 Ah, thanks, guys!
03:01 Believe me,  I’ve been so busy
03:02 it was hard  to make time to prepare it.
03:04 Oh,  tell me about it!
03:05 I think the whole congregation  has had a lot going on lately.
03:08 Yeah, it has.
03:09 That’s true, but I think  I’ve been extra busy.
03:11 Why?  What’s going on?
03:12 You’re not sick, are you?
03:14 No, no,  it’s nothing like that.
03:16 It’s all this  theocratic stuff
03:18 —pioneering,  congregation duties,
03:21 and other things.
03:23 Like this Saturday, I need to be  at the Kingdom Hall all afternoon and . . .
03:26 Saturday?  Here?
03:27 Why?
03:28 Wait a second,  I see where this is going.
03:30 Isn’t there a circuit assembly rehearsal  here on Saturday?
03:33 Oh yeah, that’s right.
03:34 So you’re on the program?
03:35 Well, I’m not sure  if I’m supposed to say.
03:38 Well, you just did.
03:39 So, what is it?  You’re in a demonstration?
03:41 An interview?  You can’t just leave us hanging!
03:44 OK.
03:45 Well, it’s not just an interview.
03:47 It’s an interview  with a reenactment,
03:49 and then they are going  to ask me questions at the end.
03:51 I’m actually on stage  for most of the part.
03:54 Come to think of it, guys,  I am the part!
03:56 You are the part?
03:58 Are you sure  you’re not stretching that a little bit?
04:01 No,  I don’t think I am.
04:03 OK.  Brother Jones’ part is ten minutes;
04:05 I’m up there for six.
04:08 That’s more than half the part.
04:10 Anyway, so let me tell you  how it’s supposed to go:
04:13 They are going to ask me about the time  I did this amazing job out in field service.
04:16 I walk up to the door.  Of course, I ring the bell.
04:18 But what happens?  It doesn’t work.
04:20 I knock louder  than any man ever has.
04:29 Bill.
04:30 Carl, how are you?
04:32 Good.  How are you feeling?
04:32 Good.
04:33 Awesome.  Alex . . .
04:33 Hey.
04:34 I didn’t get a chance  to tell you last week,
04:35 but that was a really nice job  you did on your talk.
04:37 Yeah, good job.
04:38 Thanks, guys!
04:40 With Jehovah’s help,  it came together.
04:41 Believe me,  I’ve been so busy.
04:43 It was just . . .  It was hard to make time to prepare it.
04:45 Oh, tell me about it!
04:46 I think the whole congregation  has had a lot going on lately.
04:48 Yeah, it has.
04:50 You both would know.  Aren’t you both auxiliary pioneering?
04:52 How’s that going?
04:53 It’s going.
04:53 Actually, yesterday I was able to show  one of our jw.org videos to a man.
04:57 He said that I can  come back this Saturday.
04:59 I think he might even agree  to a study.
05:01 You want  to come with me, Alex?
05:03 You know, I’m sorry.
05:03 I’m going to be tied up  for most of this Saturday.
05:06 But maybe Bill  can go with you.
05:07 How about it, Bill?
05:08 Sure.  I have a call to make too.
05:09 Maybe we can do  both calls together.
05:10 All right, deal.
05:12 So, Bill,  you have a good call too?
05:13 Tell us about it.
05:14 Oh, yes,  well I met a man . . .
05:31 Brother Harris,  do you have a moment?
05:33 Sure, Faye,  how can we help you?
05:35 Well,  you probably heard by now,
05:36 David and I got engaged  this past weekend!
05:39 We heard.
05:40 Congratulations!
05:41 We’re so happy  for both of you.
05:42 Thanks so much!
05:44 And since this  is where I grew up,
05:45 it would mean a lot to us  if we could get married in this Kingdom Hall.
05:49 So we were hoping that since you’re  the coordinator of the body of elders,
05:52 you’d be able to let us know today  if we can use the hall.
05:56 Then David and I can start working  on our wedding invitations.
05:59 David asked me to give you this letter  making our official request.
06:01 OK.
06:03 OK.
06:06 Let’s take a look.
06:09 Oh, yeah,  this is a good letter.
06:11 This gives me  all the information I need.
06:15 Faye, I can’t imagine you  getting married anywhere else.
06:19 You can count on  using the Kingdom Hall.
06:22 I’ll let the elders know  that I have already given my approval.
06:24 Let David know  we’re looking forward to your big day.
06:28 Thanks so much, Brother Harris!
06:30 I knew you’d come through for me!
06:47 Brother Harris,  do you have a moment?
06:49 Sure, Faye,  how can we help you?
06:51 Well, you  probably heard by now,
06:52 David and I got engaged  this past weekend!
06:55 We heard.
06:56 Congratulations!
06:57 We’re so happy for both of you.
06:58 Thanks so much!
06:59 And since this  is where I grew up,
07:01 it would mean a lot to us  if we could get married in this Kingdom Hall.
07:05 So we were hoping that since you’re  the coordinator of the body of elders,
07:08 you’d be able to let us know today  if we can use the hall.
07:12 Then David and I can start working  on our wedding invitations.
07:15 David asked me to give you this letter  making our official request.
07:17 OK.
07:21 OK.
07:23 Yes, this is  a good letter.
07:25 This has all the information  that we need.
07:28 I’m going to check with the other elders  and we’re going to discuss it,
07:31 then we’ll get right back to you.
07:33 Oh, you mean  you can’t tell me right now?
07:35 I thought  that since you’re the coordinator,
07:37 you’d have the authority to —you know . . .
07:39 I understand.
07:40 But, there is  a theocratic arrangement
07:43 that we all have to follow,  even the elders.
07:45 And the arrangement  is for the entire service committee
07:50 to discuss this and to consider the matter thoroughly
07:52 before any approval  can be given.
07:54 So I don’t have the authority  to make a decision on my own.
07:58 Of course,  that makes sense.
08:00 I understand.
08:01 But don’t worry, Faye, we’re going  to get on this as soon as possible.
08:05 Then you can move forward  with your wedding plans.
08:07 Thank you so much, Brother Harris.
08:08 I really appreciate it.
08:10 You’re welcome.
08:14 I’m going  to get started right on this.
08:15 OK.  Thanks.
08:21 Excuse me,
08:23 Larry, Frank.
08:24 Have either of you  seen Kevin tonight?
08:26 Yes, he’s over  by the literature counter.
08:29 OK.
08:30 I can go get him  if you’d like.
08:31 Ah, that would be great.  Thank you very much.
08:33 Larry,  perhaps you’ve heard
08:35 that Faye Carter  and David Thomas
08:38 have recently gotten engaged.
08:40 Uh-huh.
08:40 And they want to use  the Kingdom Hall for their wedding.
08:43 So perhaps you  and Kevin and myself
08:46 we could get together  for a few minutes tonight,
08:48 and then they could move forward  with their wedding plans.
08:51 Tonight?
08:53 How many times are you  going to do this to us, Tom?
08:56 Do what?
08:58 Keep having these  unscheduled meetings.
09:00 Look,
09:01 maybe you’re not so eager to get home  and spend time with your family,
09:04 but some of us are.
09:06 ‘Not want to spend time  with my family!’
09:09 What is that  supposed to mean?
09:12 He is way out of line.
09:14 I should set him straight  right now.
09:17 No, wait.
09:21 What am I thinking?
09:24 If I react poorly right now,
09:27 I could cause a major rift between us
09:30 —even between our families.
09:33 And if we elders don’t show  love among ourselves,
09:36 imagine how this could affect  the congregation.
09:40 What a dishonor that would be  to Jehovah and Jesus!
09:44 What do the Scriptures say?
09:47 “Do not leave your place.”
09:50 “Love . . . does not become provoked.”
09:55 Uh, you’re right, Larry.
09:57 Um, I’m sorry, I just thought that maybe it would take a few minutes.
10:02 But, uh, we can schedule  a better time for this,
10:05 and that way  we can all get home earlier.
10:08 No, Tom,
10:10 it’s me who  needs to apologize.
10:13 I overreacted.
10:15 Look, you’re right.
10:18 Since all of us are here,
10:19 it would be good for us  to take care of this if we can.
10:22 OK.
10:23 OK.
10:25 Here comes Kevin.
10:26 Let’s see if he’s available.
10:28 OK.
10:29 Hey, Kevin,  good to see you.
10:31 Good to see you too.
10:44 Excuse me.
10:46 Um, Larry, Frank . . .
10:53 We had such  a good time this morning.
10:55 I always enjoy working  with you in service.
10:57 Same here.
10:58 And I hope Ms. Johnson  comes to the meeting this Sunday.
11:00 That would be so nice.
11:02 Hey, did you ever find  your sunglasses?
11:04 No.  I looked all over!
11:05 I have no idea  where they could be.
11:07 Hey.
11:08 Hey, Susan.
11:09 Good to see you.
11:10 Good to see you.
11:11 You left these  at my house last night.
11:12 Ah, can you believe it?  I should have known.
11:14 What?
11:15 Susan had another gathering  at her home last night,
11:19 and I wasn’t invited —again!
11:22 I just don’t get it.
11:24 I knew they  had to be yours.
11:25 Thanks again.
11:26 I’m always leaving  my stuff behind.
11:28 And, Helen,  how are you doing?
11:30 I’m fine.  Sorry, I gotta go.
11:32 Helen?
11:34 What just happened?
11:35 I have no idea.
11:48 Hey, Helen,  got a second?
11:51 What do you want, Susan?
11:53 Helen,
11:55 I feel like I must have  done something to hurt you,
11:58 and I want to apologize  if I have.
12:00 Is there something wrong?
12:02 I guess you had some more  of the friends over last night?
12:06 Well, yes, a few.
12:09 Do you mind telling me  why I’m never invited?
12:14 Helen, I’m sorry;  I never thought—
12:17 Never thought what?
12:19 That I would have noticed how many times  you’ve done this to me?
12:22 Well, I’ve noticed!
12:24 Yesterday makes the third time
12:26 in the last couple of months
12:28 you’ve had people  to your home without me.
12:31 Not to mention the four other times  earlier this year!
12:34 I’m so sorry, Helen.
12:36 I didn’t mean  to slight you in any way.
12:39 And I promise,  it was nothing personal.
12:41 “Nothing personal?”
12:43 How can you invite  everybody in the congregation
12:46 over to your home  for a good time
12:48 —except me—
12:50 and say that it’s  “nothing personal”?
12:56 Good evening,  brothers and sisters.
12:58 We invite you  to please find your seats.
13:00 Our meeting  is about to begin.
13:12 Excuse me.
13:14 Um, Larry, Frank . . .
13:22 We had such  a good time this morning.
13:23 I always enjoy working  with you in service.
13:25 Same here.
13:26 And I hope Ms. Johnson comes  to the meeting this Sunday.
13:28 That would be so nice.
13:30 Hey, did you  ever find your sunglasses?
13:32 No.  I looked all over!
13:33 I have no idea  where they could be.
13:35 Hey.
13:36 Hey, Susan.
13:37 Good to see you.
13:38 Good to see you.
13:39 You left these  at my house last night.
13:41 Ah, can you believe it?
13:43 I should have known.
13:44 Thank you so much, Susan.
13:45 Where were they?
13:46 Wow.
13:47 Susan had  another gathering at her home.
13:51 I wonder why  I wasn’t invited again?
13:54 Wait.  That’s not important.
13:56 She is so hospitable!
13:59 I’m going to pray that Jehovah  continues to bless her for it.
14:03 And maybe  there’s something I can do.
14:06 And, Helen,  how are you doing?
14:07 Fine.  How are you, Susan?
14:09 Great.
14:10 Hey, would you  and you too, Alice,
14:13 would you like to work together  in service this Saturday
14:15 and then come  to my house for lunch?
14:17 That sounds so nice!
14:19 Would I like to?  I would love to.
14:21 Thank you, Helen!
14:22 What can I bring?
14:23 Both of you just bring yourselves;  I’ll have everything ready.
14:26 Oh, that sounds good!
14:28 Oh, I got to go.
14:36 Oh, Alice!
14:37 Oh, hi, Debbie.
14:39 I’ve got to tell you  what I just heard yesterday.
14:41 Well, . . .
14:42 Remember Bethany, who used to attend  some of our meetings years ago?
14:45 Yes, has she started going back  to the meetings again?
14:48 Not at all.
14:49 She left the man  that she was living with
14:52 to move in with another!
14:54 Wait!  You’ve been keeping in touch with her?
14:56 Well, no,  I haven’t talked to her directly,
15:01 but, you know,  word gets around.
15:03 Anyway,  can you believe it?
15:05 Debbie, we both know that Bethany  has done a lot of bad things
15:09 since she stopped  attending the meetings.
15:11 And I really hope she  makes changes and comes back.
15:15 But in the meantime,
15:17 do you really think  we should be spending our time
15:19 talking about all the bad things  she’s doing right now?
15:23 Well, probably not.
15:26 I just figured that since  we all grew up together,
15:30 you’d want to know how far  from the truth she has gotten.
15:34 But, Debbie,
15:35 “love . . . does not rejoice  over unrighteousness,
15:39 but rejoices with the truth.”
15:46 You know what?
15:48 You’re right.  Why talk about this?
15:50 We have so many good things  to talk about.
15:52 Yes, we do,  like this morning.
15:55 Do you remember that call  we went on last week?
15:56 Well, Helen and I  went back again this morning,
15:59 and the lady was home!
16:01 She invited us in,  and we placed a book.
16:03 Really!
16:04 Yes!
16:05 We even got to show her  one of our videos,
16:06 and she said she may come  to the meeting this Sunday!
16:09 That’s wonderful!  I hope she . . .
16:14 Alice, Alice.
16:16 Oh, hi, Debbie.
16:24 Wow, Brother Green,
16:26 I didn’t know it was that bad.
16:28 The storm was  far worse than expected.
16:32 I had already followed  the order to evacuate the city,
16:37 but I had no idea  I’d never see my home again.
16:40 My wife had passed away  a few years before the disaster,
16:45 and I didn’t have  any family to stay with.
16:48 So I really didn’t have  anything to go back to.
16:53 So, what did you do next?
16:56 Next?
16:59 Next, I learned  what real love is all about.
18:57 Wow, they took  all of you into their home?
19:01 Yes, six of us.
19:04 It wasn’t easy sometimes  for any of us.
19:08 But in the end,
19:10 we knew
19:13 we could get through  anything together
19:16 because
19:19 “love . . . endures all things.”
19:47 Hey, John,  nice to see you again.
19:49 Hey, if you don’t have a seat already,  we’d love to have you join us.
19:52 Thanks.
19:54 This is what,  . . . your fourth time here?
19:56 Yeah, yeah, I’ve just . . .
19:57 I’ve never seen  anything like this before.
19:59 Like what?
20:01 Hello, John.
20:02 I just wanted to say hi
20:04 and tell you how glad  I am to see you here.
20:07 Thank you, Sir.  Nice to see you too.
20:09 And, Jimmy, . . .
20:10 Hi, Brother Thompson.
20:11 I want  to thank you so much
20:12 for that package  you dropped off yesterday.
20:16 Chloe and I really appreciate  your thoughtfulness.
20:18 Anytime,  Brother Thompson, anytime.
20:20 Sorry,  don’t mean to interrupt.
20:22 Just wanted to come over  and say hello to you both.
20:24 John,  really nice to see you here.
20:27 Please keep coming.
20:28 Thanks.  I will.
20:29 And, Jim, as always,  good to see you.
20:32 Same here, Gary.
20:34 We’re still on  for tomorrow, right?
20:35 I’m counting on it.  Six o’clock?
20:37 That’s right.
20:38 Great.  I’ll see you then.
20:40 Now,  where were we?
20:42 Well, I was about to say  how friendly everyone is here!
20:45 And it’s not just with me.  I mean, it’s with each other.
20:47 You people really practice  what you preach.
20:49 Well, thanks, John.
20:51 You know, Jesus said for us  to ‘have love among ourselves.’
20:53 And we really try our best  to follow that command.
20:56 Of course, if you keep coming,  you’ll see we’re not perfect.
21:00 Well, I think I’ve seen enough  to know that I’m ready
21:03 for that Bible study  you’ve been offering me.
21:04 Oh, that’s great, John.
21:06 Good evening,  brothers and sisters.
21:07 You know,  let’s take our seats,
21:09 and we’ll talk more  about the Bible study after the meeting.
21:11 OK.

01:01.248 --> 01:04.626
I am so tired. 


01:04.627 --> 01:08.922
I’m really not up to talking 
to anyone tonight. 


01:08.922 --> 01:11.800
All I want to do 
is just find my seat 


01:11.800 --> 01:13.802
and enjoy the meeting. 


01:13.802 --> 01:16.389
I know Jehovah 
will understand if I just . . .


01:16.388 --> 01:18.390
Joanne! 
I am so glad to see you! 


01:18.390 --> 01:21.435
I could really use your help with preparing 
for my next Bible study with Lori.


01:21.435 --> 01:23.437
Well, actually, you know, 
I was trying to just get to my . . .


01:23.437 --> 01:24.814
OK, so let me tell you . . .


01:24.813 --> 01:28.000
Wow, 
she didn’t even hear me. 


01:29.527 --> 01:32.570
I don’t need this right now. 


01:32.570 --> 01:35.657
This is really trying my patience.


01:35.657 --> 01:36.617
. . . not saying a word.


01:36.617 --> 01:40.245
But how many times was Jesus


01:40.245 --> 01:42.748
interrupted when he was tired? 


01:42.748 --> 01:46.168
“Love is patient and kind.” 


01:46.168 --> 01:49.128
Let me listen closely 
to what she has to say.


01:49.128 --> 01:51.131
That’s when I remembered 
what you told me.


01:51.132 --> 01:53.425
Really? 
What did I say?


01:53.425 --> 01:56.428
Remember, you said, 
“Always be patient and kind.” 


01:56.428 --> 01:59.473
So I kindly pointed out 
the key words in the scripture, 


01:59.473 --> 02:01.516
and then after asking her 
the question again, 


02:01.517 --> 02:03.977
I patiently waited 
for her to give me an answer


02:03.977 --> 02:07.355
—which, by the way, 
is not the easiest thing for me to do. 


02:07.355 --> 02:09.567
But, just when I thought 
that I couldn’t wait any longer, 


02:09.567 --> 02:11.485
she gave me the right answer. 


02:11.485 --> 02:13.820
She got the point! 
I was so excited! 


02:13.820 --> 02:15.738
But now I’m 
kind of wondering, 


02:15.738 --> 02:18.033
‘Does she really believe 
what she said? 


02:18.033 --> 02:21.036
And if not, how am I going to help her 
to see the truth of the matter?’ 


02:21.037 --> 02:22.537
And that’s where 
I need your help, Joanne. 


02:22.537 --> 02:25.457
I’ve been trying to look for articles; 
I can’t find anything. 


02:25.457 --> 02:27.584
Joanne, can you please 
help me with finding an article


02:27.583 --> 02:29.586
on how to reason 
with a Bible student?


02:29.587 --> 02:32.380
Angela, of course, 
I’d be glad to help you. 


02:32.380 --> 02:35.717
Um, could we get together, 
maybe, tomorrow afternoon?


02:35.717 --> 02:37.887
Thank you so much, Joanne, 
for being willing to help me. 


02:37.887 --> 02:39.430
I really appreciate it. 


02:39.430 --> 02:42.000
Thank you.


02:50.940 --> 02:51.775
Bill.


02:51.775 --> 02:53.068
Carl, how are you?


02:53.068 --> 02:53.735
Good. 
How are you feeling?


02:53.735 --> 02:54.193
Good.


02:54.193 --> 02:55.403
Awesome. 
Alex . . .


02:55.403 --> 02:55.653
Hey.


02:55.653 --> 02:57.030
I didn’t get a chance 
to tell you last week, 


02:57.030 --> 02:58.865
but that was a really nice job 
you did on your talk.


02:58.865 --> 02:59.867
Yeah, good job.


02:59.867 --> 03:01.369
Ah, thanks, guys! 


03:01.368 --> 03:02.703
Believe me, 
I’ve been so busy 


03:02.703 --> 03:04.538
it was hard 
to make time to prepare it.


03:04.538 --> 03:05.705
Oh, 
tell me about it! 


03:05.705 --> 03:08.000
I think the whole congregation 
has had a lot going on lately.


03:08.000 --> 03:09.042
Yeah, it has.


03:09.042 --> 03:11.212
That’s true, but I think 
I’ve been extra busy.


03:11.212 --> 03:12.797
Why? 
What’s going on?


03:12.797 --> 03:14.005
You’re not sick, are you?


03:14.005 --> 03:16.133
No, no, 
it’s nothing like that. 


03:16.133 --> 03:18.676
It’s all this 
theocratic stuff


03:18.677 --> 03:21.680
—pioneering, 
congregation duties, 


03:21.680 --> 03:23.015
and other things. 


03:23.015 --> 03:26.727
Like this Saturday, I need to be 
at the Kingdom Hall all afternoon and . . .


03:26.727 --> 03:27.729
Saturday? 
Here? 


03:27.728 --> 03:28.770
Why?


03:28.770 --> 03:30.563
Wait a second, 
I see where this is going. 


03:30.563 --> 03:33.608
Isn’t there a circuit assembly rehearsal 
here on Saturday?


03:33.608 --> 03:34.651
Oh yeah, that’s right. 


03:34.652 --> 03:35.694
So you’re on the program?


03:35.693 --> 03:38.321
Well, I’m not sure 
if I’m supposed to say.


03:38.322 --> 03:39.280
Well, you just did. 


03:39.280 --> 03:41.617
So, what is it? 
You’re in a demonstration? 


03:41.617 --> 03:44.787
An interview? 
You can’t just leave us hanging!


03:44.787 --> 03:45.870
OK. 


03:45.870 --> 03:47.163
Well, it’s not just an interview. 


03:47.163 --> 03:49.040
It’s an interview 
with a reenactment, 


03:49.040 --> 03:51.585
and then they are going 
to ask me questions at the end. 


03:51.585 --> 03:54.003
I’m actually on stage 
for most of the part. 


03:54.003 --> 03:56.590
Come to think of it, guys, 
I am the part!


03:56.590 --> 03:58.217
You are the part? 


03:58.217 --> 04:01.052
Are you sure 
you’re not stretching that a little bit?


04:01.052 --> 04:03.180
No, 
I don’t think I am. 


04:03.180 --> 04:05.348
OK. 
Brother Jones’ part is ten minutes; 


04:05.348 --> 04:08.310
I’m up there for six. 


04:08.310 --> 04:10.895
That’s more than half the part. 


04:10.895 --> 04:13.398
Anyway, so let me tell you 
how it’s supposed to go: 


04:13.398 --> 04:16.651
They are going to ask me about the time 
I did this amazing job out in field service. 


04:16.652 --> 04:18.820
I walk up to the door. 
Of course, I ring the bell. 


04:18.820 --> 04:20.322
But what happens? 
It doesn’t work. 


04:20.322 --> 04:23.000
I knock louder 
than any man ever has.


04:29.540 --> 04:30.707
Bill.


04:30.707 --> 04:32.000
Carl, how are you?


04:32.000 --> 04:32.750
Good. 
How are you feeling?


04:32.750 --> 04:33.335
Good.


04:33.335 --> 04:33.835
Awesome. 
Alex . . .


04:33.835 --> 04:34.587
Hey.


04:34.587 --> 04:35.962
I didn’t get a chance 
to tell you last week, 


04:35.962 --> 04:37.714
but that was a really nice job 
you did on your talk.


04:37.713 --> 04:38.715
Yeah, good job.


04:38.715 --> 04:40.092
Thanks, guys! 


04:40.092 --> 04:41.927
With Jehovah’s help, 
it came together. 


04:41.927 --> 04:43.512
Believe me, 
I’ve been so busy. 


04:43.512 --> 04:45.680
It was just . . . 
It was hard to make time to prepare it.


04:45.680 --> 04:46.515
Oh, tell me about it! 


04:46.515 --> 04:48.975
I think the whole congregation 
has had a lot going on lately.


04:48.975 --> 04:50.143
Yeah, it has.


04:50.143 --> 04:52.103
You both would know. 
Aren’t you both auxiliary pioneering? 


04:52.103 --> 04:53.021
How’s that going?


04:53.022 --> 04:53.939
It’s going. 


04:53.938 --> 04:57.775
Actually, yesterday I was able to show 
one of our jw.org videos to a man. 


04:57.775 --> 04:59.443
He said that I can 
come back this Saturday. 


04:59.443 --> 05:01.696
I think he might even agree 
to a study. 


05:01.697 --> 05:03.074
You want 
to come with me, Alex?


05:03.073 --> 05:03.906
You know, I’m sorry. 


05:03.907 --> 05:06.244
I’m going to be tied up 
for most of this Saturday. 


05:06.243 --> 05:07.451
But maybe Bill 
can go with you.


05:07.452 --> 05:08.454
How about it, Bill?


05:08.453 --> 05:09.788
Sure. 
I have a call to make too. 


05:09.788 --> 05:10.996
Maybe we can do 
both calls together.


05:10.997 --> 05:12.082
All right, deal.


05:12.082 --> 05:13.709
So, Bill, 
you have a good call too? 


05:13.708 --> 05:14.918
Tell us about it.


05:14.918 --> 05:16.000
Oh, yes, 
well I met a man . . .


05:31.518 --> 05:33.686
Brother Harris, 
do you have a moment?


05:33.687 --> 05:35.480
Sure, Faye, 
how can we help you?


05:35.480 --> 05:36.857
Well, 
you probably heard by now, 


05:36.857 --> 05:39.234
David and I got engaged 
this past weekend!


05:39.233 --> 05:40.151
We heard. 


05:40.152 --> 05:41.445
Congratulations! 


05:41.445 --> 05:42.947
We’re so happy 
for both of you.


05:42.947 --> 05:44.532
Thanks so much! 


05:44.532 --> 05:45.907
And since this 
is where I grew up, 


05:45.907 --> 05:49.662
it would mean a lot to us 
if we could get married in this Kingdom Hall. 


05:49.662 --> 05:52.455
So we were hoping that since you’re 
the coordinator of the body of elders, 


05:52.455 --> 05:56.377
you’d be able to let us know today 
if we can use the hall. 


05:56.377 --> 05:59.212
Then David and I can start working 
on our wedding invitations. 


05:59.212 --> 06:01.757
David asked me to give you this letter 
making our official request.


06:01.757 --> 06:02.000
OK.


06:03.675 --> 06:06.303
OK. 


06:06.303 --> 06:09.096
Let’s take a look. 


06:09.097 --> 06:11.642
Oh, yeah, 
this is a good letter. 


06:11.642 --> 06:15.145
This gives me 
all the information I need. 


06:15.145 --> 06:19.398
Faye, I can’t imagine you 
getting married anywhere else. 


06:19.398 --> 06:22.026
You can count on 
using the Kingdom Hall. 


06:22.027 --> 06:24.947
I’ll let the elders know 
that I have already given my approval. 


06:24.947 --> 06:28.575
Let David know 
we’re looking forward to your big day.


06:28.575 --> 06:30.160
Thanks so much, Brother Harris! 


06:30.160 --> 06:33.000
I knew you’d come through for me!


06:47.343 --> 06:49.511
Brother Harris, 
do you have a moment?


06:49.512 --> 06:51.390
Sure, Faye, 
how can we help you?


06:51.390 --> 06:52.682
Well, you 
probably heard by now, 


06:52.682 --> 06:55.102
David and I got engaged 
this past weekend!


06:55.102 --> 06:56.102
We heard. 


06:56.102 --> 06:57.354
Congratulations! 


06:57.353 --> 06:58.938
We’re so happy
for both of you.


06:58.938 --> 06:59.898
Thanks so much! 


06:59.898 --> 07:01.733
And since this 
is where I grew up, 


07:01.733 --> 07:05.486
it would mean a lot to us 
if we could get married in this Kingdom Hall. 


07:05.487 --> 07:08.699
So we were hoping that since you’re 
the coordinator of the body of elders, 


07:08.698 --> 07:12.201
you’d be able to let us know today 
if we can use the hall. 


07:12.202 --> 07:15.039
Then David and I can start working 
on our wedding invitations. 


07:15.038 --> 07:17.831
David asked me to give you this letter 
making our official request.


07:17.832 --> 07:18.000
OK.


07:21.753 --> 07:23.421
OK. 


07:23.422 --> 07:25.674
Yes, this is 
a good letter. 


07:25.673 --> 07:28.260
This has all the information 
that we need. 


07:28.260 --> 07:31.597
I’m going to check with the other elders 
and we’re going to discuss it, 


07:31.597 --> 07:33.474
then we’ll get right back to you.


07:33.473 --> 07:35.558
Oh, you mean 
you can’t tell me right now? 


07:35.558 --> 07:37.560
I thought 
that since you’re the coordinator, 


07:37.560 --> 07:39.730
you’d have the authority to
—you know . . .


07:39.730 --> 07:40.855
I understand. 


07:40.855 --> 07:43.275
But, there is 
a theocratic arrangement 


07:43.275 --> 07:45.818
that we all have to follow, 
even the elders. 


07:45.818 --> 07:50.281
And the arrangement 
is for the entire service committee 


07:50.282 --> 07:52.825
to discuss this
and to consider the matter thoroughly


07:52.825 --> 07:54.828
before any approval 
can be given. 


07:54.828 --> 07:58.415
So I don’t have the authority 
to make a decision on my own.


07:58.415 --> 08:00.417
Of course, 
that makes sense. 


08:00.417 --> 08:01.419
I understand.


08:01.418 --> 08:05.046
But don’t worry, Faye, we’re going 
to get on this as soon as possible. 


08:05.047 --> 08:07.340
Then you can move forward 
with your wedding plans.


08:07.340 --> 08:08.925
Thank you so much, Brother Harris. 


08:08.925 --> 08:10.302
I really appreciate it.


08:10.302 --> 08:13.000
You’re welcome.


08:14.347 --> 08:15.640
I’m going 
to get started right on this.


08:15.640 --> 08:17.000
OK. 
Thanks.


08:21.730 --> 08:23.482
Excuse me, 


08:23.482 --> 08:24.565
Larry, Frank. 


08:24.565 --> 08:26.568
Have either of you 
seen Kevin tonight?


08:26.568 --> 08:29.278
Yes, he’s over 
by the literature counter.


08:29.278 --> 08:30.113
OK.


08:30.113 --> 08:31.155
I can go get him 
if you’d like.


08:31.155 --> 08:33.492
Ah, that would be great. 
Thank you very much. 


08:33.492 --> 08:35.952
Larry, 
perhaps you’ve heard 


08:35.952 --> 08:38.205
that Faye Carter 
and David Thomas 


08:38.205 --> 08:40.207
have recently gotten engaged.


08:40.207 --> 08:40.957
Uh-huh.


08:40.957 --> 08:43.294
And they want to use 
the Kingdom Hall for their wedding. 


08:43.293 --> 08:46.003
So perhaps you 
and Kevin and myself 


08:46.003 --> 08:48.423
we could get together 
for a few minutes tonight, 


08:48.423 --> 08:51.175
and then they could move forward 
with their wedding plans.


08:51.175 --> 08:53.220
Tonight? 


08:53.220 --> 08:56.390
How many times are you 
going to do this to us, Tom?


08:56.390 --> 08:58.015
Do what?


08:58.015 --> 09:00.352
Keep having these 
unscheduled meetings. 


09:00.352 --> 09:01.729
Look, 


09:01.728 --> 09:04.731
maybe you’re not so eager to get home 
and spend time with your family, 


09:04.732 --> 09:06.400
but some of us are.


09:06.400 --> 09:09.737
‘Not want to spend time 
with my family!’ 


09:09.737 --> 09:12.114
What is that 
supposed to mean? 


09:12.113 --> 09:14.531
He is way out of line. 


09:14.532 --> 09:17.702
I should set him straight 
right now. 


09:17.702 --> 09:21.164
No, wait. 


09:21.163 --> 09:24.541
What am I thinking? 


09:24.542 --> 09:27.254
If I react poorly right now, 


09:27.253 --> 09:30.215
I could cause
a major rift between us


09:30.215 --> 09:33.343
—even between our families. 


09:33.343 --> 09:36.345
And if we elders don’t show 
love among ourselves, 


09:36.345 --> 09:40.183
imagine how this could affect 
the congregation. 


09:40.183 --> 09:44.520
What a dishonor that would be 
to Jehovah and Jesus! 


09:44.520 --> 09:47.107
What do the Scriptures say? 


09:47.107 --> 09:50.694
“Do not leave your place.” 


09:50.693 --> 09:54.000
“Love . . . does not become provoked.”


09:55.240 --> 09:57.992
Uh, you’re right, Larry. 


09:57.992 --> 10:02.622
Um, I’m sorry, I just thought
that maybe it would take a few minutes. 


10:02.622 --> 10:05.625
But, uh, we can schedule 
a better time for this, 


10:05.625 --> 10:08.462
and that way 
we can all get home earlier.


10:08.462 --> 10:10.922
No, Tom, 


10:10.922 --> 10:13.049
it’s me who 
needs to apologize. 


10:13.048 --> 10:15.051
I overreacted. 


10:15.052 --> 10:18.305
Look, you’re right. 


10:18.305 --> 10:19.722
Since all of us are here, 


10:19.722 --> 10:22.600
it would be good for us 
to take care of this if we can.


10:22.600 --> 10:23.935
OK. 


10:23.935 --> 10:25.062
OK.


10:25.062 --> 10:26.730
Here comes Kevin. 


10:26.730 --> 10:28.232
Let’s see if he’s available.


10:28.232 --> 10:29.065
OK.


10:29.065 --> 10:31.067
Hey, Kevin, 
good to see you.


10:31.067 --> 10:33.000
Good to see you too.


10:44.622 --> 10:46.917
Excuse me. 


10:46.917 --> 10:49.000
Um, Larry, Frank . . .


10:53.757 --> 10:55.842
We had such 
a good time this morning. 


10:55.842 --> 10:57.635
I always enjoy working 
with you in service.


10:57.635 --> 10:58.470
Same here. 


10:58.470 --> 11:00.805
And I hope Ms. Johnson 
comes to the meeting this Sunday.


11:00.805 --> 11:02.390
That would be so nice.


11:02.390 --> 11:04.100
Hey, did you ever find 
your sunglasses?


11:04.100 --> 11:05.893
No. 
I looked all over! 


11:05.893 --> 11:07.853
I have no idea 
where they could be.


11:07.853 --> 11:08.521
Hey.


11:08.522 --> 11:09.522
Hey, Susan.


11:09.522 --> 11:10.690
Good to see you.


11:10.690 --> 11:11.315
Good to see you.


11:11.315 --> 11:12.692
You left these 
at my house last night.


11:12.692 --> 11:14.652
Ah, can you believe it? 
I should have known.


11:14.652 --> 11:15.945
What? 


11:15.945 --> 11:19.823
Susan had another gathering 
at her home last night, 


11:19.823 --> 11:22.118
and I wasn’t invited
—again! 


11:22.118 --> 11:24.286
I just don’t get it.


11:24.287 --> 11:25.247
I knew they 
had to be yours.


11:25.247 --> 11:26.205
Thanks again. 


11:26.205 --> 11:28.333
I’m always leaving 
my stuff behind.


11:28.333 --> 11:30.251
And, Helen, 
how are you doing?


11:30.252 --> 11:32.504
I’m fine. 
Sorry, I gotta go.


11:32.503 --> 11:34.296
Helen? 


11:34.297 --> 11:35.507
What just happened?


11:35.507 --> 11:38.000
I have no idea.


11:48.312 --> 11:51.439
Hey, Helen, 
got a second?


11:51.438 --> 11:53.691
What do you want, Susan?


11:53.692 --> 11:55.694
Helen,


11:55.693 --> 11:58.280
I feel like I must have 
done something to hurt you, 


11:58.280 --> 12:00.740
and I want to apologize 
if I have. 


12:00.740 --> 12:02.492
Is there something wrong?


12:02.492 --> 12:06.664
I guess you had some more 
of the friends over last night?


12:06.663 --> 12:09.540
Well, yes, a few.


12:09.540 --> 12:13.000
Do you mind telling me 
why I’m never invited?


12:14.462 --> 12:17.674
Helen, I’m sorry; 
I never thought—


12:17.673 --> 12:19.383
Never thought what? 


12:19.383 --> 12:22.845
That I would have noticed how many times 
you’ve done this to me? 


12:22.845 --> 12:24.847
Well, I’ve noticed! 


12:24.847 --> 12:26.892
Yesterday makes the third time 


12:26.892 --> 12:28.560
in the last couple of months 


12:28.560 --> 12:31.062
you’ve had people 
to your home without me. 


12:31.062 --> 12:34.649
Not to mention the four other times 
earlier this year!


12:34.648 --> 12:36.693
I’m so sorry, Helen. 


12:36.693 --> 12:39.528
I didn’t mean 
to slight you in any way. 


12:39.528 --> 12:41.948
And I promise, 
it was nothing personal.


12:41.948 --> 12:43.741
“Nothing personal?” 


12:43.742 --> 12:46.620
How can you invite 
everybody in the congregation 


12:46.620 --> 12:48.622
over to your home 
for a good time


12:48.622 --> 12:50.457
—except me—


12:50.457 --> 12:53.000
and say that it’s 
“nothing personal”?


12:56.755 --> 12:58.632
Good evening, 
brothers and sisters. 


12:58.632 --> 13:00.509
We invite you 
to please find your seats. 


13:00.508 --> 13:02.000
Our meeting 
is about to begin.


13:12.520 --> 13:14.605
Excuse me. 


13:14.605 --> 13:17.000
Um, Larry, Frank . . .


13:22.113 --> 13:23.990
We had such 
a good time this morning. 


13:23.990 --> 13:25.658
I always enjoy working 
with you in service.


13:25.658 --> 13:26.408
Same here. 


13:26.408 --> 13:28.953
And I hope Ms. Johnson comes 
to the meeting this Sunday.


13:28.953 --> 13:30.913
That would be so nice.


13:30.913 --> 13:32.331
Hey, did you 
ever find your sunglasses?


13:32.332 --> 13:33.917
No. 
I looked all over! 


13:33.917 --> 13:35.794
I have no idea 
where they could be.


13:35.793 --> 13:36.460
Hey.


13:36.460 --> 13:37.920
Hey, Susan.


13:37.920 --> 13:38.922
Good to see you.


13:38.922 --> 13:39.880
Good to see you.


13:39.880 --> 13:41.132
You left these 
at my house last night.


13:41.132 --> 13:43.427
Ah, can you believe it? 


13:43.427 --> 13:44.802
I should have known. 


13:44.802 --> 13:45.887
Thank you so much, Susan. 


13:45.887 --> 13:46.429
Where were they?


13:46.428 --> 13:47.805
Wow. 


13:47.805 --> 13:51.100
Susan had 
another gathering at her home. 


13:51.100 --> 13:54.353
I wonder why 
I wasn’t invited again? 


13:54.353 --> 13:56.773
Wait. 
That’s not important. 


13:56.773 --> 13:59.275
She is so hospitable! 


13:59.275 --> 14:03.153
I’m going to pray that Jehovah 
continues to bless her for it. 


14:03.153 --> 14:06.741
And maybe 
there’s something I can do.


14:06.742 --> 14:07.659
And, Helen, 
how are you doing?


14:07.658 --> 14:09.243
Fine. 
How are you, Susan?


14:09.243 --> 14:10.286
Great.


14:10.287 --> 14:13.039
Hey, would you 
and you too, Alice, 


14:13.038 --> 14:15.041
would you like to work together 
in service this Saturday 


14:15.042 --> 14:17.294
and then come 
to my house for lunch?


14:17.293 --> 14:19.295
That sounds so nice!


14:19.295 --> 14:21.672
Would I like to? 
I would love to. 


14:21.672 --> 14:22.799
Thank you, Helen! 


14:22.798 --> 14:23.925
What can I bring?


14:23.925 --> 14:26.635
Both of you just bring yourselves; 
I’ll have everything ready.


14:26.635 --> 14:28.638
Oh, that sounds good! 


14:28.638 --> 14:30.000
Oh, I got to go.


14:36.020 --> 14:37.563
Oh, Alice!


14:37.563 --> 14:39.148
Oh, hi, Debbie.


14:39.148 --> 14:41.525
I’ve got to tell you 
what I just heard yesterday.


14:41.525 --> 14:42.527
Well, . . .


14:42.527 --> 14:45.697
Remember Bethany, who used to attend 
some of our meetings years ago?


14:45.697 --> 14:48.450
Yes, has she started going back 
to the meetings again?


14:48.450 --> 14:49.783
Not at all. 


14:49.783 --> 14:52.745
She left the man 
that she was living with 


14:52.745 --> 14:54.288
to move in with another!


14:54.288 --> 14:56.916
Wait! 
You’ve been keeping in touch with her?


14:56.917 --> 15:01.129
Well, no, 
I haven’t talked to her directly, 


15:01.128 --> 15:03.423
but, you know, 
word gets around. 


15:03.423 --> 15:05.591
Anyway, 
can you believe it?


15:05.592 --> 15:09.554
Debbie, we both know that Bethany 
has done a lot of bad things 


15:09.553 --> 15:11.555
since she stopped 
attending the meetings. 


15:11.555 --> 15:15.143
And I really hope she 
makes changes and comes back. 


15:15.143 --> 15:17.145
But in the meantime, 


15:17.145 --> 15:19.438
do you really think 
we should be spending our time 


15:19.438 --> 15:23.651
talking about all the bad things 
she’s doing right now?


15:23.652 --> 15:26.570
Well, probably not. 


15:26.570 --> 15:30.658
I just figured that since 
we all grew up together, 


15:30.658 --> 15:34.036
you’d want to know how far 
from the truth she has gotten.


15:34.037 --> 15:35.414
But, Debbie, 


15:35.413 --> 15:39.000
“love . . . does not rejoice 
over unrighteousness, 


15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
but rejoices with the truth.”


15:46.967 --> 15:48.969
You know what? 


15:48.968 --> 15:50.886
You’re right. 
Why talk about this? 


15:50.887 --> 15:52.722
We have so many good things 
to talk about.


15:52.722 --> 15:55.099
Yes, we do, 
like this morning. 


15:55.098 --> 15:56.976
Do you remember that call 
we went on last week? 


15:56.977 --> 15:59.229
Well, Helen and I 
went back again this morning, 


15:59.228 --> 16:01.230
and the lady was home! 


16:01.230 --> 16:03.315
She invited us in, 
and we placed a book.


16:03.315 --> 16:04.108
Really!


16:04.108 --> 16:05.025
Yes! 


16:05.025 --> 16:06.945
We even got to show her 
one of our videos, 


16:06.945 --> 16:09.322
and she said she may come 
to the meeting this Sunday!


16:09.322 --> 16:11.000
That’s wonderful! 
I hope she . . .


16:14.493 --> 16:16.328
Alice, Alice.


16:16.328 --> 16:19.000
Oh, hi, Debbie.


16:24.253 --> 16:26.463
Wow, Brother Green, 


16:26.463 --> 16:28.508
I didn’t know it was that bad.


16:28.508 --> 16:32.636
The storm was 
far worse than expected. 


16:32.637 --> 16:36.000
I had already followed 
the order to evacuate the city, 


16:37.475 --> 16:40.812
but I had no idea 
I’d never see my home again. 


16:40.812 --> 16:45.525
My wife had passed away 
a few years before the disaster, 


16:45.525 --> 16:48.987
and I didn’t have 
any family to stay with. 


16:48.987 --> 16:53.950
So I really didn’t have 
anything to go back to.


16:53.950 --> 16:56.953
So,
what did you do next?


16:56.953 --> 16:59.663
Next? 


16:59.663 --> 17:04.000
Next, I learned 
what real love is all about.


18:57.990 --> 19:01.118
Wow, they took 
all of you into their home?


19:01.118 --> 19:04.371
Yes, six of us. 


19:04.372 --> 19:08.960
It wasn’t easy sometimes 
for any of us. 


19:08.960 --> 19:10.962
But in the end, 


19:10.962 --> 19:13.214
we knew 


19:13.213 --> 19:16.341
we could get through 
anything together 


19:16.342 --> 19:19.804
because 


19:19.803 --> 19:23.000
“love . . . endures all things.”


19:47.873 --> 19:49.916
Hey, John, 
nice to see you again. 


19:49.917 --> 19:52.795
Hey, if you don’t have a seat already, 
we’d love to have you join us.


19:52.795 --> 19:54.047
Thanks.


19:54.047 --> 19:56.049
This is what, 
. . . your fourth time here?


19:56.048 --> 19:57.883
Yeah, yeah,
I’ve just . . .


19:57.883 --> 19:59.885
I’ve never seen 
anything like this before.


19:59.885 --> 20:01.303
Like what?


20:01.303 --> 20:02.763
Hello, John. 


20:02.763 --> 20:04.931
I just wanted to say hi 


20:04.932 --> 20:07.394
and tell you how glad 
I am to see you here.


20:07.393 --> 20:09.020
Thank you, Sir. 
Nice to see you too.


20:09.020 --> 20:10.020
And, Jimmy, . . .


20:10.020 --> 20:11.147
Hi, Brother Thompson.


20:11.147 --> 20:12.982
I want 
to thank you so much 


20:12.982 --> 20:16.277
for that package 
you dropped off yesterday. 


20:16.277 --> 20:18.654
Chloe and I really appreciate 
your thoughtfulness.


20:18.653 --> 20:20.781
Anytime, 
Brother Thompson, anytime.


20:20.782 --> 20:22.492
Sorry, 
don’t mean to interrupt. 


20:22.492 --> 20:24.910
Just wanted to come over 
and say hello to you both. 


20:24.910 --> 20:27.413
John, 
really nice to see you here. 


20:27.413 --> 20:28.831
Please keep coming.


20:28.832 --> 20:29.582
Thanks. 
I will.


20:29.582 --> 20:32.960
And, Jim, as always, 
good to see you.


20:32.960 --> 20:34.128
Same here, Gary.


20:34.128 --> 20:35.671
We’re still on 
for tomorrow, right?


20:35.672 --> 20:37.424
I’m counting on it. 
Six o’clock?


20:37.423 --> 20:38.048
That’s right.


20:38.048 --> 20:40.341
Great. 
I’ll see you then.


20:40.342 --> 20:42.429
Now, 
where were we?


20:42.428 --> 20:45.598
Well, I was about to say 
how friendly everyone is here! 


20:45.598 --> 20:47.641
And it’s not just with me. 
I mean, it’s with each other. 


20:47.642 --> 20:49.852
You people really practice 
what you preach.


20:49.852 --> 20:51.479
Well, thanks, John. 


20:51.478 --> 20:53.981
You know, Jesus said for us 
to ‘have love among ourselves.’ 


20:53.982 --> 20:56.900
And we really try our best 
to follow that command. 


20:56.900 --> 21:00.863
Of course, if you keep coming, 
you’ll see we’re not perfect.


21:00.863 --> 21:03.365
Well, I think I’ve seen enough 
to know that I’m ready 


21:03.365 --> 21:04.950
for that Bible study 
you’ve been offering me.


21:04.950 --> 21:06.577
Oh, that’s great, John.


21:06.577 --> 21:07.787
Good evening, 
brothers and sisters. 


21:07.787 --> 21:09.247
You know, 
let’s take our seats, 


21:09.247 --> 21:11.249
and we’ll talk more 
about the Bible study after the meeting.


21:11.248 --> 21:40.633
OK.

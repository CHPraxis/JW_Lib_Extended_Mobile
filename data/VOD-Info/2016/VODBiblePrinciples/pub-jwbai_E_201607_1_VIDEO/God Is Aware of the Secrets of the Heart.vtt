00:13.095 --> 00:15.098
My name is Shawn. 


00:15.098 --> 00:18.000
I was raised in the truth.


00:19.468 --> 00:22.000
I was doing everything right.


00:32.648 --> 00:35.000
But I was doing everything wrong.


01:01.043 --> 01:03.245
I was in my senior year of high school. 


01:03.245 --> 01:06.315
Everything was going great 


01:06.315 --> 01:10.000
until this new girl joined our school.


01:16.558 --> 01:18.895
I really don’t know 
how it even started. 


01:18.895 --> 01:22.000
We just sort of hit it off 
and became good friends. 


01:24.332 --> 01:27.000
I mean, she was so easy to talk to.


01:54.030 --> 01:56.032
Before I knew it, 


01:56.032 --> 01:58.769
we were texting all the time. 


01:58.768 --> 02:02.000
Then, one thing led to another.


02:04.590 --> 02:07.460
Honestly, when things 
started to get physical, 


02:07.460 --> 02:10.263
I thought I could control it, 


02:10.263 --> 02:13.000
but it was only getting worse.


02:24.927 --> 02:27.397
I didn’t want to let my parents down. 


02:27.397 --> 02:30.000
So I started lying to them, 


02:33.803 --> 02:38.000
and then I started lying to myself. 


02:40.277 --> 02:44.947
I thought if I could just keep 
going to the meetings and do my parts, 


02:44.947 --> 02:48.000
it could somehow be OK.


02:50.353 --> 02:53.000
But I was far from OK.


02:57.227 --> 03:01.965
The next night, we had family worship. 


03:01.965 --> 03:06.000
We were reading about the account 
of Ananias and his wife, Sapphira. 


03:12.508 --> 03:17.513
When a special fund was set up 
for needy Christians, Ananias sold a field. 


03:17.513 --> 03:21.450
But then, he boldly claimed 
he was contributing 


03:21.450 --> 03:24.753
the entire proceeds of its sale. 


03:24.753 --> 03:28.625
In reality, though, 
Ananias had “secretly held back 


03:28.625 --> 03:32.462
some of the price” 
for his personal gain.


03:32.462 --> 03:36.499
Peter boldly said to him: 
“You have lied, 


03:36.498 --> 03:40.000
not to men, but to God.” 


03:42.072 --> 03:45.000
Jehovah wasn’t fooled 
by their pretense. 


03:48.377 --> 03:52.382
Then we read Psalm 44:21: 


03:52.382 --> 03:54.384
“[God] is aware 


03:54.383 --> 03:59.000
of the secrets of the heart.”


04:08.130 --> 04:13.000
Reading this account of Ananias 
and Sapphira made me realize 


04:20.248 --> 04:25.000
I wasn’t just lying 
to my parents or my friends. 


04:27.083 --> 04:30.715
I was lying to Jehovah. 


04:30.715 --> 04:33.857
As much as I didn’t want 
to let my parents down, 


04:33.857 --> 04:37.000
even more so, 
I didn’t want to let Jehovah down.


04:45.402 --> 04:48.000
I prayed long that night. 


04:49.148 --> 04:52.000
I didn’t hold anything back.


04:57.813 --> 05:02.000
By the next morning, 
I knew what I wanted to do.


05:34.350 --> 05:39.088
It wasn’t easy, 
but my parents were very supportive, 


05:39.088 --> 05:43.000
and I also got the help 
I needed from the elders.


05:56.705 --> 06:00.042
It’s been a few years, 
but as I look back now, 


06:00.042 --> 06:04.000
I was one of those kids 
living a double life. 


06:05.715 --> 06:08.000
But now with Jehovah’s help, 


06:09.518 --> 06:28.221
I’m living the best life.

Well, the big day finally arrived.

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all those months of preparation, 

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was just as I imagined.

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh wait! 

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not me.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s me.

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I watched my sister 
get married that day, 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t help 
but think about my own future.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I began dating Shane, 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was perfect.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent a lot of time 
talking on the phone.

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:34.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything just naturally 
seemed to click.

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced he was the one.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:13.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But over time, 
I started to notice some things.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was starting to see patterns.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they didn’t seem 
to be getting better.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t even sure 
our goals were the same anymore.

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt alone. 

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But thankfully, I wasn’t.

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom kindly asked 
how things were going, 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I told her.

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maybe he’s not the one,” 
I told her.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought she was going to tell me 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which way I should go, 
but she didn’t. 

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, she reassured me 

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:19.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if he wasn’t the one, 
I was going to be OK.

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:47.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They reminded me about what Jesus said 
when building a tower. 

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For example, who of you 
wanting to build a tower 

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:56.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“does not first sit down 
and calculate the expense 

00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:59.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if he has enough 
to complete it?”

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:04.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I was about to enter 
into a building project of my own

00:05:04.754 --> 00:05:06.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my relationship with Shane—

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:09.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I too needed 
to “calculate the expense” 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I commit to it.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They encouraged me 
to talk to Shane 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell him about the things 
that were concerning me.

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:24.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I did.

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my mom was right. 

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was OK, more than OK, really.

00:05:36.953 --> 00:05:40.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shane and I decided it was best 
to break off the relationship.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some years later,

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:50.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found someone 
that loves Jehovah as much as I do, 

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:56.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I love him with my whole heart.

00:05.288 --> 00:09.425
For 23 years, 
we’ve called this place home. 


00:09.425 --> 00:11.762
We’ve raised a family here


00:11.762 --> 00:14.997
—two beautiful girls.


00:14.997 --> 00:19.935
Six months ago, 
my boss called me into his office. 


00:19.935 --> 00:22.472
The company was restructuring. 


00:22.472 --> 00:26.309
They valued my work, 
but if I wanted to keep my job, 


00:26.308 --> 00:27.843
I would need to move. 


00:27.843 --> 00:29.678
It was a difficult decision. 


00:29.678 --> 00:34.016
My job allowed me to support my family well, 
and it had never interfered 


00:34.017 --> 00:36.285
with our spiritual routine.


00:36.285 --> 00:38.522
We said many prayers about it. 


00:38.522 --> 00:43.125
We discussed it as a family, 
and we decided to move. 


00:43.125 --> 00:46.428
But we were anxious. 


00:46.428 --> 00:51.100
My family has only ever known 
one home, one congregation. 


00:51.100 --> 00:53.202
My girls have many friends 
in the congregation, 


00:53.202 --> 00:56.840
good examples who are helping them 
to serve Jehovah. 


00:56.840 --> 01:00.643
This is going 
to be hard on all of us.


01:00.643 --> 01:04.646
A brother in our hall had moved 
into the congregation a few years ago. 


01:04.647 --> 01:09.252
I asked him how his family 
coped with the challenge. 


01:09.252 --> 01:13.924
He said that the key to staying grounded 
is maintaining the one thing 


01:13.923 --> 01:17.826
that should never change 
—our spiritual routine.


01:17.827 --> 01:20.830
But that requires 
work and planning 


01:20.830 --> 01:24.567
to make sure our move doesn’t stop us 
from getting to the meetings, 


01:24.567 --> 01:26.937
sharing in the ministry, 
spending time


01:26.937 --> 01:31.374
with our brothers and sisters, 
and looking after our family.


01:31.373 --> 01:33.776
His advice was spot-on. 


01:33.777 --> 01:38.682
After some research, I found a scripture 
that illustrated our situation. 


01:38.682 --> 01:42.819
“And the rain poured down 
and the floods came 


01:42.818 --> 01:47.623
“and the winds blew and lashed 
against that house, but it did not cave in, 


01:47.623 --> 01:51.526
for it had been founded on the rock.”


01:51.527 --> 01:55.465
The discreet man 
built his house on good foundations. 


01:55.465 --> 01:58.367
It took a plan, 
and he worked hard. 


01:58.367 --> 02:01.570
When the storm came, 
his house survived.


02:01.570 --> 02:03.940
As a family, 


02:03.940 --> 02:08.478
we needed a plan that would help us 
stay spiritually grounded through our move. 


02:08.478 --> 02:11.580
So we wrote our own plan. 


02:11.580 --> 02:14.750
Just like the discreet man, 


02:14.750 --> 02:19.222
we wanted to build our move 
on a strong spiritual foundation.


02:19.222 --> 02:23.694
So we made a visit 
to our new congregation ahead of our move.


02:23.693 --> 02:26.261
Over the years, 
it becomes a comfort 


02:26.262 --> 02:29.465
to walk into a Kingdom Hall 
and see familiar faces. 


02:29.465 --> 02:34.737
Walking into our new congregation 
reminded me 


02:34.737 --> 02:37.407
how much we are going 
to miss everyone.


02:37.407 --> 02:42.179
But the Bible tells us 
that ‘with the measure we measure out, 


02:42.178 --> 02:44.946
others will measure 
to us in return.’ 


02:44.947 --> 02:49.000
So we resolved 
to show love first.


02:51.020 --> 02:52.655
Hello, I’m Jessica.


02:52.655 --> 02:54.490
Hi, I’m Samantha. 
Nice to meet you.


02:54.490 --> 02:58.795
The best way to get to know 
our new congregation is to work 


02:58.795 --> 03:01.397
with the brothers 
and sisters in the ministry. 


03:01.397 --> 03:04.134
No matter where we go, 
we’ll find people 


03:04.133 --> 03:07.836
that love Jehovah 
and each other.


03:07.837 --> 03:11.174
Moving day finally arrived. 


03:11.173 --> 03:13.175
The last boxes were packed. 


03:13.175 --> 03:18.000
We locked the door one final time 
and began our journey to our new home.


03:27.323 --> 03:29.958
It took effort, 


03:29.958 --> 03:34.396
but visiting the congregation 
ahead of time 


03:34.397 --> 03:36.399
was well worth it. 


03:36.398 --> 03:39.835
Look! 
We already have friends here. 


03:39.835 --> 03:42.405
Unpacking seemed to never end, 


03:42.405 --> 03:46.910
but the one thing 
that we all promised ourselves 


03:46.910 --> 03:49.578
at family worship 
was that we would not let 


03:49.578 --> 03:54.000
our move affect 
our spiritual routine.


03:55.518 --> 03:59.000
Has anyone seen my ties? 


04:00.088 --> 04:02.358
Found them!


04:02.358 --> 04:05.895
We planned that we 
wouldn’t let anything stop us 


04:05.895 --> 04:07.897
from going to the meetings. 


04:07.897 --> 04:11.367
The ministry is very different. 


04:11.367 --> 04:16.272
We’ve had to adapt 
and learn new techniques. 


04:16.272 --> 04:18.609
The brothers and sisters 
are different too. 


04:18.608 --> 04:21.476
It’s important not to focus 


04:21.477 --> 04:24.447
on negative comparisons. 


04:24.447 --> 04:29.385
Instead, be positive.


04:29.385 --> 04:33.522
During this transition, 
it is especially important to be sensitive 


04:33.522 --> 04:35.525
to our spiritual needs. 


04:35.525 --> 04:40.195
Family worship is vital. 


04:40.195 --> 04:44.267
Keeping spiritually grounded 
through such a big transition isn’t easy, 


04:44.267 --> 04:47.304
especially with a family. 


04:47.303 --> 04:51.306
It took a lot of time 
and energy to care for our needs, 


04:51.307 --> 04:55.512
not just spiritually, 
but emotionally too.


04:55.512 --> 04:58.580
Planning ahead, 
like the discreet man, 


04:58.580 --> 05:18.485
helped our family 
to stay spiritually grounded.

00:05 For 23 years,  we’ve called this place home.
00:09 We’ve raised a family here
00:11 —two beautiful girls.
00:14 Six months ago,  my boss called me into his office.
00:19 The company was restructuring.
00:22 They valued my work,  but if I wanted to keep my job,
00:26 I would need to move.
00:27 It was a difficult decision.
00:29 My job allowed me to support my family well,  and it had never interfered
00:34 with our spiritual routine.
00:36 We said many prayers about it.
00:38 We discussed it as a family,  and we decided to move.
00:43 But we were anxious.
00:46 My family has only ever known  one home, one congregation.
00:51 My girls have many friends  in the congregation,
00:53 good examples who are helping them  to serve Jehovah.
00:56 This is going  to be hard on all of us.
01:00 A brother in our hall had moved  into the congregation a few years ago.
01:04 I asked him how his family  coped with the challenge.
01:09 He said that the key to staying grounded  is maintaining the one thing
01:13 that should never change  —our spiritual routine.
01:17 But that requires  work and planning
01:20 to make sure our move doesn’t stop us  from getting to the meetings,
01:24 sharing in the ministry,  spending time
01:26 with our brothers and sisters,  and looking after our family.
01:31 His advice was spot-on.
01:33 After some research, I found a scripture  that illustrated our situation.
01:38 “And the rain poured down  and the floods came
01:42 “and the winds blew and lashed  against that house, but it did not cave in,
01:47 for it had been founded on the rock.”
01:51 The discreet man  built his house on good foundations.
01:55 It took a plan,  and he worked hard.
01:58 When the storm came,  his house survived.
02:01 As a family,
02:03 we needed a plan that would help us  stay spiritually grounded through our move.
02:08 So we wrote our own plan.
02:11 Just like the discreet man,
02:14 we wanted to build our move  on a strong spiritual foundation.
02:19 So we made a visit  to our new congregation ahead of our move.
02:23 Over the years,  it becomes a comfort
02:26 to walk into a Kingdom Hall  and see familiar faces.
02:29 Walking into our new congregation  reminded me
02:34 how much we are going  to miss everyone.
02:37 But the Bible tells us  that ‘with the measure we measure out,
02:42 others will measure  to us in return.’
02:44 So we resolved  to show love first.
02:51 Hello, I’m Jessica.
02:52 Hi, I’m Samantha.  Nice to meet you.
02:54 The best way to get to know  our new congregation is to work
02:58 with the brothers  and sisters in the ministry.
03:01 No matter where we go,  we’ll find people
03:04 that love Jehovah  and each other.
03:07 Moving day finally arrived.
03:11 The last boxes were packed.
03:13 We locked the door one final time  and began our journey to our new home.
03:27 It took effort,
03:29 but visiting the congregation  ahead of time
03:34 was well worth it.
03:36 Look!  We already have friends here.
03:39 Unpacking seemed to never end,
03:42 but the one thing  that we all promised ourselves
03:46 at family worship  was that we would not let
03:49 our move affect  our spiritual routine.
03:55 Has anyone seen my ties?
04:00 Found them!
04:02 We planned that we  wouldn’t let anything stop us
04:05 from going to the meetings.
04:07 The ministry is very different.
04:11 We’ve had to adapt  and learn new techniques.
04:16 The brothers and sisters  are different too.
04:18 It’s important not to focus
04:21 on negative comparisons.
04:24 Instead, be positive.
04:29 During this transition,  it is especially important to be sensitive
04:33 to our spiritual needs.
04:35 Family worship is vital.
04:40 Keeping spiritually grounded  through such a big transition isn’t easy,
04:44 especially with a family.
04:47 It took a lot of time  and energy to care for our needs,
04:51 not just spiritually,  but emotionally too.
04:55 Planning ahead,  like the discreet man,
04:58 helped our family  to stay spiritually grounded.

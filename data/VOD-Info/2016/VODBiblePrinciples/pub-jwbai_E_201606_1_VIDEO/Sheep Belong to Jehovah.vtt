00:02.607 --> 00:05.609
I always loved music. 


00:05.608 --> 00:08.736
I got my first guitar 
when I was 15, 


00:08.737 --> 00:12.000
and since then it’s been my way 
of expressing myself.


00:13.783 --> 00:15.785
When they asked, 


00:15.785 --> 00:18.872
“Dave, do you want 
to join the band?” 


00:18.872 --> 00:21.375
I didn’t have to think twice.


00:21.375 --> 00:26.000
Making music, 
that’s all that really mattered to me. 


00:27.548 --> 00:30.133
I thought being a musician 
would make me happy.


00:30.133 --> 00:34.000
So that is the path 
I followed.


00:38.767 --> 00:43.000
Only it is not 
what I thought it to be.


00:48.652 --> 00:51.000
I work here 
during the day to pay the bills. 


00:52.615 --> 00:56.118
I thought my life 
would turn out better. 


00:56.118 --> 00:59.288
But something was missing.


00:59.288 --> 01:05.000
Instead of being happy, 
I just felt lost.


01:09.548 --> 01:12.000
Man, I’m distracted!


01:20.308 --> 01:23.000
They are friendly 
and look happy.


01:30.610 --> 01:34.282
He gave me a tract and said: 


01:34.282 --> 01:37.994
“Many people are searching 
for true happiness. 


01:37.993 --> 01:40.000
Maybe you 
are one of them.”


01:42.372 --> 01:45.000
This could help.


01:50.338 --> 01:53.925
I quickly wrote down my address 


01:53.925 --> 01:59.000
and asked whether they would mind 
passing by after I finished my shift.


02:02.810 --> 02:06.813
I was searching all right.


02:06.813 --> 02:11.000
Actually, the answers 
were in front of me all along.


02:15.863 --> 02:20.000
How come I only get it now?


02:23.455 --> 02:26.917
You see, 


02:26.917 --> 02:29.754
I was baptized. 


02:29.753 --> 02:31.000
But I never gave 
the truth a chance.


02:38.762 --> 02:42.000
Roy did come as promised. 


02:43.892 --> 02:46.000
I told him, 
“I’m a baptized brother.”


02:52.985 --> 02:55.000
He really listened to me.


02:58.490 --> 03:00.867
Then he shared Psalm 100:3:


03:00.867 --> 03:04.037
“Know that Jehovah is God. 


03:04.037 --> 03:07.792
“He is the one who made us, 
and we belong to him. 


03:07.792 --> 03:11.000
We are his people 
and the sheep of his pasture.”


03:12.670 --> 03:16.342
In the Bible, 
Jehovah is likened to a shepherd. 


03:16.342 --> 03:19.177
He knows 
every single one of his sheep, 


03:19.177 --> 03:22.000
and he knows 
when one goes missing.


03:23.765 --> 03:28.520
A lost sheep is not a lost cause; 
it still belongs to him. 


03:28.520 --> 03:30.730
And Jehovah 
doesn’t spare any efforts 


03:30.730 --> 03:34.000
in searching for it 
until he finds it.


03:39.448 --> 03:42.616
I was like one of those lost sheep. 


03:42.617 --> 03:45.000
But I still belonged 
to Jehovah, 


03:47.663 --> 03:51.000
and he has never 
forgotten about me.


03:56.257 --> 03:59.427
Roy promised 
we would keep in touch 


03:59.427 --> 04:03.000
and invited me 
to the Sunday meeting.


04:12.647 --> 04:14.817
Man, I was nervous 
that morning. 


04:14.817 --> 04:17.000
I wanted to look my best.


04:23.658 --> 04:27.328
Roy and Matthew 
were waiting for me, 


04:27.328 --> 04:30.165
giving me a warm welcome


04:30.165 --> 04:34.127
—something I’ll never forget.


04:34.127 --> 04:37.000
How I missed this! 


04:39.007 --> 04:42.594
This is indeed 
Jehovah’s congregation. 


04:42.593 --> 04:46.000
This is where I belong.


04:50.852 --> 04:55.000
The truth has never 
been so clear to me.


05:00.445 --> 05:05.000
How I enjoy the close company
of my brothers and sisters!


05:07.870 --> 05:10.872
What I enjoy most 
is helping others 


05:10.872 --> 05:14.000
to find our loving Father, 
Jehovah.


05:18.213 --> 05:49.891
With Jehovah’s help, 
I will never be lost again.

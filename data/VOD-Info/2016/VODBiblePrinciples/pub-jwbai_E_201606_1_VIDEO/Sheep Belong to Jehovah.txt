00:02 I always loved music.
00:05 I got my first guitar  when I was 15,
00:08 and since then it’s been my way  of expressing myself.
00:13 When they asked,
00:15 “Dave, do you want  to join the band?”
00:18 I didn’t have to think twice.
00:21 Making music,  that’s all that really mattered to me.
00:27 I thought being a musician  would make me happy.
00:30 So that is the path  I followed.
00:38 Only it is not  what I thought it to be.
00:48 I work here  during the day to pay the bills.
00:52 I thought my life  would turn out better.
00:56 But something was missing.
00:59 Instead of being happy,  I just felt lost.
01:09 Man, I’m distracted!
01:20 They are friendly  and look happy.
01:30 He gave me a tract and said:
01:34 “Many people are searching  for true happiness.
01:37 Maybe you  are one of them.”
01:42 This could help.
01:50 I quickly wrote down my address
01:53 and asked whether they would mind  passing by after I finished my shift.
02:02 I was searching all right.
02:06 Actually, the answers  were in front of me all along.
02:15 How come I only get it now?
02:23 You see,
02:26 I was baptized.
02:29 But I never gave  the truth a chance.
02:38 Roy did come as promised.
02:43 I told him,  “I’m a baptized brother.”
02:52 He really listened to me.
02:58 Then he shared Psalm 100:3:
03:00 “Know that Jehovah is God.
03:04 “He is the one who made us,  and we belong to him.
03:07 We are his people  and the sheep of his pasture.”
03:12 In the Bible,  Jehovah is likened to a shepherd.
03:16 He knows  every single one of his sheep,
03:19 and he knows  when one goes missing.
03:23 A lost sheep is not a lost cause;  it still belongs to him.
03:28 And Jehovah  doesn’t spare any efforts
03:30 in searching for it  until he finds it.
03:39 I was like one of those lost sheep.
03:42 But I still belonged  to Jehovah,
03:47 and he has never  forgotten about me.
03:56 Roy promised  we would keep in touch
03:59 and invited me  to the Sunday meeting.
04:12 Man, I was nervous  that morning.
04:14 I wanted to look my best.
04:23 Roy and Matthew  were waiting for me,
04:27 giving me a warm welcome
04:30 —something I’ll never forget.
04:34 How I missed this!
04:39 This is indeed  Jehovah’s congregation.
04:42 This is where I belong.
04:50 The truth has never  been so clear to me.
05:00 How I enjoy the close company of my brothers and sisters!
05:07 What I enjoy most  is helping others
05:10 to find our loving Father,  Jehovah.
05:18 With Jehovah’s help,  I will never be lost again.

I grew up in this congregation,

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:15.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for many years,
it felt like a loving family.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But lately I struggle

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel the same enthusiasm.

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the elders
—I struggle to understand them too.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Traffic is bad after work,

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:31.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they probably think that I’m slacking.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They only notice their favorites,

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Thulani.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:43.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s got to be the slowest brother on mics.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this couple

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—every week they are on the platform,

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:54.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving all the attention.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know this irritates Sizwe too.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know when I started feeling
this way about my congregation.

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:14.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But lately I feel
so disconnected from these people.

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been giving Bible reading assignments

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I was his age.

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:32.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are still the only assignments I get.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:36.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with each passing month,

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find myself feeling more and more unhappy

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this congregation.

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:32.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why, then, do you look at the straw
in your brother’s eye

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:35.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but do not notice
the rafter in your own eye?

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or how can you say to your brother,

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Allow me to remove
the straw from your eye,’

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:45.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when look!
a rafter is in your own eye?

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:48.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hypocrite!

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:50.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“First remove the rafter from your own eye,

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then you will see clearly how to remove

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the straw from your brother’s eye.”

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, I wonder:
‘What did Jesus mean by that?

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:13.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How could you fit a rafter in your eye?

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And how will you see anything else?

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:19.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can someone with a rafter in his eye

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:23.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even try to remove a straw
from someone else’s eye?’

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading the Bible can be funny sometimes.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus actually said:

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hypocrite!
First remove the rafter from your own eye.”

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:42.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hypocrite!”

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus call this man a hypocrite?

00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps he was so focused on the straws

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:53.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the mistakes of others—

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he did not see the bigger mistakes

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the rafter—

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in himself.

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, but that made me think,

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am <i>I</i>  a hypocrite?’

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to enjoy my service.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to be negative
or critical of my brothers.

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:32.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do I fix it?

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed.

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jehovah to forgive me.

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked for humility too.

00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:04.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I went on and asked my boss

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I could leave 30 minutes early

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could do that Bible reading.

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was surprised when he said yes.

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even suggested
that I could leave early every meeting night!

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:23.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like Jehovah
walked into his office before I did.

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Brother Khumalo commended me,

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even then I thought,
‘Is he being genuine?’

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I realized

00:05:55.038 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to continue
to “remove the rafter” from my eye.

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:02.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to try to view the whole congregation

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way Jehovah views them.

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope to enjoy the new world
with them one day.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the months,

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by becoming more helpful and less critical,

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:22.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel more connected to my congregation.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Applying Bible principles
helped me see the reality

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was <i>my</i>  attitude
that made me unhappy,

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the mistakes of my brothers.

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All this time,

00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:42.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way to change my congregation

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to change myself.

<b>My name is Yaroslav Dovhanych.</b>

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I received my degree</b>
<b>from the Biology Department</b>

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>of the Uzhgorod State University</b>

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and specialized in zoology.</b>

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I love nature very much</b>

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and want to protect it.</b>

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The evolutionary theory,</b>
<b>in my opinion,</b>

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>quite reasonably argued</b>

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that there is no Creator</b>
<b>—that everything</b>

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>was shaped</b>
<b>by a series of random change</b><b>s</b>

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and combinations.</b>

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I was unable to prove this,</b>
<b>but I believed it. </b>

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And that is why</b>
<b>I was an evolutionist.</b>

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I was a staunch evolutionist.</b>

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>While working</b>
<b>in the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve</b>

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and studying</b>
<b>how ecological systems function, </b>

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I studied nature through the lens</b>
<b>of the evolution theory.</b>

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>When I studied nature</b>
<b>through this lens,</b>

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I began to notice things</b>

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that contradicted the theory of evolution.</b>

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I found things</b>

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that couldn’t have been formed</b>
<b>by natural selection.</b>

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>As I started to wonder about this</b>

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>—whether there is a Creator—</b>

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I began to discover more facts</b>

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>contradicting the theory of evolution.</b>

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Can anyone say that some computer programs</b>
<b>appeared simply by chance?</b>

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>In contrast,</b>
<b>evolutionists would like us to believe</b>

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that DNA was formed by evolution.</b>

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>To illustrate:</b>

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Say you take some letter blocks,</b>

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>pour them onto the table,</b>

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and the </b><b><i>Encyclopedia Britannica </b></i><b> </b><b>is formed.</b>

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>There is an even smaller probability</b>

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:51.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that DNA originated by evolution.</b>

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:57.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>When I started</b>
<b>to seriously consider the possibility</b>

00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that the world</b>
<b>might have been created,</b>

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I began to meditate</b>
<b>about the following:</b>

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I knew that religion explains</b>

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that the world was created by God.</b>

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So I decided to examine</b>
<b>different religious teachings,</b>

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:19.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>including what the Bible says</b>
<b>about how God created the world.</b>

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The Bible is very old,</b>

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:26.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>thousands of years old,</b>
<b>and yet its contents</b>

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>are accurate</b><b> </b><b>and authentic to this day.</b>

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And the Bible contains many prophecies;</b>

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:37.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>these are the foretelling of events.</b>

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:45.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>They were to occur in the distant future,</b>
<b>sometimes many centuries in the future.</b>

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>History confirms</b>
<b>that they have been fulfilled</b>

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>exactly as the Bible foretold.</b>

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So these predictions</b>
<b>must have been made by someone</b>

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>whose abilities are far greater than man’s.</b>

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>This proves</b>
<b>that the Author of the Bible is not man,</b>

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:07.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>but someone who is far wiser</b>

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and has abilities that man lacks.</b>

00:00:05 My name is Yaroslav Dovhanych.
00:00:08 I received my degree from the Biology Department
00:00:11 of the Uzhgorod State University
00:00:13 and specialized in zoology.
00:00:16 I love nature very much
00:00:18 and want to protect it.
00:00:20 The evolutionary theory, in my opinion,
00:00:23 quite reasonably argued
00:00:25 that there is no Creator —that everything
00:00:27 was shaped by a series of random changes
00:00:30 and combinations.
00:00:32 I was unable to prove this, but I believed it.
00:00:36 And that is why I was an evolutionist.
00:00:39 I was a staunch evolutionist.
00:00:44 While working in the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve
00:00:47 and studying how ecological systems function,
00:00:50 I studied nature through the lens of the evolution theory.
00:00:57 When I studied nature through this lens,
00:00:59 I began to notice things
00:01:01 that contradicted the theory of evolution.
00:01:04 I found things
00:01:05 that couldn’t have been formed by natural selection.
00:01:12 As I started to wonder about this
00:01:15 —whether there is a Creator—
00:01:17 I began to discover more facts
00:01:19 contradicting the theory of evolution.
00:01:23 Can anyone say that some computer programs appeared simply by chance?
00:01:27 In contrast, evolutionists would like us to believe
00:01:31 that DNA was formed by evolution.
00:01:33 To illustrate:
00:01:35 Say you take some letter blocks,
00:01:38 pour them onto the table,
00:01:42 and the Encyclopedia Britannica  is formed.
00:01:46 There is an even smaller probability
00:01:49 that DNA originated by evolution.
00:01:53 When I started to seriously consider the possibility
00:01:57 that the world might have been created,
00:02:00 I began to meditate about the following:
00:02:05 I knew that religion explains
00:02:07 that the world was created by God.
00:02:11 So I decided to examine different religious teachings,
00:02:14 including what the Bible says about how God created the world.
00:02:21 The Bible is very old,
00:02:23 thousands of years old, and yet its contents
00:02:26 are accurate and authentic to this day.
00:02:29 And the Bible contains many prophecies;
00:02:33 these are the foretelling of events.
00:02:40 They were to occur in the distant future, sometimes many centuries in the future.
00:02:45 History confirms that they have been fulfilled
00:02:48 exactly as the Bible foretold.
00:02:51 So these predictions must have been made by someone
00:02:55 whose abilities are far greater than man’s.
00:03:01 This proves that the Author of the Bible is not man,
00:03:05 but someone who is far wiser
00:03:07 and has abilities that man lacks.

00:07 My name is Monica Richardson.
00:09 I studied genetics and chemistry
00:11 and then medicine in Stockholm, Sweden.
00:15 I believed in evolution  because of my education.
00:17 Everybody did.
00:19 It was something I never doubted;
00:21 it was taught as a scientific fact.
00:23 And even those  who perhaps believed
00:27 that there was a God  believed that this God
00:30 would have used evolution in the creation process.
00:35 I want to talk  about the miracle of birth.
00:38 Now, during pregnancy,
00:40 the baby is supplied oxygen  via the placenta,
00:44 but at birth  it will have to use its lungs.
00:49 In the womb the baby’s lungs  are collapsed.
00:52 After breath,  they have to become inflated.
00:55 Now, this is a very hard work  for the baby to do.
01:01 So during the latter part of pregnancy,
01:03 there is a very special chemical
01:06 produced and secreted
01:09 called a pulmonary surfactant.
01:13 And that chemical  is being deposited on the surface
01:17 of the peripheral parts of the lungs
01:19 where the gas exchange is taking place
01:22 to lower the surface tension.
01:25 And that means  that when the baby is born
01:27 and starts to inflate its lungs, he can do it.
01:33 One wonders,  ‘Is this a result of a clever,
01:39 ‘intelligent conception and design,
01:42 or could it  have happened by chance?’
01:46 Well, it was  when the Witnesses called on me
01:48 that I really got encouraged to,
01:50 for the first time in my life,  look into the Bible.
01:55 Life around us  is so cleverly designed
02:01 I can’t believe there is a design  without a designer.

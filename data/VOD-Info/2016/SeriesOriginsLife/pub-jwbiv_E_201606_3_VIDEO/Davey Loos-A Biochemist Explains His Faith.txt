00:05 My name is Davey Loos.
00:07 I studied biochemistry  at the University of Leuven in Belgium,
00:10 and after that time  I did a PhD in the same area.
00:14 When I was a young child,  I believed in the Bible.
00:18 But growing up,  I kind of lost my interest in it.
00:22 When you go to university  and you study life sciences
00:25 or biochemistry, for example,
00:27 you get introduced into the idea  of the origin of life very quickly
00:31 and also into the principle  of evolution.
00:33 The professors  who taught these courses,
00:36 they were really scientists  with long careers,
00:38 and they were well-established scientists,  and we had a lot of respect for them.
00:42 So there was just no way to really question the principle of evolution.
00:48 In 1999, there was a war  in Europe—in Kosovo
00:52 —and I remember reading  in the Bible as a child
00:55 about the future events  that would take place,
01:00 and I started wondering whether the war  in Kosovo was one of those events.
01:04 So that led me  to pick up the Bible again.
01:08 At the time, I felt that I had to reexamine  my beliefs about the origin of life
01:12 and also about the principle  of evolution.
01:17 Based on the theory of evolution,  we would expect to see
01:20 an abundance of transitional forms  to be present in the fossil record.
01:24 But when we do look at the fossil evidence, we just don’t see that.
01:28 We see that the major species
01:30 come into existence  at specific times,
01:33 and their form and structure  is still exactly the same
01:35 as their form  and structure today.
01:38 It was actually Darwin himself  who wrote in his book
01:42 that the biggest objection  that could be brought against this theory
01:46 would be the fact  that the fossil record
01:49 does not show an abundance  of transitional forms.
01:53 And that’s what really happens  if you look at the set of data
01:58 —the fossil record seems to prove  the opposite of evolution.
02:02 As a biochemist,  I had the opportunity to learn about
02:07 and study  many different biomolecules.
02:09 And I observed  that pretty much every biomolecule
02:13 is really a complex molecule.
02:15 We can look at them  as nanoscale molecular motors
02:19 or machines that are performing  very complex and specific tasks.
02:25 For me, the complexity that we see in nature and the complexity in those molecules
02:30 points to the fact  that there really is a Creator.

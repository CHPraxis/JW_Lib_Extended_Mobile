00:05.483 --> 00:07.485
My name is Davey Loos. 


00:07.485 --> 00:10.865
I studied biochemistry 
at the University of Leuven in Belgium, 


00:10.865 --> 00:14.577
and after that time 
I did a PhD in the same area.


00:14.577 --> 00:18.414
When I was a young child, 
I believed in the Bible. 


00:18.413 --> 00:22.668
But growing up, 
I kind of lost my interest in it. 


00:22.668 --> 00:25.586
When you go to university 
and you study life sciences 


00:25.587 --> 00:27.882
or biochemistry, for example,


00:27.882 --> 00:31.594
you get introduced into the idea 
of the origin of life very quickly 


00:31.593 --> 00:33.595
and also into the principle 
of evolution.


00:33.595 --> 00:36.265
The professors 
who taught these courses, 


00:36.265 --> 00:38.725
they were really scientists 
with long careers, 


00:38.725 --> 00:42.938
and they were well-established scientists, 
and we had a lot of respect for them. 


00:42.938 --> 00:47.000
So there was just no way to really question
the principle of evolution.


00:48.693 --> 00:52.698
In 1999, there was a war 
in Europe—in Kosovo


00:52.698 --> 00:55.910
—and I remember reading 
in the Bible as a child 


00:55.910 --> 01:00.705
about the future events 
that would take place, 


01:00.705 --> 01:04.502
and I started wondering whether the war 
in Kosovo was one of those events. 


01:04.502 --> 01:07.000
So that led me 
to pick up the Bible again.


01:08.422 --> 01:12.677
At the time, I felt that I had to reexamine 
my beliefs about the origin of life 


01:12.677 --> 01:16.000
and also about the principle 
of evolution.


01:17.682 --> 01:20.684
Based on the theory of evolution, 
we would expect to see 


01:20.683 --> 01:24.855
an abundance of transitional forms 
to be present in the fossil record. 


01:24.855 --> 01:28.150
But when we do look at the fossil evidence,
we just don’t see that. 


01:28.150 --> 01:30.652
We see that the major species 


01:30.652 --> 01:33.155
come into existence 
at specific times, 


01:33.155 --> 01:35.907
and their form and structure 
is still exactly the same


01:35.907 --> 01:38.077
as their form 
and structure today.


01:38.077 --> 01:42.580
It was actually Darwin himself 
who wrote in his book 


01:42.580 --> 01:46.668
that the biggest objection 
that could be brought against this theory 


01:46.668 --> 01:49.838
would be the fact 
that the fossil record 


01:49.838 --> 01:53.758
does not show an abundance 
of transitional forms. 


01:53.758 --> 01:58.013
And that’s what really happens 
if you look at the set of data


01:58.013 --> 02:02.768
—the fossil record seems to prove 
the opposite of evolution.


02:02.768 --> 02:07.188
As a biochemist, 
I had the opportunity to learn about 


02:07.188 --> 02:09.858
and study 
many different biomolecules. 


02:09.858 --> 02:13.361
And I observed 
that pretty much every biomolecule 


02:13.362 --> 02:15.530
is really a complex molecule. 


02:15.530 --> 02:19.868
We can look at them 
as nanoscale molecular motors 


02:19.868 --> 02:24.000
or machines that are performing 
very complex and specific tasks.


02:25.332 --> 02:30.170
For me, the complexity that we see in nature
and the complexity in those molecules 


02:30.170 --> 02:46.083
points to the fact 
that there really is a Creator.

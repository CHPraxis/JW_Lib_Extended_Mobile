00:01 We now have a special treat.
00:03 Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body
00:06 will give a talk  based on a specific Bible verse.
00:10 His talk is “‘Sing Out Joyfully’ to Jehovah!”
00:15 Mark my words, this is a special treat!
00:28 I hope I can live up to his comments.
00:36 David did it as he played on his harp.
00:41 The Levites did it regularly at the temple.
00:45 Jesus did it shortly before being executed.
00:49 Paul and Silas did it while in stocks,  deep in a prison dungeon.
00:55 The resurrected anointed do it
00:59 as they stand before Jehovah’s throne.
01:02 What activity are we talking about?
01:06 We’re talking about singing  songs of praise to Jehovah.
01:11 And, of course, all of us want  to imitate these fine Bible examples.
01:15 But now,  how do we want to sing these songs?
01:18 What approach?
01:20 Well, let’s go to 1 Chronicles 15,
01:23 and let’s see how we want to sing
01:26 these songs of praise.
01:30 First Chronicles 15:16:
01:33 “David then told the chiefs of the Levites
01:37 “to appoint their brothers the singers,”
01:40 now notice, “to sing out joyfully,
01:44 “accompanied by musical instruments:
01:48 stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals.”
01:52 Now, does this scripture say  that we should move our lips
01:57 but with no sound  coming out of our mouth?
02:00 Can you imagine Jesus singing like that?
02:03 Does this scripture indicate  we should mumble our words?
02:07 speak in an undertone,  like we do sometimes when we read the Bible?
02:11 No, we’re told “to sing out”!
02:14 That means, obviously,  enthusiastically projecting our voices.
02:19 Perhaps you remember a picture
02:21 in the inside cover pages  of one of our previous songbooks.
02:26 It was a picture of the Levites singing.
02:29 And obviously they  were projecting their voices.
02:33 In fact, their mouths were so wide open,  you could almost see their tonsils.
02:38 Well, good example for us.
02:41 Think about this:
02:43 Many worldly people will sing out
02:45 worldly songs with a joyful attitude.
02:48 Well, much more so to our God,
02:52 who is worthy  of such worshipful praise,
02:55 do we want to give it  to him enthusiastically.
02:59 But now let’s look at a brief video
03:02 that highlights some of the history  of how Jehovah’s people
03:05 have always felt about singing  songs of praise to Jehovah.
03:12 I love singing to Jehovah.
03:14 It’s something  that I find so personally strengthening.
03:19 I think it’s such a wonderful privilege
03:21 to be able to praise
03:22 Jehovah’s name by singing.
03:24 Mind you, I would never be called  a professional singer.
03:28 We know that birds sing,
03:30 but they’re not singing praises to Jehovah.
03:32 And, of course, dogs bark and cats meow,
03:35 but humans can really sing  and praise Jehovah with their words.
03:39 And it always reminds me  of the account in the book of Acts,
03:43 Acts chapter 16,
03:45 where it talks about the apostle Paul  and Silas when they were in prison.
03:50 It says:  “But about the middle of the night,
03:52 “Paul and Silas were praying
03:54 “and praising God with song,
03:57 and the prisoners were listening to them.”
03:59 Obviously,  the songs that they sang at that time
04:03 helped them to ease the pain  of their very sore backs;
04:06 they had been beaten.
04:08 So the spiritual side of us  becomes stronger when we sing.
04:15 In our organization
04:16 from the very beginning, hymns were used.
04:20 But then the brothers and sisters
04:22 began producing their own songs,
04:24 and they put them into a book form.
04:27 Back in 1944,  we released a songbook
04:31 that was called  the Kingdom Service Songbook.
04:34 And after a half million copies  had been released
04:37 and just six years later (1950),
04:40 we came out with a brand new songbook,  Songs to Jehovah’s Praise.
04:44 Now, no doubt  many of the brothers wondered,
04:46 ‘Why are we doing this?’
04:48 But, of course, you see,
04:50 the New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures
04:52 had just been released in 1950.
04:55 And then we’ve had several books  that have been released
04:57 down through the decades.
04:59 So it’s always been  a part of the modern-day worship.
05:15 You know, when you ponder  what we’ve discussed thus far,
05:19 you’re probably beginning to ask yourself,
05:22 ‘When are we going to get our new songbook?’
05:29 Well, I must tell you  that the songbook project
05:33 has proved to be more challenging,
05:36 more complex  than the Governing Body anticipated.
05:39 But, nevertheless,  despite the challenges and the complications,
05:44 we’re confident that we’re going  to be able to release this book
05:47 to you within less than 12 months.
06:04 In fact, we’re talking  about much less than 12 months.
06:08 We’re talking about right now!
06:10 The Governing Body  is very happy to release . . .
06:25 I don’t think I had most of you fooled.
06:29 We are so happy to release this new songbook,
06:33 entitled “Sing Out Joyfully” to Jehovah.
06:37 That’s the “SOJJ” book, Brother Herd.
06:55 This new songbook,  “Sing Out Joyfully” to Jehovah,
06:59 is being provided in three formats:
07:02 There’s the small  and the large with musical notations,
07:07 and then there’s  (in the large size only) lyrics only.
07:12 And you’re going to be able  to obtain your personal copy
07:16 electronically in English.
07:19 This will be Monday, October the 3rd.
07:22 So we’re talking  about just two days from now.
07:24 You can go on jw.org,
07:27 Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY,
07:30 or JW Library,
07:32 and you can get that copy  of this beautiful songbook.
07:36 But now, here’s a question,
07:38 How soon are we going to sing  songs from the new songbook?
07:44 Well, you’ll be happy to know  that beginning in January,
07:46 just three months from now,
07:48 English-speaking congregations  will begin to sing these new songs.
07:53 And you’ll be happy to know, too,
07:55 that the Governing Body  has arranged for a new provision
07:59 to come along with the new songbook.
08:01 We’re going to have  the lyrics in video format.
08:06 Now, we enjoyed right here  having the lyrics on the screen,
08:11 and we enjoyed it  during the summer conventions
08:15 —the regional and the special conventions.
08:17 Instead of having to look down
08:20 and try to look at your songbook  or your tablet,
08:24 we were able to hold our heads erect
08:27 and sing out joyfully to Jehovah.
08:31 Well, you’ll be able  to do that in the congregation.
08:46 But now, we talked about receiving  our songbook electronically,
08:51 and we noticed that many of you  are using electronic devices
08:55 in order to receive  the publications and to use them.
08:59 And this is commendable.
09:01 This saves the organization  considerable funds.
09:04 But what if you want  a hard copy of the new songbook?
09:08 Well, we’re happy  to inform you that you can order
09:12 through the congregation a hard copy.
09:15 Within a few days,  English-speaking congregations
09:18 and also several other  foreign-language speaking congregations
09:22 will receive a letter
09:24 telling you how you may submit the order.
09:27 And we’re happy to inform you too
09:30 that the hard copy songbook will have,
09:34 whether it’s the small or the large,
09:36 it’ll have the same  beautiful gray deluxe cover
09:40 that our revised  New World Translation Bible has.
09:44 So what a beautiful compliment  the songbook will be to the Bible.
09:48 For those who use hard copy,
09:51 you will truly enjoy using
09:54 the beautiful “gray twins.”
10:09 But now,  we talked about English mostly.
10:12 What about other languages?
10:14 Well, translations are being made  into other languages as we speak.
10:19 And as soon as possible,  these other language releases will be made.
10:23 In fact, I’ve been informed
10:26 that there will be  quite a number of other languages.
10:29 We’ll be able to release  the songbook in those languages
10:32 within less than 12 months.
10:36 And this time, I’m not teasing.
10:40 But additional information  will be provided as soon as available.
10:44 But now,  let’s discuss some interesting information
10:47 about the new songbook.
10:49 First, we’re going to talk  about the composition of the songs
10:52 and then a little bit  about the structure of the songbook.
10:56 But now you’re probably thinking:
10:59 ‘Why is Brother Splane not presenting  this information?
11:04 Why is Brother Lett trying to present this?’
11:07 Well, I can understand your question;
11:13 I had the same question.
11:17 But the truth is,
11:19 all seven members  of the Governing Body love, very much,
11:24 singing songs of praise to Jehovah.
11:27 Of course, some are  a lot better singers than the rest of us.
11:31 And all of us are happy that we  don’t have student singing assignments
11:35 on the midweek meeting
11:39 because we wouldn’t want to send  the brothers running for their earplugs.
11:45 But now I’ve got to get serious.
11:48 Let’s talk about the composition  of the songs.
11:52 Well, here’s an interesting point:
11:54 Rather than request  contributed songs from various songwriters,
11:58 the Governing Body assigned a composer
12:01 and a lyricist team  to work specifically on the project.
12:06 And then the Governing Body  closely supervised that team.
12:10 For example,  providing subject themes for songs
12:15 that would be very relevant  to our meetings,
12:17 assemblies, conventions,  and the field ministry.
12:21 And the team worked very hard
12:24 specifically crafting each song
12:26 according to that direction.
12:29 Here’s another point that you can imagine:
12:31 The revised New World Translation
12:34 resulted in changing a lot of the lyrics
12:37 —a replacement of different words  and expressions.
12:40 Just a few examples:
12:42 Most references to Sheol, seed,  long-suffering have been replaced.
12:47 The song “Long-Suffering”  is now “Exercise Patience.”
12:53 The expression “loving-kindness”  is now “loyal love.”
12:57 “Time indefinite” has been replaced
12:59 with expressions  such as “forevermore” or “eternal life.”
13:04 Here’s another point:
13:06 Doctrinal refinements, of course,  affected some of the lyrics.
13:10 Just one example:
13:12 The expanded explanation  of the meaning of Jehovah’s name
13:17 resulted in opening the door  to more application
13:21 of Jehovah ‘Causing to Become.’
13:25 Here’s another point:
13:27 An effort was made to have
13:29 less direct counsel in the songs.
13:33 So rather than some feeling awkward  as they were singing praises
13:37 and that they were maybe giving  counsel to others as they were singing
13:41 —well, we’ve changed that.
13:43 That has been taken out.
13:45 Here’s another thing:
13:47 Certain awkward expressions
13:49 have been removed from the songs.
13:52 Just one example:
13:54 In one of our current songs,
13:56 there’s an expression that makes it appear
13:59 that single people are probably lonely.
14:02 Well, we took that out.
14:08 Here’s another detail,
14:10 and we present this in the form of a caution:
14:13 Be careful when you are singing  from the new songbook
14:18 because the majority of the songs
14:20 —these older songs— have had lyrics adjusted.
14:24 So if you just sing  from your previous memory bank,
14:28 you’re going to find  yourself often in trouble.
14:32 But now, just a few comments  about the structure of the songbook:
14:36 An effort has been made  to put the songs in subject order.
14:40 And there are 15 categories now,
14:43 and the categories are listed  in the index in the front of the songbook.
14:47 The first 12 songs
14:50 appropriately are  under the category “Jehovah,”
14:54 and these are songs  of direct praise to Jehovah
14:58 or songs about his name  or his qualities.
15:02 “Meeting Together” —that’s another category—
15:05 songs about our meeting together  and worshipping together.
15:10 The category “Godly Qualities”
15:13 —and included  among other songs in this section
15:17 are songs that develop each one
15:20 of the aspects  of the fruitage of the holy spirit
15:24 mentioned at Galatians 5:22, 23.
15:27 And they’re developed  in the order in the songbook
15:30 that they’re listed in that scripture.
15:32 So that’s very helpful.
15:34 But now here’s something  we’d like to say regarding the structure:
15:37 There is no significance to the song numbers
15:42 assigned to each song.
15:45 Over the years,  some have worked very hard
15:48 to try to figure out  the significance of the song numbers.
15:52 For example,
15:54 many concluded  it wasn’t just coincidence
15:58 that the song “Be Forgiving”  was song number 77.
16:05 Similarly,
16:08 the song “We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses,”
16:11 many thought  it was no coincidence that that song
16:14 was song number 1931; I mean 31.
16:19 But we want to tell you up front,
16:22 there is no significance  to the numbering and,
16:27 for that matter,  there was not in the current songbook.
16:33 The numbers are random,
16:36 with the songs placed  in the category they fit best in
16:40 and where they fit best  in regard to the engraving layout.
16:46 Now, here’s another thought:
16:48 Three of the older songs  have been removed
16:51 from the new songbook.
16:53 And quite a number  have been totally revised with new subjects.
16:58 For example, the song  “The Scene of This World Is Changing”
17:01 has now been totally revised  to a more positive subject,
17:06 “Keep Working, Watching, and Waiting.”
17:10 The song “Making Our Way Successful”
17:13 is now “Life Depends on God’s Word.”
17:16 The song formerly  “Content With God’s Good Gifts,”
17:19 which had limited use,
17:21 is now “Teaching the Word of God”
17:23 —a much more practical subject  for our meetings or our field ministry.
17:28 Now, here’s one more point  regarding the structure:
17:32 Many of the songs have been reformatted
17:36 and spread out over more pages.
17:38 Why?
17:40 Well, for one thing,  it gives more space for other languages
17:44 that need more space
17:46 to be able to put the lyrics  under the musical notes.
17:50 Another advantage by spreading them out:
17:52 It makes it easier to read the music
17:54 in the case of those who enjoy playing
17:57 the songs on piano.
18:00 But now, let’s look at another video,
18:03 and this one shows us some interesting facts
18:07 about the making of our new songbook.
18:12 The Governing Body’s support  for this project was unanimous.
18:17 One of the reasons  we felt it was especially important
18:20 was because of the revised  New World Translation.
18:23 It was important for us  to change the songs as well,
18:26 so that all the terminology  in the revised version would match the songs.
18:31 In our audience,  we have some of our brothers and sisters
18:34 who have the heavenly hope.
18:36 And, of course,  the majority in our audience
18:39 are looking forward  to life everlasting right here on the earth.
18:42 So the words of our songs  would have to include both groups.
18:47 There are a few songs  that were very rarely used
18:49 at meetings and assemblies  because of the subject.
18:53 They may have been relevant subjects  years back but not anymore.
18:57 So those songs,
18:58 the same melody is being used
19:01 but you’ll find  there’s a brand new theme.
19:03 In our songbook in recent years,
19:05 there has definitely been an effort
19:07 to have more diversity of style.
19:09 It really helps all of us
19:11 —no matter what our background
19:13 or from what part  of the world we come from—
19:14 to be unified in our worship.
19:16 When we get the music from the arranger,
19:19 we have to format it so it fits properly
19:23 to the page  as it will appear in the songbook.
19:26 We supply the branches
19:28 with music-only notation,
19:31 and this way  they can pour in the translated lyrics.
19:35 Songs really are
19:37 probably the most difficult  translation project that you can handle.
19:40 Take an English verse  like “listen, obey, and be blessed.”
19:44 It’s not difficult to express  that idea in another language,
19:47 but the music there
19:49 has only seven notes:  la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
19:53 So the challenge is to express those ideas
19:56 and make them  fit into those seven notes.
19:59 So for all of these reasons,  this is the work of a lyricist
20:02 —someone who can rewrite the song
20:05 and make sure that it conveys  the right ideas, the right mood,
20:09 but at the same time that it is poetic
20:11 and that it touches the heart  of those who are going to sing it.
20:24 What a wonderful thing to think
20:26 that worldwide in hundreds of languages  our brothers and sisters
20:30 are having the very same experience:
20:34 being able to use their words  to praise Jehovah in song.
20:38 The Governing Body  feels very strongly about singing.
20:42 So that’s why they actually created a cover
20:45 that looks  just like the New World Translation.
20:49 The songbook has been organized  into subject order.
20:52 There are more songs in the book;  there are 151 songs.
20:55 But also the songs  have been spread out a little bit more.
20:58 That’s mainly for translation.
21:00 The website will have easier navigation tools
21:04 to help us to find  the song number we’re looking for.
21:07 So we can listen to the song  or the vocal rendition
21:10 while the phrase that is to be sung
21:14 during that portion  of the song will highlight
21:16 as the song plays through.
21:18 We need to take the time right now  to learn these new songs
21:22 and then to sing them.
21:24 You know, sing them all the time
21:26 —sing them  when we’re working around the house,
21:28 sing them when we’re in the car,
21:30 sing them when we come together  for social gatherings with our brothers.
21:33 They have the power to strengthen us.
21:37 It’s showing respect for Jehovah
21:39 when we actually stand there  with the congregation
21:41 and sing with the congregation.
21:43 It brings the congregation  together in worship.
21:46 So when we combine how we feel  and when we sing from our hearts,
21:51 we can be sure that Jehovah  will accept that as appreciation.
21:55 Well, I think this scripture at Psalm 104:33
22:00 really reflects the feelings  of all of Jehovah’s people when it says:
22:04 “I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life;
22:08 I will sing praises to my God  as long as I live.”
22:13 That’s the desire that we all have
22:15 —to be able to sing  praises to Jehovah forever.
22:28 Obviously, our new songbook
22:31 is a gift from the Giver
22:34 of “every good gift  and every perfect present.”
22:37 You brothers and sisters are going  to love singing from the new songbook.
22:42 So by all means, use it to the full.
22:46 Use it completely
22:48 to “sing out joyfully” to Jehovah!
23:08 We told you it would be a special treat.
23:12 Not only was Brother Lett’s delivery special
23:15 but we have the special treat  of a new songbook now.
23:20 And we add it
23:22 to the long line of songbooks
23:26 that have come before.
23:28 Some of you can reach back many years  with various different songbooks.
23:33 The songbook is,
23:36 to describe it, praiseworthy.
23:41 You see that in your notes?
23:44 What does that mean?
23:46 Highly commendable —that’s our songbook.
23:51 Now, if that was special,  this next part is truly unique.
23:58 I do not remember ever hearing an interview
24:02 from this unique group of interviewees.
24:06 Brother Ralph Walls,  a helper to the Personnel Committee
24:09 of the Governing Body,
24:11 will take the lead  in the video interview entitled
24:15 Jehovah Cares for  and Strengthens Faithful Ones.
24:20 The video, please.
24:27 Jehovah’s care for each  of his faithful servants
24:31 is felt especially  during times of difficulty.
24:35 The apostle Paul experienced  what he called “a thorn in the flesh.”
24:40 I’d like to read to you what he said
24:43 about that in 2 Corinthians chapter 12.
24:46 I’ll read portions of verses 9 and 10.
24:50 Speaking of the Lord, he said:
24:52 “But he said to me:
24:54 “‘My undeserved kindness  is sufficient for you,
24:58 “‘for my power
25:00 is being made perfect in weakness.’”
25:04 Verse 10,
25:06 “So I take pleasure in weaknesses,
25:09 “ . . . and difficulties, for Christ.
25:11 For when I am weak, then I am powerful.”
25:17 While it’s the responsibility of each one
25:19 to give balanced attention to their health,
25:22 still, there are problems that arise.
25:26 Therefore, the Governing Body  has made arrangements
25:29 for all branches  to assist special full-time servants
25:33 with their health-care needs  and, that is,
25:35 within the circumstances  of each branch.
25:38 The United States branch is privileged
25:42 to have a group  of dedicated brothers and sisters
25:45 who render such care.
25:48 We’re going to talk to nine  of our physicians serving at Bethel,
25:52 and we’re going  to introduce them alphabetically.
25:56 First, we have Brother Samuel Worae Boakye,
25:59 who’s been serving us for 11 years at Bethel;
26:02 Brother Jack Carleton,  who’s been with us for 40 years
26:08 (it’s hard to believe  because Jack claims he’s 39);
26:12 Anne Marie Correia,  who’s been with us for three years;
26:17 Enrique Corvalan, for eight years;
26:20 Brother Walter Ferguson, for 30 years;
26:24 Luis Garza, 26 years;
26:27 Brother James Harper, for 26 years;
26:32 Brother James Howard, for 28 years;
26:35 and Olga Manson, for 15 years.
26:38 What a wonderful representative group!
26:41 I’d like to ask you dear folks
26:44 to share with us your experience  of learning the truth
26:47 and how that impacted your profession.
26:51 And, Brother Carleton,  would you please start off with it?
26:54 The truth was introduced  through the door-to-door ministry.
26:58 I was doing research  at the National Institutes of Health
27:00 in Washington, D.C.,  and the Cancer Institute
27:03 and planning  to go on into neurosurgery.
27:05 But the knock came on the door.
27:06 The brother came in,  and he presented the Kingdom hope
27:09 from Genesis to Revelation.
27:11 And my wife and I said:  “That’s marvelous
27:13 “—to live forever on earth  and have no sickness
27:16 “and enjoy peace and security forever!
27:18 What a wonderful hope!”
27:19 And then he added to that,  “You know that God has a name?”
27:22 And we didn’t know that.
27:23 So now to know Jehovah personally —it touched us.
27:26 And that’s all it took.
27:27 From that time on,  we wanted to be in full-time service
27:30 and aid Bethel,  if we could, in the future.
27:33 Very interesting.
27:34 Thank you.
27:35 And, Sister Correia, Anne Marie,
27:37 what about yourself?
27:39 Well, I started to study the Bible  in my last year of medical school
27:44 and then went on  to work part-time as a doctor
27:47 to be able to regular pioneer  with my husband
27:50 from 1997 till 2009.
27:54 In 2009,  I stopped practicing medicine
27:57 to expand my ministry
27:59 in the Hindi congregation in Montreal
28:01 until I was called to Bethel in 2013.
28:04 Wonderful!  And we’re glad you’re here too.
28:07 Walter,  share with us your experience, please?
28:10 I was contacted  in the door-to-door work
28:12 in Buffalo, New York.
28:14 I had a very good, effective Bible teacher
28:17 who was able to help
28:19 to revive in me a spiritual interest.
28:23 And I made it a formal study
28:25 my last years in medical school,
28:27 and I was baptized
28:29 not long after I graduated  from medical school.
28:32 Excellent!
28:33 Thank you.
28:34 Luis Garza from Monterrey, México,
28:40 tell us about your experience.
28:43 My first contact with the truth
28:45 was after I had been practicing  medicine for 16 years.
28:51 A patient of mine came  with a sore throat and two magazines,
28:56 and she was a Jehovah’s Witness.
28:58 At that time,
28:59 I was having some scary experiences
29:04 where the demons were involved,
29:07 although I was not looking for them.
29:09 And I was earnestly praying  to God for help.
29:14 I didn’t know his name,  but I knew he existed.
29:18 And at that time, the patient came
29:21 and one of the magazines  had on the front cover,
29:25 with big letters,  the word “spiritism.”
29:29 So first, I said,
29:31 “I don’t want anything with that;  I already have enough problems.”
29:34 But she said,  “This is to protect yourself,
29:37 not to practice it.”
29:39 So I took the magazines,  read them, and after that
29:44 a local elder  started studying the Bible with me.
29:48 And that’s how I came into the truth.
29:50 Beautiful!
29:51 And we’re so glad  to have you serving us at Bethel.
29:55 And, Brother Harper?
29:57 I requested a Bible study
30:00 immediately after finishing  high school at age 18.
30:04 And because  of the rigorous premedical program
30:09 that I was involved with,  it was difficult to continue my study.
30:13 I restarted a few years later,
30:16 and my formal graduation from medical school
30:19 was one week after my baptism.
30:22 When I came to Bethel,  I offered to come one week a month,
30:26 commuting from Atlanta, Georgia.
30:28 And so I did that for six months.
30:32 They asked me to come to Bethel full-time,
30:35 and I did that six months later  and have been at Bethel ever since.
30:40 That’s an interesting sideline
30:42 —you commuted  from Atlanta, Georgia,
30:45 for a year.
30:46 Beautiful!
30:48 And, Brother Howard,
30:49 help us with the situation  that you were faced with
30:52 when you were introduced to the truth.
30:54 When my wife and I learned the truth,  then, immediately that changed our attitude
30:59 towards what was important in life.
31:02 And I was able to cut down  to part-time work,
31:05 because it was just really a means  of supporting my family then,
31:09 and auxiliary pioneer on a regular basis
31:12 and then planning  to become a regular pioneer.
31:16 But then in 1983,
31:18 Bethel called us  and invited us to come in
31:22 for me to serve as a medical doctor  because there was a great need.
31:26 Within three months, we’d sold our house;
31:29 I’d left my practice;
31:30 and with our ten-year-old daughter,  we came to Brooklyn Bethel.
31:36 And today  that daughter is a Bethel sister
31:39 married to a responsible brother.
31:42 They’re serving here together.
31:43 So the family is together in their service.
31:46 We appreciate that.
31:48 Now we want to move into an area  that’s a little bit more sobering.
31:52 You deal with a family who are very sick,
31:56 sometimes terminally ill.
31:58 Sam Worae,  how are you affected personally
32:01 when you are exposed to that?
32:04 Well, serving as a Bethel physician
32:07 definitely is a unique privilege
32:10 but also a challenging one.
32:12 Because unlike physicians on the outside
32:15 who are detached from their patients,
32:17 we have an attachment
32:19 with our patients,  who are also our family members.
32:24 And to even make it more difficult
32:27 is when you have to endure  with them through terminal illnesses
32:31 or even be the one  to give them the diagnosis
32:34 —a bad diagnosis, a grave one.
32:36 And then,
32:38 when you’ve gone through  all the difficult situations with them,
32:42 to be the one  to pronounce them as clinically dead.
32:46 You know,  even though we know
32:48 that we’re going to see them  back in the new world,
32:50 it can really wrench your heart out.
32:56 For me, coming to Bethel
32:58 was a complete new experience  in medical care.
33:01 You’re treating, essentially,  your brothers and sisters,
33:05 and they become your family.
33:07 So your emotional involvement  and commitment
33:11 —it’s much deeper.
33:14 I recall the words of my father,
33:16 he said: “A physician  tends to treat his patients
33:20 “with his brain, or his head.
33:22 But he treats his family with heart.”
33:27 And here there’s this duality
33:30 that we have patients  but our patients are our family
33:33 —brothers and sisters—
33:35 so how to deal with that?
33:38 It’s very difficult.
33:39 So one of the things that really helps me
33:42 to be able to work with the situation
33:45 is what Paul said  at Colossians 4:14 about Luke,
33:50 and he was “the beloved physician.”
33:52 So there are two words in there, “physician”;
33:55 medical care, it was given (the medical care)
33:58 but in a loving way.
34:01 So that can be done,
34:03 and that really inspires me  to be able to provide to my patients
34:06 the best medical care with tender affection.
34:12 As physicians,  we don’t want to see people suffering.
34:17 And whenever we’re dealing
34:20 with our dear brothers and sisters,  it’s different;
34:24 it’s our family.
34:26 And treating our family
34:29 is more difficult.
34:31 Talking to patients  about what they are facing
34:34 —pain; suffering;
34:36 and even terminal,  incurable diseases—
34:40 this makes my occupation stressful  and emotionally charged,
34:46 especially when I have to break bad news.
34:50 But at those times,  besieging Jehovah in prayer,
34:55 asking for strength and wisdom,
34:59 also having the support  of my overseers at the infirmary.
35:04 They accompany me sometimes
35:07 to talk about critical issues  with the patients,
35:11 and they pray  even for me and for them.
35:14 So, even though it’s stressful,
35:18 I never feel overwhelmed.
35:21 Very interesting.
35:23 Now, going in another direction,  on the other side of this,
35:28 how do you stay positive
35:31 despite the negative circumstances  that we’ve just talked about?
35:35 Walter, how do you do that?
35:38 Yes, Ralph, heart disease,  breast cancer, and prostate cancer
35:42 are still the leading causes  of death in the Bethel family.
35:47 In such cases,  we stay positive by sharing
35:51 our absolute confidence  in the nearness of Jehovah’s promises.
35:56 And that tends to be  a two-way interchange.
36:00 We attempt to encourage others,
36:02 but we are also encouraged
36:04 by many of these very mature people  that we’re working with.
36:07 And they see things very clearly.
36:10 And we also rejoice  because we’re able to participate
36:15 in some of the positive outcomes  for the greater majority
36:18 of the individuals that suffer illness.
36:21 For example, the majority of our patients
36:23 with breast cancer are cured
36:25 —more than 90 percent.
36:27 And in prostate cancer  the majority are cured,
36:30 but there is also a large portion
36:33 that live a long time with their disease
36:35 —a productive life with their disease.
36:37 So that helps us —the positive outcomes.
36:41 But also with heart disease,  we are now having much better outcomes.
36:45 People are living more productive lives  and actually living longer.
36:49 Additionally, the Bethel environment  is a very positive place
36:53 to develop spiritual qualities,  such as it is.
36:56 And we get help from the Bethel table;
36:59 they deal with faith based on facts.
37:03 And it helps persons
37:05 with scientific orientation;
37:08 it helps us to know  that our faith is very sound.
37:12 I think of three factors.
37:13 The one is having a loving spouse.
37:15 Nyla is always —and the family—
37:17 always supportive of me  being available 24 hours a day,
37:21 seven days a week to the Bethel family.
37:23 And then the love that we have as a team
37:25 —our nurses and all those  who work in the infirmary.
37:28 We have such a bond of love  between us and the patient.
37:31 It sustains us,
37:33 and that’s a beautiful thing to see.
37:36 And then Jehovah’s spirit
37:37 —the joy we get from that spirit,  the joy we pass on to our patients,
37:41 the trust we have in Jehovah,  the security we have.
37:44 And that powerful force —the greatest thing in the universe—
37:46 helps me through  as it does the patients.
37:50 And I think he speaks for all of you  when he says he really appreciates
37:53 the support the nurses, the PCAs,  and all of the staff give you.
37:58 I’ve heard you comment on that many times.
38:00 Thank you, Brother Jack.
38:01 Let’s go to Brother Harper,
38:04 how would you respond to this
38:06 —keeping positive in spite  of the things you have to deal with?
38:09 I focus on the positive
38:12 —the things that we can do for the patient
38:15 to make them have a better quality of life.
38:19 And that gives us some personal satisfaction.
38:22 The other thing  is that we concentrate on the positive
38:26 by means of what the Scriptures tell us
38:29 about the fact that all  of these things are only temporary.
38:32 I look at Jesus.
38:35 Even though he was about to raise Lazarus
38:40 and he knew what he was going to do,
38:42 he still broke out crying.
38:45 Why did he do that?
38:47 Because he felt the pain
38:49 that they were enduring,  and we feel it too.
38:51 So it’s OK to cry.
38:53 But we know that the end result
38:56 will be for the benefit of everybody.
39:00 Hope.
39:01 I think just the fact that I remember
39:04 that this situation is temporary
39:07 —the illness of the friend.
39:09 And one verse that I really, really like
39:11 is Revelation 21:4, where, at the end,
39:16 it says that all things have passed away.
39:19 So we won’t remember any of those things.
39:22 Although it’s hard right now,
39:24 it’s not something  we will live with in the future.
39:28 The thing that really helps me a great deal
39:30 is to see the faith  and the love for Jehovah in patients
39:35 who have a serious,  very painful terminal illness.
39:41 I see that they love Jehovah,  and that’s crystal clear like a diamond
39:45 —that love and faith in Jehovah.
39:49 And it really strengthens my faith,  no matter how much they’re suffering.
39:54 And they know  that they’re going to be resurrected.
39:57 There’s no doubt whatsoever in their minds
39:59 that in the words of Hosea 13:14:
40:04 “Where are your stings, O Death?”
40:06 There was one sister, a long-time missionary
40:10 who was dying of a very painful cancer
40:15 —rapidly progressive cancer—
40:17 and she’d been healthy  all her life until then,
40:20 and she had a complete faith  in the resurrection.
40:23 And one of her last expressions was:
40:28 “I never died before.  I didn’t know it’d be so hard.”
40:32 But she knew what was coming after that.
40:34 That’s a touching experience.
40:37 Last question:
40:39 Can you share your comments  about looking forward to the time
40:43 when you’ll no longer have your jobs?
40:47 In the new world, we won’t need this work.
40:49 What do you think about that, Worae?
40:53 Well, I particularly look forward, Ralph,
40:55 to a time that I wouldn’t have to be woken up in the night,
40:59 you know,  to care for dear ones who are in pain.
41:04 I can have the time to enjoy
41:07 time with my dear wife in the new world
41:10 and pursue skills such as drawing, painting,
41:12 designing beautiful buildings.
41:15 And, you know, enjoying the art and music
41:17 into eternity with my wife.
41:19 And I look forward very much to that.
41:22 So I can easily let this go.
41:24 For several years
41:26 Worae has been asking  to work in the Art Department,
41:30 so you’ll have your day.
41:32 It’s a promise.
41:36 Brother Carleton, please,  new world, no more physician?
41:41 That will be a wonderful day!
41:43 The only thing I look forward to is those  who we haven’t been able to help,
41:46 then I can welcome them back.
41:48 I’ll be young, and they’ll be young.
41:50 And that’ll be a beautiful time.
41:52 But the peace and security  that the world will hold
41:54 —the creation, the sounds of birds,
41:57 nothing man-made interfering with noises.
42:00 But seeing the animals play  and learning about the plants
42:03 and having my own garden  with the family together doing these things.
42:09 Sister Anne Marie?
42:11 We are often asked  to imagine ourselves in the new system.
42:15 And for me, it’s never been  like a specific house or a place,
42:20 but it’s always been to know  that everybody wakes up in the morning,
42:24 they’re happy, they don’t have any pain,
42:27 they’re ready for a full day of activity.
42:30 For me, that’s the new system,  and I’m ready to go there.
42:35 Thank you,
42:36 and Enrique Corvalan, please?
42:40 Here on this side of life,
42:44 we can say we treat
42:48 and take care of our friends.
42:50 It could be an illness, severe or minor.
42:54 But the end is all death.
42:58 So in the new system,  what I’m looking for
43:02 is that there’s not going to be  any illness or diseases.
43:05 And on top of that,
43:07 we will be able to see  the ones who we have left,
43:10 because they’ve gone into death,  come back
43:13 —not leaving but coming back,  coming back to life.
43:17 So I’m looking forward  to being able to be,
43:20 eventually,  one of the reception committee.
43:22 Yeah, waking and receiving  those brothers and sisters
43:27 and family members,  dear family members,
43:29 who we have lost in death.
43:31 Beautiful, beautiful thought.
43:34 Walter, no more doctoring,
43:37 new world, what do you say?
43:40 I don’t think I’ll have  any problem with that at all.
43:42 In fact, we have  so many beautiful brothers and sisters
43:47 that Jehovah has created  with minds that we’ll now be able
43:50 to employ them in more useful activities.
43:53 But I think for me the most important thing,
43:56 I think, would be that in the new system
44:00 I’ll be able to learn  and associate more with Jehovah
44:05 without the distractions we have today.
44:08 And I think that’s going  to be a marvelous hope
44:10 to open up for everyone,  and I certainly look forward to that.
44:14 Profound thought.  Thank you.
44:16 And, dear Brother Luis Garza?
44:20 I will be extremely happy to give up
44:23 the practice of medicine in the new world.
44:25 With all these promises
44:27 that Jehovah has made for us,
44:31 we will not need the practice of medicine.
44:35 Thank you.
44:36 And, James Harper?
44:38 I look so forward  to the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.
44:43 I just can’t wait.
44:44 And, actually,  I look forward to giving up this assignment.
44:47 But many people in the past have said,  “Well, you won’t have a job.”
44:52 I’m not concerned  because Jehovah won’t let me go unemployed.
44:56 He’ll give me a very interesting  and challenging assignment, I’m sure.
45:00 Very good, thank you.
45:03 And, Brother Howard?
45:04 Peace, nature, animals, music,
45:09 happy people all loving Jehovah  and loved by him
45:14 working together to serve him.
45:16 I just want to be there.
45:19 And, Sister Olga Manson?
45:23 When Jesus was on earth,
45:26 he did powerful works of curing the sick
45:30 and resurrecting the dead.
45:33 And to me, that is an evidence
45:36 that Jehovah and Jesus
45:38 are very interested in our health
45:41 and also that they are  better doctors than I could ever be.
45:46 So I can’t wait to be out of a job.
45:51 And I think every one of us  agrees with every one of you.
45:55 We yearn for the day  when you will not be doctors.
45:58 Yeah.
46:00 But in the meantime,  we want to thank you,
46:03 not just for your expressions today
46:05 but for your dedicated view  of your sacred service
46:09 at Bethel as physicians.
46:12 In fact, we’re grateful  for the entire medical staff.
46:16 And I know when we talked about this before,
46:18 you dear folks in your comments
46:20 applauded those who  support you in your work.
46:24 We appreciate that you’re willing  to use your training,
46:27 not for selfish pursuits  but for Kingdom interests.
46:31 But even more than that,  we appreciate
46:34 what we’ve seen here among you,
46:36 and that’s your deep spirituality.
46:39 It’s so evident, and we thank you for that.
46:44 So you’ve given not only your skills  but as Paul mentions
46:48 at 1 Thessalonians 2:8,
46:50 you remember there,  he says we’ve given ‘our very souls.’
46:54 And that’s what you dear folks have done.
46:57 Most of all, who do you think we thank?
47:00 Jehovah.
47:02 Why?
47:03 Because he cares for faithful ones
47:06 and he strengthens such ones,  including yourselves.
47:10 I’d like to read what Paul said  in one of his letters to a congregation.
47:15 I’d like for you dear folks to hear it
47:17 in the context of all of us  saying this about you:
47:22 “We always thank God  when we mention all of you . . . ,
47:26 “for we continually remember  your faithful work,
47:30 your loving labor,  and your endurance.”
47:33 And all of us yearn for the time
47:36 when “no resident” in the entire earth
47:39 “will say: ‘I am sick.’”
47:41 Thank you very much.
47:54 That was indeed a unique interview.
47:58 And we appreciate their love for Jehovah
48:01 and their love for their fellow servants
48:04 and the loving way  in which they use their talents.
48:08 It’s also unique in that they
48:11 will all lose their jobs in the near future.
48:15 They seem to be happy for that though.
48:19 I would just like to mention  that this interview
48:23 was featuring  the United States branch medical provisions.
48:28 While it’s true  that all branches around the world
48:31 have arrangements in place to care
48:33 for their Bethel families’ medical needs,
48:37 the doctors interviewed just now
48:39 take care of over 4,500 members
48:43 of the Bethel family  here in the United States,
48:46 including long-term members of the family
48:51 and temporary volunteers.
48:54 The cost to provide  outside doctor’s care for that many people
48:58 would be very, very expensive,
49:01 especially since medical costs  in the United States are so high.
49:07 However, these doctors just interviewed
49:09 receive the same small monthly allowance
49:13 as all other Bethel family members.
49:17 This has saved hundreds  of thousands of dollars
49:20 of contributed funds each year.
49:23 So we would like to thank  the doctors for their fine spirit
49:28 and all of those working with the infirmaries
49:31 for their skill and efficiency.
49:33 But above all, we thank them  for their warm brotherly affection
49:38 when we are often feeling our worst.
49:43 You’re good medical caregivers,
49:48 and we want you to know  that you do good work.
49:53 You’re definitely needed
49:56 —for now.
50:02 Oh, by the way,
50:05 if any of these doctors or any other doctor
50:10 should ask you  to please stick out your tongue,
50:15 don’t try to swallow it.
50:17 Stick it out!
50:19 They’re just trying to help us,
50:21 even though you’re not in Tibet.
50:27 Well, it’s time for you to stand
50:32 —that is, if you’re able—
50:34 and “sing out joyfully” to Jehovah.
50:38 Since none of you have the new songbook
50:41 with this new numbering system,
50:43 we’re going to use the song numbers
50:45 from the songbook  you currently have access to.
50:49 It is one of our new songs.
50:51 The number we have been using  is song number 152,
50:56 “Our Strength, Our Hope, Our Confidence.”
54:15 We now will enjoy a number of talks
54:17 from members of the Governing Body.
54:19 Brother David Splane is ready  to present his talk,
54:23 “Trust in Jehovah and Do What Is Good.”
54:26 Brother Splane, our ears are ready
54:28 to hear what your tongue has to say.
54:34 We’ll see.
54:40 Jehovah created all of us
54:44 with some remarkable abilities.
54:48 He gave us the ability to solve problems
54:52 and plan for the future,
54:54 and he also gave us  the ability to carry out our plans.
54:59 Now, how does he want  us to use our abilities?
55:03 To benefit others.
55:06 Why?
55:08 Because he knows that when we  are serving others, we’re happy.
55:12 God loves us,
55:14 and he wants us to be happy.
55:17 Now, at the same time,
55:19 Jehovah realizes  that we all have limitations.
55:24 He realizes it,  but sometimes we don’t.
55:28 And so all of us have to learn  to set reasonable goals for ourselves
55:33 and then to rejoice, to be happy,  when we have achieved these goals.
55:38 Now, some really have to learn that.
55:41 They’re never satisfied;  they never have enough money;
55:45 they never have enough service privileges;
55:48 they always want more, more, more.
55:51 And what’s the result?
55:52 They’re never happy.
55:54 We have to be able to rejoice
55:57 over what we can do
56:00 and not fret over what we cannot do.
56:04 Now, if our goals  are in line with Jehovah’s purpose,
56:08 we can be sure that he will back us up.
56:11 In fact, the writer of the 37th Psalm  was convinced of this.
56:15 Here’s a man who had  personal experience with Jehovah,
56:18 and he knew how Jehovah would back him up
56:21 if he put his trust in Him.
56:23 Let’s read Psalm 37:3.
56:28 And here we see that the writer
56:32 is speaking to us from personal experience.
56:36 He says:
56:38 “Trust in Jehovah
56:41 and do what is good.”
56:45 Well, that’s the theme of this talk,  isn’t it?
56:47 “Reside in the earth,  and act with faithfulness.”
56:54 The 37th Psalm  was written by David of Bethlehem
56:58 and apparently near the end of his life,
57:01 because he wrote:
57:03 “I was once young and now I am old.”
57:10 Now, David was only 70 when he died,
57:14 so I think some of us  would object to that characterization.
57:18 I can just about hear Brother Herd say,  “Who are you calling old?
57:24 We can still hear  crickets chirping and birds singing.”
57:28 But let’s say that David  was speaking from his own experience
57:33 and that he’s sharing his experience  as a mature man with us;
57:38 he wants us to benefit from the things
57:40 that happened to him in his lifetime.
57:44 And what a life David led!
57:46 So for the next few minutes,  we’re going to review
57:49 a few highlights of David’s life
57:51 and we’re going to see how David’s life
57:55 was really directed by his trust in Jehovah.
57:59 Jehovah God was guiding him  every step of the way,
58:02 and it’s a real benefit for us.
58:05 Now, do you realize  that when David was born,
58:09 Saul had been reigning over Israel
58:13 for ten years already?
58:16 But Jehovah wasn’t pleased with Saul.
58:18 In fact, much earlier,
58:20 He had sent the prophet Samuel  to tell the king:
58:23 “Jehovah will find  a man agreeable to his heart,
58:28 “and Jehovah will commission him  as a leader over his people,
58:33 because you did not obey  what Jehovah commanded you.”
58:38 Now, that was Jehovah’s promise to Saul,
58:42 but He didn’t carry it out right away;
58:45 He didn’t provide  for Saul’s replacement right away.
58:48 In fact,  it was probably more than a quarter century
58:52 before David was anointed  as the future king of Israel.
58:57 And maybe Saul thought that Jehovah  had forgotten all about replacing him,
59:02 but Jehovah hadn’t,  and David was anointed.
59:06 Now,  it was some time after that
59:10 that a Philistine from Gath,  the giant Goliath,
59:14 challenged the battle lines  of the living God:
59:17 ‘Choose for yourselves a man  that he might fight with me.’
59:22 Young David was visiting the camp,  and he overheard this.
59:26 And he couldn’t understand  why none of the Israelite soldiers
59:29 were willing to take up the challenge,
59:31 and so he expressed his concern.
59:34 And his oldest brother, Eliab,
59:37 heard what David was saying,
59:39 and he rebuked his younger brother.
59:42 Well, older brothers  have a tendency of doing that, don’t they?
59:45 We read about the conversation  in 1 Samuel chapter 17,
59:53 and we’re going to make a point with this.
59:59 1 Samuel 17:28, 29:
1:00:13 “When his oldest brother Eliab  heard him speak to the men,
1:00:17 “he became angry with David and said:
1:00:20 “‘Why have you come down?
1:00:22 “‘And with whom did you leave  those few sheep in the wilderness?
1:00:25 “‘I well know your presumptuousness  and the bad intentions of your heart;
1:00:30 “you came down just to see the battle.’
1:00:34 “To this David said:  ‘What have I done now?
1:00:38 I was only asking a question!’”
1:00:41 Isn’t the wording of that realistic?
1:00:44 Isn’t that what you would hear  in your own family?
1:00:49 Now, what was the problem with Eliab?
1:00:53 He was viewing David according to the flesh.
1:00:57 To Eliab,  David was still his pesky little brother,
1:01:02 but he should have known better.
1:01:04 Why?
1:01:06 Because Eliab had been present earlier
1:01:09 when Samuel had anointed David  as the future king of Israel.
1:01:13 Now,  the current king of Israel wasn’t willing
1:01:16 to take up the challenge  that Goliath threw out.
1:01:19 So wasn’t it only reasonable  that the next in line to the throne
1:01:22 should take up the challenge?
1:01:24 There was nothing presumptuous  about what David was doing.
1:01:28 Now picture this:  Here you have, on the one hand
1:01:32 —David— a shepherd,
1:01:35 probably in his teens and,
1:01:37 on the other
1:01:40 —Saul— a seasoned warrior,
1:01:42 probably in his late 60’s.
1:01:45 And we have to ask,
1:01:47 What did David have that Saul was lacking?
1:01:52 Trust —trust in Jehovah.
1:01:56 David was going to work  with Jehovah on this assignment,
1:02:00 but David realized  that trust alone was not enough.
1:02:04 You could trust that Jehovah would raise up  someone else to fight Goliath,
1:02:07 but that wouldn’t do any good.
1:02:09 David wanted to trust in Jehovah,
1:02:11 but he also wanted to do something about it
1:02:14 —to do something good.
1:02:17 But didn’t David run the risk  of being killed by Goliath?
1:02:21 Not a chance.
1:02:23 Why?
1:02:25 Because Jehovah had had David anointed
1:02:30 to rule over Israel
1:02:32 and David hadn’t become king yet.
1:02:35 Do you think  that an uncircumcised Philistine like Goliath
1:02:38 could stand in the way  of Jehovah fulfilling His purpose?
1:02:43 Never!
1:02:44 Never would that happen.
1:02:46 Neither Goliath nor Saul nor anyone else
1:02:50 was going to prevent David  from becoming the king.
1:02:54 He would live,  as long as he was faithful to Jehovah.
1:02:59 David had complete trust in Jehovah,
1:03:03 and his trust was rewarded.
1:03:06 So he was again  drawing on personal experience.
1:03:09 If we turn back to Psalm 37,
1:03:11 we’ll be reading quite a bit  from Psalm 37 now,
1:03:15 so you can keep your Bibles open there.
1:03:17 He’s again drawing on personal experience
1:03:20 when he writes what we read in verse 5.
1:03:23 So that’s Psalm 37:5:
1:03:28 “Commit your way to Jehovah;
1:03:30 “rely on him,
1:03:33 and he will act in your behalf.”
1:03:37 Now, the Philistines were  sworn enemies of Israel,
1:03:42 but David had enemies closer to home.
1:03:45 And he could have become embittered
1:03:48 to realize that intimate associates of his
1:03:51 and even family members had betrayed him.
1:03:54 But, on the whole,  David was a spiritual man.
1:03:57 And we might ask,
1:03:59 How does a spiritual man handle betrayal?
1:04:02 Notice verse 8.
1:04:05 He says:
1:04:07 “Let go of anger and abandon rage;
1:04:12 do not become upset and turn to doing evil.”
1:04:18 Now, why could David adopt this attitude
1:04:21 when he was being betrayed?
1:04:24 He had a warm personal relationship  with Jehovah God;
1:04:28 he knew his God.
1:04:30 He knew that Jehovah hears everything;
1:04:33 He sees everything.
1:04:35 He knew that God cares.
1:04:37 And notice Psalm 37:18.
1:04:42 David writes:
1:04:44 “Jehovah is aware  of what the blameless go through.”
1:04:48 Isn’t that reassuring?
1:04:50 “And their inheritance will last forever.”
1:04:54 Now, David was a strong man,
1:04:57 a valiant warrior.
1:04:59 We recall when David would return from battle
1:05:02 that the women would sing:
1:05:04 ‘Saul has killed his thousands,
1:05:06 David his tens of thousands.’
1:05:10 But David did not rely  on his military prowess
1:05:15 in dealing with his enemies
1:05:17 —he turned to Jehovah.
1:05:19 And we find evidence of that  in verses 12 and 13 of the 37th Psalm.
1:05:25 David writes:
1:05:27 “The wicked man plots against the righteous;
1:05:31 “he grinds his teeth at him.
1:05:33 “But Jehovah will laugh at him,
1:05:37 for He knows that his day will come.”
1:05:41 So there’s always this sense with David  that whatever is happening,
1:05:45 Jehovah sees it;  Jehovah is observing it,
1:05:48 and Jehovah is going to step in in due time
1:05:52 —very encouraging.
1:05:54 And so often in the Psalms—
1:05:55 We’ve been reading in the Psalms now  in our Bible reading,
1:05:57 and haven’t you noticed  so often in the Psalms
1:06:00 that this strong man,
1:06:02 this rugged man —David—
1:06:05 beseeches Jehovah to give him
1:06:08 a way of escape from his enemies?
1:06:13 Now, a lot of people in this country
1:06:16 would think that that was a coward’s act.
1:06:19 In this country,  there are so many people who say:
1:06:22 “Don’t give in. Don’t back down.
1:06:25 “Stand your ground.  Buy a weapon.
1:06:27 Keep it by your bedside.”
1:06:30 Not David
1:06:32 —David took comfort
1:06:34 in what we read  in verse 28 of Psalm 37:
1:06:38 “Jehovah loves justice.”
1:06:41 So he placed his case before Jehovah God.
1:06:46 David had to struggle with his conscience  on more than one occasion.
1:06:51 Do you remember what happened  when David was running away from Saul
1:06:56 and he came to Ahimelech the priest?
1:06:59 Now, Ahimelech didn’t know  that David was a fugitive,
1:07:02 and David wasn’t interested  in letting him know that.
1:07:06 Instead, he told the priest:
1:07:08 “The king instructed me to do something,  but he said,
1:07:12 “‘Do not let anyone know anything  about the mission
1:07:15 on which I am sending you.’”
1:07:17 Well, that wasn’t true.
1:07:20 Then David asked for bread for his men,
1:07:24 and the priest was happy  to give him bread and provisions.
1:07:28 Saul found out about it,  and he was furious.
1:07:32 He directed that Ahimelech  and his household
1:07:36 be put to death
1:07:38 and, in all, 85 priests were slaughtered.
1:07:45 Ahimelech was deceived.
1:07:47 He thought he was helping  an emissary of King Saul.
1:07:51 Do you think he  would have been so willing to help
1:07:53 if he had known the true situation?
1:07:56 Maybe not.
1:07:58 When those 85 priests are resurrected,
1:08:01 I think David is going to have  a little explaining to do.
1:08:06 Well, was David’s conscience stricken?
1:08:09 You better believe it.
1:08:12 He told Ahimelech’s only surviving son:
1:08:15 “I am personally responsible
1:08:18 for the death of everyone  in your father’s house.”
1:08:22 How do you live with that?
1:08:24 How do you live with being responsible  for the death of so many people?
1:08:31 What could David do?
1:08:34 What was done was done.
1:08:37 He couldn’t change the past.
1:08:39 Would he become paralyzed with guilt
1:08:43 or overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness
1:08:47 and become inactive in Jehovah’s service?
1:08:50 Not David.
1:08:52 What he could do was protect  the last remaining member
1:08:56 of the house of Ahimelech,
1:08:58 and that’s exactly what he did.
1:09:01 As we know,  there were other conscience matters.
1:09:06 David committed adultery with Bath-sheba
1:09:08 and had her husband, Uriah, killed.
1:09:11 So he sinned against Jehovah,  he sinned against Uriah,
1:09:16 and he sinned against his other wives.
1:09:20 Imagine poor Abigail.
1:09:23 She’d been rescued from one bad marriage,
1:09:25 and now her new husband  had betrayed her.
1:09:29 When his sins came to light,  how did David react?
1:09:33 Well, here’s what he could not do:
1:09:36 He could not resurrect Uriah.
1:09:39 But he could sincerely repent  of his sins, and he did.
1:09:44 And, in turn,  the prophet Nathan told him:
1:09:47 “Jehovah . . . forgives your sin.”
1:09:51 What else could David do?
1:09:53 He could have faith
1:09:55 —faith that Jehovah really meant it
1:09:57 when He said that He forgave His servant.
1:10:01 Well, what about us?
1:10:04 In some cases, we may not be able
1:10:06 to undo our mistakes in our current lifetime.
1:10:09 We may have to live with the consequences.
1:10:12 But here’s what we can do:
1:10:14 We can take Jehovah at his word,
1:10:16 trusting that he will support  us through difficult times
1:10:21 —even if the difficult times  are of our own making.
1:10:27 David allowed Jehovah
1:10:30 to help him recover spiritually.
1:10:34 I’m going to repeat that.
1:10:36 David allowed Jehovah
1:10:39 to help him recover spiritually.
1:10:43 How did he do that?
1:10:45 Well, one way  was by humbly accepting the counsel
1:10:49 of an experienced elder,  the prophet Nathan.
1:10:52 His repentance was sincere.
1:10:55 There was no—  There was no facade about it.
1:10:57 We know that.
1:10:59 We know that David  repented with a good attitude
1:11:02 because later David and Bath-sheba
1:11:05 even named one of their sons Nathan,
1:11:09 and you don’t do that if you resent someone.
1:11:13 He took the counsel with a good attitude.
1:11:16 David learned from his mistakes,
1:11:19 and he kept on doing what was good.
1:11:23 Now, he may have been thinking  of himself when he wrote
1:11:25 what we read at Psalm 37:23, 24:
1:11:34 “Jehovah guides the steps of a man  when He finds pleasure in his way.
1:11:38 “Although he may fall,  he will not be hurled down,
1:11:43 for Jehovah supports him by the hand.”
1:11:47 And David felt that support  on many occasions.
1:11:52 Well, how can we learn  from David’s example?
1:11:55 If we sin, we have to let  Jehovah help us recover.
1:12:00 And more often than not,  he’ll use the elders for that purpose.
1:12:05 What about you faithful parents  whose child has gone astray?
1:12:10 David would understand your sorrow
1:12:14 —the sleepless nights, the tears,
1:12:17 the heartache, the worry.
1:12:21 One of his own sons, Amnon,  raped his daughter Tamar.
1:12:26 Another of his sons, Absalom,
1:12:28 killed Amnon and then fled the country for three years.
1:12:32 Finally, the Bible says:
1:12:34 “David longed to go to Absalom,
1:12:37 for he had become reconciled  to the death of Amnon.”
1:12:42 So he called him back.
1:12:44 You might say, in effect,
1:12:46 that Absalom got  a three-year time-out for murder.
1:12:51 Did he appreciate the mercy?
1:12:54 No, he did not.
1:12:56 He tried to take the throne from David,
1:12:59 conspired against his own father.
1:13:02 And you wonder,  ‘What was he thinking?’
1:13:05 Because at the time  he was plotting against David,
1:13:08 he must have known  that Jehovah had declared
1:13:11 that it was Solomon who was going  to succeed his father and not Absalom.
1:13:15 He must have known that.
1:13:16 Did he really think that he  could frustrate Jehovah’s purpose?
1:13:21 Wicked Absalom was finally put to death,
1:13:25 and David was devastated.
1:13:28 The poor young man
1:13:32 —seems he had a weak spot  for his wicked sons.
1:13:38 You know,  when we think of permissive parents,
1:13:40 we often think of High Priest Eli  and his sons, Hophni and Phinehas.
1:13:45 But when you think about it,  David was a bit permissive himself.
1:13:50 And you wonder if Solomon  wasn’t thinking of his own half brothers
1:13:54 when he encouraged parents to use the rod.
1:14:00 Now, David couldn’t force his wicked sons
1:14:04 to respect Jehovah’s standards,
1:14:08 but there was something he could do.
1:14:10 He had a faithful son at home, Solomon.
1:14:14 And so David and Bath-sheba  could lavish Solomon
1:14:18 with the love and affection that he deserved
1:14:21 and also help him to grow spiritually.
1:14:23 And they obviously did,  because at Proverbs 4:3 we read—
1:14:27 These are Solomon’s words:
1:14:29 “I was a true son to my father
1:14:33 and the one especially loved by my mother.”
1:14:37 And then he added:
1:14:38 “He taught me.”
1:14:40 So David obviously was teaching  his son to grow spiritually.
1:14:46 Now, it doesn’t always happen that way.
1:14:49 Consider this true-to-life scenario:
1:14:53 A brother and sister have two sons.
1:14:56 One leaves the truth  and the other remains faithful.
1:15:01 The parents are heartbroken, and like David,
1:15:04 they go into mourning for their son.
1:15:08 And that’s completely understandable,
1:15:12 but we have to ask:
1:15:14 What about the son at home  who has remained faithful?
1:15:18 What about the son who has never given  his parents a moment’s grief?
1:15:22 Will he continue to get  the love and affection
1:15:26 that he so richly deserves,
1:15:28 or will it be all about his brother?
1:15:33 Many of our modern-day fellow believers
1:15:36 have demonstrated their trust in Jehovah.
1:15:39 One brother who remained faithful  till his death in 2015,
1:15:43 said this:
1:15:45 “Life is unpredictable at times,
1:15:47 “uncertain, and even hard to deal with.
1:15:51 But Jehovah blesses those who lean on him.”
1:15:55 And his advice:
1:15:57 “Pray to be as productive
1:15:59 “and as active in Jehovah’s service
1:16:02 as you can be.”
1:16:04 And notice this:
1:16:06 “Focus on what you can do,
1:16:08 not on what you cannot do.”
1:16:12 That excellent advice  is being followed by traveling overseers
1:16:16 who are transitioning  into other forms of service.
1:16:20 It’s also being applied  by longtime members of the Bethel family
1:16:24 who are no longer serving  as department overseers.
1:16:28 They are grateful to Jehovah  for what they can do,
1:16:32 and they focus on that.
1:16:35 As this system of things  degenerates from bad to worse,
1:16:40 we can expect difficult times.
1:16:43 When that coalition of nations,  known as Gog of Magog,
1:16:47 launches its final attack on God’s people,
1:16:50 it will seem that there is no way out.
1:16:53 Our most formidable weapon  at that time will be our faith.
1:16:58 And so, brothers, it’s fitting
1:17:01 that our yeartext for 2017 should be
1:17:08 Psalm 37:3:
1:17:12 “Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.”
1:17:35 Thank you very much, Brother Splane.
1:17:37 We’ll remember that talk  at least until the end of next year.
1:17:43 Your talk was well-spoken, as usual.

00:05 The Big Red Island is renowned
00:08 as a place of incredible beauty  and diversity.
00:12 About 75 percent  of the plant and animal species
00:15 found in Madagascar  live nowhere else on the planet.
00:30 Another form of diversity on the island  has to do with the directive
00:35 given by Jesus at Luke 12:42
00:39 that he would appoint  a ‘faithful and discreet steward
00:42 ‘over his body of attendants
00:44 ‘to keep giving them  their measure of food supplies
00:46 at the proper time.’
00:48 Doing so for the diverse needs  of this large island was the main reason
00:53 for the original branch buildings
00:55 that were constructed,  which were dedicated
00:57 December 7, 1996.
01:00 However,  because of remarkable growth,
01:04 it was not long  before it became too small
01:07 and construction  was started once more.
01:10 Isaiah 54:2
01:12 foretold that this would happen
01:14 during the time we are living in.
01:17 And so it became necessary  to “make the place
01:19 “of your tent more spacious. . . .
01:21 And make  your tent pins strong.”
01:23 These newly expanded  branch facilities
01:26 were dedicated  by Brother Mark Sanderson
01:28 of the Governing Body  on Saturday,
01:31 January 24, 2015.
01:36 Brothers and sisters, it is a great privilege  for me to be here today
01:39 for the dedication  of these expanded facilities in Madagascar.
01:45 The diversity  among Jehovah’s unified people
01:49 was well represented  by the hundreds
01:51 of brothers and sisters  at this special event.
01:57 Included were guests  from 15 different countries,
02:01 along with longtime Witnesses,
02:05 Bethelites, circuit overseers,
02:08 special pioneers, and missionaries.
02:11 Even some of the first missionaries  were among the visitors.
02:15 In his dedication talk,  Brother Sanderson
02:19 highlighted  our ongoing spiritual building work
02:23 with those to whom we preach  and with ourselves.
02:28 We have to help  our students and our children
02:30 to build their own relationship  with Jehovah.
02:35 Is it your desire that we  should dedicate these buildings
02:39 to the worship and service  of our God, Jehovah?
02:45 The expansion  gives more office space
02:48 for the Malagasy translation team  for added projects.
02:51 This is a key to serving the food  in the right language.
02:55 So that spiritual food  can be served in the right locations,
02:59 the new offices  for the Local Design/Construction Department
03:03 help them to care  for the construction
03:06 of Assembly and Kingdom Halls  throughout the country.
03:09 These buildings serve  as spiritual banquet halls
03:13 for the more than 660 congregations.
03:16 But what about food  in the right format?
03:21 One of these formats is Braille  for the visually impaired.
03:25 In the main office complex,  a Braille Transcription Department
03:29 has been added that produces  Braille publications in Malagasy.
03:35 One blind sister commented:
03:37 Receiving Braille publications  in my mother tongue
03:40 has really touched my heart.
03:43 Thank you.
03:45 The facilities now include  a new sign-language studio
03:48 for recording  Madagascar Sign Language publications
03:52 on DVD and jw.org.
03:55 With publications  in this video format,
03:58 sign-language congregations  and groups are actively helping the deaf
04:02 to “hear” the good news  in the language of their heart.
04:10 A special meeting was held  the day after the dedication program,
04:13 which proved to be historic
04:15 as 28,683 people attended
04:19 either at the Assembly Hall
04:21 or via a live stream video tie-in  at their Kingdom Halls
04:24 to listen to a special talk
04:26 given by Brother Sanderson.
04:29 This represented nearly all
04:31 of Jehovah’s people in Madagascar.
04:36 Through these newly expanded  branch facilities,
04:39 “the faithful and discreet slave”  continues to provide the people of Madagascar
04:44 spiritual food supplies  at the proper time,
04:49 at the right locations,
04:52 in the correct languages,  and in up-to-date formats.

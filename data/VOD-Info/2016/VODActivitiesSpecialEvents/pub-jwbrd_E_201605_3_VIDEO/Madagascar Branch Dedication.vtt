00:05.150 --> 00:08.237
The Big Red Island is renowned 


00:08.237 --> 00:11.000
as a place of incredible beauty 
and diversity. 


00:12.825 --> 00:15.870
About 75 percent 
of the plant and animal species 


00:15.870 --> 00:20.000
found in Madagascar 
live nowhere else on the planet.


00:30.717 --> 00:35.264
Another form of diversity on the island 
has to do with the directive 


00:35.263 --> 00:39.016
given by Jesus at Luke 12:42 


00:39.017 --> 00:42.020
that he would appoint 
a ‘faithful and discreet steward 


00:42.020 --> 00:44.022
‘over his body of attendants


00:44.022 --> 00:46.400
‘to keep giving them 
their measure of food supplies 


00:46.400 --> 00:48.818
at the proper time.’ 


00:48.818 --> 00:53.198
Doing so for the diverse needs 
of this large island was the main reason 


00:53.198 --> 00:55.491
for the original branch buildings 


00:55.492 --> 00:57.745
that were constructed, 
which were dedicated 


00:57.745 --> 01:00.497
December 7, 1996.


01:00.497 --> 01:04.084
However, 
because of remarkable growth, 


01:04.083 --> 01:07.503
it was not long 
before it became too small 


01:07.503 --> 01:10.090
and construction 
was started once more. 


01:10.090 --> 01:12.677
Isaiah 54:2 


01:12.677 --> 01:14.762
foretold that this would happen 


01:14.762 --> 01:17.180
during the time we are living in. 


01:17.180 --> 01:19.182
And so it became necessary 
to “make the place 


01:19.182 --> 01:21.227
“of your tent more spacious. . . . 


01:21.227 --> 01:23.229
And make 
your tent pins strong.” 


01:23.228 --> 01:26.065
These newly expanded 
branch facilities 


01:26.065 --> 01:28.942
were dedicated 
by Brother Mark Sanderson 


01:28.942 --> 01:31.320
of the Governing Body 
on Saturday, 


01:31.320 --> 01:35.000
January 24, 2015.


01:36.325 --> 01:39.328
Brothers and sisters, it is a great privilege 
for me to be here today 


01:39.328 --> 01:43.000
for the dedication 
of these expanded facilities in Madagascar.


01:45.458 --> 01:49.338
The diversity 
among Jehovah’s unified people 


01:49.338 --> 01:51.340
was well represented 
by the hundreds 


01:51.340 --> 01:55.000
of brothers and sisters 
at this special event. 


01:57.303 --> 02:01.391
Included were guests 
from 15 different countries, 


02:01.392 --> 02:05.812
along with longtime Witnesses, 


02:05.812 --> 02:08.440
Bethelites, circuit overseers, 


02:08.440 --> 02:11.318
special pioneers, and missionaries. 


02:11.318 --> 02:15.196
Even some of the first missionaries 
were among the visitors.


02:15.197 --> 02:19.117
In his dedication talk, 
Brother Sanderson 


02:19.117 --> 02:23.247
highlighted 
our ongoing spiritual building work 


02:23.247 --> 02:28.210
with those to whom we preach 
and with ourselves.


02:28.210 --> 02:30.503
We have to help 
our students and our children 


02:30.503 --> 02:34.000
to build their own relationship 
with Jehovah.


02:35.883 --> 02:39.471
Is it your desire that we 
should dedicate these buildings 


02:39.472 --> 02:42.000
to the worship and service 
of our God, Jehovah?


02:45.935 --> 02:48.022
The expansion 
gives more office space 


02:48.022 --> 02:51.442
for the Malagasy translation team 
for added projects. 


02:51.442 --> 02:55.070
This is a key to serving the food 
in the right language. 


02:55.070 --> 02:59.700
So that spiritual food 
can be served in the right locations, 


02:59.700 --> 03:03.537
the new offices 
for the Local Design/Construction Department 


03:03.537 --> 03:06.665
help them to care 
for the construction 


03:06.665 --> 03:09.125
of Assembly and Kingdom Halls 
throughout the country. 


03:09.125 --> 03:13.213
These buildings serve 
as spiritual banquet halls 


03:13.213 --> 03:16.883
for the more than 660 congregations.


03:16.883 --> 03:20.000
But what about food 
in the right format? 


03:21.222 --> 03:25.809
One of these formats is Braille 
for the visually impaired. 


03:25.808 --> 03:29.896
In the main office complex, 
a Braille Transcription Department 


03:29.897 --> 03:34.000
has been added that produces 
Braille publications in Malagasy. 


03:35.360 --> 03:37.362
One blind sister commented:


03:37.362 --> 03:40.574
Receiving Braille publications 
in my mother tongue 


03:40.573 --> 03:43.076
has really touched my heart. 


03:43.077 --> 03:45.079
Thank you.


03:45.078 --> 03:48.623
The facilities now include 
a new sign-language studio 


03:48.623 --> 03:52.210
for recording 
Madagascar Sign Language publications 


03:52.210 --> 03:55.213
on DVD and jw.org. 


03:55.213 --> 03:58.341
With publications 
in this video format, 


03:58.342 --> 04:02.679
sign-language congregations 
and groups are actively helping the deaf 


04:02.678 --> 04:07.000
to “hear” the good news 
in the language of their heart.


04:10.228 --> 04:13.356
A special meeting was held 
the day after the dedication program, 


04:13.357 --> 04:15.359
which proved to be historic 


04:15.358 --> 04:19.613
as 28,683 people attended 


04:19.613 --> 04:21.531
either at the Assembly Hall 


04:21.532 --> 04:24.325
or via a live stream video tie-in 
at their Kingdom Halls 


04:24.325 --> 04:26.662
to listen to a special talk 


04:26.662 --> 04:29.080
given by Brother Sanderson. 


04:29.080 --> 04:31.833
This represented nearly all 


04:31.833 --> 04:34.000
of Jehovah’s people in Madagascar.


04:36.338 --> 04:39.256
Through these newly expanded 
branch facilities,


04:39.257 --> 04:44.262
“the faithful and discreet slave” 
continues to provide the people of Madagascar 


04:44.262 --> 04:49.267
spiritual food supplies 
at the proper time, 


04:49.267 --> 04:52.645
at the right locations, 


04:52.645 --> 05:11.353
in the correct languages, 
and in up-to-date formats.

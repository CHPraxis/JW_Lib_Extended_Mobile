00:19.202 --> 00:22.339
For me,
this is a historical moment. 


00:22.338 --> 00:24.906
I was very worried 
about how we will succeed. 


00:24.907 --> 00:29.845
But you can see that this is not possible 
just by people’s efforts. 


00:29.845 --> 00:32.915
The angels are helping, 
and Jehovah gives his spirit.


00:32.915 --> 00:37.000
Actually, this went 
beyond our dreams, what we get. 


00:38.488 --> 00:41.356
Of course, there have been 
many efforts put into it, 


00:41.357 --> 00:44.627
but it was worth it. 


00:44.627 --> 00:47.630
And we are very thankful 


00:47.630 --> 00:51.000
to the Governing Body 
that they made this possible for us.


00:56.538 --> 01:01.243
We welcome the 60 brothers 
and sisters who symbolized 


01:01.243 --> 01:04.213
their dedication to Jehovah 
who have now joined us 


01:04.213 --> 01:07.000
as footstep followers of Jesus.


01:10.653 --> 01:13.556
Thank you, friends, 
for all the love and the kindness 


01:13.557 --> 01:16.359
you’ve shown us here in Sofia.


01:16.358 --> 01:21.030
It’s a great privilege to be here 
with all of you and feeling the love 


01:21.030 --> 01:26.000
that Jehovah has for us 
and for everyone of you as well.


01:27.503 --> 01:30.406
I think that the best gift 
that we received 


01:30.407 --> 01:32.542
from our brothers 
was their smiles 


01:32.542 --> 01:35.000
of happiness.


01:37.680 --> 01:39.415
We saw how the brothers and sisters, 


01:39.415 --> 01:42.218
with all their hearts, 
gave their time 


01:42.218 --> 01:46.000
and were thinking about how to make 
the delegates feel welcome.


01:47.590 --> 01:51.962
To host this special event 
is really a huge privilege for us. 


01:51.962 --> 01:54.964
Thank you all for coming. 


01:54.963 --> 01:58.000
We are happy, and we look forward 
to seeing each other again.


02:03.405 --> 02:04.607
We love you.


02:04.607 --> 02:07.000
Thank you for your gifts.


02:15.852 --> 02:20.000
I think the question we all had 
in the beginning was, Will we make it? 


02:21.790 --> 02:25.395
Still today, I don’t really understand 
how it worked out. 


02:25.395 --> 02:28.000
But we used everyone,
everywhere.


02:31.367 --> 02:33.670
We knew that the brothers here 


02:33.670 --> 02:37.073
in Bulgaria had less materially, 
but we also saw 


02:37.073 --> 02:38.808
that they had a big heart. 


02:38.808 --> 02:40.075
Many different languages 


02:40.075 --> 02:43.078
are spoken here, 
but the spirit is the same. 


02:43.078 --> 02:48.000
We experienced what 
an international brotherhood really is.


02:53.422 --> 02:56.625
The local congregations 
helped a lot. 


02:56.625 --> 03:00.000
They prepared 
a pleasant surprise for every tour. 


03:01.197 --> 03:04.034
At the end, we saw joy 


03:04.033 --> 03:08.838
and happiness on the brothers’ faces.


03:08.838 --> 03:12.575
For being here for the week, 
it really had such an impact on us. 


03:12.575 --> 03:14.110
It’s been wonderful. 


03:14.110 --> 03:16.112
It’s been a faith-building experience, 


03:16.112 --> 03:18.480
and it really brings us together 
as a worldwide organization, 


03:18.480 --> 03:21.000
and we’re privileged 
to be a part of it.


03:23.185 --> 03:27.657
So when we follow instruction 
from the organization 


03:27.657 --> 03:29.792
regarding the ministry 


03:29.792 --> 03:31.929
and we think 
about the brothers’ happiness


03:31.928 --> 03:34.163
and the joy in the ministry,


03:34.163 --> 03:37.000
we can see the result.


03:39.468 --> 03:44.206
We saw that in the end, 
Jehovah opened large doors. 


03:44.207 --> 03:46.842
We managed to accommodate 
our precious delegates 


03:46.842 --> 03:49.945
in the best hotels, 
and we saw how Jehovah 


03:49.945 --> 03:52.000
can make the impossible, possible.


03:54.717 --> 03:59.389
These three days, 
we met our “relatives” from Bulgaria, 


03:59.388 --> 04:01.356
from the United States, 


04:01.357 --> 04:05.362
from Macedonia, 
from Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova 


04:05.362 --> 04:08.000
and we wouldn’t change 
this for anything else.


04:14.370 --> 04:17.940
Some of the joyful tears 
we will shed in the new world, 


04:17.940 --> 04:19.942
we have experienced here. 


04:19.942 --> 04:22.000
The memory of this is beautiful. 
Thank you!


04:23.578 --> 04:25.581
We are truly a family.


04:25.582 --> 04:27.000
Da! 


04:46.935 --> 04:51.473
The feeling I had with this event 
is just like we had the impression 


04:51.473 --> 04:55.611
to walk for a few moments 
in the new world. 


04:55.612 --> 04:56.779
This is the way I felt.


04:56.778 --> 05:01.150
We would like to help you learn 
how you can be on Jesus’ side, 


05:01.150 --> 05:05.000
on his side, 
when he completely conquers the world!


05:41.590 --> 05:59.292
We look forward to being with you 
at a convention in the new world.

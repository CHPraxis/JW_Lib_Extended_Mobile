00:00:01 This past summer,
00:00:03 it was my privilege to attend
00:00:05 a large regional convention
00:00:08 in Stockholm, Sweden.
00:00:10 Brothers and sisters  from Sweden, Denmark,
00:00:14 Norway, Iceland, Greenland, the Faeroe Islands,
00:00:17 and also the Swedish circuit in Finland
00:00:20 were present at this historic convention.
00:00:25 While this event was a great spiritual boost  for the Witnesses,
00:00:30 some of you may know
00:00:32 that the majority of the local residents
00:00:35 do not believe in God.
00:00:37 Many consider themselves atheists.
00:00:41 But the conduct
00:00:43 and professionalism of Jehovah’s people
00:00:47 made a great impact.
00:01:02 First, the branch offices were merged.
00:01:06 And the result was a new branch office —Scandinavia branch.
00:01:13 We thought that if all the brothers in Scandinavia
00:01:16 should benefit from this unity,
00:01:18 then we had to have a convention in Stockholm.
00:01:25 Here we were allowed to arrange a regional convention,
00:01:28 but one of enormous size.
00:01:30 Having 50,000 brothers gathered together for three days
00:01:34 is the largest theocratic event ever in Scandinavia.
00:01:39 So we began to look for a facility,
00:01:42 and we found Friends Arena.
00:01:52 I think we have had a very good collaboration.
00:01:55 Many times I have thought:
00:01:57 “Wow, these people working for you
00:02:00 “as the organizers of infrastructure, logistics, and so on,
00:02:03 we should work with them more often.”
00:02:09 The use of technology has been the greatest challenge.
00:02:12 Obviously, with such a large project, many details have to come together.
00:02:18 There are four languages and three sign languages,
00:02:20 and all these have to be tied together and work at the same time.
00:02:23 It has been a challenge, but we made it work.
00:02:26 All the experts argued
00:02:28 that it would be impossible
00:02:30 to have four languages at one arena.
00:03:07 Early in the morning, families with children and strollers arrive.
00:03:12 Some elderly publishers get up at 5:30 a.m. or 6:00 a.m.,
00:03:16 getting on the bus to be here in good time.
00:03:19 Jehovah must be joyful seeing all the people
00:03:22 appreciating the spiritual program
00:03:24 and all their efforts.
00:03:35 When the song started,
00:03:37 50,000 were in place here,
00:03:39 and it was our proof that all the hard work in preparation was successful.
00:03:43 And actually, I shed a tear of joy.
00:03:45 I did.
00:03:48 One of the managers at the arena said:
00:03:51 “You have to stand and listen to the song
00:03:53 “because you will never again hear
00:03:56 “a choir of 50,000 singing at the same time.
00:04:00 You just have to listen to it.”
00:04:11 First, I want to thank you for how well it worked out.
00:04:15 Normally, at arrangements of this size,
00:04:18 we are using an event agency, but you have done this for many years,
00:04:21 and you have done a fantastic job, so it was not needed.
00:04:26 You have been very professional and have knowledge of the business industry.
00:04:31 I have told the contact persons I have been involved with
00:04:34 that they should start up an event agency because it has worked out so smoothly.
00:04:40 I can warmly recommend other cities to welcome you.
00:04:45 You have been very well-organized,
00:04:47 and we have not had to put much effort into the arrangement.
00:04:52 It requires good organization
00:04:55 to get all things to fall into place.
00:04:59 Obviously, having so many tourists in Stockholm
00:05:02 at the same time benefits the whole city.
00:05:06 I looked at the number of hotel bookings, and there are not many rooms available.
00:05:10 There are many who can learn from the work of the logistics,
00:05:13 of how to get 50,000 people
00:05:16 into the area at the same time.
00:05:18 That is something we can learn a lot from.
00:05:21 We met with the police this afternoon,
00:05:25 and they said that they have never seen
00:05:27 such a well-organized event, ever.
00:05:32 Seeing how everything has been successful,
00:05:41 that is a clear evidence of Jehovah’s help.
00:05:45 It is a great confirmation of one’s faith.
00:05:49 Here you really see faith in action.
00:05:51 Here you see the foundation for a new and better world.

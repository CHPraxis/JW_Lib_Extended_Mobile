00:00:09 ‎For sure, Maltese people  are a friendly people.
00:00:13 ‎It’s in our tradition  to be like that,
00:00:15 ‎but the Christian love  that Jehovah
00:00:18 ‎wants us  to grow inside,
00:00:21 ‎that will triple the effect.
00:00:25 ‎In October 2015,  the time finally arrived
00:00:28 ‎for the 650 publishers  on the island of Malta
00:00:32 ‎to host over 1,500 delegates
00:00:35 ‎for the “Imitate Jesus” Special Convention.
00:00:38 ‎This would allow for a unique
00:00:40 ‎and unprecedented shout  of praise to Jehovah.
00:00:45 ‎Well, the work in Malta  was for a long time
00:00:48 ‎rather restricted,  and there was a lot of opposition.
00:00:51 ‎Now, with this special convention,
00:00:55 ‎the brothers make an impact  on the people here.
00:00:59 ‎Some of them were not aware  that we are
00:01:02 ‎a worldwide brotherhood.
00:01:06 ‎The Maltese are very impressed  with numbers.
00:01:08 ‎So now when they see  all these numbers
00:01:10 ‎and all this activity,  they’re going to change their whole minds
00:01:14 ‎about us, and it’s going to open  their hearts and minds to our message.
00:01:20 ‎As well as making  a positive impact in the field,
00:01:23 ‎the delegates got to visit  the nearby isle of Gozo
00:01:26 ‎and have an interchange  of encouragement
00:01:28 ‎with one of the territory’s most  isolated congregations.
00:01:33 ‎We were looking forward to this  for over a year now,
00:01:36 ‎and to have the reality
00:01:38 ‎—you see the brothers here,  you can talk to them,
00:01:41 ‎you can hug them,  you see the love,
00:01:44 ‎the sincerity— and that’s what makes the difference.
00:02:00 ‎Hospitality was shown by means  of the evening entertainment program,
00:02:03 ‎which not only shared the local culture
00:02:06 ‎but glorified Jehovah  and the many treasures found in his Word.
00:02:21 ‎The children loved every bit  of this thing.
00:02:23 ‎They even said:  “What are we going to do when this finishes?
00:02:27 ‎“We loved being with Jehovah’s children.
00:02:30 ‎It’s so different than being  with the children in school.”
00:02:37 ‎By means of the convention,  I have felt closer to Jehovah,
00:02:41 ‎and I felt that I had Jehovah’s spirit.
00:02:45 ‎And, yes, I also met many other children  from different congregations,
00:02:50 ‎and I really enjoyed that.
00:03:02 ‎The brotherly love continued
00:03:04 ‎as other tours were hosted  all across the beautiful island,
00:03:08 ‎allowing the visitors to see Malta  and the Maltese people to see the visitors.
00:03:16 ‎“After we made it to safety,
00:03:18 ‎“we learned that the island  was called Malta.
00:03:21 ‎“And the foreign-speaking people  showed us extraordinary kindness.
00:03:25 ‎They kindled a fire  and received all of us kindly.”
00:03:35 ‎We extend a warm welcome  to all those present.
00:03:39 ‎We would like to give a special welcome
00:03:42 ‎to the 1,550 delegates
00:03:45 ‎coming from Australia, Portugal, Spain,
00:03:48 ‎Greece, Israel, and the United States!
00:03:59 ‎I found the truth in 1960.
00:04:05 ‎And it was difficult  at that time
00:04:07 ‎because there was no one  in the truth.
00:04:13 ‎When I saw this crowd here,
00:04:15 ‎I was filled with joy  seeing how Jehovah has made it grow.
00:04:25 ‎I was here in 1980 as a missionary.
00:04:28 ‎We only had 82 people here.
00:04:30 ‎And now look at it!
00:04:32 ‎From that little, little group,  we are now huge!
00:04:36 ‎And that makes me very happy.
00:04:39 ‎It reminds us of a prophecy  in the Hebrew Scriptures
00:04:43 ‎not to ‘despise the day  of small beginnings.’
00:04:46 ‎It doesn’t matter whether there are  many publishers or a few.
00:04:49 ‎The fact is that Jehovah  through his holy spirit
00:04:52 ‎can do things that we  are not even imagining
00:04:57 ‎so that there will be an increase  in Kingdom proclaimers.
00:05:03 ‎With the special convention now over,
00:05:05 ‎a lot of us take a deep breath  and say, “Ah, it’s done.”
00:05:10 ‎But it’s not time to stop;  now is the beginning.
00:05:13 ‎The brothers and sisters  give us a lot of encouragement.
00:05:16 ‎When they came,  they brought along their love as well.
00:05:21 ‎And seeing all this  makes you even want to give more.
00:05:25 ‎Doing this for Jehovah,  it’s rewarding, it is, truly.
00:05:29 ‎The Scriptures are right.

‎Preaching in the province of Quebec 
‎was a real challenge. 

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:07.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Catholic Church 

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was present 
‎in every sphere of public life.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the early ’40s,
‎the persecution 

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎took on quite a bit 

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:19.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎of emphasis. 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.938 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎Many Witnesses were being arrested. 

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Any excuse was used. 

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Peddling without a license

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:28.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—this was a favorite excuse. 

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah’s Witnesses were put in prison 

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎whenever they were seen 
‎with religious literature.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It had got so bad in Quebec 

00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:41.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that it was decided to circulate a petition, 

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and this petition was circulated 
‎throughout Canada. 

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And it called 
‎on the government of Quebec 

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to put an end 
‎to this persecution. 

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And interestingly, 

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎some 600,000 people 
‎signed the petition.

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Witnesses distributed 

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:02.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a very fiery tract 

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎called the Burning Hate of Quebec. 

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:06.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And in this tract, 

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they showed 
‎what was really happening

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:11.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—the actions of the policemen, 

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the illegal arrests, 
‎the mob action. 

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Within four months, 

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there were 800 new court cases. 

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So here, 
‎for 400 Jehovah’s Witnesses, 

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎you had 1,600 court cases.

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The seriousness 

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the court cases increased, 
‎in that now 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they were accusing 
‎the brothers of sedition. 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎If convicted, 
‎it was more than 10

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:41.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—maybe 12 or 15—
‎years in prison.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had one brother,
‎Aimé Boucher, 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who was arrested 
‎and charged with sedition.

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:51.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Aimé Boucher 
‎was a very poor brother, 

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎who lived 
‎in a rural part of Quebec. 

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:55.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And he actually 

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:59.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎went to court 
‎with his ox and buggy.

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And on the way to court, 

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he was preaching, 
‎so he was arrested again. 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They had the court hearing, 
‎and he was condemned. 

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He was found guilty of sedition. 

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And his case went up 
‎to the Court of Appeal

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—and at that time, the Court of Appeal 
‎of Quebec was very hostile—

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he lost on appeal, 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so it went up 
‎to the Supreme Court of Canada. 

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And by this time,

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:27.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there were several 
‎other brothers and sisters 

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎also charged on sedition, 

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎which meant that if he lost his case, 

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:34.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we had several going to prison 

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for very lengthy prison terms.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When Brother Boucher’s case 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎came before the Supreme Court, 

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he lost by a majority of one. 

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Catholic judges 
‎all ruled against him, 

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they found that the tract 

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the Burning Hate of Quebec 
‎was seditious.

00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:58.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our lawyers looked at the situation, 

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:00.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎prayed about it, and thought: 

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘What can we do? 
‎We can’t lose this battle.’ 

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And they realized that in Canada 

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:08.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there was a very rarely used provision 

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of asking the Supreme Court 
‎for a rehearing.

00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:14.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At the rehearing, 
‎one of the Catholic judges 

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:16.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was willing to discuss further 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the issue of sedition. 

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And to be guilty of sedition, 

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎you have to incite to violence. 

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So our attorney asked them: 

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:30.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Please, look at the record. 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Show the court 
‎where Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎incited to violence.” 

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And finally, they were able 
‎to convince a court they were wrong. 

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And so they overturned 
‎their initial decision, 

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Brother Boucher’s case 

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was victorious.

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:51.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This dealt with all 
‎the accusations of sedition 

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:55.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and really brought to an end 
‎the vicious opposition, 

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because that case 
‎was the one the government 

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was hoping would work out for them.

00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:05.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎There is one case 
‎that’s quite noteworthy in Quebec. 

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:08.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And it’s a case of the priest 

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:11.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎calling up the federal police 

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to come and interrupt 

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:21.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and expel the speaker 
‎from the province of Quebec. 

00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:24.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The police obeyed the priest. 

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They went to the meeting, 
‎they took the brother, 

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they escorted him 
‎out of the province into Ontario.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And to disrupt a religious meeting 
‎was a criminal act. 

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎For the first time
‎—and it’s at the level of the Supreme Court—

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:41.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they found that the three policemen 

00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:44.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎had to pay moral damages 
‎to the brothers 

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:47.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for intercepting, 
‎or interrupting, the meeting. 

00:04:47.804 --> 00:04:49.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This has never happened before.

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:52.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And when it came up 
‎to the Supreme Court, 

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:54.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they unanimously ruled 

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:56.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎against the province of Quebec. 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The section on religious freedom 

00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is the result of these court cases. 

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:07.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Every lawyer in Canada 
‎(whether in Quebec or in English Canada), 

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when he studies law, 
‎must review these cases. 

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:14.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They are the fundamentals 
‎of religious freedom. 

00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And they represent 
‎the different areas

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:22.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—police action, government action, 
‎criminal action—

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they lay a very nice basis 

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:29.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for our freedoms today.

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our purpose is to be able 
‎to preach the good news 

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and to direct people’s attention 
‎toward the Bible. 

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But our court cases 
‎have helped governments, 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎courts, judges, 

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎on the issue of religious freedom.

00:01.772 --> 00:03.857
Over the last several years,


00:03.857 --> 00:06.485
the U.S. branch and world headquarters


00:06.485 --> 00:10.697
have had the responsibility
of constructing several new buildings.


00:10.697 --> 00:15.327
Nine of these buildings were awarded
a Four Green Globes rating,


00:15.327 --> 00:19.999
which is the highest
Green Globes certification possible.


00:19.998 --> 00:22.333
The two at Wallkill were
the Office Building 


00:22.333 --> 00:24.711
and F Residence.


00:24.712 --> 00:27.255
The seven at the new Warwick complex


00:27.255 --> 00:31.468
were the four residence buildings,
the Maintenance Building,


00:31.468 --> 00:36.140
Office and Services Building,
and Vehicle Maintenance Building.


00:36.140 --> 00:40.018
Now, a good number of you
may be asking right about now,


00:40.018 --> 00:43.813
‘What exactly is this Green Globes program?’


00:43.813 --> 00:45.856
Well, it is a program 


00:45.857 --> 00:49.529
which assesses
the “eco-friendliness” of a building


00:49.528 --> 00:53.073
starting from design 
through construction.


00:53.073 --> 00:55.616
An independent third party 
assesses 


00:55.617 --> 00:58.037
the environmental impact
of a completed building


00:58.037 --> 01:01.499
on a scale of one to four Globes.


01:01.498 --> 01:06.503
The organization
that coordinates the program stated


01:06.503 --> 01:08.796
that a Four Green Globes rating


01:08.797 --> 01:11.592
“demonstrates national leadership


01:11.592 --> 01:15.304
“and excellence 
in the practice of water, energy 


01:15.303 --> 01:20.141
and environmental efficiency
to reduce environmental impact.”


01:20.142 --> 01:23.187
The organization that coordinates
the Green Globes program


01:23.187 --> 01:27.692
drew our attention
to how significant an accomplishment


01:27.692 --> 01:29.735
receiving this award is


01:29.735 --> 01:33.030
by mentioning that only 4 percent


01:33.030 --> 01:35.823
of properties that apply


01:35.823 --> 01:40.745
are able to achieve the top rating
for even one of their buildings.


01:40.745 --> 01:43.373
In spite of this, 


01:43.373 --> 01:46.376
on September 14, 2016,


01:46.377 --> 01:49.797
the Warwick project
was simultaneously awarded


01:49.797 --> 01:53.217
seven of these Four Green Globes


01:53.217 --> 01:57.639
for all buildings that qualified
for consideration.


01:57.638 --> 02:01.266
Now, understanding the significance
of this award,


02:01.267 --> 02:03.310
you probably feel a measure


02:03.310 --> 02:06.688
of pride and satisfaction
with this milestone.


02:06.688 --> 02:09.065
Another question you may have is,


02:09.065 --> 02:11.985
‘How does this environmental design


02:11.985 --> 02:15.947
at Warwick and Wallkill
benefit the organization?’


02:15.947 --> 02:20.285
Well, since Revelation 11:18
points out that it is 


02:20.285 --> 02:22.997
Jehovah that will ultimately need


02:22.997 --> 02:25.832
to step in to save our earth from ruin,


02:25.832 --> 02:28.585
the intent is not to join some


02:28.585 --> 02:31.005
sustainable design fad


02:31.005 --> 02:34.467
or try to do what only Jehovah can do.


02:34.467 --> 02:36.469
This means that we don’t design 


02:36.468 --> 02:40.180
simply to be “green”
as many in the world would.


02:40.180 --> 02:44.393
Rather, we saw 
four noteworthy benefits


02:44.393 --> 02:46.686
from this level of design.


02:46.687 --> 02:49.064
First and foremost,


02:49.063 --> 02:52.316
Jehovah’s name is glorified.


02:52.317 --> 02:55.945
It often happens
that during the design phase of a project,


02:55.945 --> 02:57.865
claims are made 


02:57.865 --> 03:02.035
as to the anticipated
environmental impact of a building’s design.


03:02.035 --> 03:04.372
However, the final outcome


03:04.372 --> 03:07.207
after construction often falls short


03:07.207 --> 03:09.250
of what is promised,


03:09.250 --> 03:12.087
which can leave officials quite frustrated.


03:12.087 --> 03:15.382
With Warwick,
we modestly made known


03:15.382 --> 03:18.635
our goal to the local officials and community


03:18.635 --> 03:23.223
that we would strive 
to achieve three of four Green Globes.


03:23.223 --> 03:25.225
In contrast, 


03:25.225 --> 03:27.560
this award confirms


03:27.560 --> 03:31.065
that Jehovah’s Witnesses
have kept our word by achieving


03:31.065 --> 03:33.983
not three but four Green Globes.


03:33.983 --> 03:35.985
Keeping our word


03:35.985 --> 03:38.197
has brought honor to Jehovah


03:38.197 --> 03:42.534
and built a trustworthy reputation
in the community.


03:42.533 --> 03:45.828
And that leads to our second benefit.


03:45.828 --> 03:49.916
This top environmental rating confirms 


03:49.917 --> 03:54.129
that we, as an organization,
respect Jehovah’s creation.


03:54.128 --> 03:56.173
Being known 


03:56.173 --> 03:58.550
as responsible stewards
of the environment


03:58.550 --> 04:02.972
allows us to have many benefits,
one of which 


04:02.972 --> 04:04.932
is in the case of Wallkill.


04:04.932 --> 04:07.977
Our reputation made it easier
to gain approvals


04:07.977 --> 04:10.729
to expand our facilities there.


04:10.728 --> 04:13.523
A third benefit 


04:13.523 --> 04:16.401
is to our neighbors
in the surrounding community.


04:16.402 --> 04:21.000
For example, the drinking water
in the adjoining lake is not contaminated.


04:22.032 --> 04:27.037
Our site lighting
doesn’t light the night sky.


04:27.037 --> 04:31.500
The use of native plants 
serves to protect the health 


04:31.500 --> 04:35.545
of the beautiful surrounding forest
that we all enjoy.


04:35.545 --> 04:38.632
And the design and location
of the buildings on-site


04:38.632 --> 04:40.884
preserve the spectacular views


04:40.883 --> 04:44.555
from the adjoining forest trails.


04:44.555 --> 04:48.475
Yet, a fourth benefit to the organization


04:48.475 --> 04:51.060
is that this level of design


04:51.060 --> 04:54.607
makes the best use of donated funds.


04:54.607 --> 04:57.775
While experts vary 
on the exact percentages,


04:57.775 --> 04:59.778
over the lifetime 


04:59.778 --> 05:04.491
of a typical building,
operational and maintenance costs can be


05:04.492 --> 05:07.870
four to six times
the initial construction costs.


05:07.870 --> 05:12.540
So the more efficient the design 
and construction, the more long-term savings


05:12.540 --> 05:15.127
are realized for the organization.


05:15.127 --> 05:17.087
For instance,


05:17.087 --> 05:20.132
an independent energy consultant
recently calculated


05:20.132 --> 05:22.800
that we could expect to see savings


05:22.800 --> 05:25.595
of over one million dollars annually


05:25.595 --> 05:29.182
from the energy-efficient measures
incorporated 


05:29.182 --> 05:32.227
into our project as compared 
to a standard construction


05:32.227 --> 05:35.480
of similar facilities.


05:35.480 --> 05:38.483
But you may be curious
as to what 


05:38.483 --> 05:41.445
energy and environmental features


05:41.445 --> 05:44.698
were incorporated into the Warwick project


05:44.698 --> 05:47.951
to earn these awards and save funds.


05:47.952 --> 05:52.539
These features covered
multiple aspects of design.


05:52.538 --> 05:55.916
They basically fall into five categories:


05:55.917 --> 05:57.460
landscaping, 


05:57.460 --> 05:59.337
rainwater control,


05:59.337 --> 06:01.549
lighting control,


06:01.548 --> 06:03.716
energy efficiency, 


06:03.717 --> 06:05.927
and water usage.


06:05.927 --> 06:09.974
With respect to the first category
—landscaping—


06:09.973 --> 06:13.976
a control system checks rainfall
and local weather conditions


06:13.977 --> 06:17.064
to determine how much water
is needed 


06:17.063 --> 06:19.523
in each irrigation zone,


06:19.523 --> 06:22.986
and drought-resistant native plants and trees


06:22.987 --> 06:26.990
also reduce water needs.


06:26.990 --> 06:30.160
The second category is rainwater control.


06:30.160 --> 06:32.162
All rainwater


06:32.162 --> 06:37.000
from the roofs and building surfaces
is treated with green roofs,


06:38.002 --> 06:42.000
bioretention areas,


06:44.007 --> 06:47.719
permeable concrete paving,


06:47.718 --> 06:50.430
underground sand filters,


06:50.430 --> 06:53.000
and storm-water planters.


06:55.185 --> 06:58.230
Yet a third category is lighting control.


06:58.230 --> 07:00.232
Lighting sensors


07:00.232 --> 07:04.737
in perimeter window spaces
are linked to a control system


07:04.737 --> 07:08.865
that balances
natural lighting with fluorescent lighting,


07:08.865 --> 07:12.000
while still permitting 
the occupant control as desired.


07:13.703 --> 07:16.790
The fourth category is energy efficiency.


07:16.790 --> 07:19.918
High-efficiency HVAC equipment,


07:19.918 --> 07:23.000
boilers, and chillers were incorporated.


07:24.715 --> 07:27.383
A geothermal well field


07:27.383 --> 07:30.636
consisting of some 120 wells


07:30.637 --> 07:32.764
takes advantage of renewable energy


07:32.763 --> 07:36.000
to supplement
building heating and cooling needs.


07:37.685 --> 07:42.232
And with respect to our fifth category
—water usage—


07:42.232 --> 07:45.235
water is conserved in all the buildings


07:45.235 --> 07:48.905
by means of plumbing fixtures that use 


07:48.905 --> 07:51.700
lower volumes of water.


07:51.700 --> 07:55.578
As we stated earlier,
the operation and maintenance expense


07:55.578 --> 08:00.166
is the greatest part
of a building’s total cost.


08:00.167 --> 08:02.960
To the extent that we practice water,


08:02.960 --> 08:05.172
lighting, and energy conservation


08:05.172 --> 08:08.467
in our individual rooms and work places


08:08.467 --> 08:10.969
—to that extent we can have


08:10.968 --> 08:14.931
a personal share
in realizing the full benefit,


08:14.932 --> 08:17.100
potential, and purpose


08:17.100 --> 08:20.353
of these new facilities
at Wallkill and Warwick.


08:20.353 --> 08:24.523
And what knitted together
all of these features,


08:24.523 --> 08:28.278
making the awards possible though,
were the people.


08:28.278 --> 08:32.156
This was only because
of the close cooperation


08:32.157 --> 08:35.452
and tireless efforts of the thousands


08:35.452 --> 08:37.995
who worked in various areas


08:37.995 --> 08:41.040
such as design, purchasing
and construction.


08:41.040 --> 08:47.505
It truly was a strong testimony
to the power of unity.


08:47.505 --> 08:51.217
Certainly, Jehovah’s heart
is filled with joy


08:51.217 --> 08:55.764
as he sees all the fine work
that has been accomplished


08:55.763 --> 08:57.765
and the glory that it’s brought


08:57.765 --> 09:13.303
and will continue to bring to his name.

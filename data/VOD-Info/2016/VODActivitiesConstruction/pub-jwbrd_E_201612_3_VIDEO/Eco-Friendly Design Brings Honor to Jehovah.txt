00:01 Over the last several years,
00:03 the U.S. branch and world headquarters
00:06 have had the responsibility of constructing several new buildings.
00:10 Nine of these buildings were awarded a Four Green Globes rating,
00:15 which is the highest Green Globes certification possible.
00:19 The two at Wallkill were the Office Building
00:22 and F Residence.
00:24 The seven at the new Warwick complex
00:27 were the four residence buildings, the Maintenance Building,
00:31 Office and Services Building, and Vehicle Maintenance Building.
00:36 Now, a good number of you may be asking right about now,
00:40 ‘What exactly is this Green Globes program?’
00:43 Well, it is a program
00:45 which assesses the “eco-friendliness” of a building
00:49 starting from design  through construction.
00:53 An independent third party  assesses
00:55 the environmental impact of a completed building
00:58 on a scale of one to four Globes.
01:01 The organization that coordinates the program stated
01:06 that a Four Green Globes rating
01:08 “demonstrates national leadership
01:11 “and excellence  in the practice of water, energy
01:15 and environmental efficiency to reduce environmental impact.”
01:20 The organization that coordinates the Green Globes program
01:23 drew our attention to how significant an accomplishment
01:27 receiving this award is
01:29 by mentioning that only 4 percent
01:33 of properties that apply
01:35 are able to achieve the top rating for even one of their buildings.
01:40 In spite of this,
01:43 on September 14, 2016,
01:46 the Warwick project was simultaneously awarded
01:49 seven of these Four Green Globes
01:53 for all buildings that qualified for consideration.
01:57 Now, understanding the significance of this award,
02:01 you probably feel a measure
02:03 of pride and satisfaction with this milestone.
02:06 Another question you may have is,
02:09 ‘How does this environmental design
02:11 at Warwick and Wallkill benefit the organization?’
02:15 Well, since Revelation 11:18 points out that it is
02:20 Jehovah that will ultimately need
02:22 to step in to save our earth from ruin,
02:25 the intent is not to join some
02:28 sustainable design fad
02:31 or try to do what only Jehovah can do.
02:34 This means that we don’t design
02:36 simply to be “green” as many in the world would.
02:40 Rather, we saw  four noteworthy benefits
02:44 from this level of design.
02:46 First and foremost,
02:49 Jehovah’s name is glorified.
02:52 It often happens that during the design phase of a project,
02:55 claims are made
02:57 as to the anticipated environmental impact of a building’s design.
03:02 However, the final outcome
03:04 after construction often falls short
03:07 of what is promised,
03:09 which can leave officials quite frustrated.
03:12 With Warwick, we modestly made known
03:15 our goal to the local officials and community
03:18 that we would strive  to achieve three of four Green Globes.
03:23 In contrast,
03:25 this award confirms
03:27 that Jehovah’s Witnesses have kept our word by achieving
03:31 not three but four Green Globes.
03:33 Keeping our word
03:35 has brought honor to Jehovah
03:38 and built a trustworthy reputation in the community.
03:42 And that leads to our second benefit.
03:45 This top environmental rating confirms
03:49 that we, as an organization, respect Jehovah’s creation.
03:54 Being known
03:56 as responsible stewards of the environment
03:58 allows us to have many benefits, one of which
04:02 is in the case of Wallkill.
04:04 Our reputation made it easier to gain approvals
04:07 to expand our facilities there.
04:10 A third benefit
04:13 is to our neighbors in the surrounding community.
04:16 For example, the drinking water in the adjoining lake is not contaminated.
04:22 Our site lighting doesn’t light the night sky.
04:27 The use of native plants  serves to protect the health
04:31 of the beautiful surrounding forest that we all enjoy.
04:35 And the design and location of the buildings on-site
04:38 preserve the spectacular views
04:40 from the adjoining forest trails.
04:44 Yet, a fourth benefit to the organization
04:48 is that this level of design
04:51 makes the best use of donated funds.
04:54 While experts vary  on the exact percentages,
04:57 over the lifetime
04:59 of a typical building, operational and maintenance costs can be
05:04 four to six times the initial construction costs.
05:07 So the more efficient the design  and construction, the more long-term savings
05:12 are realized for the organization.
05:15 For instance,
05:17 an independent energy consultant recently calculated
05:20 that we could expect to see savings
05:22 of over one million dollars annually
05:25 from the energy-efficient measures incorporated
05:29 into our project as compared  to a standard construction
05:32 of similar facilities.
05:35 But you may be curious as to what
05:38 energy and environmental features
05:41 were incorporated into the Warwick project
05:44 to earn these awards and save funds.
05:47 These features covered multiple aspects of design.
05:52 They basically fall into five categories:
05:55 landscaping,
05:57 rainwater control,
05:59 lighting control,
06:01 energy efficiency,
06:03 and water usage.
06:05 With respect to the first category —landscaping—
06:09 a control system checks rainfall and local weather conditions
06:13 to determine how much water is needed
06:17 in each irrigation zone,
06:19 and drought-resistant native plants and trees
06:22 also reduce water needs.
06:26 The second category is rainwater control.
06:30 All rainwater
06:32 from the roofs and building surfaces is treated with green roofs,
06:38 bioretention areas,
06:44 permeable concrete paving,
06:47 underground sand filters,
06:50 and storm-water planters.
06:55 Yet a third category is lighting control.
06:58 Lighting sensors
07:00 in perimeter window spaces are linked to a control system
07:04 that balances natural lighting with fluorescent lighting,
07:08 while still permitting  the occupant control as desired.
07:13 The fourth category is energy efficiency.
07:16 High-efficiency HVAC equipment,
07:19 boilers, and chillers were incorporated.
07:24 A geothermal well field
07:27 consisting of some 120 wells
07:30 takes advantage of renewable energy
07:32 to supplement building heating and cooling needs.
07:37 And with respect to our fifth category —water usage—
07:42 water is conserved in all the buildings
07:45 by means of plumbing fixtures that use
07:48 lower volumes of water.
07:51 As we stated earlier, the operation and maintenance expense
07:55 is the greatest part of a building’s total cost.
08:00 To the extent that we practice water,
08:02 lighting, and energy conservation
08:05 in our individual rooms and work places
08:08 —to that extent we can have
08:10 a personal share in realizing the full benefit,
08:14 potential, and purpose
08:17 of these new facilities at Wallkill and Warwick.
08:20 And what knitted together all of these features,
08:24 making the awards possible though, were the people.
08:28 This was only because of the close cooperation
08:32 and tireless efforts of the thousands
08:35 who worked in various areas
08:37 such as design, purchasing and construction.
08:41 It truly was a strong testimony to the power of unity.
08:47 Certainly, Jehovah’s heart is filled with joy
08:51 as he sees all the fine work that has been accomplished
08:55 and the glory that it’s brought
08:57 and will continue to bring to his name.

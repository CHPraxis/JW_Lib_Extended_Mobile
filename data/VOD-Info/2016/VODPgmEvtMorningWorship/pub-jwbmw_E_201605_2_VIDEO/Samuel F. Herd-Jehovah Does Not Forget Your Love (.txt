00:01 This text was taken  from The Watchtower with the theme:
00:05 “Serving Jehovah  Before the Days of Distress Come.”
00:09 And the scripture  was Ecclesiastes 12:1:
00:13 “Remember . . .  your Grand Creator.”
00:15 Now for some of us  present here this morning, we must admit
00:19 the days of distress  have arrived.
00:23 Let’s open our Bibles  and look at something in the 90th Psalm.
00:28 Psalm 90:10 says:  “The span of our life is 70 years,
00:33 “or 80 if one  is especially strong.
00:36 “But they are filled  with trouble and sorrow;
00:40 “they quickly pass by,
00:43 and away we fly.”
00:46 It makes us think  of the words of Barzillai.
00:51 He made a comment  at 2 Samuel 19:
00:54 “How many days of my life are left that I  should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
00:58 “I am 80 years old today.
01:01 “Can I discern  between good and bad?
01:03 “Can I, your servant,  taste what I eat and drink?
01:06 Can I still listen to the voice  of male and female singers?”
01:10 Now I can tell you from experience,  when you reach the age of 80,
01:15 birds may be singing  when you wake up in the morning,
01:18 but many of us  can’t hear them.
01:20 We’re just too old.
01:23 However, it goes without saying,  wisdom accompanies age.
01:27 So this puts  a little light, good light,
01:30 on those of us  who are 80 and beyond.
01:33 In fact the Bible says:  “Gray hair is a crown of beauty
01:36 when it is found  in the way of righteousness.”
01:39 Now there are many scriptures
01:41 in the Hebrew Scriptures especially
01:44 that shed light  on older people
01:47 in a very favorable way.
01:49 One said: “Before gray hair  you should rise up,
01:52 “and you must show honor  to an older man
01:55 “[and, of course,  we can include woman],
01:58 “and you must be  in fear of your God.
02:00 I am Jehovah.”
02:02 Jehovah does not leave us  when we get old;
02:06 neither does he forget  what we did
02:08 when we were young  and healthy.
02:12 It made me think  of a situation
02:14 that happened in my life  when I was a young boy.
02:17 My father told me  to take our two mules, Jim and Old Jack,
02:22 to the creek  so they could drink some water.
02:26 Later, my father asked me  if I watered the mules.
02:31 I told him: “Yes, I took Jim  down there and gave him some water.
02:35 “I didn’t bother Old Jack.
02:37 Old Jack hadn’t done anything  all day long, just stayed in the barn.”
02:41 My father said: “I want you  to go back and get Old Jack
02:46 “and take him down and let him  drink some water, just like you did Jim.
02:50 “Old Jack has spent  his whole life
02:53 “so that we  could have bread on the table.
02:55 We’re not going to throw him away  now that he has grown old.”
02:58 Well that stuck with me,  and it made me think, too,
03:02 of what the Bible says  in Hebrews 6:10:
03:06 “For God is not unrighteous  so as to forget your work
03:10 “and the love  you showed for his name
03:12 by ministering and continuing to minister  to the holy ones.”
03:16 So Jehovah wants us to continue,  even when we’re older,
03:21 to perform our ministry,  perhaps to slow down a little
03:24 but not to stop.
03:27 So share the good news  you know about Jehovah
03:30 with the next generation.
03:32 That’s what Psalm 78  encourages us to do.
03:36 It says, “relate  to the generation to come.”
03:40 Make these things known
03:42 to their children,  the next generation.
03:45 So we have the responsibility,  those of us who are older,
03:49 80 and beyond  or 60 and beyond,
03:52 50 and beyond,  you just figure out what’s old.
03:56 But now where  and when can you do that?
04:00 How can you encourage  the younger ones?
04:03 I don’t know how you can do that,  where and when.
04:08 I don’t know  your circumstances,
04:10 but I’m going to give you  some situations: your room.
04:14 A member of the Governing Body  invited my wife and I
04:16 when we were serving  in the district here to come to his room
04:19 and sit in on his  family Bible study.
04:22 Well, we thought,  ‘That is quite an honor, my land,
04:25 to be able to come to a member  of the Governing Body’s room and his wife.’
04:28 And so we went in, and we studied  for the school and the service meeting.
04:32 On the way home, my wife said,  “You know, he studies just like we do.”
04:37 Well, that’s the way  we all should study.
04:41 What about field service?
04:43 Between doors,  stop and smell the roses
04:46 with the younger ones  that you are working with.
04:48 Breakfast meals,
04:50 squeeze out a “Good morning” and a warm smile.
04:53 It may be the best you can do  that early in the morning.
04:56 During the noon meal, mention how Jehovah  has helped you years ago.
05:01 What about to and from meetings  in the automobile?
05:05 Share a comment heard  that made your day.
05:08 During intermission  at circuit and regional conventions?
05:12 Oh, well, you’re saying,  ‘I’m too tired for that.’
05:15 Then just sit there  and look happy.
05:18 When in the infirmary,
05:21 nurses like to break the spell of pain  and sickness with a little humor.
05:25 Show them your picture  that was taken
05:28 on your wedding day
60 years ago.
05:30 They will not believe it’s you  and will talk about it when you leave.
05:37 Older ones, don’t concentrate  on what you no longer are able to do.
05:43 Give what you’re able to give,
05:45 give it joyfully, share what you still have  with the next generation.
05:49 It will encourage them  and definitely please Jehovah.
05:53 Now, what about  you younger ones?
05:55 Well, the Bible tells you  to ‘remember your Creator
05:58 ‘in the days of your young manhood  [or your young womanhood]
06:02 before the calamitous days  or the days of distress arrive.’
06:06 And they’re going to come, and they’re going  to hit you like a ton of bricks,
06:10 and there’s nothing  that you will be able to do
06:14 to prevent  that from happening.
06:16 It’s just part of being  in this wicked world
06:21 and being filled with sin.
06:24 So Jehovah knows,  though, what we have to give,
06:28 and he doesn’t expect us  to give any more than we have.
06:32 So do your best.
06:33 Continue working hard  in Kingdom service.
06:36 Give your youth  and vitality to Jehovah.
06:41 You’ll never regret it,  and Jehovah definitely will not forget
06:45 the love you showed  for his name.
06:47 He will see to it  that you “have the full assurance
06:50 of the hope  down to the end.”

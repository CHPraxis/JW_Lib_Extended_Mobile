00:00.883 --> 00:05.155
Many of us are concerned 
about how to care well for aging parents, 


00:05.155 --> 00:08.692
not only because of what it says 
in the quoted portion of today’s text 


00:08.692 --> 00:13.430
but also because of the phrase 
at the end of 1 Timothy 5:4. 


00:13.430 --> 00:16.365
If you tap the citation 
at the end of today’s text, 


00:16.365 --> 00:18.802
you get the rest of the verse,
namely, 


00:18.802 --> 00:23.607
“for this is acceptable 
in God’s sight.” 


00:23.607 --> 00:26.075
And that tells us 
just how important a matter this is. 


00:26.075 --> 00:28.077
Notice the Interlinear rendering. 


00:28.077 --> 00:31.680
The term translated 
“godly devotion” is literally 


00:31.680 --> 00:35.418
“to be revering well,” 
which could denote 


00:35.418 --> 00:38.421
being generally virtuous 
toward anyone. 


00:38.422 --> 00:40.557
And perhaps that’s why 
a number of translations 


00:40.557 --> 00:43.092
in our list here in JW Library


00:43.092 --> 00:45.829
simply say “to show piety.” 


00:45.828 --> 00:48.431
Still others, 
such as The Jerusalem Bible, 


00:48.432 --> 00:51.234
render the term 
“to do their duty.”


00:51.233 --> 00:53.235
But honoring our parents 


00:53.235 --> 00:56.973
is more than just 
our duty toward humans. 


00:56.973 --> 00:59.775
It’s more than just virtue 
for its own sake. 


00:59.775 --> 01:03.647
The verse itself says, 
“this is acceptable in God’s sight.” 


01:03.647 --> 01:07.184
So we love our parents, yes. 
They deserve our care, yes. 


01:07.183 --> 01:09.385
That’s virtuous, of course. 


01:09.385 --> 01:12.255
But principally, 
we care for our aging parents


01:12.255 --> 01:14.123
because we revere Jehovah. 


01:14.123 --> 01:17.860
We care about what Jehovah 
says is right conduct 


01:17.860 --> 01:19.895
toward family members. 


01:19.895 --> 01:21.898
It’s a matter 
of godly devotion.


01:21.898 --> 01:23.900
So, what are some 
of the factors to keep in mind? 


01:23.900 --> 01:26.837
Our commenters 
have helped us so much. 


01:26.837 --> 01:28.839
The comments point out 


01:28.838 --> 01:32.941
that “exactly how 
children provide care varies”


01:32.942 --> 01:36.012
because situations vary. 


01:36.012 --> 01:38.014
But here are four 
practical things we can do. 


01:38.013 --> 01:39.948
First, communicate. 


01:39.948 --> 01:43.820
Second, 
determine the real needs. 


01:43.820 --> 01:48.223
Third, 
have reasonable expectations. 


01:48.223 --> 01:52.895
And fourth, always remember 
to throw your burden on Jehovah.


01:52.895 --> 01:56.432
First, turn, please, 
to Proverbs chapter 15 


01:56.432 --> 01:59.302
and verse 22. 


01:59.302 --> 02:02.772
Communicate, 
communicate, communicate. 


02:02.772 --> 02:04.574
And what does this result in? 


02:04.573 --> 02:06.508
It says: 


02:06.508 --> 02:11.513
“Plans fail when there is 
no consultation, 


02:11.513 --> 02:13.816
“but there is 
accomplishment 


02:13.817 --> 02:17.154
through many advisers.” 


02:17.153 --> 02:21.556
So keep in touch
—call, write, email, text, Skype


02:21.557 --> 02:25.362
—once a week, more often, 
especially as they age. 


02:25.362 --> 02:27.197
Satisfy their spiritual needs. 


02:27.197 --> 02:30.200
Keep them apprised 
of what is going on at Bethel 


02:30.200 --> 02:33.202
and the rich treasures 
you enjoy here in your service. 


02:33.202 --> 02:35.605
Care for their emotional needs 
by reminding them 


02:35.605 --> 02:38.207
just how valuable they are. 


02:38.207 --> 02:40.277
But regarding 
their material needs, 


02:40.277 --> 02:43.780
it’s important to ask 
the right questions. 


02:43.780 --> 02:46.315
It’s easy to conclude 
they’re doing OK. 


02:46.315 --> 02:48.852
But this is where 
the many advisors come in. 


02:48.852 --> 02:51.922
Keep in touch with other family members, 
the local congregation. 


02:51.922 --> 02:53.524
Get the whole story. 


02:53.523 --> 02:55.925
True, the sheer multiplicity 
of counselors 


02:55.925 --> 02:58.528
doesn’t in itself 
guarantee accurate data. 


02:58.528 --> 03:00.530
A majority can be wrong. 


03:00.530 --> 03:05.000
That’s why Exodus 23:2 cautions us 
against just going along with the crowd. 


03:05.000 --> 03:08.337
However, when we’re trying 
to make important decisions, 


03:08.337 --> 03:12.342
we need to get a clear picture 
of what’s actually going on in their lives.


03:12.342 --> 03:15.412
And that leads to our second point: 
Determine the real needs. 


03:15.412 --> 03:20.417
Notice what it says here 
in Proverbs 14:15. 


03:20.417 --> 03:23.687
Some parents have made 
wise provision for their old age


03:23.687 --> 03:25.889
—pensions, insurance, 
retirement funds. 


03:25.888 --> 03:29.625
But what if these run out, 
then what? 


03:29.625 --> 03:32.095
Time to quit? 
Get a house? 


03:32.095 --> 03:34.297
It’s good 
that we honor our parents, 


03:34.297 --> 03:36.765
and never would we want 
to treat them with contempt. 


03:36.765 --> 03:39.435
That’s exactly 
what Jesus condemned. 


03:39.435 --> 03:42.838
And yet, in some cases, 


03:42.838 --> 03:46.108
we have to think 
about what it says 


03:46.108 --> 03:48.343
in Proverbs 14:15. 


03:48.343 --> 03:50.813
Notice what 
it says at the end: 


03:50.813 --> 03:54.550
“The shrewd one 
ponders each step.” 


03:54.550 --> 03:57.553
Family Happiness, page 176 


03:57.553 --> 04:00.956
raises 11 pertinent questions. 


04:00.957 --> 04:04.227
It says: ‘Suppose . . . your elderly mother 
is having difficulty living alone 


04:04.227 --> 04:07.030
‘and you think she might benefit 
from moving in with you . . . 


04:07.030 --> 04:10.400
‘You might consider . . . : 
What are her actual needs? 


04:10.400 --> 04:13.202
‘Are there private 
or state-sponsored support services 


04:13.202 --> 04:15.872
‘that offer an acceptable 
alternative solution? 


04:15.872 --> 04:19.209
‘Does she want to move? 


04:19.208 --> 04:22.945
‘If she does, in what ways 
will her life be affected? 


04:22.945 --> 04:25.748
‘Will she have to leave 
friends behind? 


04:25.748 --> 04:28.618
‘How might this 
affect her emotionally? 


04:28.618 --> 04:31.153
‘Have you talked 
these things over with her? 


04:31.153 --> 04:34.890
‘How might such a move 
affect you, your mate . . . ? 


04:34.890 --> 04:38.227
‘If your mother needs care, 
who will provide it? 


04:38.227 --> 04:39.962
‘Can the responsibility 
be shared? 


04:39.962 --> 04:44.234
Have you discussed the matter 
with all those directly involved?’


04:44.233 --> 04:47.636
In one of the most touching 
accounts on this subject, 


04:47.637 --> 04:51.474
John 19:26, 27, 


04:51.473 --> 04:54.343
we read that Jesus 


04:54.343 --> 04:57.213
when he “saw his mother 


04:57.213 --> 05:01.950
“and the disciple whom he loved 
standing nearby, he said to his mother: 


05:01.950 --> 05:03.618
“‘Woman, see! 
Your son!’ 


05:03.618 --> 05:05.621
“Next he said 
to the disciple: ‘See! 


05:05.622 --> 05:07.190
“Your mother!’ 


05:07.190 --> 05:09.192
“And from that hour on, 


05:09.192 --> 05:12.262
the disciple took her 
into his own home.” 


05:12.262 --> 05:15.030
Yes, despite all that was weighing 


05:15.030 --> 05:17.167
on Jesus’ shoulders 
at that precise moment, 


05:17.167 --> 05:21.304
not to mention 
the incredible pain he was enduring, 


05:21.303 --> 05:23.605
he took the time 
to take care of his mother. 


05:23.605 --> 05:24.540
But what did he do? 


05:24.540 --> 05:27.143
Did he summon 
12 legions of angels 


05:27.143 --> 05:29.478
and postpone his execution? 


05:29.478 --> 05:32.548
No, he delegated responsibility 


05:32.548 --> 05:36.418
to a relative 
and not his brothers, 


05:36.418 --> 05:39.821
because they apparently 
were not yet believers. 


05:39.822 --> 05:44.360
What an amazing example 
of balancing the real needs 


05:44.360 --> 05:46.762
of all concerned!


05:46.762 --> 05:49.299
Well, that brings us 
to our third point: 


05:49.298 --> 05:53.301
Have reasonable expectations 
of our parents, 


05:53.302 --> 05:56.605
of our relatives, 
of the congregation. 


05:56.605 --> 06:01.610
First Corinthians 16:14 says: 
“Let everything you do 


06:01.610 --> 06:06.482
be done with love”
—beautiful text. 


06:06.482 --> 06:09.352
Now the responsibility 
rests primarily 


06:09.352 --> 06:12.355
upon each Christian 
to care for his own household. 


06:12.355 --> 06:14.757
Children, grandchildren, 
other close relatives 


06:14.757 --> 06:17.427
display Christian love 
by providing assistance 


06:17.427 --> 06:20.697
to the elderly and infirm ones 
according to their needs. 


06:20.697 --> 06:23.432
But congregations 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


06:23.432 --> 06:26.169
do not weaken 


06:26.168 --> 06:30.706
this personal responsibility 
by taking over. 


06:30.707 --> 06:34.510
The Bethel family is really 
to be commended for the variety of ways 


06:34.510 --> 06:37.513
in which you are shouldering 
this very heavy responsibility. 


06:37.513 --> 06:39.981
How this must please Jehovah! 


06:39.982 --> 06:42.985
And that leads 
to our final point: 


06:42.985 --> 06:46.688
Remember to throw 
your burdens on Jehovah. 


06:46.688 --> 06:51.160
As pointed out in our comments, 
Jehovah “can bless 


06:51.160 --> 06:54.563
“any Scriptural decision 


06:54.563 --> 06:57.300
and make it work.” 


06:57.300 --> 06:59.968
How encouraging 
those words are! 


06:59.968 --> 07:03.305
And then it cites 
Numbers 11:23: 


07:03.305 --> 07:06.642
‘The hand of Jehovah 
is not short.’


07:06.642 --> 07:10.179
Only our lack 
of trust in Jehovah 


07:10.178 --> 07:13.648
would limit 
what he will do for us. 


07:13.648 --> 07:16.585
And although 
Jehovah can work miracles, 


07:16.585 --> 07:20.255
we don’t expect that we will never 
have to participate in the solution 


07:20.255 --> 07:22.325
of giving care 
to our aging parents. 


07:22.325 --> 07:23.325
Why not? 


07:23.325 --> 07:26.995
Because by learning to ‘practice 
godly devotion in our own households,’ 


07:26.995 --> 07:30.198
we have the opportunity 
to show the depth 


07:30.198 --> 07:33.535
of our unselfish motives 
in serving Jehovah, 


07:33.535 --> 07:35.538
and that proves 
the Devil a liar. 


07:35.538 --> 07:38.808
Nevertheless, 
notice this encouraging promise 


07:38.808 --> 07:43.078
at Psalm 145:18: 


07:43.078 --> 07:47.081
“Jehovah is near 
to all those calling on him, 


07:47.082 --> 07:49.619
“to all who call 
on him in truth. 


07:49.618 --> 07:53.221
“He satisfies the desire 
of those who fear him; 


07:53.222 --> 07:55.492
“he hears their cry for help, 


07:55.492 --> 07:58.360
and he rescues them.” 


07:58.360 --> 08:00.697
Jehovah helps. 


08:00.697 --> 08:03.232
Maybe you yourself 
are the instrument 


08:03.232 --> 08:06.702
in Jehovah’s hands to make sure 
that your parents are well cared for. 


08:06.702 --> 08:09.905
Your work 
may actually be the expression 


08:09.905 --> 08:24.938
of Jehovah’s love in answer 
to your parent’s prayers.

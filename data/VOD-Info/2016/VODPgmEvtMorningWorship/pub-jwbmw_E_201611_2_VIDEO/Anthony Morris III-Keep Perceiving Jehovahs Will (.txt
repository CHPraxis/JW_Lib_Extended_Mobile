00:00 Today, I thought we’d discuss the need to keep perceiving Jehovah’s will,
00:05 particularly when it comes to making decisions.
00:09 And what motivated me to choose to discuss that
00:14 is this first sentence  in the comments for today.
00:18 “If we are to please Jehovah,
00:21 “we must hold firmly to his laws and principles,
00:25 never adopting an unholy compromising attitude toward them.”
00:31 So it’s very obvious when it comes to commands.
00:35 And Jehovah has direct commands in Scripture:
00:38 he forbids idolatry,
00:41 he forbids fornication,
00:44 he forbids adultery and theft.
00:46 However, there are many situations
00:50 where there is no direct command in Scripture.
00:54 So some might feel that  in the absence of a direct law,
00:58 they’re free to do as they please.
01:01 Well, we’re aware of the fact that the Devil would be delighted
01:04 if he succeeds in getting us to break a law of Jehovah God.
01:09 However, “the wise in heart”
01:11 understand this need to firmly hold to
01:15 and apply Bible principles in their life.
01:18 It’s our experience that those that don’t hold firmly to Bible principles
01:23 ultimately end up breaking a law of God.
01:26 So it’s very crucial.
01:28 That’s why this scripture in Ephesians chapter 5
01:33 —or these verses here—
01:35 are really food for thought.
01:39 Jehovah gives us all we need
01:42 so that we’re not succumbing to the temptation
01:46 to violate Bible principles  when we’re making decisions.
01:53 And here in the fifth chapter,  familiar words,
01:56 verse 15 all the way through 17:
02:00 “So keep strict watch that how you walk
02:04 “is not as unwise but as wise persons,
02:07 “making the best use of your time,  because the days are wicked.
02:11 “On this account stop being unreasonable,
02:15 but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.”
02:20 Why, this is so helpful to God’s people to just
02:24 “keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.”
02:28 So that’s going to call on us to apply Bible principles in our lives.
02:33 This idea of perceiving —some translations,
02:37 they have “discernment” or “try to understand it.”
02:41 Really, “perceive” is a good translation.
02:44 It means to “attain awareness or understanding.”
02:47 So we need to attain awareness or understanding of Jehovah’s will.
02:53 Take, for example,  decisions that we make.
02:55 We’ll do a couple of examples here.
02:58 How about music choices?
03:00 Now, obviously, all of the sacred music —our Kingdom music—
03:04 is a good choice.
03:06 But we’re not going to be overrighteous and say we can’t listen to other music.
03:10 No, Jehovah’s not that way.  He’s not unreasonable.
03:14 However, when we make a choice in music
03:17 that we’re going to listen to,
03:19 can you say,  “Well, I like this kind of music,”
03:23 and everything is fine?
03:25 Not if we’re going to consider Ephesians 5:17
03:29 when it comes to making decisions where there is no direct command
03:33 against this particular kind of song or music.
03:38 We have to take into account  Jehovah’s thinking and his feelings.
03:42 Feelings?
03:43 Well, of course, Jehovah has feelings—they matter.
03:47 And one that really loves him,
03:49 it’s going to matter how Jehovah  is affected by a decision we make.
03:54 And “the wise in heart” always apply Bible principles in their lives.
03:59 They’re not going to give their ear and heart
04:01 to music without considering Jehovah’s feelings.
04:04 Think about a couple of questions we might raise
04:08 in your choice of music outside of the Kingdom music:
04:12 Can you think about Jehovah as you listen to this song,
04:15 and can you do so  without any pain of conscience?
04:22 Are the lyrics acceptable for one claiming
04:25 to love Jehovah and his principles?
04:29 See, good questions.
04:31 Something to think about.
04:34 You need to seek Jehovah’s will, perceive it,
04:38 and if it’s OK and your conscience is fine,
04:41 well, go ahead and listen to it.
04:44 But if you can’t answer  those questions there affirmatively,
04:49 well, then, it would be wise not to violate the Bible principle.
04:55 Another example, consider our appearance in the ministry.
04:59 And it’s noted  that styles of clothing differ
05:03 from place to place all over the world.
05:06 And we see that in our JW Broadcast
05:09 —the different type of dress the brothers have in some parts of the earth—
05:13 and that’s acceptable.
05:15 But see, we have to think again
05:17 about Bible principles guiding our decisions.
05:20 For example, this one here in 2 Corinthians chapter 6,
05:28 and when we think about our appearance
05:32 as we engage in the ministry, the holy ministry,
05:35 verse 3 of 2 Corinthians 6:
05:40 “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling,
05:44 so that no fault may be found  with our ministry.”
05:48 That’s very clear.
05:50 How does Jehovah feel?
05:53 Well, it’s right here.
05:54 He’d be offended if we had an appearance
05:59 in the ministry that stumbled folks, see.
06:02 This is our ministry in behalf of Jehovah God.
06:05 We don’t want to ever give a cause for stumbling.
06:08 So if our appearance detracts
06:11 from our representing ourselves as ministers of God,
06:16 well, then, that would stumble anyone that we’re preaching to,
06:21 and we would avoid that.
06:22 Very clear, so you don’t have to get a long list of rules.
06:26 Is there a chance somebody is going to be stumbled
06:28 by my appearance?
06:32 Now, I thought that we’d further help
06:36 with this matter of perceiving Jehovah’s will when making decisions,
06:40 and there’s no specific command.
06:42 And there was a beautiful article back in 2003,
06:47 “Do You Always Need a Bible Command?”
06:50 Good question.
06:52 And under the heading “Sharpening Our Perceptive Powers,”
06:55 a question was raised,
06:58 “How can we develop our perceptive powers
07:02 “so as to know how to please Jehovah
07:05 even when he has not given specific direction in a matter?”
07:08 And then the good advice was provided, of course,
07:12 reminding us to “read his Word daily, study it regularly,”
07:16 and we can’t overemphasize the need to “meditate on what we read.”
07:20 And then the observation was made here:
07:25 “We will experience growth in our powers of perception” if we do so.
07:29 But it doesn’t take place rapidly.
07:32 Like the physical growth of a child,  spiritual growth is gradual.”
07:36 It “is not immediately discerned.”
07:39 And the good counsel here:
07:41 “There is a need for patience, . . . we should not become frustrated
07:45 if we do not notice immediate improvement.”
07:48 And then it’s balanced off with:
07:50 “On the other hand,  the mere passing of much time
07:53 will not of itself sharpen our  perceptive powers”
07:57 just because time went by.
07:59 “Such time must be filled with regular  consideration of [Jehovah] God’s Word.”
08:04 See, so we learn to “live that Word to the best of our ability.”
08:09 That’s a profound thought.
08:12 And I thought this was even more profound
08:14 and it really reaches into our figurative hearts.
08:18 Just a marvelous thought in the following paragraph.
08:24 “It might be said
08:26 “that while God’s laws test our obedience,
08:31 “his principles test the depth of our spirituality
08:35 and of our desire to please him.”
08:38 Now that’s worth repeating.
08:40 “It might be said that while God’s laws test our obedience,
08:45 “his principles test the depth of our spirituality
08:50 and of our desire to please him”—beautiful.
08:53 So spiritual persons are governed by Bible principles,
08:58 that way they’re not going to be breaking a Bible law.
09:01 So let’s be determined to please Jehovah,
09:04 to do our best always,
09:06 to perceive his will —how does he feel about this—
09:09 and be guided by Bible principles when we make decisions.

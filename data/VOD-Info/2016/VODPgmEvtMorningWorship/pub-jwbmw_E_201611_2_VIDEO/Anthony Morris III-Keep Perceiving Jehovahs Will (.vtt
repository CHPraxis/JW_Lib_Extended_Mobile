WEBVTT

00:00.983 --> 00:05.588
Today, I thought we’d discuss
the need to keep perceiving Jehovah’s will,


00:05.588 --> 00:09.991
particularly when it comes
to making decisions. 


00:09.992 --> 00:14.497
And what motivated me
to choose to discuss that


00:14.497 --> 00:18.067
is this first sentence 
in the comments for today. 


00:18.067 --> 00:21.104
“If we are to please Jehovah, 


00:21.103 --> 00:25.408
“we must hold firmly
to his laws and principles,


00:25.408 --> 00:30.000
never adopting an unholy
compromising attitude toward them.”


00:31.447 --> 00:35.119
So it’s very obvious
when it comes to commands. 


00:35.118 --> 00:38.421
And Jehovah has direct
commands in Scripture:


00:38.422 --> 00:41.524
he forbids idolatry,


00:41.523 --> 00:44.060
he forbids fornication,


00:44.060 --> 00:46.763
he forbids adultery and theft. 


00:46.763 --> 00:50.466
However, there are many situations


00:50.467 --> 00:54.437
where there is no
direct command in Scripture. 


00:54.437 --> 00:58.642
So some might feel that 
in the absence of a direct law, 


00:58.642 --> 01:01.310
they’re free to do as they please. 


01:01.310 --> 01:04.380
Well, we’re aware of the fact
that the Devil would be delighted


01:04.380 --> 01:09.085
if he succeeds in getting us
to break a law of Jehovah God. 


01:09.085 --> 01:11.320
However, “the wise in heart”


01:11.320 --> 01:15.592
understand this need to firmly hold to


01:15.592 --> 01:18.762
and apply Bible principles in their life. 


01:18.762 --> 01:23.265
It’s our experience that those
that don’t hold firmly to Bible principles 


01:23.265 --> 01:26.435
ultimately end up breaking a law of God. 


01:26.435 --> 01:28.738
So it’s very crucial. 


01:28.738 --> 01:33.375
That’s why this scripture
in Ephesians chapter 5


01:33.375 --> 01:35.278
—or these verses here—


01:35.278 --> 01:39.781
are really food for thought. 


01:39.782 --> 01:42.352
Jehovah gives us all we need


01:42.352 --> 01:46.890
so that we’re not succumbing
to the temptation


01:46.890 --> 01:51.000
to violate Bible principles 
when we’re making decisions. 


01:53.062 --> 01:56.532
And here in the fifth chapter, 
familiar words,


01:56.532 --> 02:00.337
verse 15 all the way through 17: 


02:00.337 --> 02:04.140
“So keep strict watch that how you walk


02:04.140 --> 02:07.277
“is not as unwise but as wise persons, 


02:07.277 --> 02:11.915
“making the best use of your time, 
because the days are wicked. 


02:11.915 --> 02:15.385
“On this account stop being unreasonable,


02:15.385 --> 02:19.000
but keep perceiving
what the will of Jehovah is.” 


02:20.423 --> 02:24.926
Why, this is so helpful
to God’s people to just


02:24.927 --> 02:28.965
“keep perceiving what
the will of Jehovah is.” 


02:28.965 --> 02:33.837
So that’s going to call on us
to apply Bible principles in our lives. 


02:33.837 --> 02:37.974
This idea of perceiving
—some translations,


02:37.973 --> 02:41.743
they have “discernment”
or “try to understand it.” 


02:41.743 --> 02:44.113
Really, “perceive” is a good translation. 


02:44.113 --> 02:47.616
It means to “attain awareness
or understanding.” 


02:47.617 --> 02:52.000
So we need to attain awareness
or understanding of Jehovah’s will.


02:53.122 --> 02:55.825
Take, for example, 
decisions that we make. 


02:55.825 --> 02:58.093
We’ll do a couple of examples here. 


02:58.093 --> 03:00.263
How about music choices? 


03:00.263 --> 03:04.033
Now, obviously, all of the sacred music
—our Kingdom music—


03:04.033 --> 03:06.035
is a good choice. 


03:06.035 --> 03:10.207
But we’re not going to be overrighteous
and say we can’t listen to other music. 


03:10.207 --> 03:14.277
No, Jehovah’s not that way. 
He’s not unreasonable. 


03:14.277 --> 03:17.614
However, when we
make a choice in music


03:17.613 --> 03:19.915
that we’re going to listen to,


03:19.915 --> 03:23.485
can you say, 
“Well, I like this kind of music,” 


03:23.485 --> 03:25.522
and everything is fine? 


03:25.522 --> 03:29.059
Not if we’re
going to consider Ephesians 5:17


03:29.058 --> 03:33.195
when it comes to making decisions
where there is no direct command


03:33.195 --> 03:37.000
against this particular
kind of song or music. 


03:38.000 --> 03:42.405
We have to take into account 
Jehovah’s thinking and his feelings. 


03:42.405 --> 03:43.873
Feelings? 


03:43.873 --> 03:47.576
Well, of course,
Jehovah has feelings—they matter. 


03:47.577 --> 03:49.579
And one that really loves him,


03:49.578 --> 03:54.250
it’s going to matter how Jehovah 
is affected by a decision we make. 


03:54.250 --> 03:59.222
And “the wise in heart” always apply
Bible principles in their lives. 


03:59.222 --> 04:01.424
They’re not going to give
their ear and heart 


04:01.423 --> 04:04.793
to music without considering
Jehovah’s feelings. 


04:04.793 --> 04:08.396
Think about a couple of questions
we might raise


04:08.397 --> 04:12.202
in your choice of music
outside of the Kingdom music:


04:12.202 --> 04:15.939
Can you think about Jehovah
as you listen to this song,


04:15.938 --> 04:20.000
and can you do so 
without any pain of conscience? 


04:22.512 --> 04:25.247
Are the lyrics acceptable
for one claiming 


04:25.247 --> 04:29.919
to love Jehovah and his principles? 


04:29.918 --> 04:31.920
See, good questions. 


04:31.920 --> 04:34.290
Something to think about. 


04:34.290 --> 04:38.327
You need to seek
Jehovah’s will, perceive it,


04:38.327 --> 04:41.864
and if it’s OK
and your conscience is fine, 


04:41.863 --> 04:44.133
well, go ahead and listen to it. 


04:44.133 --> 04:49.138
But if you can’t answer 
those questions there affirmatively,


04:49.138 --> 04:55.143
well, then, it would be wise
not to violate the Bible principle.


04:55.143 --> 04:59.548
Another example, consider
our appearance in the ministry. 


04:59.548 --> 05:03.618
And it’s noted 
that styles of clothing differ


05:03.618 --> 05:06.788
from place to place all over the world. 


05:06.788 --> 05:09.491
And we see that in our JW Broadcast


05:09.492 --> 05:13.595
—the different type of dress
the brothers have in some parts of the earth—


05:13.595 --> 05:15.332
and that’s acceptable. 


05:15.332 --> 05:17.834
But see, we have to think again


05:17.833 --> 05:20.870
about Bible principles
guiding our decisions. 


05:20.870 --> 05:26.000
For example, this one here
in 2 Corinthians chapter 6,


05:28.845 --> 05:32.148
and when we think
about our appearance


05:32.148 --> 05:35.751
as we engage in the ministry,
the holy ministry, 


05:35.752 --> 05:40.122
verse 3 of 2 Corinthians 6:


05:40.122 --> 05:44.627
“In no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,


05:44.627 --> 05:48.799
so that no fault may be found 
with our ministry.” 


05:48.798 --> 05:50.833
That’s very clear. 


05:50.833 --> 05:53.268
How does Jehovah feel? 


05:53.268 --> 05:54.903
Well, it’s right here. 


05:54.903 --> 05:59.108
He’d be offended
if we had an appearance


05:59.108 --> 06:02.745
in the ministry
that stumbled folks, see. 


06:02.745 --> 06:05.882
This is our ministry
in behalf of Jehovah God. 


06:05.882 --> 06:08.985
We don’t want to ever
give a cause for stumbling. 


06:08.985 --> 06:11.753
So if our appearance detracts 


06:11.753 --> 06:16.425
from our representing
ourselves as ministers of God,


06:16.425 --> 06:21.230
well, then, that would stumble
anyone that we’re preaching to,


06:21.230 --> 06:22.598
and we would avoid that.


06:22.598 --> 06:26.135
Very clear, so you
don’t have to get a long list of rules. 


06:26.135 --> 06:28.872
Is there a chance somebody
is going to be stumbled


06:28.872 --> 06:31.000
by my appearance?


06:32.242 --> 06:36.012
Now, I thought that we’d further help


06:36.012 --> 06:40.517
with this matter of perceiving
Jehovah’s will when making decisions, 


06:40.517 --> 06:42.652
and there’s no specific command. 


06:42.652 --> 06:47.757
And there was a beautiful
article back in 2003,


06:47.757 --> 06:50.594
“Do You Always Need a Bible Command?” 


06:50.593 --> 06:52.261
Good question. 


06:52.262 --> 06:55.965
And under the heading
“Sharpening Our Perceptive Powers,”


06:55.965 --> 06:58.835
a question was raised,


06:58.835 --> 07:02.003
“How can we develop
our perceptive powers


07:02.003 --> 07:05.073
“so as to know how to please Jehovah


07:05.073 --> 07:08.743
even when he has not given
specific direction in a matter?” 


07:08.743 --> 07:12.148
And then the good advice
was provided, of course,


07:12.148 --> 07:16.518
reminding us to “read his Word daily,
study it regularly,” 


07:16.518 --> 07:20.923
and we can’t overemphasize
the need to “meditate on what we read.” 


07:20.923 --> 07:25.293
And then the observation
was made here:


07:25.293 --> 07:29.131
“We will experience growth
in our powers of perception” if we do so. 


07:29.132 --> 07:32.034
But it doesn’t take place rapidly. 


07:32.033 --> 07:36.838
Like the physical growth of a child, 
spiritual growth is gradual.” 


07:36.838 --> 07:39.175
It “is not immediately discerned.” 


07:39.175 --> 07:41.577
And the good counsel here: 


07:41.577 --> 07:45.314
“There is a need for patience,
. . . we should not become frustrated


07:45.313 --> 07:48.383
if we do not notice
immediate improvement.” 


07:48.383 --> 07:50.385
And then it’s balanced off with: 


07:50.385 --> 07:53.588
“On the other hand, 
the mere passing of much time


07:53.588 --> 07:57.091
will not of itself sharpen our 
perceptive powers”


07:57.092 --> 07:59.329
just because time went by. 


07:59.328 --> 08:04.333
“Such time must be filled with regular 
consideration of [Jehovah] God’s Word.” 


08:04.333 --> 08:09.338
See, so we learn to “live that Word
to the best of our ability.” 


08:09.338 --> 08:12.208
That’s a profound thought.


08:12.208 --> 08:14.710
And I thought
this was even more profound 


08:14.710 --> 08:18.680
and it really reaches
into our figurative hearts. 


08:18.680 --> 08:22.000
Just a marvelous thought
in the following paragraph. 


08:24.087 --> 08:26.255
“It might be said


08:26.255 --> 08:30.000
“that while God’s laws
test our obedience, 


08:31.060 --> 08:35.565
“his principles test the depth
of our spirituality


08:35.565 --> 08:38.968
and of our desire to please him.” 


08:38.968 --> 08:40.970
Now that’s worth repeating. 


08:40.970 --> 08:45.173
“It might be said that while
God’s laws test our obedience,


08:45.173 --> 08:50.111
“his principles test the depth
of our spirituality


08:50.112 --> 08:53.782
and of our desire
to please him”—beautiful. 


08:53.782 --> 08:58.287
So spiritual persons
are governed by Bible principles,


08:58.287 --> 09:01.957
that way they’re
not going to be breaking a Bible law. 


09:01.957 --> 09:04.694
So let’s be determined
to please Jehovah,


09:04.693 --> 09:06.195
to do our best always, 


09:06.195 --> 09:09.465
to perceive his will
—how does he feel about this—


09:09.465 --> 09:24.663
and be guided by Bible principles
when we make decisions.

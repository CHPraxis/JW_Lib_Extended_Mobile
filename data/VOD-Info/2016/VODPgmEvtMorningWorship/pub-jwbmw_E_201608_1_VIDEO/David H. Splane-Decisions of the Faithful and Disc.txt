00:00 “Well, there’ve been so many changes.
00:03 It’s hard to keep up.”
00:05 We hear that a lot.
00:07 And it’s true.
00:09 So the question is,  How do these changes come about?
00:13 Does the Governing Body get together  on a Wednesday morning and say,
00:17 “Well, what will we change  this week?
00:20 Let’s throw the brotherhood  off guard a little bit.”
00:23 That would not be  faithful or discreet.
00:28 The fact is that,
00:30 although changes may seem  to be announced one after another,
00:33 the decision to put  the changes into effect
00:37 is often years in the making.
00:40 Now, one of the first big changes
00:44 that the current Governing Body  had to grapple with
00:47 had to do with this,
00:49 Is it feasible
00:51 to have a Branch Committee serving
00:54 in the United States?
00:56 Now, for years the thought was  that we really couldn’t have
01:00 a Branch Committee  functioning in the United States
01:02 because the States was host
01:05 to the Governing Body  and the world headquarters.
01:09 So this was going to be  a big decision,
01:13 and it wasn’t taken overnight.
01:16 A lot of consultation
01:18 with mature,  experienced brothers was necessary.
01:22 But finally the decision was made,
01:24 and we believe that decision  has had Jehovah’s rich blessing.
01:28 We’re proud  of our hard-working Branch Committee,
01:33 and we’re happy  to have their support.
01:35 We need their support.
01:38 Now let’s consider  a couple of other examples.
01:42 Beginning in the first week  of January 2009,
01:45 the School, Service Meeting,
01:47 and the Congregation Book Study  were merged.
01:50 Now that decision
01:52 was almost ten years  in the making.
01:56 As far back as 1999,  it was being discussed.
02:01 Well, then, why wasn’t the decision  made ten years earlier?
02:05 Because the Governing Body  wanted to be sure.
02:08 Will the brothers  have what they need?
02:10 Will they have  all of the spiritual food they need
02:13 if we merge the meetings?
02:16 Now then one Wednesday
02:17 —I think it was  about three-thirty in the afternoon—
02:19 we’d had a long meeting.
02:22 We received two letters  from large branches.
02:26 And one of the branches said  that they had many large congregations
02:31 with seven or eight book studies,
02:33 but with only one elder  and one ministerial servant.
02:36 So the elder might conduct  five book studies,
02:39 and the ministerial servant  might conduct three,
02:41 and then they had all of the parts  on the meetings to prepare.
02:44 So all they were doing with their time  was conducting book studies
02:48 and preparing parts  for the meetings.
02:51 It was hard!
02:53 And then the same week we received  a letter from another branch,
02:56 and they explained why the attendance  at the book study was so low.
03:00 They explained that the publishers  loved the meetings
03:03 —all of the meetings— including the book study.
03:06 But they’re very poor,  and they couldn’t afford the bus fare
03:11 to attend two midweek meetings;  they had to choose.
03:15 And if they attended  the School and Service Meeting,
03:18 they could get almost two hours  of spiritual direction,
03:21 whereas with the book study,  they would get one.
03:25 So most of the time  it was the School
03:27 and Service Meeting  that won out.
03:30 Well, those two letters
03:33 put a real face  on the situation,
03:36 and it helped us  to make the decision.
03:39 Now, in 2008,
03:41 a public edition  and a study edition
03:44 of The Watchtower  began to be published.
03:47 That decision was  a long time coming.
03:51 We discussed the possibility off and on,  but we always said,
03:55 “Let’s not be hasty;  let’s wait a little bit.
03:57 Let’s see what Jehovah wants.”
03:59 The main thing was,  What would Jehovah want?
04:03 And how would we know?
04:05 We decided to make  a sort of fleece test.
04:09 And so in 2006,
04:11 we began publishing  one Awake! a month,
04:14 but we kept publishing  two Watchtowers.
04:16 So that would be three magazines  per month, instead of four.
04:20 And the rationale was,  “We’ll try it for a year,
04:23 “and if at the end of a year
04:25 “our magazine placements  have plummeted,
04:28 “we’ll know that Jehovah  is not backing this arrangement.
04:31 We can go back to producing  two Awakes! a year.”
04:34 Well, what was the result?
04:36 At the end of the year,
04:38 we were placing  as many magazines at three per month
04:42 as we had been placing  at four per month the year before.
04:47 So that indicated to us
04:49 that Jehovah  was backing the arrangement.
04:51 And how many  of us have appreciated
04:53 having a study edition  of The Watchtower
04:55 that speaks directly  to the brotherhood
04:58 and then a public edition  of The Watchtower
05:00 that can be tailored  a little bit more
05:02 to the needs of the public.
05:05 Now, before making  any decision
05:08 that affects  the Kingdom work,
05:10 the Governing Body  has to carefully consider
05:13 the spiritual implications.
05:15 As an example,  in 2008,
05:18 the decision was made to reduce  the length of public talks
05:22 from 45 minutes  to 30 minutes.
05:25 Well you say, ‘How could  that decision possibly affect
05:29 the spirituality  of the brotherhood?’
05:32 And if you’re serving  in an urban congregation with many elders
05:36 and nearby there are other  urban congregations with many elders,
05:40 perhaps you’d have difficulty  in understanding the reasoning.
05:43 But the Governing Body  has to look at the whole picture.
05:47 Thousands of our brothers  have served where the need is great,
05:51 and they’ve learned  a foreign language.
05:53 And in many, many  of these congregations
05:55 the learners are the elders.
05:58 Some of the learners  have told us
06:00 that for every minute  of a public talk,
06:03 it has required one hour  of preparation.
06:07 So can you imagine:
45-minute public talk
06:10 —45 hours for some of them?
06:12 So the reduction in the length  of the public talks has actually meant
06:16 that these congregations  could have more public talks.
06:20 That’s not all.
06:22 There are thousands of elders
06:24 who are serving  in isolated congregations
06:26 that may be 100 miles or more  from the next congregation.
06:29 So in one congregation  you have one elder,
06:32 and then 100 miles away you have  another congregation with one elder.
06:36 How many public talks  were those brothers getting
06:39 when there were
45-minute public talks?
06:41 The 15-minute reduction  made a difference.
06:45 So if we take a narrow view
06:47 and think only about our own situation  and our own congregation,
06:51 well, we can have difficulty  in understanding
06:54 why certain decisions are made.
06:57 Now the same principles  apply to clarifications in our beliefs.
07:01 The Governing Body loves  to get together and discuss the Bible.
07:05 And when those Bibles  come out on the table
07:07 and when the brothers  bring their research in
07:09 and they’re starting to search  the Scriptures and analyze the Scriptures,
07:13 you see the happy smiles  on their faces.
07:15 The brothers love  discussing spiritual things.
07:19 But the clarifications
07:23 are often a long time  in coming into print.
07:26 Why?
07:28 Because the clarification  on one scripture
07:30 can have  a domino effect on others.
07:32 The clarification  on one scripture
07:35 can have ramifications  on other prophecies,
07:37 so we have to be absolutely sure  that everything fits.
07:42 So to reiterate,
07:44 although certain changes  may be announced one after another,
07:48 these decisions  are thought out very carefully.
07:52 And here’s  an interesting side point:
07:54 The older members  of the Governing Body
07:57 —Brother Jaracz, Brother Barr—
07:59 were just as interested  in making the adjustments
08:02 as the younger members were.
08:05 They were very progressive.

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s much for us

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:03.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to think about in these words

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.689 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Proverbs 12:18.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.691 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And all of us, we like to think

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of ourselves as wise.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But we all know that from time to time

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:14.931 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we still stab our brothers and sisters

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our speech—thoughtless speech.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we all know
that we need to watch our speech

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—say things that are positive or upbuilding.

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t it true that sometimes
we may find that we have ourselves

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:28.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a negative thinking pattern

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:32.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we cannot get out of and that exhibits
itself in our speech?

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can help us?

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you notice our theme scripture
at Proverbs 12:18 says,

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The tongue of a wise person is a healing.’

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us to be wise?

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us
to have healing and positive speech?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider
three things this morning.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:54.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is:
Wise persons maintain perspective.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:59.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes we may find
that our speech is negative or cutting

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:01.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re frustrated.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But yet stepping back and looking
at things from a broader perspective,

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:10.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times can help us to be wise
—to control our tongue.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this context,
many times I think about Job.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look at Job’s words,

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:19.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find that he really said
some hurtful things.

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 40:2,
Jehovah calls Job a “faultfinder.”

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job was finding fault with Jehovah.

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, from Job’s perspective,
an injustice was being done.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, turn, if you will, to Job chapter 9,

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just notice some of the things
that Job says about Jehovah.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 9:15-18, just skimming through there,

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:43.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice in verse 15, he says:

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if I were in the right,
I would not answer him.”

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 18:
‘If I call out to him, will he answer me?

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not believe
he’ll even listen to my voice.’

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 17:
“He crushes me with a storm.”

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 18:
“He does not let me catch my breath.”

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verses 34 and 35;
Job says of Jehovah:

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:07.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If he would [just] stop beating me . . . ,
then I would speak to him unafraid.”

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, these words are stabs of a sword,
stinging criticism of Jehovah.

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what helped Job
to correct his thinking

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, therefore,
again to have positive speech?

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was perspective.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jehovah pulled him back
to see things from a different perspective.

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we think of the words there
and His questions in Job chapter 38,

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah said: ‘Well, Job,
let me ask you a few questions now.

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can you remind me again,

00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:36.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘where was it you were at when
I created the earth?

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t remember seeing you anywhere.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or, who commands the morning?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or, Job, let me ask you,
where does light come from?

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Ideas?
Ideas?

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t think so.’

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, what was Jehovah doing?

00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:52.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah was pulling Job back
to see things from a broader perspective.

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:55.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It allowed him to see his issues in context.

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result?

00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at Job 42:3, he said:
“I spoke without understanding.”

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:04.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 6, he said:
‘Can you just take back everything I said;

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just erase what I said.’

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the point is that meditating
on a broader perspective

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help us to have positive speech.

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we have to remember
that it’s not all about us.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world does not revolve around us.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are bigger issues at play,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that perspective can help us to be wise.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can help us to control our speech.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a second point
is that a wise person is humble.

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what a wise person will do.

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Proverbs 1:5.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 1:5 says: “A wise person listens

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:43.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and takes in more instruction.”

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it takes humility to listen.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we contrast that with Proverbs 18:2.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 18:2 says: “A stupid person
takes no pleasure in understanding;

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would rather disclose
what is in his heart.”

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, a stupid person,
he doesn’t have time to listen.

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:05.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He already knows what the story
is and therefore speaks accordingly.

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, am I a wise or a stupid person?

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:11.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, see, humility will help us to realize

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:14.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not always have the whole story;

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t always have all the facts.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we listen
and we get a full perspective,

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times that changes our thinking.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many times has that happened to you?

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s happened to me.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That once we step back
and we hear the whole story,

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realize we didn’t know
what we were talking about.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:32.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t speaking out of wisdom,
but rather out of ignorance.

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And see, that realization and that humility
will then help us do what it says

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at Proverbs 17:27.

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what a wise person does.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A man of knowledge restrains his words,

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:45.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a discerning man will remain calm.”

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the point is:
Humility can help us to be wise.

00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humble people listen to others,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
therefore realizing
that they don’t have all the facts.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that helps us to restrain our words, 
to remain calm, and to be wise.

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our third point is
that a wise person is realistic.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have to be careful
that we do not overthink things at times.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in this organization we have

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:15.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just absolutely brilliant
brothers and sisters.

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:19.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you can look at a situation
and see how to straighten it out

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:22.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it faster, smoother,
better, more efficient.

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:24.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is a gift,

00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:27.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to be careful
that we do not overthink things.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, sometimes we may look
at something and say,

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, you know, that is the most ridiculous
process I’ve ever seen in my life.’

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:34.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know what?
Maybe it is.

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we cannot optimize everything.

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:41.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll only end up frustrating ourselves,
which will cause us to be cynical,

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:44.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which ends up coming out in our speech.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I find the book of Ecclesiastes
of much benefit,

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it carries realistic thinking.

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Ecclesiastes 2:15.

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 2:15 says:
“Then I said in my heart:

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“ ‘What happens to the stupid one
will also happen to me.’

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What, then, did I gain
by becoming excessively wise? . . .

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This too is futility.’ ’’

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we may have a better solution.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
Share it.

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share it with our oversight—be wise.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Solomon is reminding us,
‘Do not be “excessively wise.” ’

00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:21.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not become so fixated
on it that we start to become bitter,

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:24.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which comes out in our speech.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve heard before,
we cannot expect perfection

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:31.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from an imperfect process
where imperfect people are involved.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:35.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we expect that, we’ll only end up
frustrating ourselves and others.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also remember that anyone
can complain about an imperfect process.

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s easy to do; all of us can do that.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the real gem of a person

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the one that can be used
 the most by Jehovah—

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:50.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the one who can take
an imperfect process and make it work.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, along that line, we may think of Jesus.

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have spent his last
three and a half years of life here on earth

00:06:56.632 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
complaining to Jehovah, couldn’t he?

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, he could have complained
about the imperfect men

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had to work with.

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:04.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have complained about the failed

00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:06.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
religious structure that was in place.

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have complained that he
didn’t even have a decent place to live.

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why, foxes and birds live better than I do.’

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have complained about the flaws

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the temple arrangement and the synagogue.

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:19.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things that Jesus
could have complained about,

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could have become bitter.

00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:23.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would have reflected
itself in his speech.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t do that.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jesus is a beautiful example
of taking an imperfect process

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still making it a success
—making it work.

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, therefore,
this helped him to be positive,

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this helped him to speak
in a way that others said:

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:42.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Never has another man spoken like this.”

00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:46.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the point is that perspective,

00:07:46.315 --> 00:07:48.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humility, and being realistic

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this can help us to be wise

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this can help us
to have healing and positive speech

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our dear brothers and sisters
that we work with and we live with.

00:00 Now, this word picture
00:02 of someone being stumbled
00:05 is quite vivid, isn’t it?
00:07 We’ve all seen someone stumbled.
00:09 In fact, we’ve all stumbled  ourselves at times,
00:12 and there are varying degrees  of consequences.
00:16 For example,  a person can stumble,
00:19 quickly recover,
00:21 and continue  almost uneventfully down the path.
00:24 Or a person can stumble,
00:27 fall, break a bone,
00:29 eventually they recover
00:32 —but only after extensive therapy.
00:34 Then again, a person can stumble,
00:37 fall, hit his head,  never recover
00:40 —becoming a casualty.
00:43 Well, the situation is similar
00:46 when one is stumbled spiritually.
00:48 He can recover quickly,
00:51 maybe recover over time,
00:53 or he may never recover
00:55 —becoming a spiritual casualty.
00:58 So we cannot know  the ultimate outcome
01:02 for someone who is stumbled.
01:04 So no wonder we’re cautioned  to be very careful
01:07 to never be any cause  for stumbling.
01:11 Open up  to Matthew chapter 18,
01:13 and here’s  an especially powerful scripture
01:17 in this regard.
01:19 Matthew 18:6, Jesus says:
01:21 “But whoever stumbles  one of these little ones
01:24 “who have faith in me,
01:27 “it would be better for him  to have hung around his neck
01:30 “a millstone  that is turned by a donkey
01:33 and to be sunk in the open sea.”
01:37 Well, with graphic language,
01:41 Jesus describes  how that if we cause someone
01:44 to become a spiritual casualty,
01:47 we could actually bring  eternal doom
01:49 upon ourselves.
01:51 But now, here’s a question,
01:53 What could we do  to cause someone to stumble?
01:56 Well, interestingly,  there are several similarities
02:00 between causing someone  to stumble physically
02:02 and causing someone  to stumble spiritually.
02:05 Let us discuss three.
02:07 Now one, pushing someone
02:11 could cause them to stumble,
02:13 especially if they’re on uneven terrain,  if you think about it.
02:17 And this is true  physically and spiritually.
02:21 But think about Jehovah  for a moment.
02:23 He could push any of us,  couldn’t he?
02:26 He could force us to serve him.
02:28 He certainly has the power,  but he never uses it that way.
02:32 Instead, he invites, he encourages;
02:35 and he explains the blessings,
02:37 the curses,  depending upon how we decide.
02:40 But it’s up to us, isn’t it?
02:41 For example, at Isaiah 48:18,
02:45 Jehovah says: ‘If only
02:48 ‘you would pay attention  to my commandments!
02:51 ‘Then your peace  would become like a river
02:55 and your righteousness  like the waves of the sea.’
02:59 Beseeching, but not forcing.
03:02 Now think about it,  if Jehovah doesn’t force,
03:04 he doesn’t want us  to force either, does he?
03:07 For example, parents
03:09 need to be very careful  they don’t just simply push
03:12 their children to serve Jehovah.
03:14 But rather, lovingly,
03:16 beseechingly like Jehovah,
03:18 try to reach the heart,  and of course,
03:20 clearly show them the blessings
03:22 that will come their way  if they do.
03:24 Another example,
03:26 elders should never try  to push Jehovah’s sheep.
03:30 I heard an experience  about an elder, during his part,
03:33 asked the brothers  for a show of hands
03:36 how many were going out in service  the next morning.
03:39 Well, only a few raised their hand.
03:41 He proceeded  to scold the congregation
03:44 that more should be going out.
03:47 Well, he then unwisely asked
03:49 for another show of hands.
03:51 You guessed it —fewer raised their hand
03:54 the second time.
03:56 Take another example,
03:58 those who conduct Bible studies
04:01 should not just try to push  their students to do the right thing.
04:04 “You’ve got to quit smoking!  You’ve got to get rid of those idols!”
04:08 No, not with external pressure,
04:10 but by motivating their hearts,
04:13 you motivate your students.
04:15 Or take another example,  none of us
04:18 should try to push schoolmates,  workmates, or relatives
04:21 to accept the truth.
04:23 A pushing approach,
04:26 shoving approach —even though motivated with sincerity—
04:30 has actually resulted  in people being stumbled
04:32 away from the truth  for many years.
04:34 It makes me think of the story,  or the saying,
04:37 that when a person  first learns the truth,
04:40 you should lock them up  for about six months
04:43 to contain, or minimize,  the damage they do.
04:46 Well, that saying is totally erroneous.
04:48 You shouldn’t lock that brother up;  you should follow that brother.
04:53 See, that brother has zeal,  doesn’t he?
04:55 But it’s true,  we probably do need to help him
04:57 to properly channel that zeal,
04:59 so that he doesn’t try  to force his relatives
05:03 or others to accept the truth
05:05 that he is so excited about.
05:08 But now, what is the second thing
05:11 we can do to cause someone  to stumble?
05:14 Placing an obstacle in their path.
05:18 Now again, this is true  physically or spiritually.
05:22 And if you think about it,
05:24 whether we put  that stumbling block there intentionally
05:28 or unintentionally,  the result is the same, isn’t it?
05:32 As mentioned  in today’s Watchtower comments,
05:34 wholesome speech and upright conduct
05:37 can help us to avoid
05:39 ever being a cause for stumbling.
05:42 In contrast, unwholesome speech,
05:44 unclean conduct,
05:46 can easily stumble ones inside
05:48 or outside the congregation.
05:50 But now, what about in an area
05:53 where we have a Scriptural right  to do something?
05:56 Now, surely exercising that right,
05:59 if it stumbles someone,
06:01 we can’t be held accountable  for that, can we?
06:03 Well, open up  to 1 Corinthians chapter 8,
06:06 and here —very interestingly—
06:10 this scripture  answers that question.
06:12 1 Corinthians 8:9,
06:16 it says:  “But keep watching
06:18 “that your right to choose
06:22 “does not somehow
06:24 become a stumbling block  to those who are weak.”
06:27 Isn’t that interesting?
06:29 Even our right to choose,
06:31 if it would stumble someone,
06:33 we wouldn’t exercise that right  according to this scripture.
06:36 The apostle Paul,  in verse 13 of that same chapter,
06:40 he said he  wouldn’t even eat meat ever again
06:43 if it stumbled his brother.
06:45 Well, like Paul,  are we willing
06:47 to forgo our rights regarding,
06:50 for example,  wearing a beard,
06:52 wearing heavy makeup,
06:54 using alcohol —as just a few examples—
06:58 if exercising that right
07:00 might even possibly stumble someone?
07:03 But now,  what’s the third way
07:05 we could cause someone to stumble?
07:08 Failing to warn him
07:10 about a potential trip hazard.
07:13 We could call this  the sin of omission.
07:16 And again,  it applies physically and spiritually.
07:19 As a physical example,  let’s say we see the floor
07:22 has just been mopped,
07:24 and an unsuspecting person
07:27 is approaching that wet area.
07:30 Now will we warn them?
07:32 If we don’t warn them —they fall, hurt themselves—
07:35 would we not share  some responsibility?
07:38 Well, similarly,
07:40 with spiritual application,
07:42 Galatians 6:1 tells us
07:46 that if someone “takes a false step”  before he’s aware of it,
07:49 what are we supposed  to try to do?
07:51 “Try to readjust” such a person,
07:54 but then it adds:  “In a spirit of mildness.”
07:56 Don’t push him!
07:58 But try to gently, lovingly warn
08:02 and readjust that person.
08:04 So there we have three areas
08:06 in which we must be careful  we never contribute
08:10 toward someone being stumbled.
08:12 We don’t push others  to serve Jehovah.
08:15 We strive to never,
08:18 even unintentionally,
08:20 put a stumbling block in their path —for example—
08:23 by insisting on exercising  our personal rights.
08:27 And number three,  we never fail to lovingly warn
08:31 one whom we see approaching
08:34 a potential trip hazard.
08:37 Rather than being  any cause for stumbling,
08:40 we want to be  a force for good, don’t we?
08:43 Helping others to stand firm
08:45 and even helping ones get up
08:48 if they have fallen.

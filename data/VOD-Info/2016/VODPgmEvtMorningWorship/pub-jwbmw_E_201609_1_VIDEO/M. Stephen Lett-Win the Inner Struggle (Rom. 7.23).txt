00:01 As has been mentioned  in our scripture for today,
00:04 the apostle Paul talks
00:07 about this inner struggle
00:09 —this inner war, really—
00:11 that is going on  inside every one of us.
00:14 It’s the war
00:16 between God’s law in our mind
00:19 and sin’s law in our flesh.
00:22 And it’s interesting,  the expression “law”
00:25 in both cases  is appropriate because a law
00:29 —the purpose— is to legislate action
00:31 or conduct.
00:33 And of course,  God’s law in our mind
00:35 is trying to legislate  that we act
00:38 according to Jehovah’s thinking.
00:40 But, of course,  sin’s law in our flesh
00:42 is trying to dictate
00:44 that we act  according to Satan’s thinking
00:47 —selfishly, fleshly.
00:49 And it is an intense war, see.
00:52 These two laws are warring,
00:55 trying to overpower each other
00:57 and dominate  and control how we act,
01:01 and only if we fight hard
01:03 will we win the war.
01:05 Now, the apostle Paul fought hard,  didn’t he?
01:08 It’s true he lost some battles  along the way,
01:11 but he won the war, didn’t he?
01:13 And he’s now  an immortal spirit creature
01:16 in the heavens.
01:18 So we want to imitate Paul.
01:20 But now,  what can help us win this war?
01:23 Well, let’s develop  an illustration that can help us
01:27 —hopefully appreciate what can help us— to win the war.
01:30 We want to illustrate  with two opposing armies.
01:34 And if we think about it,
01:36 that’s what we have inside of us, don’t we?
01:38 We have two opposing armies  fighting each other.
01:41 In effect, one is a good army;
01:43 one is a very bad army.
01:45 Now, what can we do  to help the good army,
01:48 God’s law in our mind,  to dominate
01:52 over the other army?
01:54 Well, let’s talk about two factors  that are involved:
01:57 one, food;
01:59 second, attitude.
02:01 Now, taking first, food.
02:03 If one army is well-fed
02:05 and the other is starved,
02:07 now, which one  do you think is going to win?
02:09 Well, the answer is obvious,  isn’t it?
02:11 It makes me think  of the saying that an army
02:13 marches on its stomach.
02:15 Well, how do we  feed the good army?
02:18 Jesus said in Matthew 4:4:  “Man must live,
02:21 “not on bread alone,  but on every word
02:24 that comes  from Jehovah’s mouth.”
02:27 First Peter 2:2  talks about the “milk of the word.”
02:30 Hebrews 5:14  talks about the “solid food,”
02:34 deeper truths of God’s Word.
02:36 Matthew 24:45, Jesus talks
02:39 about feeding his disciples  through the faithful slave.
02:43 So how do we  feed the good army?
02:45 Well, we consistently,  diligently consume
02:48 the spiritual food  and thereby keep
02:52 the law of God in our mind  well-nourished,
02:54 strong, and healthy.
02:57 But now,  how do we starve the bad army?
03:00 Well, for one thing,  we refuse to dwell
03:03 on the immoral thinking
03:05 that Satan’s world promotes.
03:08 We wouldn’t even think  of looking at pornography.
03:11 If we did that,
03:13 that would be  like feeding a steak dinner
03:15 to the bad army.
03:18 But even much more than that,  if an immoral thought
03:21 enters our mind,  we push it out.
03:23 We pray to Jehovah.
03:25 We get the Bible out;  start reading it; somehow we switch
03:28 our mind  onto something wholesome.
03:30 We do our best,  as brought out
03:32 at 2 Corinthians 10:5
03:35 to bring  “every thought into captivity”
03:38 and “to make it  obedient to the Christ.”
03:41 We also refuse  to feed our mind materialistic
03:44 and other worldly thinking  that Satan’s world promotes.
03:48 When we think about this matter
03:50 of feeding the good army,
03:52 starving the bad army,  it makes me think
03:54 of the old Cherokee Indian legend —you might have heard of this.
03:59 According to one reference book,
04:01 a grandfather was talking to his grandson,
04:03 and he talked  about how he had inside him
04:06 two wolves fighting intensely  with each other
04:10 —one, a very good wolf;  one, a very bad wolf.
04:12 The grandson naturally wanted to know,  “Well, which one is going to win?”
04:16 Well, the grandfather explained,  “The one I feed.”
04:20 And it’s really true of us.
04:22 But now, let’s get  the second factor—attitude.
04:26 If one army has a positive,  determined attitude
04:31 and the other has a hopeless,  demoralized attitude,
04:34 which one is likely to win?
04:36 Well, again,  the answer is pretty clear.
04:38 Well, how do we maintain  a positive, determined attitude
04:41 in the figurative good army  inside of us?
04:44 Open up  to 2 Corinthians chapter 4, please.
04:48 And here is a key factor:
04:50 No matter what trials,  tests, tribulations
04:53 come our way,  we don’t give up;
04:55 we don’t lose our hope;
04:57 we keep our eyes on the prize.
04:59 Now, notice how it’s expressed here,
2 Corinthians chapter 4
05:03 beginning in verse 16.
05:05 It says: “Therefore,
05:07 “we do not give up,
05:11 “but even if the man  we are outside
05:14 “is wasting away,
05:16 “certainly the man  we are inside
05:19 “is being renewed  from day to day.
05:22 “For though the tribulation  is momentary and light,
05:26 “it works out for us  a glory that is of more
05:30 “and more surpassing greatness  and is everlasting;
05:34 “while we keep our eyes,  not on the things seen,
05:37 “but on the things unseen.
05:39 “For the things seen  are temporary,
05:41 but the things unseen  are everlasting.”
05:45 And I really like  that thought that any trial,
05:47 no matter how intense it is,
05:49 is only momentary
05:52 and is only light,
05:54 relatively speaking.
05:56 It’s momentary when you think  of the comparison
05:59 of eternal blessings  in Jehovah’s new world.
06:01 It’s light compared  to the weightiness,
06:04 the greatness, of the blessings  of Jehovah’s new world.
06:08 Can you imagine  being able to trade
06:11 a moment of pain
06:13 for an eternity of pleasure?
06:15 An ounce of misery
06:17 for tons of happiness?
06:19 And if you think about it, we’re able to make that exchange,
06:21 see, if we don’t give up,  no matter what trial comes our way.
06:25 But now, how do we infuse
06:28 a hopeless,  demoralized attitude
06:32 into the bad army,  sin’s law in our flesh?
06:36 Well, for one thing,  we always remember
06:39 that if we were  to give in to sin’s law
06:42 and pursue a life of sin —and that’s just a terrible thought
06:45 to even think about,  but if we did that
06:47 —it would be a lose-lose proposition,  wouldn’t it?
06:51 In fact,  we would lose big time now,
06:54 reaping the horrible consequences
06:57 —physically, mentally, emotionally— of sin.
07:01 We would lose even bigger in the future,  totally missing out
07:04 on what Jehovah has in store  for those who love him.
07:07 So we remember that.
07:09 And we remember scriptures  such as Psalm 37:38:
07:13 “All the transgressors  will be destroyed;
07:16 the future of wicked people  will be cut off,” see.
07:20 We remember that Satan  and his followers
07:24 are headed for the lake of fire,  and we don’t want to join them.
07:28 See, our destination  is the new world, isn’t it?
07:30 Not the lake of fire.
07:32 So we  don’t even slightly envy
07:35 the wicked, unlike Asaph.
07:37 At one point in his life,  he began to envy them.
07:40 We don’t envy them.  We feel sorry for them, don’t we?
07:42 We certainly infuse
07:45 this hopeless attitude
07:47 into the bad army  that to pursue a course of sin
07:51 would be very foolish.
07:53 Well, there we have  two factors involved:
07:56 food and attitude.
07:58 Now if we had time,  we could discuss training,
08:01 equipment.
08:03 But we’re going  to leave that for you.
08:05 You can do that in your family worship,  your personal study.
08:08 And I think you’ll find it interesting  if you pursue, just like we did
08:10 with food and attitude,  equipment and training.
08:14 But the point is,  as long as we have this inner struggle
08:18 inside us, it’s really good.
08:20 It means we haven’t lost.  See, we’re still fighting.
08:24 And even though we lose  a battle or two along the way,
08:28 we’ll win the war if:  We don’t give up; we don’t lose hope;
08:31 we don’t surrender.
08:33 So don’t ever put up the white flag.
08:36 Don’t ever call a truce.
08:38 Continue to fight
08:40 until that wonderful day
08:42 when that inner struggle  will be gone.
08:44 We’ll be perfect,  and God’s law
08:47 in our mind  will completely dominate.
08:49 And like Jehovah and Jesus,
08:51 just naturally,  our natural inclination
08:55 will be to do what is right.
08:57 But until then, let us fight
08:59 with all our might.

00:01.017 --> 00:04.854
As has been mentioned 
in our scripture for today, 


00:04.853 --> 00:07.056
the apostle Paul talks 


00:07.057 --> 00:09.059
about this inner struggle


00:09.058 --> 00:11.060
—this inner war, really—


00:11.060 --> 00:14.863
that is going on 
inside every one of us. 


00:14.863 --> 00:16.866
It’s the war 


00:16.867 --> 00:19.535
between God’s law in our mind 


00:19.535 --> 00:22.605
and sin’s law in our flesh. 


00:22.605 --> 00:25.342
And it’s interesting, 
the expression “law” 


00:25.342 --> 00:29.212
in both cases 
is appropriate because a law


00:29.212 --> 00:31.547
—the purpose—
is to legislate action 


00:31.547 --> 00:33.550
or conduct. 


00:33.550 --> 00:35.885
And of course, 
God’s law in our mind 


00:35.885 --> 00:38.220
is trying to legislate 
that we act 


00:38.220 --> 00:40.223
according to Jehovah’s thinking. 


00:40.223 --> 00:42.358
But, of course, 
sin’s law in our flesh 


00:42.358 --> 00:44.360
is trying to dictate 


00:44.360 --> 00:47.163
that we act 
according to Satan’s thinking


00:47.163 --> 00:49.698
—selfishly, fleshly. 


00:49.698 --> 00:52.635
And it is an intense war, see. 


00:52.635 --> 00:55.238
These two laws are warring, 


00:55.238 --> 00:57.773
trying to overpower each other 


00:57.773 --> 01:01.576
and dominate 
and control how we act, 


01:01.577 --> 01:03.714
and only if we fight hard 


01:03.713 --> 01:05.748
will we win the war.


01:05.748 --> 01:08.016
Now, the apostle Paul fought hard, 
didn’t he? 


01:08.017 --> 01:11.154
It’s true he lost some battles 
along the way, 


01:11.153 --> 01:13.221
but he won the war, didn’t he? 


01:13.222 --> 01:16.492
And he’s now 
an immortal spirit creature 


01:16.492 --> 01:18.160
in the heavens. 


01:18.160 --> 01:20.697
So we want to imitate Paul. 


01:20.697 --> 01:23.834
But now, 
what can help us win this war?


01:23.833 --> 01:27.636
Well, let’s develop 
an illustration that can help us


01:27.637 --> 01:30.307
—hopefully appreciate what can help us—
to win the war. 


01:30.307 --> 01:34.044
We want to illustrate 
with two opposing armies. 


01:34.043 --> 01:36.045
And if we think about it, 


01:36.045 --> 01:38.047
that’s what we have
inside of us, don’t we?


01:38.047 --> 01:41.517
We have two opposing armies 
fighting each other. 


01:41.517 --> 01:43.654
In effect, one is a good army; 


01:43.653 --> 01:45.788
one is a very bad army. 


01:45.788 --> 01:48.991
Now, what can we do 
to help the good army, 


01:48.992 --> 01:52.129
God’s law in our mind, 
to dominate 


01:52.128 --> 01:54.263
over the other army? 


01:54.263 --> 01:57.133
Well, let’s talk about two factors 
that are involved: 


01:57.133 --> 01:59.168
one, food; 


01:59.168 --> 02:01.203
second, attitude. 


02:01.203 --> 02:03.205
Now, taking first, food. 


02:03.205 --> 02:05.675
If one army is well-fed 


02:05.675 --> 02:07.743
and the other is starved, 


02:07.743 --> 02:09.745
now, which one 
do you think is going to win? 


02:09.745 --> 02:11.413
Well, the answer is obvious, 
isn’t it? 


02:11.413 --> 02:13.550
It makes me think 
of the saying that an army 


02:13.550 --> 02:15.818
marches on its stomach. 


02:15.818 --> 02:18.420
Well, how do we 
feed the good army? 


02:18.420 --> 02:21.690
Jesus said in Matthew 4:4: 
“Man must live, 


02:21.690 --> 02:24.427
“not on bread alone, 
but on every word 


02:24.427 --> 02:27.164
that comes 
from Jehovah’s mouth.”


02:27.163 --> 02:30.766
First Peter 2:2 
talks about the “milk of the word.”


02:30.767 --> 02:34.104
Hebrews 5:14 
talks about the “solid food,” 


02:34.103 --> 02:36.973
deeper truths of God’s Word.


02:36.973 --> 02:39.775
Matthew 24:45, Jesus talks 


02:39.775 --> 02:43.713
about feeding his disciples 
through the faithful slave.


02:43.713 --> 02:45.848
So how do we 
feed the good army? 


02:45.848 --> 02:48.985
Well, we consistently, 
diligently consume 


02:48.985 --> 02:52.188
the spiritual food 
and thereby keep 


02:52.188 --> 02:54.923
the law of God in our mind 
well-nourished, 


02:54.923 --> 02:57.293
strong, and healthy.


02:57.293 --> 03:00.363
But now, 
how do we starve the bad army? 


03:00.363 --> 03:03.231
Well, for one thing, 
we refuse to dwell 


03:03.232 --> 03:05.369
on the immoral thinking 


03:05.368 --> 03:08.103
that Satan’s world promotes. 


03:08.103 --> 03:11.240
We wouldn’t even think 
of looking at pornography. 


03:11.240 --> 03:13.242
If we did that, 


03:13.242 --> 03:15.712
that would be 
like feeding a steak dinner 


03:15.712 --> 03:18.147
to the bad army. 


03:18.147 --> 03:21.417
But even much more than that, 
if an immoral thought 


03:21.417 --> 03:23.754
enters our mind, 
we push it out. 


03:23.753 --> 03:25.555
We pray to Jehovah. 


03:25.555 --> 03:28.390
We get the Bible out; 
start reading it; somehow we switch 


03:28.390 --> 03:30.660
our mind 
onto something wholesome. 


03:30.660 --> 03:32.795
We do our best, 
as brought out 


03:32.795 --> 03:35.063
at 2 Corinthians 10:5 


03:35.063 --> 03:38.200
to bring 
“every thought into captivity” 


03:38.200 --> 03:41.537
and “to make it 
obedient to the Christ.”


03:41.537 --> 03:44.807
We also refuse 
to feed our mind materialistic 


03:44.807 --> 03:48.210
and other worldly thinking 
that Satan’s world promotes. 


03:48.210 --> 03:50.212
When we think about this matter 


03:50.212 --> 03:52.749
of feeding the good army, 


03:52.748 --> 03:54.750
starving the bad army, 
it makes me think 


03:54.750 --> 03:59.222
of the old Cherokee Indian legend
—you might have heard of this. 


03:59.222 --> 04:01.224
According to one reference book, 


04:01.223 --> 04:03.626
a grandfather was talking
to his grandson, 


04:03.627 --> 04:06.429
and he talked 
about how he had inside him 


04:06.428 --> 04:10.300
two wolves fighting intensely 
with each other


04:10.300 --> 04:12.835
—one, a very good wolf; 
one, a very bad wolf. 


04:12.835 --> 04:16.405
The grandson naturally wanted to know, 
“Well, which one is going to win?” 


04:16.405 --> 04:20.142
Well, the grandfather explained, 
“The one I feed.” 


04:20.142 --> 04:22.479
And it’s really true of us.


04:22.478 --> 04:26.748
But now, let’s get 
the second factor—attitude. 


04:26.748 --> 04:31.086
If one army has a positive, 
determined attitude 


04:31.087 --> 04:34.490
and the other has a hopeless, 
demoralized attitude, 


04:34.490 --> 04:36.492
which one is likely to win? 


04:36.492 --> 04:38.494
Well, again, 
the answer is pretty clear. 


04:38.493 --> 04:41.563
Well, how do we maintain 
a positive, determined attitude 


04:41.563 --> 04:44.633
in the figurative good army 
inside of us?


04:44.633 --> 04:48.036
Open up 
to 2 Corinthians chapter 4, please. 


04:48.037 --> 04:50.407
And here is a key factor: 


04:50.407 --> 04:53.175
No matter what trials, 
tests, tribulations 


04:53.175 --> 04:55.512
come our way, 
we don’t give up; 


04:55.512 --> 04:57.514
we don’t lose our hope; 


04:57.513 --> 04:59.715
we keep our eyes on the prize. 


04:59.715 --> 05:03.585
Now, notice how it’s expressed here, 
2 Corinthians chapter 4 


05:03.585 --> 05:05.788
beginning in verse 16. 


05:05.788 --> 05:07.856
It says: “Therefore, 


05:07.857 --> 05:11.360
“we do not give up, 


05:11.360 --> 05:14.697
“but even if the man 
we are outside 


05:14.697 --> 05:16.699
“is wasting away, 


05:16.698 --> 05:19.435
“certainly the man 
we are inside 


05:19.435 --> 05:22.238
“is being renewed 
from day to day. 


05:22.238 --> 05:26.408
“For though the tribulation 
is momentary and light, 


05:26.408 --> 05:30.346
“it works out for us 
a glory that is of more 


05:30.347 --> 05:34.284
“and more surpassing greatness 
and is everlasting; 


05:34.283 --> 05:37.220
“while we keep our eyes, 
not on the things seen, 


05:37.220 --> 05:39.222
“but on the things unseen. 


05:39.222 --> 05:41.557
“For the things seen 
are temporary, 


05:41.557 --> 05:45.027
but the things unseen 
are everlasting.”


05:45.027 --> 05:47.997
And I really like 
that thought that any trial, 


05:47.997 --> 05:49.999
no matter how intense it is, 


05:49.998 --> 05:52.201
is only momentary 


05:52.202 --> 05:54.204
and is only light, 


05:54.203 --> 05:56.205
relatively speaking. 


05:56.205 --> 05:59.208
It’s momentary when you think 
of the comparison 


05:59.208 --> 06:01.810
of eternal blessings 
in Jehovah’s new world. 


06:01.810 --> 06:04.813
It’s light compared 
to the weightiness, 


06:04.813 --> 06:08.350
the greatness, of the blessings 
of Jehovah’s new world. 


06:08.350 --> 06:11.153
Can you imagine 
being able to trade 


06:11.153 --> 06:13.155
a moment of pain 


06:13.155 --> 06:15.223
for an eternity of pleasure? 


06:15.223 --> 06:17.426
An ounce of misery 


06:17.427 --> 06:19.429
for tons of happiness? 


06:19.428 --> 06:21.830
And if you think about it,
we’re able to make that exchange, 


06:21.830 --> 06:25.602
see, if we don’t give up, 
no matter what trial comes our way.


06:25.602 --> 06:28.470
But now, how do we infuse 


06:28.470 --> 06:32.408
a hopeless, 
demoralized attitude 


06:32.408 --> 06:36.311
into the bad army, 
sin’s law in our flesh? 


06:36.312 --> 06:39.549
Well, for one thing, 
we always remember 


06:39.548 --> 06:42.851
that if we were 
to give in to sin’s law 


06:42.852 --> 06:45.722
and pursue a life of sin
—and that’s just a terrible thought 


06:45.722 --> 06:47.724
to even think about, 
but if we did that


06:47.723 --> 06:51.726
—it would be a lose-lose proposition, 
wouldn’t it? 


06:51.727 --> 06:54.430
In fact, 
we would lose big time now, 


06:54.430 --> 06:57.433
reaping the horrible consequences


06:57.433 --> 07:01.170
—physically, mentally, emotionally—
of sin. 


07:01.170 --> 07:04.773
We would lose even bigger in the future, 
totally missing out 


07:04.773 --> 07:07.976
on what Jehovah has in store 
for those who love him. 


07:07.977 --> 07:09.579
So we remember that. 


07:09.578 --> 07:13.248
And we remember scriptures 
such as Psalm 37:38: 


07:13.248 --> 07:16.451
“All the transgressors 
will be destroyed; 


07:16.452 --> 07:20.824
the future of wicked people 
will be cut off,” see.


07:20.823 --> 07:24.693
We remember that Satan 
and his followers 


07:24.693 --> 07:28.496
are headed for the lake of fire, 
and we don’t want to join them. 


07:28.497 --> 07:30.700
See, our destination 
is the new world, isn’t it?


07:30.700 --> 07:32.368
Not the lake of fire. 


07:32.368 --> 07:35.705
So we 
don’t even slightly envy 


07:35.705 --> 07:37.873
the wicked, unlike Asaph. 


07:37.873 --> 07:40.341
At one point in his life, 
he began to envy them. 


07:40.342 --> 07:42.945
We don’t envy them. 
We feel sorry for them, don’t we? 


07:42.945 --> 07:45.615
We certainly infuse 


07:45.615 --> 07:47.683
this hopeless attitude 


07:47.683 --> 07:51.353
into the bad army 
that to pursue a course of sin 


07:51.353 --> 07:53.555
would be very foolish. 


07:53.555 --> 07:56.425
Well, there we have 
two factors involved: 


07:56.425 --> 07:58.427
food and attitude.


07:58.427 --> 08:01.297
Now if we had time, 
we could discuss training, 


08:01.297 --> 08:03.299
equipment. 


08:03.298 --> 08:05.300
But we’re going 
to leave that for you. 


08:05.300 --> 08:08.303
You can do that in your family worship, 
your personal study. 


08:08.303 --> 08:10.506
And I think you’ll find it interesting 
if you pursue, just like we did 


08:10.507 --> 08:14.310
with food and attitude, 
equipment and training. 


08:14.310 --> 08:18.447
But the point is, 
as long as we have this inner struggle 


08:18.447 --> 08:20.917
inside us, it’s really good. 


08:20.917 --> 08:24.554
It means we haven’t lost. 
See, we’re still fighting. 


08:24.553 --> 08:28.490
And even though we lose 
a battle or two along the way, 


08:28.490 --> 08:31.893
we’ll win the war if: 
We don’t give up; we don’t lose hope; 


08:31.893 --> 08:33.896
we don’t surrender. 


08:33.897 --> 08:36.099
So don’t ever put up the white flag. 


08:36.098 --> 08:38.433
Don’t ever call a truce. 


08:38.433 --> 08:40.435
Continue to fight 


08:40.435 --> 08:42.638
until that wonderful day 


08:42.638 --> 08:44.973
when that inner struggle 
will be gone. 


08:44.973 --> 08:47.543
We’ll be perfect, 
and God’s law 


08:47.543 --> 08:49.845
in our mind 
will completely dominate. 


08:49.845 --> 08:51.913
And like Jehovah and Jesus, 


08:51.913 --> 08:55.050
just naturally, 
our natural inclination 


08:55.050 --> 08:57.052
will be to do what is right. 


08:57.052 --> 08:59.855
But until then, let us fight 


08:59.855 --> 09:13.220
with all our might.

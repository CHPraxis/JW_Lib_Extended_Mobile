For many people, just to hear

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:04.487 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the word “slave”

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:06.690 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
leaves a bitter taste in their mouth.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.358 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They associate the word

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:09.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the following definition.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Listen carefully to it, please:

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:14.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“A human being who is owned as property

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by another
and is absolutely subject to his will,

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or a bond servant divested of all freedom

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:23.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and personal rights.”

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The word “slave” may bring to mind

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the trafficking in slaves,

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the buying
and selling of blacks for profit

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:35.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prior to the American Civil War.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that having been said,

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible’s use of the word “slave”

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:43.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not leave a bad taste in our mouths

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a sweet taste.

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:49.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we were bought
with the precious blood of another human

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a perfect one—
we all know to be Jesus.

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul told
the early Christians in Corinth:

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You do not belong to yourselves,

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:03.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you were bought with a price.”

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:07.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 24 elders too in Revelation 5:9

00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:09.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sing to Jesus, “the Lamb of God.”

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles, please, to this

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:14.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s the ninth verse

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fifth chapter

00:01:17.193 --> 00:01:19.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Revelation,

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it reads this way:

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they sing a new song, saying:

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You are worthy to take the scroll
and open its seals,

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you were slaughtered
and with your blood you bought people

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:44.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for God out of every tribe and tongue

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:47.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people and nation.’”

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s true.

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:53.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what has happened,
and we are all happy for that.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we all know that we are slaves of God.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have been bought and paid for.

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:01.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re happy slaves, aren’t we?

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:05.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work diligently to please our owners,
Jehovah and Jesus.

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Bethel is all about too.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work hard as slaves.

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be a slave of Jehovah
is a cherished privilege.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to be owned by God
—to belong to him—

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the best thing that could happen
to any one of us.

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:25.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is how
“the faithful and discreet slave” feels

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:29.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the feeding of the domestics
is accomplished each day.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:33.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you see members of the Governing Body
walking here and there

00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:36.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the various complexes here
in the United States

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from time to time.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every now and then, we’ll go up to Canada,

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go other places throughout the world,

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see a few of us walking around too.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some things that occupy

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:55.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the time of the faithful slave
and their attention?

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just jotted down a few things.

00:02:57.694 --> 00:02:59.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’m going to go through them very fast 

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we don’t have a lot of time,
but you just think about them:

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making decisions
that affect the lives of all sheep​

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—​publishers, auxiliary, regular,
special pioneers, missionaries,

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circuit overseers, Bethel family members​—​
all over the world;

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deciding whether new branch facilities

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are needed in various countries
throughout the world;

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deciding on the needs
in the field of computers,

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:26.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a field that just keeps growing and growing
with each passing week;

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking into legal fights
we’re having all over the world;

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deciding the best approach
to helping brothers and sisters

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been struck by natural disasters,

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much money can be allotted, and so forth;

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deciding on assembly
and convention program themes, 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dramas, broadcast programs, videos,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:03:50.046 --> 00:03:52.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involvement with all
the schools being taught,

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s no end to them;

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reading and checking and approving
all material that will be printed;

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

that will be used in our publications;

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:04:12.568 --> 00:04:17.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and, of course, that has
really been a jewel, and still is);

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
final approval
on all audio recordings of the Bible;

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:25.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and special conventions;

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
organizes branch dedications
and Assembly Hall dedications worldwide;

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:32.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involved with all teaching;
constantly looking to

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying to Jehovah for direction
in shepherding his sheep.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what has been said is probably only half

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:44.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is done
by “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is accomplished
is not by human effort alone,

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is by means of God’s holy spirit
and direction given by Jesus,

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the head of the congregation.

00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:58.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While all major decisions

00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approvals are made
by “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have 30 most qualified helpers

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and several other brothers

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:11.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who work hard in assisting us
to accomplish our responsibility

00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of feeding and caring for Jehovah’s sheep.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their work does not go unnoticed.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of us
may be viewed as “Iron Chefs,”

00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:24.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re not the only ones in the kitchen;
you better believe that.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:29.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The entire Bethel family helps as well.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:32.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hear you praying
in our behalf on a regular basis,

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thank you for your prayers.

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it any wonder that the apostle Paul

00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:41.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found admonishing sheep
to “be industrious,

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not lazy”?

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:45.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be aglow with the spirit,” he says,

00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:48.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he ends up by saying:
“Slave for Jehovah.”

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 12:11.

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By becoming loyally obedient slaves
of God and Jesus,

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:57.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become their friends.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at something here in our Bibles,
John 15:15.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads this way:
“I no longer call you slaves,

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because a slave does not know
what his master does.

00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I have called you friends,
because I have made known to you

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the things I have heard from my Father.”

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:19.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:21.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Jesus.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he does.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:27.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate it so much
—what he does for us.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those who follow Jesus,

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while slaves, are also his friends.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a blessing.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of a better position

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be in than being a friend of Jesus?

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:44.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have Jesus’ friendship,

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:47.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we automatically have
Jehovah’s friendship.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t let the word “slave”

00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:53.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put a bad taste in your mouth.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:55.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a sweet thing.

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:58.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s honey to the palate.

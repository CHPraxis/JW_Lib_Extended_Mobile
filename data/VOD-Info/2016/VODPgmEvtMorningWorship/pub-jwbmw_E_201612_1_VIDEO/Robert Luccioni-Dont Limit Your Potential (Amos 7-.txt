00:00 Our text today is very encouraging  as it reminds us,
00:03 through this example of Amos,
00:05 that Jehovah notices the potential
00:08 of each one of his servants.
00:10 In fact, one of the comments  from today’s text states:
00:13 “Even though we may  lack self-confidence,
00:16 “Jehovah can help us  go beyond our perceived limits
00:19 and reach goals that we  would not have imagined.”
00:23 See, Jehovah knows our potential.
00:26 But you note from that statement,
00:28 this is also a reminder  that we have to put forth effort
00:32 to reach our potential.
00:34 You see, if we’re not careful,  we can sabotage our own efforts
00:38 to reach the potential  that Jehovah sees in us.
00:41 How’s that possible?  Well, let’s look at three examples.
00:45 Number one:  We can limit potential
00:47 by not throwing ourselves  into what we are asked to do.
00:52 Now, we may remember  the account of Jehoash
00:54 the king of Israel  there in 2 Kings chapter 13,
00:58 when he visited  the prophet Elisha who was dying.
01:01 And you notice there  at 2 Kings 13:17
01:06 that Elisha  notes Jehoash’s potential.
01:09 You notice he says there  that: “You will
01:12 strike down Syria . . .  until you finish it off.”
01:16 See, he noted the potential
01:18 that he had to finish off Syria.
01:20 But then what happens?
01:22 Well, you remember that’s where  Elisha tells the king
01:26 to beat the arrows  on the ground three times or—
01:29 beat it on the ground,  and he only does it three times.
01:31 Notice what happens in verse 19:
01:34 “At that the man of the true God
01:36 “grew indignant at him and said:
01:38 “‘You should have struck the ground  five or six times!
01:42 “‘Then you  would have struck down Syria
01:44 “‘until you finished it off,
01:46 “‘but now  you will strike down Syria
01:48 only three times.’”
01:50 What happened?
01:52 Well, you see, by not throwing himself  into what he was asked to do
01:55 —showing zeal for his assignment—
01:57 he would only  have limited success.
02:00 Jehoash limited his own potential.
02:03 Number two:  We can limit our potential
02:06 by focusing on our inadequacies  or our insecurities.
02:10 The account that drives that home  for me is that of Moses.
02:14 If you look in Exodus chapter 3,
02:16 and in this account we know  it’s not due to lack of zeal,
02:20 but, rather,  Moses’ own insecurities
02:23 that nearly caused him to limit  how he was used by Jehovah.
02:27 So we know in Exodus chapter 3,
02:29 he received a very weighty assignment —going to Pharaoh.
02:32 And notice what happens  in verse 11,
02:35 Exodus 3:11.
02:37 It says: “However,  Moses said to the true God:
02:40 “‘Who am I that I  should go to Pharaoh
02:42 and bring the Israelites  out of Egypt?’”
02:45 Now, that’s a normal reaction.
02:46 We probably would have felt  the same way.
02:47 ‘Jehovah, are you sure  you have the right person here?’
02:50 And Jehovah says, ‘No.  I do.
02:52 I will be with you.’
02:54 You look on in verse 13, it says:
02:56 “But Moses said to the true God:  ‘Suppose I
02:58 “‘go to [Israel] and say to them,
03:00 “‘“The God of your forefathers  has sent me to you,”
03:03 “‘and they say to me,  “What is his name?”
03:05 What should I say to them?’”
03:07 Jehovah says, ‘No problem,’  and He explains His name
03:09 —even tells him  what His name means
03:11 and how that power  will be behind him.
03:14 Chapter 4, verse 1:
03:17 “However, Moses answered:  ‘But suppose they do not believe me
03:20 “‘and do not listen to my voice,  for they will say,
03:22 “Jehovah did not appear to you.”’”
03:24 ‘No problem, Moses.  What’s in your hand?’
03:26 It’s where he has the staff.
03:27 He shows him miracles  that he can perform to show
03:30 that Jehovah is behind him.
03:32 Look at verse 10:
03:34 “Moses now said to Jehovah:  ‘Pardon me, Jehovah,
03:36 “‘but I have never been a fluent speaker,  neither in the past
03:39 “‘nor since you have spoken  to your servant,
03:41 for I am slow of speech  and slow of tongue.’”
03:44 ‘OK, Moses,  who created the mouth?
03:47 I’ll speak for you.  Don’t worry about it.’
03:50 Look at verse 13:
03:52 “But he said: ‘Pardon me,  Jehovah, please send
03:54 anyone whom you  want to send.’”
03:56 And notice what it says  in verse 14:
03:59 “Then Jehovah’s anger  blazed against Moses.”
04:03 ‘Fine, you know, I’m going  to just send somebody else.’
04:06 But, you see, thankfully,  Moses got the point
04:08 and he jumped into the assignment  and was used further by Jehovah.
04:11 But what happened here?
04:13 You notice, Moses got caught up  worrying about his inadequacies,
04:17 worrying about all the things  that could go wrong.
04:19 Jehovah was saying,  ‘Just get moving,
04:21 and I will take care  of the rest.’
04:23 Jehovah saw that Moses had the potential
04:26 to carry out this assignment;
04:28 however,  Moses was limiting himself.
04:31 Number three:  We can limit our own potential
04:34 by becoming paralyzed by fear —fear of failure.
04:38 If you turn to the account  in Numbers chapter 13,
04:41 we notice that this  is what happened to the ten spies.
04:44 And it’s very interesting,
04:46 a phrase they used when they  came back from spying out the land.
04:49 Numbers chapter 13,  and look at verse 33.
04:55 It says:  “And there we saw the Nephilim,
04:58 “the sons of Anak,  who [were] from the Nephilim,
05:01 and in comparison  we seemed like grasshoppers,”
05:05 and notice, “both to us  and to them.”
05:09 You see, they ran into these  sons of Anak who were giants,
05:12 men of extraordinary size  who inhabited
05:14 the mountainous region of Canaan,
05:16 and it was understandable  that these enemies of Jehovah
05:19 viewed the Israelites  as puny grasshoppers.
05:21 ‘You can just squash them —no competition.’
05:24 But, you know, the ten spies
05:27 saw themselves the same way.
05:30 And, see, their view  of themselves in this situation
05:33 paralyzed them with fear  and caused them
05:35 to demoralize the entire nation.
05:37 But now, in contrast,  we think of the account of David,
05:40 who as a young man  also encountered a giant, Goliath.
05:44 And remember, Goliath also saw David  as a defenseless little boy
05:48 and as a grasshopper,  if you will.
05:51 But did David see himself  the same way?
05:53 No, he said: ‘You are coming to me  with sword and spear.
05:56 I am coming to you  with the name of Jehovah.’
05:59 You see, David did not allow himself  to be paralyzed by fear.
06:03 He trusted in Jehovah,  and David lived up to the potential
06:07 that Jehovah saw in him.
06:09 So, what’s the lesson for us?
06:11 Well, the lesson is that this illustrates
06:13 —these accounts illustrate— that sometimes we can be
06:16 our own worst enemy at times.
06:18 See, lack of zeal —not throwing ourself into the work,
06:20 as in the case of Jehoash;
06:22 or our own insecurities,  as in the case of Moses;
06:26 or fear of failure,  as in the case of the ten spies
06:30 —can cause us to limit the potential that Jehovah sees in us.
06:35 So, what do we do?
06:37 Well, Jehovah’s words to Gideon  remind us of what we could do,
06:40 and we invite you  to turn to Judges chapter 6.
06:44 And you remember  that for seven years
06:47 the Midianites  oppressed the nation of Israel,
06:50 and Jehovah’s angel appears to Gideon and says that He is going
06:54 to deliver Israel out of this wicked nation.
06:56 How could he possibly succeed?
06:58 We read the account,  and Gideon saw himself
07:00 as the least significant  one of his father’s house.
07:03 And he said his father’s house  was the least significant family
07:06 of the tribe of Manasseh.
07:08 But yet Jehovah saw  the potential that Gideon had.
07:12 And what did Jehovah  tell him to do?
07:15 Look at Judges 6:14.
07:20 It says:  “Jehovah faced him and said:
07:23 “‘Go with the strength you have,
07:26 “‘and you will save Israel  out of Midian’s hand.
07:30 Is it not I who [sent] you?’”
07:32 Interesting.
07:34 ‘Go with the strength  you have.
07:37 ‘I know you cannot do it  on your own strength.
07:40 ‘Just get moving;  throw everything you can into it;
07:43 and I, Jehovah,  will make up the difference.’
07:47 You see,  that’s what Jehovah is saying,
07:49 and that’s exactly what happened.
07:51 So may we be determined  to do the same.
07:55 We know that none of us  accomplish Jehovah’s work
07:57 on our own strength,  on our own wisdom,
07:59 on our own abilities.
08:01 But when we receive an assignment,
08:03 we need to just start moving.
08:05 Do not let our inadequacies  paralyze us.
08:09 Do not let fear of failure  paralyze us.
08:12 Throw ourselves into the work.  Have a zeal for the work.
08:15 Go with the strength  that you have.
08:18 Trust in Jehovah  to make up the difference,
08:22 and you will live up to the potential  that Jehovah sees in you.

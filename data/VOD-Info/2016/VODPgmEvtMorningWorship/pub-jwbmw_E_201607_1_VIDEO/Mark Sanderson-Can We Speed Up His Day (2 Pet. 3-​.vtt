WEBVTT

00:01.017 --> 00:04.387
Well, here’s the question 
we want to ask this morning: 


00:04.387 --> 00:09.192
Is it actually possible 
to speed up the day of Jehovah? 


00:09.192 --> 00:11.862
Well, if we look at our text this morning 


00:11.862 --> 00:16.700
at 2 Peter 3:11, 


00:16.700 --> 00:18.868
we’ve had that read for us, 


00:18.868 --> 00:21.503
so we know 
that expression at the end 


00:21.503 --> 00:25.241
that we should “consider 
what sort of people you ought to be 


00:25.242 --> 00:29.412
in holy acts of conduct 
and deeds of godly devotion.” 


00:29.412 --> 00:31.680
But then it goes on to say: 


00:31.680 --> 00:35.252
“As you await and keep close in mind 


00:35.252 --> 00:38.389
the presence of the day of Jehovah.” 


00:38.388 --> 00:40.956
Well, now, if you look at the footnote 


00:40.957 --> 00:43.259
on this expression in verse 12, 


00:43.258 --> 00:45.795
you’ll notice that the expression 


00:45.795 --> 00:48.498
“keep close in mind” literally means 


00:48.498 --> 00:52.301
to “speed up” the day of Jehovah. 


00:52.302 --> 00:54.670
Well, now, how can we do that? 


00:54.670 --> 00:57.407
Well, it’s true we cannot bring 


00:57.407 --> 01:00.477
the day forward of Jehovah 
even one day, 


01:00.477 --> 01:03.714
nor can we move it 
back even one day. 


01:03.713 --> 01:07.050
That is not within our power. 
That day is set. 


01:07.050 --> 01:10.987
But how can we, then, 
“speed up” 


01:10.987 --> 01:14.224
the day of Jehovah 
as it says there in verse 12? 


01:14.223 --> 01:18.461
Well, we keep that day 
close in our mind. 


01:18.462 --> 01:21.130
We never let it be out of our sight. 


01:21.130 --> 01:23.165
As the footnote also says, 


01:23.165 --> 01:26.102
we “eagerly desire” it. 


01:26.102 --> 01:28.672
Well, now, 
if we’re persons like that, 


01:28.672 --> 01:32.242
Peter says 
that we’re going to be busy 


01:32.242 --> 01:34.744
in “deeds of godly devotion.” 


01:34.743 --> 01:36.813
Well, now, 
just as a quick reminder: 


01:36.813 --> 01:38.848
What is godly devotion? 


01:38.848 --> 01:42.751
Well, just looking 
at our New World Translation glossary, 


01:42.752 --> 01:44.754
here’s the definition: 


01:44.753 --> 01:47.790
It’s “reverence, worship, 


01:47.790 --> 01:50.092
“and service to Jehovah God, 


01:50.092 --> 01:54.130
with loyalty 
to his universal sovereignty.” 


01:54.130 --> 01:56.800
Well, what do we get 
from that definition? 


01:56.800 --> 02:00.837
Did you notice
—reverence, worship, service? 


02:00.837 --> 02:05.409
You see, godly devotion 
is not passive; it’s active. 


02:05.408 --> 02:09.678
It’s reflected 
in action and in activity.


02:09.678 --> 02:12.081
Well, that’s why the apostle Peter 


02:12.082 --> 02:14.217
used the expression in verse 11, 


02:14.217 --> 02:17.187
“deeds of godly devotion.” 


02:17.187 --> 02:21.057
Well, what are some of the ways 
that we demonstrate this quality? 


02:21.057 --> 02:23.494
Well, some of them are just very small. 


02:23.493 --> 02:26.428
For example, what about hospitality? 


02:26.428 --> 02:30.098
At 1 Peter 4:9, 


02:30.098 --> 02:33.503
when the apostle Peter 
wrote his first letter, he said: 


02:33.503 --> 02:37.740
“Be hospitable 
to one another without grumbling.” 


02:37.740 --> 02:40.877
Well, there are 
so many opportunities 


02:40.877 --> 02:43.980
for us to imitate Jehovah 
and be hospitable


02:43.980 --> 02:47.583
—to share with others 
according to their needs. 


02:47.583 --> 02:51.686
And this really is an expression 
not only for another person 


02:51.687 --> 02:54.724
but it’s an expression 
of our love for Jehovah


02:54.723 --> 02:56.893
—our desire to want 
to imitate him. 


02:56.893 --> 02:58.895
Well, we all acknowledge that. 


02:58.895 --> 03:00.997
But here’s the question: 


03:00.997 --> 03:03.465
When was the last time 


03:03.465 --> 03:06.735
that you acted hospitably? 


03:06.735 --> 03:09.638
Or when was the last time 
I acted hospitably? 


03:09.638 --> 03:13.843
You see, it’s not enough just to love 
the quality of hospitality. 


03:13.843 --> 03:16.745
If we are going 
to have deeds of godly devotion, 


03:16.745 --> 03:18.748
we’re going to have to practice it.


03:18.748 --> 03:20.750
Here’s another one. 


03:20.750 --> 03:25.053
What about helping the elderly 
that are in our midst? 


03:25.053 --> 03:27.856
You know, 
our elderly brothers need help. 


03:27.857 --> 03:30.092
They need help 
to get to the meetings. 


03:30.092 --> 03:33.095
They need help 
to get out in the field ministry. 


03:33.095 --> 03:35.832
Some of them 
are confined to their homes. 


03:35.832 --> 03:40.169
Well, if that’s the case, 
they may need help from younger ones 


03:40.168 --> 03:43.238
to assist them 
with shopping or doing errands 


03:43.238 --> 03:47.010
or just doing 
some chore around the house. 


03:47.010 --> 03:49.712
Well, that’s something 
that has been mentioned 


03:49.712 --> 03:52.015
in many Watchtower articles. 


03:52.015 --> 03:55.017
It’s been mentioned at 
many conventions and assemblies. 


03:55.017 --> 03:58.054
It’s been mentioned at 
many congregation meetings. 


03:58.053 --> 04:00.055
But now here’s a question: 


04:00.055 --> 04:02.258
When was the last time 


04:02.258 --> 04:05.093
that you did something 
for an elderly brother or sister? 


04:05.093 --> 04:07.096
Or when was the last time I did? 


04:07.097 --> 04:09.365
You see, we need to think 


04:09.365 --> 04:12.335
about not just loving these ideas 


04:12.335 --> 04:15.805
but what are we doing to really help? 


04:15.805 --> 04:19.675
See, that’s showing 
deeds of godly devotion.


04:19.675 --> 04:23.880
Well, of course, we also have to think 
about the more major things. 


04:23.880 --> 04:27.183
What about attending 
our congregation meetings? 


04:27.183 --> 04:30.453
Hebrews 10:23-25


04:30.453 --> 04:33.488
—that scripture 
that we quote so many times—


04:33.488 --> 04:37.660
says that we should ‘not forsake 
our meeting together.’ 


04:37.660 --> 04:42.632
But it goes on to say 
that we should ‘encourage one another.’ 


04:42.632 --> 04:45.602
So it’s not enough 
just to be at the meeting. 


04:45.602 --> 04:49.472
When we’re there, we want to reach out 
and do everything that we can 


04:49.472 --> 04:53.475
to encourage our brothers 
and really participate in the meeting. 


04:53.475 --> 04:58.180
You see, godly devotion 
is not passive; it’s active. 


04:58.180 --> 05:02.552
And so, what sort of persons ought we to be 
when we’re at the meeting? 


05:02.552 --> 05:05.489
Well, we know we want to be active, 


05:05.488 --> 05:08.290
fully involved with the program.


05:08.290 --> 05:11.460
But now, of course, 
what’s the most important way 


05:11.460 --> 05:14.430
that we exercise 
these deeds of godly devotion? 


05:14.430 --> 05:17.000
Well, you’ll remember 
that the apostle Paul 


05:17.000 --> 05:20.603
at 1 Timothy 3:16 


05:20.603 --> 05:24.940
referred to ‘the sacred secret 
of godly devotion,’ 


05:24.940 --> 05:29.378
and he showed there 
that Jesus really was that secret. 


05:29.378 --> 05:32.381
You see, he was 
the one who demonstrated 


05:32.382 --> 05:35.652
godly devotion 
in a perfect sense. 


05:35.652 --> 05:39.622
Now, Paul in that verse, 
1 Timothy 3:16, 


05:39.622 --> 05:44.394
went on to say that Jesus 
was ‘preached among the nations.’ 


05:44.393 --> 05:47.863
Well, then, that really is 
a vital part 


05:47.863 --> 05:49.998
of our deeds of godly devotion


05:49.998 --> 05:53.501
—preaching about Christ Jesus, 
his Kingdom, 


05:53.502 --> 05:56.005
and everything 
that will be accomplished. 


05:56.005 --> 06:00.242
But brothers, 
how much incentive we have today 


06:00.242 --> 06:03.545
to be involved fully 
in our preaching work. 


06:03.545 --> 06:07.817
We have tools today 
like we have never had before.


06:07.817 --> 06:10.787
You know, over the summer 
as I was attending 


06:10.787 --> 06:14.590
a number of different regional conventions 
in different parts of the world, 


06:14.590 --> 06:18.260
I enjoyed so much, 
no doubt just as you have, 


06:18.260 --> 06:21.963
using the JW Library app 


06:21.963 --> 06:25.366
and downloading the 
Why Study the Bible? video 


06:25.367 --> 06:27.870
in a number of different languages. 


06:27.870 --> 06:31.173
We had one real interesting experience 
when we were in Europe. 


06:31.173 --> 06:35.645
We got into a taxi 
with a driver from Africa. 


06:35.645 --> 06:38.347
And right away, 
we asked him what his language was. 


06:38.347 --> 06:41.984
Well, he told us it was 
a language not familiar to us at all. 


06:41.983 --> 06:44.286
But while he was driving, 


06:44.287 --> 06:48.557
we managed to download 
the Why Study the Bible? video, 


06:48.557 --> 06:52.395
and it automatically 
began to play as we were in the car. 


06:52.395 --> 06:55.163
Well, as soon as the man heard it, 
he started shouting: 


06:55.163 --> 06:57.200
“What’s happening? 
What’s happening?” 


06:57.200 --> 07:00.035
I think he thought 
he was hearing a voice from heaven 


07:00.035 --> 07:03.072
when he heard 
his own language in the taxi. 


07:03.072 --> 07:06.409
But we reassured him that 
that was not the case. 


07:06.408 --> 07:08.610
But he was so moved. 


07:08.610 --> 07:12.548
He almost didn’t want to take the fare, 
if you can imagine, 


07:12.548 --> 07:16.318
and initially 
he had been quite unfriendly. 


07:16.318 --> 07:19.455
But when he saw 
what was available on our website, 


07:19.455 --> 07:21.457
he was deeply moved. 


07:21.457 --> 07:24.127
Well, maybe 
you’ve had a similar experience. 


07:24.127 --> 07:26.195
Just as a note of future reference: 


07:26.195 --> 07:28.263
It’s probably not a good idea 
to play the video 


07:28.263 --> 07:30.466
when someone is driving.


07:30.467 --> 07:35.404
Well, if we have 
real godly devotion that’s active, 


07:35.403 --> 07:40.008
we’re going to be busy 
in doing deeds of godly devotion. 


07:40.008 --> 07:42.345
You know, 
there’s an old saying that says: 


07:42.345 --> 07:45.548
“Time flies when you’re having fun.” 


07:45.548 --> 07:49.885
Well, you know, even scientists 
acknowledge that there’s truth in that. 


07:49.885 --> 07:53.555
A study that was published 
in the year 2012 


07:53.555 --> 07:57.760
in the journal 
Psychological Science said this: 


07:57.760 --> 07:59.995
Although we tend to believe 


07:59.995 --> 08:03.032
that time flies 
when we’re having a good time, 


08:03.032 --> 08:06.735
these studies 
indicate that what it is 


08:06.735 --> 08:10.940
about the enjoyable time 
that causes it to go by more quickly. 


08:10.940 --> 08:14.410
It seems to be the goal pursuit 


08:14.410 --> 08:19.048
or achievement-directed action 
we’re engaged in that matters. 


08:19.048 --> 08:23.986
Just being content or satisfied 
may not make time fly, 


08:23.987 --> 08:27.790
but being excited or actively pursuing 


08:27.790 --> 08:29.792
a desired object can. 


08:29.792 --> 08:31.794
Isn’t that interesting?


08:31.793 --> 08:34.596
Well, now, if we’re 
the sort of persons that are busy 


08:34.597 --> 08:38.667
with holy acts of conduct 
and deeds of godly devotion, 


08:38.667 --> 08:43.372
reaching out for that most important goal 
of everlasting life, 


08:43.372 --> 08:47.577
we will speed up the coming 
of the day of Jehovah 


08:47.577 --> 09:01.274
in our hearts and our minds.

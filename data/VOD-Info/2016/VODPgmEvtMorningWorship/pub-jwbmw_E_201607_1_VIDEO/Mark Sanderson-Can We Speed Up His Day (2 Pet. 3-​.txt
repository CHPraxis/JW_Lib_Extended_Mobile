00:01 Well, here’s the question  we want to ask this morning:
00:04 Is it actually possible  to speed up the day of Jehovah?
00:09 Well, if we look at our text this morning
00:11 at 2 Peter 3:11,
00:16 we’ve had that read for us,
00:18 so we know  that expression at the end
00:21 that we should “consider  what sort of people you ought to be
00:25 in holy acts of conduct  and deeds of godly devotion.”
00:29 But then it goes on to say:
00:31 “As you await and keep close in mind
00:35 the presence of the day of Jehovah.”
00:38 Well, now, if you look at the footnote
00:40 on this expression in verse 12,
00:43 you’ll notice that the expression
00:45 “keep close in mind” literally means
00:48 to “speed up” the day of Jehovah.
00:52 Well, now, how can we do that?
00:54 Well, it’s true we cannot bring
00:57 the day forward of Jehovah  even one day,
01:00 nor can we move it  back even one day.
01:03 That is not within our power.  That day is set.
01:07 But how can we, then,  “speed up”
01:10 the day of Jehovah  as it says there in verse 12?
01:14 Well, we keep that day  close in our mind.
01:18 We never let it be out of our sight.
01:21 As the footnote also says,
01:23 we “eagerly desire” it.
01:26 Well, now,  if we’re persons like that,
01:28 Peter says  that we’re going to be busy
01:32 in “deeds of godly devotion.”
01:34 Well, now,  just as a quick reminder:
01:36 What is godly devotion?
01:38 Well, just looking  at our New World Translation glossary,
01:42 here’s the definition:
01:44 It’s “reverence, worship,
01:47 “and service to Jehovah God,
01:50 with loyalty  to his universal sovereignty.”
01:54 Well, what do we get  from that definition?
01:56 Did you notice —reverence, worship, service?
02:00 You see, godly devotion  is not passive; it’s active.
02:05 It’s reflected  in action and in activity.
02:09 Well, that’s why the apostle Peter
02:12 used the expression in verse 11,
02:14 “deeds of godly devotion.”
02:17 Well, what are some of the ways  that we demonstrate this quality?
02:21 Well, some of them are just very small.
02:23 For example, what about hospitality?
02:26 At 1 Peter 4:9,
02:30 when the apostle Peter  wrote his first letter, he said:
02:33 “Be hospitable  to one another without grumbling.”
02:37 Well, there are  so many opportunities
02:40 for us to imitate Jehovah  and be hospitable
02:43 —to share with others  according to their needs.
02:47 And this really is an expression  not only for another person
02:51 but it’s an expression  of our love for Jehovah
02:54 —our desire to want  to imitate him.
02:56 Well, we all acknowledge that.
02:58 But here’s the question:
03:00 When was the last time
03:03 that you acted hospitably?
03:06 Or when was the last time  I acted hospitably?
03:09 You see, it’s not enough just to love  the quality of hospitality.
03:13 If we are going  to have deeds of godly devotion,
03:16 we’re going to have to practice it.
03:18 Here’s another one.
03:20 What about helping the elderly  that are in our midst?
03:25 You know,  our elderly brothers need help.
03:27 They need help  to get to the meetings.
03:30 They need help  to get out in the field ministry.
03:33 Some of them  are confined to their homes.
03:35 Well, if that’s the case,  they may need help from younger ones
03:40 to assist them  with shopping or doing errands
03:43 or just doing  some chore around the house.
03:47 Well, that’s something  that has been mentioned
03:49 in many Watchtower articles.
03:52 It’s been mentioned at  many conventions and assemblies.
03:55 It’s been mentioned at  many congregation meetings.
03:58 But now here’s a question:
04:00 When was the last time
04:02 that you did something  for an elderly brother or sister?
04:05 Or when was the last time I did?
04:07 You see, we need to think
04:09 about not just loving these ideas
04:12 but what are we doing to really help?
04:15 See, that’s showing  deeds of godly devotion.
04:19 Well, of course, we also have to think  about the more major things.
04:23 What about attending  our congregation meetings?
04:27 Hebrews 10:23-25
04:30 —that scripture  that we quote so many times—
04:33 says that we should ‘not forsake  our meeting together.’
04:37 But it goes on to say  that we should ‘encourage one another.’
04:42 So it’s not enough  just to be at the meeting.
04:45 When we’re there, we want to reach out  and do everything that we can
04:49 to encourage our brothers  and really participate in the meeting.
04:53 You see, godly devotion  is not passive; it’s active.
04:58 And so, what sort of persons ought we to be  when we’re at the meeting?
05:02 Well, we know we want to be active,
05:05 fully involved with the program.
05:08 But now, of course,  what’s the most important way
05:11 that we exercise  these deeds of godly devotion?
05:14 Well, you’ll remember  that the apostle Paul
05:17 at 1 Timothy 3:16
05:20 referred to ‘the sacred secret  of godly devotion,’
05:24 and he showed there  that Jesus really was that secret.
05:29 You see, he was  the one who demonstrated
05:32 godly devotion  in a perfect sense.
05:35 Now, Paul in that verse,
1 Timothy 3:16,
05:39 went on to say that Jesus  was ‘preached among the nations.’
05:44 Well, then, that really is  a vital part
05:47 of our deeds of godly devotion
05:49 —preaching about Christ Jesus,  his Kingdom,
05:53 and everything  that will be accomplished.
05:56 But brothers,  how much incentive we have today
06:00 to be involved fully  in our preaching work.
06:03 We have tools today  like we have never had before.
06:07 You know, over the summer  as I was attending
06:10 a number of different regional conventions  in different parts of the world,
06:14 I enjoyed so much,  no doubt just as you have,
06:18 using the JW Library app
06:21 and downloading the  Why Study the Bible? video
06:25 in a number of different languages.
06:27 We had one real interesting experience  when we were in Europe.
06:31 We got into a taxi  with a driver from Africa.
06:35 And right away,  we asked him what his language was.
06:38 Well, he told us it was  a language not familiar to us at all.
06:41 But while he was driving,
06:44 we managed to download  the Why Study the Bible? video,
06:48 and it automatically  began to play as we were in the car.
06:52 Well, as soon as the man heard it,  he started shouting:
06:55 “What’s happening?  What’s happening?”
06:57 I think he thought  he was hearing a voice from heaven
07:00 when he heard  his own language in the taxi.
07:03 But we reassured him that  that was not the case.
07:06 But he was so moved.
07:08 He almost didn’t want to take the fare,  if you can imagine,
07:12 and initially  he had been quite unfriendly.
07:16 But when he saw  what was available on our website,
07:19 he was deeply moved.
07:21 Well, maybe  you’ve had a similar experience.
07:24 Just as a note of future reference:
07:26 It’s probably not a good idea  to play the video
07:28 when someone is driving.
07:30 Well, if we have  real godly devotion that’s active,
07:35 we’re going to be busy  in doing deeds of godly devotion.
07:40 You know,  there’s an old saying that says:
07:42 “Time flies when you’re having fun.”
07:45 Well, you know, even scientists  acknowledge that there’s truth in that.
07:49 A study that was published  in the year 2012
07:53 in the journal  Psychological Science said this:
07:57 Although we tend to believe
07:59 that time flies  when we’re having a good time,
08:03 these studies  indicate that what it is
08:06 about the enjoyable time  that causes it to go by more quickly.
08:10 It seems to be the goal pursuit
08:14 or achievement-directed action  we’re engaged in that matters.
08:19 Just being content or satisfied  may not make time fly,
08:23 but being excited or actively pursuing
08:27 a desired object can.
08:29 Isn’t that interesting?
08:31 Well, now, if we’re  the sort of persons that are busy
08:34 with holy acts of conduct  and deeds of godly devotion,
08:38 reaching out for that most important goal  of everlasting life,
08:43 we will speed up the coming  of the day of Jehovah
08:47 in our hearts and our minds.

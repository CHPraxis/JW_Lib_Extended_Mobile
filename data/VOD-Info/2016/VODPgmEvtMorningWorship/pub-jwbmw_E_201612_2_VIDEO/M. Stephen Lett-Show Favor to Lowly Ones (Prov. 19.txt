00:01 Let’s discuss the theme
00:03 “Imitate Jesus in Showing  Favor to Lowly Ones.”
00:08 Now, open up to Proverbs,  please, chapter 19.
00:12 And here’s a beautiful proverb
00:14 in harmony with this theme,  Proverbs 19:17.
00:18 It says: “The one showing favor to the lowly
00:22 “is lending to Jehovah,
00:26 and He [Jehovah] will repay him for what he does.”
00:31 Well, that’s a beautiful thought, isn’t it?  We’re going to ‘lend to Jehovah.’
00:36 The Hebrew word for “lowly”
00:39 literally means “thin,”  “lean,” or “slender.”
00:42 So it’s someone who is weak
00:45 due to maybe some depressing circumstance
00:49 —poverty or illness.
00:52 The English word “lowly” means “bent low.”
00:56 And there’s a heavy weight on their back.
00:59 They need help; they are lowly.
01:02 And if you think about it,  all of us are lowly at times, aren’t we?
01:05 There are times there’s a heavy weight  on our back, and we’re bent low.
01:09 And, of course, we know that Jesus set the perfect example
01:14 in showing favor to lowly ones.
01:17 But now, here’s a question: What qualities enabled him to do so?
01:21 Well, let’s discuss three.
01:23 And those same three qualities will put us in a position
01:27 to show this favor to lowly ones
01:30 and lend to Jehovah.
01:32 Number one: compassion.
01:35 Now, compassion is defined  in the Insight book
01:38 as ‘a sympathetic awareness of another’s suffering
01:42 coupled with a desire to alleviate that suffering.’
01:47 So in other words,  we’re keenly aware of someone’s suffering,
01:51 and we want to do something  about it to alleviate it.
01:55 Open up to Mark chapter 6, please.
01:58 Now, here’s a beautiful example  of Jesus showing compassion.
02:02 Mark 6, and please,  let’s read verse 34.
02:08 It says: “Well, on getting out [of the boat],
02:12 “he saw a large crowd,
02:15 “and he was moved with pity for them,
02:19 “because they were as sheep  without a shepherd.
02:22 And he started to teach them many things.”
02:26 Now let’s think about the circumstances.
02:28 Jesus was very tired.
02:31 He really needed some quiet time,  some downtime.
02:34 He didn’t even have time  to eat a meal in peace.
02:36 So he gets in a boat,  he goes to an isolated area,
02:41 but a crowd of thousands of people  found out where he was going.
02:46 They got there ahead of him.
02:47 Now, when Jesus got out of the boat,  how could he have reacted?
02:52 He could have immediately  dismissed that crowd
02:55 or maybe made an appointment with them.
02:57 “Now, come back tomorrow, this same time tomorrow,
03:00 and then I’ll help you.”
03:02 Or he could have maybe spent
10 or 15 minutes with them,
03:05 taught them a few things —flipped them a few spiritual tidbits,
03:09 we could say —and then sent them on their way.
03:12 But, no!
03:13 Pity and compassion  moved him to teach them many things.
03:17 And apparently several hours  were involved
03:20 because the account says  that while he was teaching them,
03:24 ‘the hour grew late.’
03:27 In fact,  he even fed them physically
03:30 before he sent them on their way.
03:32 But, what was it  that moved him to do this?
03:34 Compassion.
03:36 So similarly,  compassion will move us
03:39 to extend favor to the lowly.
03:41 If we don’t have  this right feeling toward them,
03:44 we might not even notice the suffering they’re experiencing
03:47 and we’re certainly not going  to be moved to do anything about it.
03:51 But compassion will  move us to visit them, console them,
03:58 provide transportation,  give them a gift
04:02 —whatever it takes to show favor  to these lowly ones.
04:06 But now let’s get our  second quality: humility.
04:09 Please go to Philippians chapter 2.
04:13 Philippians chapter 2,
04:16 and here’s a beautiful scripture  talking about Jesus’ humility.
04:21 Beginning in verse 5,  it says:
04:24 “Keep this mental attitude in you
04:29 “that was also in Christ Jesus,
04:31 “who, although he was existing  in God’s form,
04:35 “gave no consideration to a seizure,
04:38 “namely, that he should be  equal to God.
04:41 “No, but he emptied himself
04:43 “and took a slave’s form  and became human.
04:46 “More than that,  when he came as a man,
04:49 “he humbled himself
04:51 “and became obedient  to the point of death,
04:54 yes, death on a torture stake.”
04:57 Now, first, contemplate  the humility it took
05:01 for Jesus to empty himself
05:04 of his glorious heavenly body,
05:08 his lofty heavenly home,  his privileges, his position.
05:12 But then when he got here on the earth,
05:15 think of the humility  as he dealt with the lowly,
05:20 diseased, dying offspring of Adam.
05:23 Now, think about it.
05:24 He was the only perfect person  on the planet.
05:27 He could’ve become hypercritical,  couldn’t he?
05:30 Comparing how perfect he was
05:32 with how imperfect everybody else was.
05:35 He could’ve really put people down,  but instead,
05:38 he slaved for,  ministered to, taught, washed the feet
05:43 of these lowly offspring of Adam,
05:46 treating them, in effect,  as though they were superior to himself.
05:50 Now, to appreciate, perhaps,  a little better
05:53 this humility of Jesus
05:55 —and this really doesn’t do the job,  this illustration, but it may help—
05:59 imagine that you are confined
06:03 to a home, or institution,
06:07 for mentally handicapped individuals.
06:10 Now, you’re not mentally handicapped,  but you’re confined
06:13 to this home, this institution,  where these ones are cared for.
06:16 Now, it would be very easy to develop
06:19 a superiority attitude  toward the other residents.
06:23 But, can you imagine  slaving for them,
06:26 serving them, ministering to them,  washing their feet?
06:31 Now, that would take humility,  wouldn’t it?
06:33 And perhaps that  does illustrate a little bit
06:36 the humility of this perfect man —uniquely perfect—
06:40 dealing with the handicapped offspring  of Adam.
06:44 Well, that same quality of humility
06:47 will move us to perform
06:50 humble, down-to-earth tasks
06:52 in behalf of these ones
06:55 that may be more disadvantaged  than we are, at least right now,
06:58 to show them this favor.
07:00 These ones that are experiencing poverty,
07:02 weakness—they’re bent low
07:05 by some depressing circumstance.
07:08 Well, let’s get one more quality:  approachability.
07:12 Now, what do you think of  when you think of approachability?
07:16 Well, the dictionary defines it this way:
07:18 “Possible to approach, accessible,
07:22 easy to talk to, or deal with, friendly.”
07:26 Open up to Mark chapter 10, please,
07:29 and here’s a scripture
07:32 that talks about  this approachability of Jesus.
07:35 He attracted people  of all different backgrounds to himself.
07:39 Mark chapter 10,
07:41 and just looking at some of these verses,  look at verse 1:
07:44 “Crowds gathered to him.”
07:46 Verse 2, the Pharisees felt free  to approach.
07:50 Look at verse 10,
07:52 the disciples approached him  and “began to question him.”
07:55 Verse 13,  people brought their “young children.”
07:59 Verse 17,
08:01 “a man ran up and fell” at Jesus.
08:05 Well, here you have,  in those five verses,
08:08 crowds, the Pharisees,
08:11 Jesus’ disciples,  parents with their little children,
08:15 just a stranger—a man.
08:17 Jesus certainly  was approachable to people.
08:21 See, it was obvious  that his accessibility
08:24 but also undoubtedly his countenance
08:28 —his friendly facial expressions—
08:31 made him appear  not too busy for people.
08:35 But they felt free to approach him.
08:37 Well, similarly,  we should do our best
08:40 to develop this godly quality.
08:42 Now, it’s true we’re limited  and we’re imperfect.
08:45 But we should do our best  to try to appear accessible,
08:50 not always too busy for others.
08:53 We should strive  to maintain warm, joyful,
08:56 friendly facial expressions,
09:00 so that we appear accessible to people.
09:03 And then, as they approach,  we can show them favor,
09:06 and we can lend to Jehovah.
09:09 Well, there we have  three qualities that will help us.
09:11 Did you get them?
09:13 We talked about compassion,
09:16 humility, and approachability.
09:20 And how are we going to benefit  if we show this favor to lowly ones?
09:25 Well, Psalm 41:1 says:
09:28 “Happy is anyone  who shows consideration to the lowly.”
09:31 So Jehovah says,  “You’re going to be happy.”
09:33 And then it goes on to say:
09:35 “Jehovah will rescue him  in the day of calamity.”
09:39 And that applies to calamities now
09:41 and the big calamity—the great tribulation.
09:44 And then, remember that scripture  we read at the beginning,
09:48 Proverbs 19:17.
09:50 When we show “favor to the lowly,”
09:53 we’re “lending to Jehovah.”
09:55 And if we do that
09:58 —we give to these lowly ones,  not expecting anything in return—
10:03 Jehovah views it as a loan made to Him.
10:06 And he’s going to repay that loan  with favor and blessings.

00:01.017 --> 00:03.720
Let’s discuss the theme


00:03.720 --> 00:08.525
“Imitate Jesus in Showing 
Favor to Lowly Ones.” 


00:08.525 --> 00:12.062
Now, open up to Proverbs, 
please, chapter 19. 


00:12.062 --> 00:14.297
And here’s a beautiful proverb 


00:14.297 --> 00:18.735
in harmony with this theme, 
Proverbs 19:17. 


00:18.735 --> 00:22.972
It says: “The one showing favor to the lowly


00:22.972 --> 00:26.575
“is lending to Jehovah, 


00:26.575 --> 00:31.580
and He [Jehovah] will repay him
for what he does.” 


00:31.580 --> 00:36.352
Well, that’s a beautiful thought, isn’t it? 
We’re going to ‘lend to Jehovah.’ 


00:36.352 --> 00:39.355
The Hebrew word for “lowly”


00:39.355 --> 00:42.925
literally means “thin,” 
“lean,” or “slender.” 


00:42.925 --> 00:45.662
So it’s someone who is weak 


00:45.662 --> 00:49.399
due to maybe some depressing circumstance


00:49.398 --> 00:52.735
—poverty or illness. 


00:52.735 --> 00:56.538
The English word “lowly” means “bent low.” 


00:56.538 --> 00:59.408
And there’s a heavy weight on their back. 


00:59.408 --> 01:02.345
They need help; they are lowly. 


01:02.345 --> 01:05.682
And if you think about it, 
all of us are lowly at times, aren’t we? 


01:05.682 --> 01:09.619
There are times there’s a heavy weight 
on our back, and we’re bent low. 


01:09.618 --> 01:14.590
And, of course, we know
that Jesus set the perfect example


01:14.590 --> 01:17.627
in showing favor to lowly ones. 


01:17.627 --> 01:21.597
But now, here’s a question:
What qualities enabled him to do so? 


01:21.597 --> 01:23.434
Well, let’s discuss three. 


01:23.433 --> 01:27.403
And those same three qualities
will put us in a position


01:27.403 --> 01:30.740
to show this favor to lowly ones


01:30.740 --> 01:32.775
and lend to Jehovah.


01:32.775 --> 01:35.745
Number one: compassion. 


01:35.745 --> 01:38.915
Now, compassion is defined 
in the Insight book 


01:38.915 --> 01:42.518
as ‘a sympathetic awareness
of another’s suffering 


01:42.518 --> 01:47.156
coupled with a desire
to alleviate that suffering.’ 


01:47.157 --> 01:51.594
So in other words, 
we’re keenly aware of someone’s suffering, 


01:51.593 --> 01:55.531
and we want to do something 
about it to alleviate it. 


01:55.532 --> 01:58.869
Open up to Mark chapter 6, please. 


01:58.868 --> 02:02.805
Now, here’s a beautiful example 
of Jesus showing compassion. 


02:02.805 --> 02:07.000
Mark 6, and please, 
let’s read verse 34. 


02:08.878 --> 02:12.481
It says: “Well, on getting out [of the boat], 


02:12.482 --> 02:15.319
“he saw a large crowd, 


02:15.318 --> 02:19.855
“and he was moved with pity for them, 


02:19.855 --> 02:22.858
“because they were as sheep 
without a shepherd. 


02:22.858 --> 02:26.361
And he started to teach them many things.” 


02:26.362 --> 02:28.965
Now let’s think about the circumstances. 


02:28.965 --> 02:31.100
Jesus was very tired. 


02:31.100 --> 02:34.137
He really needed some quiet time, 
some downtime. 


02:34.137 --> 02:36.840
He didn’t even have time 
to eat a meal in peace. 


02:36.840 --> 02:41.777
So he gets in a boat, 
he goes to an isolated area, 


02:41.777 --> 02:46.182
but a crowd of thousands of people 
found out where he was going. 


02:46.182 --> 02:47.917
They got there ahead of him. 


02:47.917 --> 02:52.255
Now, when Jesus got out of the boat, 
how could he have reacted? 


02:52.255 --> 02:55.492
He could have immediately 
dismissed that crowd 


02:55.492 --> 02:57.694
or maybe made an appointment with them. 


02:57.693 --> 03:00.296
“Now, come back tomorrow,
this same time tomorrow,


03:00.297 --> 03:02.299
and then I’ll help you.” 


03:02.298 --> 03:05.935
Or he could have maybe spent 
10 or 15 minutes with them, 


03:05.935 --> 03:09.205
taught them a few things
—flipped them a few spiritual tidbits,


03:09.205 --> 03:12.142
we could say
—and then sent them on their way. 


03:12.142 --> 03:13.075
But, no! 


03:13.075 --> 03:17.913
Pity and compassion 
moved him to teach them many things. 


03:17.913 --> 03:20.883
And apparently several hours 
were involved 


03:20.883 --> 03:24.720
because the account says 
that while he was teaching them, 


03:24.720 --> 03:27.057
‘the hour grew late.’ 


03:27.057 --> 03:30.125
In fact, 
he even fed them physically 


03:30.125 --> 03:32.428
before he sent them on their way. 


03:32.428 --> 03:34.730
But, what was it 
that moved him to do this? 


03:34.730 --> 03:36.232
Compassion. 


03:36.232 --> 03:39.069
So similarly, 
compassion will move us 


03:39.068 --> 03:41.470
to extend favor to the lowly. 


03:41.470 --> 03:44.307
If we don’t have 
this right feeling toward them, 


03:44.307 --> 03:47.944
we might not even notice
the suffering they’re experiencing 


03:47.943 --> 03:51.846
and we’re certainly not going 
to be moved to do anything about it. 


03:51.847 --> 03:57.000
But compassion will 
move us to visit them, console them,


03:58.453 --> 04:02.025
provide transportation, 
give them a gift


04:02.025 --> 04:06.128
—whatever it takes to show favor 
to these lowly ones.


04:06.128 --> 04:09.365
But now let’s get our 
second quality: humility. 


04:09.365 --> 04:12.000
Please go to Philippians chapter 2. 


04:13.302 --> 04:16.039
Philippians chapter 2, 


04:16.038 --> 04:21.210
and here’s a beautiful scripture 
talking about Jesus’ humility. 


04:21.210 --> 04:24.080
Beginning in verse 5, 
it says:


04:24.080 --> 04:27.000
“Keep this mental attitude in you 


04:29.085 --> 04:31.820
“that was also in Christ Jesus, 


04:31.820 --> 04:35.392
“who, although he was existing 
in God’s form, 


04:35.392 --> 04:38.160
“gave no consideration to a seizure, 


04:38.160 --> 04:41.263
“namely, that he should be 
equal to God. 


04:41.263 --> 04:43.666
“No, but he emptied himself 


04:43.667 --> 04:46.635
“and took a slave’s form 
and became human. 


04:46.635 --> 04:49.805
“More than that, 
when he came as a man, 


04:49.805 --> 04:51.807
“he humbled himself


04:51.807 --> 04:54.644
“and became obedient 
to the point of death,


04:54.643 --> 04:57.980
yes, death on a torture stake.” 


04:57.980 --> 05:01.583
Now, first, contemplate 
the humility it took 


05:01.583 --> 05:04.720
for Jesus to empty himself


05:04.720 --> 05:07.000
of his glorious heavenly body, 


05:08.190 --> 05:12.928
his lofty heavenly home, 
his privileges, his position. 


05:12.928 --> 05:15.898
But then when he got here on the earth, 


05:15.898 --> 05:20.235
think of the humility 
as he dealt with the lowly, 


05:20.235 --> 05:23.538
diseased, dying offspring of Adam. 


05:23.538 --> 05:24.573
Now, think about it.


05:24.573 --> 05:27.510
He was the only perfect person 
on the planet. 


05:27.510 --> 05:30.278
He could’ve become hypercritical, 
couldn’t he? 


05:30.278 --> 05:32.981
Comparing how perfect he was 


05:32.982 --> 05:35.652
with how imperfect everybody else was. 


05:35.652 --> 05:38.789
He could’ve really put people down, 
but instead, 


05:38.788 --> 05:43.391
he slaved for, 
ministered to, taught, washed the feet


05:43.392 --> 05:46.429
of these lowly offspring of Adam, 


05:46.428 --> 05:50.433
treating them, in effect, 
as though they were superior to himself.


05:50.433 --> 05:53.668
Now, to appreciate, perhaps, 
a little better 


05:53.668 --> 05:55.705
this humility of Jesus


05:55.705 --> 05:59.675
—and this really doesn’t do the job, 
this illustration, but it may help—


05:59.675 --> 06:03.345
imagine that you are confined


06:03.345 --> 06:07.517
to a home, or institution, 


06:07.517 --> 06:10.654
for mentally handicapped individuals. 


06:10.653 --> 06:13.355
Now, you’re not mentally handicapped, 
but you’re confined 


06:13.355 --> 06:16.925
to this home, this institution, 
where these ones are cared for. 


06:16.925 --> 06:19.562
Now, it would be very easy to develop 


06:19.562 --> 06:23.132
a superiority attitude 
toward the other residents. 


06:23.132 --> 06:26.369
But, can you imagine 
slaving for them, 


06:26.368 --> 06:31.273
serving them, ministering to them, 
washing their feet? 


06:31.273 --> 06:33.475
Now, that would take humility, 
wouldn’t it? 


06:33.475 --> 06:36.412
And perhaps that 
does illustrate a little bit 


06:36.412 --> 06:40.517
the humility of this perfect man
—uniquely perfect—


06:40.517 --> 06:44.520
dealing with the handicapped offspring 
of Adam. 


06:44.520 --> 06:47.357
Well, that same quality of humility 


06:47.357 --> 06:50.159
will move us to perform 


06:50.158 --> 06:52.661
humble, down-to-earth tasks 


06:52.662 --> 06:55.565
in behalf of these ones 


06:55.565 --> 06:58.467
that may be more disadvantaged 
than we are, at least right now, 


06:58.467 --> 07:00.102
to show them this favor. 


07:00.102 --> 07:02.905
These ones that are experiencing poverty, 


07:02.905 --> 07:05.307
weakness—they’re bent low 


07:05.307 --> 07:08.344
by some depressing circumstance.


07:08.343 --> 07:12.981
Well, let’s get one more quality: 
approachability. 


07:12.982 --> 07:16.452
Now, what do you think of 
when you think of approachability? 


07:16.452 --> 07:18.855
Well, the dictionary defines it this way: 


07:18.855 --> 07:22.358
“Possible to approach, accessible, 


07:22.358 --> 07:26.728
easy to talk to, or deal with, friendly.” 


07:26.728 --> 07:29.431
Open up to Mark chapter 10, please, 


07:29.432 --> 07:32.435
and here’s a scripture 


07:32.435 --> 07:35.672
that talks about 
this approachability of Jesus. 


07:35.672 --> 07:39.709
He attracted people 
of all different backgrounds to himself. 


07:39.708 --> 07:41.776
Mark chapter 10, 


07:41.777 --> 07:44.614
and just looking at some of these verses, 
look at verse 1: 


07:44.613 --> 07:46.781
“Crowds gathered to him.” 


07:46.782 --> 07:50.419
Verse 2, the Pharisees felt free 
to approach. 


07:50.418 --> 07:52.388
Look at verse 10,


07:52.388 --> 07:55.491
the disciples approached him 
and “began to question him.” 


07:55.492 --> 07:59.429
Verse 13, 
people brought their “young children.” 


07:59.428 --> 08:01.130
Verse 17, 


08:01.130 --> 08:05.968
“a man ran up and fell” at Jesus.


08:05.968 --> 08:08.136
Well, here you have, 
in those five verses, 


08:08.137 --> 08:11.307
crowds, the Pharisees, 


08:11.307 --> 08:15.979
Jesus’ disciples, 
parents with their little children, 


08:15.978 --> 08:17.980
just a stranger—a man. 


08:17.980 --> 08:21.250
Jesus certainly 
was approachable to people. 


08:21.250 --> 08:24.953
See, it was obvious 
that his accessibility 


08:24.953 --> 08:27.000
but also undoubtedly his countenance


08:28.323 --> 08:31.960
—his friendly facial expressions—


08:31.960 --> 08:35.063
made him appear 
not too busy for people. 


08:35.063 --> 08:37.966
But they felt free to approach him. 


08:37.967 --> 08:40.402
Well, similarly, 
we should do our best 


08:40.402 --> 08:42.472
to develop this godly quality. 


08:42.472 --> 08:45.942
Now, it’s true we’re limited 
and we’re imperfect. 


08:45.942 --> 08:50.212
But we should do our best 
to try to appear accessible, 


08:50.212 --> 08:53.315
not always too busy for others. 


08:53.315 --> 08:56.652
We should strive 
to maintain warm, joyful, 


08:56.652 --> 08:59.000
friendly facial expressions, 


09:00.022 --> 09:03.392
so that we appear accessible to people. 


09:03.392 --> 09:06.662
And then, as they approach, 
we can show them favor, 


09:06.662 --> 09:09.365
and we can lend to Jehovah.


09:09.365 --> 09:11.600
Well, there we have 
three qualities that will help us. 


09:11.600 --> 09:13.502
Did you get them? 


09:13.502 --> 09:15.000
We talked about compassion, 


09:16.305 --> 09:20.042
humility, and approachability. 


09:20.042 --> 09:25.280
And how are we going to benefit 
if we show this favor to lowly ones? 


09:25.280 --> 09:28.117
Well, Psalm 41:1 says: 


09:28.117 --> 09:31.487
“Happy is anyone 
who shows consideration to the lowly.” 


09:31.487 --> 09:33.522
So Jehovah says, 
“You’re going to be happy.” 


09:33.522 --> 09:35.490
And then it goes on to say: 


09:35.490 --> 09:39.528
“Jehovah will rescue him 
in the day of calamity.” 


09:39.528 --> 09:41.730
And that applies to calamities now 


09:41.730 --> 09:44.533
and the big calamity—the great tribulation. 


09:44.533 --> 09:48.336
And then, remember that scripture 
we read at the beginning, 


09:48.337 --> 09:50.339
Proverbs 19:17. 


09:50.338 --> 09:53.041
When we show “favor to the lowly,” 


09:53.042 --> 09:55.645
we’re “lending to Jehovah.” 


09:55.645 --> 09:58.180
And if we do that


09:58.180 --> 10:03.018
—we give to these lowly ones, 
not expecting anything in return—


10:03.018 --> 10:06.721
Jehovah views it as a loan made to Him. 


10:06.722 --> 10:22.655
And he’s going to repay that loan 
with favor and blessings.

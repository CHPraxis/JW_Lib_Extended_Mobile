00:00.850 --> 00:03.118
How can we be sure 


00:03.118 --> 00:06.690
that we will give a word
at the right time? 


00:06.690 --> 00:09.325
Well, one of the things 
that will help us is described 


00:09.325 --> 00:11.862
by the apostle Paul in the book 


00:11.862 --> 00:14.064
of the first letter to the Corinthians. 


00:14.063 --> 00:17.666
If you turn with me, please, 
to 1 Corinthians chapter 12,


00:17.667 --> 00:20.104
and verse 25, 


00:20.103 --> 00:22.971
notice what Paul says to them: 


00:22.972 --> 00:26.242
“So that there should be 
no division in the body, 


00:26.242 --> 00:29.879
“but its members should have 
mutual concern 


00:29.878 --> 00:31.646
for one another.” 


00:31.647 --> 00:33.617
So notice that comment there, 


00:33.617 --> 00:36.619
“mutual concern for one another.” 


00:36.618 --> 00:39.221
If you look 
at the [Kingdom] Interlinear, 


00:39.222 --> 00:42.825
you’ll notice that literally 
the Greek says there 


00:42.825 --> 00:46.000
“to be anxious over one another.” 


00:47.330 --> 00:50.032
And it’s interesting 
also for us to note 


00:50.032 --> 00:53.235
that this Greek word 
translated here, 


00:53.235 --> 00:55.272
“mutual concern,” 


00:55.272 --> 00:58.040
is the same basic word 


00:58.040 --> 01:00.243
that’s used 
in the book of Matthew 


01:00.243 --> 01:02.245
when recording what Jesus said 


01:02.245 --> 01:05.482
about not being anxious 
about anything. 


01:05.482 --> 01:08.017
So that seems 
a little unusual, doesn’t it? 


01:08.017 --> 01:10.787
Jesus tells us not to be anxious, 


01:10.787 --> 01:12.922
and yet Paul here tells us 


01:12.922 --> 01:15.259
to be anxious for one another. 


01:15.258 --> 01:17.326
How does that work? 


01:17.327 --> 01:19.595
Well, obviously, this word 


01:19.595 --> 01:22.865
has different meanings 
or different connotations 


01:22.865 --> 01:24.867
in different settings. 


01:24.867 --> 01:27.137
It’s wrong for us to be anxious 


01:27.137 --> 01:29.139
about material things, 


01:29.138 --> 01:32.275
particularly if it shows 
a lack of faith on our part. 


01:32.275 --> 01:34.877
But on the other hand, 
it’s appropriate 


01:34.877 --> 01:37.847
that we should be anxious 
or show concern


01:37.847 --> 01:40.850
—a wholesome concern—
that motivates us to action 


01:40.850 --> 01:43.820
when we’re dealing 
with our brothers and sisters. 


01:43.820 --> 01:47.157
If you turn over 
to the book of Philippians, 


01:47.157 --> 01:49.292
you’ll notice that Paul uses 


01:49.292 --> 01:52.829
the same Greek word 
when describing Timothy 


01:52.828 --> 01:56.000
at Philippians 2:20. 


01:57.700 --> 02:00.803
There he says: 
“For I have no one else 


02:00.803 --> 02:02.871
“of a disposition like his 


02:02.872 --> 02:05.409
“who will genuinely care 


02:05.408 --> 02:07.476
for your concerns.” 


02:07.477 --> 02:10.814
So this expression 
“genuinely care”


02:10.813 --> 02:13.483
—the “care” part of it—
is the same Greek word 


02:13.483 --> 02:16.718
about being anxious for others. 


02:16.718 --> 02:19.355
And, of course, 
that’s the same Greek word 


02:19.355 --> 02:22.892
that Paul used 
in Philippians 4:6 


02:22.892 --> 02:26.864
where he said: 
“Do not be anxious over anything.”


02:26.863 --> 02:29.298
Now at this point, 
you’re probably thinking:


02:29.298 --> 02:31.300
‘How does this all work? 


02:31.300 --> 02:33.637
‘The same Greek word, 
and yet we’re told 


02:33.637 --> 02:36.974
‘not to be anxious, 
and yet at the same time 


02:36.973 --> 02:39.708
we’re told to be anxious 
for one another.’ 


02:39.708 --> 02:41.710
Well, maybe we could illustrate it 


02:41.710 --> 02:44.000
with the English word “jealousy.” 


02:45.248 --> 02:47.316
Normally, 
the connotation we would get 


02:47.317 --> 02:50.152
from the word “jealousy” 
is something negative, 


02:50.152 --> 02:54.090
but in certain situations 
or circumstances 


02:54.090 --> 02:58.127
it can have a positive 
or proper description. 


02:58.127 --> 03:01.164
Perhaps let’s take 
a husband or a wife 


03:01.163 --> 03:03.465
who finds out that their mate 


03:03.465 --> 03:07.070
is starting to have 
a wrong romantic attachment 


03:07.070 --> 03:08.838
to someone else. 


03:08.838 --> 03:11.040
Well, shouldn’t they have 
a feeling of jealousy? 


03:11.040 --> 03:13.042
If they don’t, 
there’s something wrong. 


03:13.042 --> 03:15.177
So in that situation, 


03:15.177 --> 03:17.314
jealousy is positive. 


03:17.313 --> 03:19.315
Well, in a similar way, 


03:19.315 --> 03:21.450
it’s wrong for us to be anxious 


03:21.450 --> 03:23.653
about material things, 


03:23.653 --> 03:26.355
trying to get ahead in the world, 
and so on. 


03:26.355 --> 03:28.357
But it’s appropriate 


03:28.357 --> 03:30.560
that we have a wholesome, 


03:30.560 --> 03:33.295
positive anxiety or concern 


03:33.295 --> 03:35.298
for one another.


03:35.298 --> 03:37.600
So, what is this positive, 


03:37.600 --> 03:39.602
wholesome concern? 


03:39.602 --> 03:42.205
Well, first of all, 
let’s say what it isn’t. 


03:42.205 --> 03:45.475
First Peter 4:15, 


03:45.475 --> 03:48.010
you can check on that later, 
but I’m sure you remember, 


03:48.010 --> 03:51.480
it says we should not be 
“a busybody.” 


03:51.480 --> 03:54.283
So this anxious concern 
doesn’t mean 


03:54.283 --> 03:57.820
that we’re trying to find out 
everything about this person. 


03:57.820 --> 04:02.092
Then, also, 1 Timothy 5:13 


04:02.092 --> 04:04.094
speaks of “gossipers . . . 


04:04.093 --> 04:07.096
meddlers 
in other people’s affairs.” 


04:07.097 --> 04:10.500
So if we were to be anxious 
in that regard, 


04:10.500 --> 04:12.535
that would be negative. 


04:12.535 --> 04:15.137
It wouldn’t be appropriate, 
would it? 


04:15.137 --> 04:19.542
So how can we show 
this wholesome concern 


04:19.542 --> 04:22.245
or anxiety for one another? 


04:22.245 --> 04:24.580
Well, over the years, 
The Watchtower has made 


04:24.580 --> 04:26.582
many comments on this. 


04:26.582 --> 04:29.252
But perhaps we could say 
there are four different things 


04:29.252 --> 04:33.355
that we could do that would show 
this mutual concern.


04:33.355 --> 04:35.358
The first one is 


04:35.358 --> 04:38.695
to take personal interest 
in others. 


04:38.695 --> 04:41.830
Yes, genuine interest, 
not just asking them, 


04:41.830 --> 04:44.733
“How are you?” 
and not waiting for an answer 


04:44.733 --> 04:48.671
but trying to see 
what’s happening in their lives 


04:48.672 --> 04:51.140
and show concern for them.


04:51.140 --> 04:55.010
The second way 
is by noting things 


04:55.010 --> 04:57.813
that they do or say 
that we can commend 


04:57.813 --> 04:59.815
and then encourage them. 


04:59.815 --> 05:03.018
So looking for opportunities 
to encourage one another 


05:03.018 --> 05:07.000
is another way that we show 
that we have this mutual concern.


05:08.057 --> 05:10.560
The third way 
that was mentioned 


05:10.560 --> 05:12.728
in our text comments 
this morning 


05:12.728 --> 05:14.863
is that we need to try and see 


05:14.863 --> 05:17.000
the potential 
in others for good. 


05:18.600 --> 05:22.605
We can think 
of the example of Barnabas. 


05:22.605 --> 05:25.875
Remember, Mark disappointed 


05:25.875 --> 05:29.412
both Barnabas and Paul 
during the first missionary journey, 


05:29.412 --> 05:32.015
and yet Barnabas 
didn’t give up on him. 


05:32.015 --> 05:36.518
He saw there was some
potential there for Mark to be better, 


05:36.518 --> 05:40.856
to be used in a more interesting way 
in the future. 


05:40.857 --> 05:44.660
So Barnabas 
encouraged that quality 


05:44.660 --> 05:47.997
in Mark, and, of course, 
we realize what the result was. 


05:47.997 --> 05:51.367
Later Mark was very useful 
not only to Barnabas 


05:51.367 --> 05:54.337
but also to Paul, and, 
of course, he had the privilege 


05:54.337 --> 05:57.340
of writing an account 
of Jesus’ life. 


05:57.340 --> 05:59.742
So, what a wonderful privilege he had. 


05:59.742 --> 06:02.845
So like Barnabas, 
we need to look at younger ones, 


06:02.845 --> 06:05.982
newer ones, 
and even everybody 


06:05.982 --> 06:09.185
to see if we can see 
potential for improvement 


06:09.185 --> 06:12.055
and then encourage them 
to be able to reach out 


06:12.055 --> 06:14.223
for further activity.


06:14.223 --> 06:16.758
The fourth point 
we’d like to mention 


06:16.758 --> 06:21.630
is the need for us to show 
confidence in others. 


06:21.630 --> 06:25.267
The apostle Paul 
was a good example of this. 


06:25.267 --> 06:29.172
If we take our Bibles 
and turn to the book of Hebrews, 


06:29.172 --> 06:31.774
and you remember 
when Paul was writing 


06:31.773 --> 06:34.110
to the Hebrew Christians, 


06:34.110 --> 06:37.847
there were many things he had 
to mention that were negative. 


06:37.847 --> 06:40.917
For example, 
some were drifting away; 


06:40.917 --> 06:42.952
they were distracted. 


06:42.952 --> 06:46.355
Others had allowed 
their hearts to harden. 


06:46.355 --> 06:49.225
Yet others 
really were still immature 


06:49.225 --> 06:51.693
when it came 
to Christian living. 


06:51.693 --> 06:54.496
They were feeding, as it were, 
on ‘the milk of the word.’ 


06:54.497 --> 06:58.267
They couldn’t eat properly 
in a spiritual sense. 


06:58.267 --> 07:02.472
So those things could have perhaps 
played on Paul’s mind, 


07:02.472 --> 07:05.542
and perhaps he could have
become quite negative. 


07:05.542 --> 07:10.212
But notice in Hebrews 10:39 


07:10.212 --> 07:14.950
what Paul says 
to these brothers and sisters, 


07:14.950 --> 07:17.587
Hebrews 10:39: 


07:17.587 --> 07:21.724
“Now we are not the sort 
who shrink back to destruction, 


07:21.723 --> 07:25.293
but the sort who have faith 
for the preserving of our lives.” 


07:25.293 --> 07:27.363
Now, isn’t that 
a positive comment? 


07:27.363 --> 07:30.065
A positive comment 
made to those 


07:30.065 --> 07:33.068
who perhaps 
were neglecting to do 


07:33.068 --> 07:35.203
certain things 
that they should have done. 


07:35.203 --> 07:37.540
And we notice there too 
that Paul says: 


07:37.540 --> 07:39.875
“Now we are not the sort.” 


07:39.875 --> 07:43.000
So he includes himself 
along with these other brothers.


07:44.413 --> 07:47.081
How could Paul 
have such confidence 


07:47.082 --> 07:49.085
when writing 
to those who needed 


07:49.085 --> 07:52.488
such a lot of counsel? 


07:52.488 --> 07:54.490
Well, The Watchtower 
made two points. 


07:54.490 --> 07:57.427
It said: 
First of all, Paul tried; 


07:57.427 --> 08:01.030
he endeavored to imitate 
the viewpoint of Jehovah God. 


08:01.030 --> 08:03.732
Jehovah looks 
at imperfect humans, 


08:03.732 --> 08:05.735
he sees their potential, 


08:05.735 --> 08:07.803
and he has confidence 


08:07.803 --> 08:10.338
that if they want 
to do what’s right, 


08:10.338 --> 08:13.008
with his help 
they’ll be able to do it. 


08:13.008 --> 08:15.143
And the second area 


08:15.143 --> 08:19.015
that Paul was able 
to trust in was holy spirit. 


08:19.015 --> 08:22.918
He realized 
that with holy spirit, 


08:22.918 --> 08:26.221
someone can gain the power 
beyond what is normal 


08:26.222 --> 08:30.660
and overcome all sorts 
of fleshly desires and problems. 


08:30.660 --> 08:33.428
So those two reasons then


08:33.428 --> 08:35.998
—Paul’s endeavoring 
to imitate Jehovah 


08:35.998 --> 08:38.500
and also his belief 
in the power of holy spirit


08:38.500 --> 08:41.170
—helped him to be confident, 


08:41.170 --> 08:43.172
to be positive with regard 


08:43.172 --> 08:45.742
to those brothers and sisters.


08:45.742 --> 08:47.810
So, what can we see with regard 


08:47.810 --> 08:50.547
to us giving a good word 
at the right time? 


08:50.547 --> 08:55.017
Well, we need to have 
mutual concern for one another. 


08:55.017 --> 08:58.020
Not the type of concern 
that we’re busybodies 


08:58.020 --> 09:00.422
or meddlers 
in other people’s affairs. 


09:00.422 --> 09:02.425
But what were 
those four points? 


09:02.425 --> 09:05.662
First of all, 
take personal interest in others, 


09:05.662 --> 09:07.697
commend and encourage them, 


09:07.697 --> 09:10.032
see the potential in them for good, 


09:10.032 --> 09:12.569
and then express confidence. 


09:12.568 --> 09:15.170
If we do that, 
then we can be sure 


09:15.170 --> 09:17.440
that in a positive way 
each one of us 


09:17.440 --> 09:30.537
is showing mutual concern.

00:00 When you look  at the words in the way
00:03 that the apostle Paul worded things,
00:06 he said: “I live by faith  in the Son of God,
00:09 who loved me  and handed himself over for me.”
00:13 And we can really see  the very personal nature
00:16 of the ransom to the apostle Paul.
00:18 And it’s important for us to do
00:20 —as our commenters  pointed out nicely—
00:23 it is important for us  to personalize the ransom.
00:26 The apostle Paul, in Hebrews 6:5,
00:30 showed the very personal nature;
00:32 he understood the personal nature
00:34 of the Bible and the ransom.
00:37 In Hebrews 6:5,
00:40 he uses this expression:
00:42 “And who have tasted  the fine word of God
00:46 and powers  of the coming system of things.”
00:48 Well, it’s interesting  he used the word “taste.”
00:51 Taste is something very personal.
00:52 Somebody can’t taste  something for you.
00:55 You have to put it  in your mouth in order
00:57 to really know  what it’s going to taste like.
00:59 So, too, with the ransom.
01:01 And what practical ways  can we “taste,”
01:04 or personalize,  the ransom for us?
01:06 Let’s just consider  a couple this morning.
01:09 One is personal fears.
01:11 ‘Does God really love me?
01:13 Am I worthy of love?’
01:15 Sometimes the “what-ifs”  and their cousins, the “could-bes,”
01:19 they come to live and never leave.
01:22 You know, if bad things  or trials or difficulties happen to us,
01:26 we begin to reason,  ‘Well, Jehovah God maybe doesn’t love me.’
01:30 There’s really strong reason for us
01:32 to somehow believe  in cause and effect.
01:34 We see the cause of things and effect, and so after a while,
01:37 everything that happens to us,  we begin to look at some cause
01:40 and even begin to think  that maybe Jehovah
01:42 doesn’t love us.
01:45 Even if we’re a good person
01:47 and bad things happen to us,  we begin to wonder,
01:51 ‘Others my age are healthy.’
01:53 Some leaving  or changing assignments,
01:56 you hear everything  falls into place
01:58 for them within a few weeks.
02:00 ‘I’m still looking for a job.  I’m still looking for work.’
02:04 In other words,  do not try to reason
02:07 that just because things  don’t work out perfectly
02:09 that Jehovah doesn’t love us.
02:11 It’s not true.
02:12 We can still be doing very,  very good things,
02:15 and yet some difficulties  can face us.
02:18 For example,  you’re driving down the road,
02:20 obeying all the traffic laws.
02:22 You pull up to a red light,  you stop,
02:25 it turns green, you go through it,  and you get broadsided
02:28 by some knucklehead who went  through the red light on the other side.
02:32 Well, that’s not your fault.
02:34 Are you going to say:  “Well, you know what?
02:37 I’m not going to obey traffic laws anymore. See, it doesn’t pay!”
02:40 Well, no!
02:41 It was his fault for running  through the traffic light.
02:45 And sometimes bad, or difficult,  things can happen to us.
02:49 It’s not our fault
02:51 or it’s not any sign  that Jehovah doesn’t love us.
02:53 So how can reflecting  on the ransom help us
02:56 when we have these kinds  of personal fears?
02:59 Well, we could start with,  Why do we have the ransom?
03:02 Well, because some very bad things
03:04 were happening  to some good people
03:06 —us— Adam and Eve’s descendants.
03:09 I mean,  Adam sinned and Eve sinned,
03:12 yet we suffer.
03:14 The ransom is Jehovah’s solution
03:17 for those who appreciate it.
03:19 It’s his way of telling us,
03:21 ‘I know bad things are happening,
03:23 and I’m working to fix it.’
03:25 Yes, when we reflect  on the reason
03:28 why Jehovah God  gave us the ransom,
03:30 it helps us to know  that Jehovah knows we suffer
03:33 from cancer and old age  and the sins and mistakes of others
03:36 and even our own imperfections.
03:39 See, tasting of the ransom in this way
03:42 means we’ll not get the feeling
03:44 that Jehovah doesn’t love us  when trials befall us.
03:47 To the contrary, the ransom
03:50 is the greatest expression  of Jehovah’s and Jesus’ love for us
03:54 and their desire to fix  the current mess we live in now.
03:58 How about,  let’s consider a second way
04:00 that we could reflect  on the ransom,
04:02 and that is the death  of someone close to us.
04:06 Anyone who’s had someone  very close to them die
04:09 knows the very helpless feeling  that you have,
04:12 knowing that there’s  really nothing you can do.
04:16 In that instant when they die,  your hope
04:19 —your faith in the resurrection  based on the ransom—
04:23 becomes more real to you  than any time in your entire life.
04:28 In Acts 17:31,
04:31 in a beautiful speech  that the apostle Paul gave,
04:34 he highlights
04:36 that Jesus’ death
04:39 and resurrection and the ransom  was really a guarantee
04:42 that we have.
04:44 Here in Acts 17:31,
04:48 he says: “Because he has set a day  on which he purposes
04:51 “to judge the inhabited earth  in righteousness
04:54 “by a man  whom he has appointed,
04:56 “and he has provided  a guarantee
04:59 “to all men  by resurrecting him
05:02 from the dead.”
05:04 So personalizing the ransom
05:07 and all that it makes possible
05:09 helps us to know that the resurrection is,  not just possible,
05:12 but that Jehovah  and Jesus want to resurrect
05:15 our mother, our father,
05:17 our beloved husband or a wife.
05:21 They care about each person
05:24 that has ever lived or died
05:27 and know them  so intimately and so completely
05:29 that they can resurrect them completely  with all their memories
05:32 and personality completely  as we knew them.
05:36 I mean, how much more personal
05:38 could God’s love for us  become than that?
05:42 You know, to bring our loved ones  back from the dead
05:45 is the ultimate statement
05:48 of Jehovah’s personal interest
05:50 in each and every human being.
05:54 We are not just collateral damage
05:58 in Satan’s war on Jehovah.
06:01 The ransom is the way
06:03 that Jehovah plans  to undo all the harm
06:05 that Satan has caused
06:07 since the death of Adam and Eve.
06:10 In fact, the resurrection  is really Jehovah’s way
06:14 of proving all of Satan’s lies
06:16 completely false.
06:19 When you think about it today,  Satan can perpetrate
06:21 all kinds of lies about what happens  to people after they die.
06:24 ‘They’re going to go here,  they’re going to go there,
06:26 ‘they’re going to go to some afterlife,  they’re going to go to some paradise,
06:28 they’re going to come back  as some animal.’
06:31 But in the new world,
06:33 when the vast majority of people
06:35 have been resurrected,
06:38 that lie isn’t going  to be sold anymore.
06:42 Each one can tell everyone
06:44 what happened to them  when they died
06:46 —nothing,
06:48 no afterlife.
06:51 Everyone will know  that it’s nonexistence.
06:55 That lie won’t work.
06:57 See, Jehovah knew
06:59 that we would hurt terribly
07:02 at the death of loved ones,
07:04 so he gave us the ransom
07:07 as his way of telling us,
07:09 ‘I know it hurts,  but please know
07:13 that I have  the perfect solution in mind.’
07:16 Now, we’ve just considered two ways
07:19 to reflect and meditate on the ransom,
07:21 like the apostle Paul did,  to really personalize it.
07:24 We just talked about personal fears
07:26 and the resurrection,
07:30 the death of someone close to us.
07:32 Imagine how many more ways
07:34 we can benefit today
07:37 from meditating on the ransom
07:39 and how it affects us personally.

While we enjoy relative freedom
in many countries around the world,

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:08.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at times governments impose

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:11.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bans or restrictions on the preaching work.

Brother Stephanos Demsas serves

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:17.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a special pioneer
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with his wife, Leteberhan.

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:24.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith was tested
during many years of adversity.

00:00:24.307 --> 00:00:27.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped them champion the truth?

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:31.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their story began in what is today Eritrea.

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:40.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I come from a family of nine children.

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:43.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I joined the navy in 1956.

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was during the time

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My brother Gebrehiwot

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked me to come to Asmara.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so impressed
with what he shared with me

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that for the rest of my vacation,

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible study became my priority.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:06.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, I was discharged from the navy
and started working in Addis Ababa,

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I was able to continue studying the Bible
and get baptized.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leti was also doing the same.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:22.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1960, I was attending a nursing college.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, a nurse shared
some interesting thoughts with me

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Bible.

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:29.539 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Ten other student nurses

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.274 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
also showed interest,

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the college threatened us with dismissal

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there was a ban
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were shown from the Bible

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:45.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why true Christians are persecuted,

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we renewed our determination.

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, five of us were baptized.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, I met Stephanos,
and we were married in 1964.

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the ban,
the brothers were meeting in small groups.

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:07.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our trust was in Jehovah, and we made
the preaching work a matter of prayer,

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:09.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that he would help us.

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We saw evidence of this

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.782 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the underground production

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:14.450 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers were of modest means,

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:20.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they used what they had
to buy a hand-operated duplicating machine

00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:22.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was used in our home.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After returning from our secular work,

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leti and I would get busy
making copies of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:30.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would play music
so our neighbors wouldn’t hear

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sound of the duplicator.

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.673 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1974,

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:40.043 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed.

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:42.078 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This Communist government quickly began

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:45.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a campaign called “Red Terror”

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against any supposed political opposer.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:52.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just having a typewriter
or a duplicating machine

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:55.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could put you in prison
or even have you killed.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:02:59.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picking up a paper from the street

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:01.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with something printed on it
against the government

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could put one’s life in danger.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was common for people to disappear.

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:12.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, my youngest brother, Eyob,
was a victim.

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:14.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He disappeared on his way home

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was never seen again.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:26.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the situation being very dangerous,
we were quite concerned

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
raising our daughter, Janet.

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we fully trusted in Jehovah,

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we felt his loving protection.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From time to time, sections of the city

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were suddenly blockaded.

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This happened one morning as a translator

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:46.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was heading to our home
to deliver stencils for printing.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:51.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Urgently, he telephoned informing us
that a house-to-house search

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:53.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was under way.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our house was full of publications

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:59.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with a duplicator and typewriters!

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just after the phone call,

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three soldiers
entered our compound to search.

00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:10.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, I prayed silently

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah would blind them.

00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:14.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Entering the room where the duplicator

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stacks
of freshly printed literature were,

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one soldier asked, “What is all this?”

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, this is a duplicator that we use

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to print these Bible materials.”

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:30.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Completing his search,
he went outside to the commander,

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:33.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who asked him, “What did you find?”

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:36.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To our utter amazement,
after seeing everything,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he answered: “Nothing!

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t find anything here.”

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1970’s and into the early 1980’s,

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.971 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
another wave of vicious persecution occurred.

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:49.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A number of faithful brothers

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:53.376 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken from my workplace
because of my neutral stand

00:04:57.647 --> 00:04:59.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put in prison.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think about living
through those difficult times,

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am reminded of Isaiah 54:17

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:09.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah promised us:

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:13.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No weapon formed against you
will have any success.”

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:17.767 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Finally, in 1991,

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:19.635 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a liberal government came to power.

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:22.138 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They gave us legal recognition

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:24.140 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and freedom of worship.

00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:29.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With these difficult, dangerous years
now behind us,

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were assigned to the circuit work

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Eritrea and Ethiopia.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By now, Eritrea was becoming
an independent country,

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this brought about

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
new challenges for the brothers.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:44.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some young brothers were arrested

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and imprisoned

00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:47.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because of their Christian stand.

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:50.933 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote at Hebrews 13:3:

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.935 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as though you were imprisoned with them.”

00:05:56.372 --> 00:06:00.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After enjoying the circuit work for 15 years,

00:06:00.443 --> 00:06:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we faced another change.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were invited to serve at Bethel

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:07.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as full-time commuters.

00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:10.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has helped us to endure
through the ban years

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to adjust to the many changes

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our spiritual study program.

00:06:16.692 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in full agreement

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jeremiah 17:7:

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Blessed is the man
who puts his trust in Jehovah.”

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also brings us much happiness

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know that our daughter, Janet,

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been serving as a regular pioneer
for 20 years now.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each assignment has had its challenges

00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:40.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many rewards and blessings.

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not young anymore;

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m 77 years old.

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m 74 years old.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now serving as special pioneers.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about all the changes
that we’ve been through,

00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:57.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realize that the words at Isaiah 6:8:

00:06:57.266 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here I am! Send me!”

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are, not just for young people,
but for all of us.

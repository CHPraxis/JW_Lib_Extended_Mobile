00:00:02 While we enjoy relative freedom in many countries around the world,
00:00:06 at times governments impose
00:00:08 bans or restrictions on the preaching work.
00:00:11 Brother Stephanos Demsas serves
00:00:13 as a special pioneer in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
00:00:17 along with his wife, Leteberhan.
00:00:20 Their faith was tested during many years of adversity.
00:00:24 What helped them champion the truth?
00:00:27 Their story began in what is today Eritrea.
00:00:37 I come from a family of nine children.
00:00:40 I joined the navy in 1956.
00:00:43 That was during the time
00:00:44 when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.
00:00:46 My brother Gebrehiwot
00:00:48 asked me to come to Asmara.
00:00:51 He was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:53 I was so impressed with what he shared with me
00:00:56 that for the rest of my vacation,
00:00:59 Bible study became my priority.
00:01:02 In time, I was discharged from the navy and started working in Addis Ababa,
00:01:06 so I was able to continue studying the Bible and get baptized.
00:01:12 Leti was also doing the same.
00:01:18 In 1960, I was attending a nursing college.
00:01:22 There, a nurse shared some interesting thoughts with me
00:01:25 from the Bible.
00:01:27 Ten other student nurses
00:01:29 also showed interest,
00:01:31 but the college threatened us with dismissal
00:01:35 because there was a ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:39 When we were shown from the Bible
00:01:41 why true Christians are persecuted,
00:01:45 we renewed our determination.
00:01:48 Eventually, five of us were baptized.
00:01:51 In time, I met Stephanos, and we were married in 1964.
00:01:58 Because of the ban, the brothers were meeting in small groups.
00:02:02 Our trust was in Jehovah, and we made the preaching work a matter of prayer,
00:02:07 confident that he would help us.
00:02:09 We saw evidence of this
00:02:11 with the underground production
00:02:12 of The Watchtower.
00:02:14 Our brothers were of modest means,
00:02:16 but they used what they had to buy a hand-operated duplicating machine
00:02:20 which was used in our home.
00:02:22 After returning from our secular work,
00:02:24 Leti and I would get busy making copies of The Watchtower.
00:02:28 We would play music so our neighbors wouldn’t hear
00:02:30 the sound of the duplicator.
00:02:34 In 1974,
00:02:36 Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed.
00:02:40 This Communist government quickly began
00:02:42 a campaign called “Red Terror”
00:02:45 against any supposed political opposer.
00:02:48 Now, just having a typewriter or a duplicating machine
00:02:52 could put you in prison or even have you killed.
00:02:57 Picking up a paper from the street
00:02:59 with something printed on it against the government
00:03:01 could put one’s life in danger.
00:03:04 It was common for people to disappear.
00:03:07 Sadly, my youngest brother, Eyob, was a victim.
00:03:12 He disappeared on his way home
00:03:14 and was never seen again.
00:03:21 With the situation being very dangerous, we were quite concerned
00:03:26 raising our daughter, Janet.
00:03:29 But as we fully trusted in Jehovah,
00:03:32 we felt his loving protection.
00:03:35 From time to time, sections of the city
00:03:37 were suddenly blockaded.
00:03:39 This happened one morning as a translator
00:03:42 was heading to our home to deliver stencils for printing.
00:03:46 Urgently, he telephoned informing us that a house-to-house search
00:03:51 was under way.
00:03:53 Our house was full of publications
00:03:55 along with a duplicator and typewriters!
00:03:59 Just after the phone call,
00:04:01 three soldiers entered our compound to search.
00:04:06 At that moment, I prayed silently
00:04:10 that Jehovah would blind them.
00:04:12 Entering the room where the duplicator
00:04:14 and stacks of freshly printed literature were,
00:04:17 one soldier asked, “What is all this?”
00:04:21 “Oh, this is a duplicator that we use
00:04:24 to print these Bible materials.”
00:04:26 Completing his search, he went outside to the commander,
00:04:30 who asked him, “What did you find?”
00:04:33 To our utter amazement, after seeing everything,
00:04:36 he answered: “Nothing!
00:04:38 We won’t find anything here.”
00:04:41 In the late 1970’s and into the early 1980’s,
00:04:44 another wave of vicious persecution occurred.
00:04:47 A number of faithful brothers
00:04:49 were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered.
00:04:54 I was taken from my workplace because of my neutral stand
00:04:57 and put in prison.
00:05:00 When I think about living through those difficult times,
00:05:04 I am reminded of Isaiah 54:17
00:05:07 where Jehovah promised us:
00:05:09 “No weapon formed against you will have any success.”
00:05:15 Finally, in 1991,
00:05:17 a liberal government came to power.
00:05:19 They gave us legal recognition
00:05:22 and freedom of worship.
00:05:25 With these difficult, dangerous years now behind us,
00:05:29 we were assigned to the circuit work
00:05:31 in Eritrea and Ethiopia.
00:05:37 By now, Eritrea was becoming an independent country,
00:05:39 and this brought about
00:05:41 new challenges for the brothers.
00:05:42 Some young brothers were arrested
00:05:44 and imprisoned
00:05:45 because of their Christian stand.
00:05:47 Paul wrote at Hebrews 13:3:
00:05:50 “Keep in mind those in prison,
00:05:52 as though you were imprisoned with them.”
00:05:56 After enjoying the circuit work for 15 years,
00:06:00 we faced another change.
00:06:02 We were invited to serve at Bethel
00:06:05 as full-time commuters.
00:06:07 What has helped us to endure through the ban years
00:06:10 and to adjust to the many changes
00:06:13 is our spiritual study program.
00:06:16 We’re in full agreement
00:06:19 with Jeremiah 17:7:
00:06:21 “Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah.”
00:06:26 It also brings us much happiness
00:06:28 to know that our daughter, Janet,
00:06:31 has been serving as a regular pioneer for 20 years now.
00:06:36 Each assignment has had its challenges
00:06:38 but many rewards and blessings.
00:06:41 I’m not young anymore;
00:06:42 I’m 77 years old.
00:06:45 And I’m 74 years old.
00:06:47 We are now serving as special pioneers.
00:06:50 When we think about all the changes that we’ve been through,
00:06:54 we realize that the words at Isaiah 6:8:
00:06:57 “Here I am! Send me!”
00:06:59 are, not just for young people, but for all of us.

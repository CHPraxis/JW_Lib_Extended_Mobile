00:01.985 --> 00:06.488
What if we face a situation 
in which we have access to nothing? 


00:06.488 --> 00:09.325
We are not allowed 
to have a Bible, 


00:09.325 --> 00:11.928
no literature with illustrations, 


00:11.928 --> 00:15.431
no videos, 
and no audio recordings. 


00:15.432 --> 00:17.534
What do we do? 


00:17.533 --> 00:21.003
Our recollection 
of what we have read in the past 


00:21.003 --> 00:24.473
can keep our spirituality intact. 


00:24.473 --> 00:28.645
One of our brothers from Russia 
faced such a situation. 


00:28.645 --> 00:31.000
Notice what helped him.


00:37.087 --> 00:40.724
The year was 1963.


00:40.723 --> 00:43.000
I was 36 at the time. 


00:45.195 --> 00:48.965
The KGB searched my home 
and found some Bible literature 


00:48.965 --> 00:52.000
and some publishers’ field service reports. 


00:53.570 --> 00:56.438
So I was sentenced 
to five years of imprisonment 


00:56.438 --> 00:58.941
for being an organizer. 


00:58.942 --> 01:02.000
That was the third time 
I had been imprisoned.


01:03.747 --> 01:06.449
Some brothers and sisters 
and I went to the court 


01:06.448 --> 01:09.618
to support Brother Vladimir. 


01:09.618 --> 01:12.321
When he saw us, 
he clasped his hands 


01:12.322 --> 01:16.000
and declared, 
“Everything is fine!” 


01:18.695 --> 01:20.863
A KGB officer told me 


01:20.863 --> 01:23.398
that the only reason 
I hadn’t been imprisoned 


01:23.398 --> 01:25.468
was because I had six children. 


01:25.468 --> 01:27.470
But Vladimir was single.


01:27.470 --> 01:30.473
I was just glad 
that they had arrested me and not him, 


01:30.473 --> 01:33.000
because I didn’t have a family. 


01:37.647 --> 01:41.885
In the camp, I didn’t have a Bible 
or any Bible literature at all. 


01:41.885 --> 01:45.000
All I had to keep me going 
was the knowledge I already had.


01:47.323 --> 01:49.758
We prayed for him, 
and we sent greetings 


01:49.758 --> 01:52.000
and encouraging messages 
to him through his relatives.


01:54.230 --> 01:56.365
Due to the strict censorship 
in the camp,


01:56.365 --> 01:59.235
we were not allowed 
to write anything spiritual in our letters 


01:59.235 --> 02:01.270
to encourage each other. 


02:01.270 --> 02:05.000
If we did, 
the letters were confiscated. 


02:06.175 --> 02:11.000
But I really wanted to send Brother Mikhail 
something encouraging. 


02:12.882 --> 02:15.619
I was growing flowers 
with a group of inmates in the camp. 


02:15.618 --> 02:17.720
So instead of a sending him a letter, 


02:17.720 --> 02:21.000
I decided to send him 
a bouquet of flowers.


02:23.927 --> 02:27.530
Vladimir’s sister Olga came to our home, 


02:27.530 --> 02:32.000
and she brought me a beautiful bouquet 
of flowers from Vladimir. 


02:36.338 --> 02:40.443
I couldn’t believe 
that I had received fresh flowers 


02:40.443 --> 02:45.781
from behind a barbed-wire fence
—from inside the camp. 


02:45.782 --> 02:48.350
I was so touched 
by his act of kindness 


02:48.350 --> 02:51.053
that my heart moved me 
to write down some verses, 


02:51.053 --> 02:55.000
a poem, 
which I called “The Bouquet.”


02:57.360 --> 03:00.630
My relatives came 
and visited me in the prison 


03:00.630 --> 03:03.600
and delivered to me the poem. 


03:03.600 --> 03:06.468
I kept the poem 
in a very secret place. 


03:06.468 --> 03:08.470
It could have been confiscated, 


03:08.470 --> 03:12.000
and I could have been punished 
because it was about God.


03:13.175 --> 03:16.178
After Vladimir was released from prison, 


03:16.178 --> 03:20.250
well, he told me that my poem 
had really strengthened him 


03:20.250 --> 03:22.385
and that he had often taken it out 


03:22.385 --> 03:26.000
of its secret hiding place 
to read it over and over again.


03:28.023 --> 03:31.060
If it hadn’t been for the support 
I received from Jehovah 


03:31.060 --> 03:33.062
and the prayers of friends, 


03:33.062 --> 03:36.000
it would have been much harder 
for me to serve my time. 


03:37.467 --> 03:40.904
The poem that I had received 
helped me not to feel 


03:40.903 --> 03:42.905
separated from my friends 


03:42.905 --> 03:45.000
and, most importantly, 
from Jehovah.


03:48.410 --> 03:51.013
So many years have now gone by. 


03:51.013 --> 03:54.483
But we have remained firm 
through the difficult times, 


03:54.483 --> 03:57.000
and we continue serving Jehovah. 


04:00.457 --> 04:04.127
Lately, Vladimir and I have been trying 
to keep in touch by phone, 


04:04.127 --> 04:07.864
but we haven’t seen each other 
for seven years. 


04:07.863 --> 04:10.000
I would really love 
to see Vladimir again.


04:13.502 --> 04:16.000
He doesn’t know 
that I’ve decided to go and visit him. 


04:17.073 --> 04:20.000
I hope that he likes the surprise.


04:52.908 --> 04:55.911
“I see these flowers, 
grown by hands


04:55.912 --> 04:58.749
“Hardened from work 
that prison demands.


04:58.748 --> 05:01.016
“My friend has sent a bouquet.


05:01.017 --> 05:03.654
“Prison three times 
prevented our meeting,


05:03.653 --> 05:07.456
“But you found a way 
to convey a greeting.


05:07.457 --> 05:10.394
“My joy now moves me to say:


05:10.393 --> 05:13.395
“‘Greetings, my brother, 
with all of my heart.


05:13.395 --> 05:16.532
“‘You gave me strength, 
although we’re apart.


05:16.532 --> 05:19.569
“‘While you have 
countless trials withstood,


05:19.568 --> 05:22.738
“‘You’ve strengthened me 
as best you could.


05:22.738 --> 05:26.141
“‘Greetings, my friend 
on that narrow road,


05:26.142 --> 05:29.479
“‘You were always with me 
through hardships untold.


05:29.478 --> 05:32.648
“‘We worked so hard 
for spiritual treasure.


05:32.648 --> 05:36.218
“‘Blessed we were 
for sticking together.


05:36.218 --> 05:39.721
“‘Cruelly, my friend, 
you were taken from me


05:39.722 --> 05:42.425
“‘When they tried 
to break our integrity.


05:42.425 --> 05:45.862
“‘But God stood by us 
and helped us to cope.


05:45.862 --> 05:50.000
“‘Conquer the evil, we did, 
for our dear Kingdom hope.


05:51.133 --> 05:54.570
“‘How grateful we are 
and always will be


05:54.570 --> 05:57.873
“‘For spiritual vision 
 by which we can see


05:57.873 --> 06:01.710
“‘The crown of life 
promised to those


06:01.710 --> 06:05.080
“‘Who stay on the loyal course 
they chose.


06:05.080 --> 06:08.483
“‘How much you’ve endured, 
long-suffering friend.


06:08.483 --> 06:11.486
“‘But Jehovah’s mercy 
will never end.


06:11.487 --> 06:14.590
“‘On a paradise earth 
our hands will unite,


06:14.590 --> 06:18.093
“‘Planting more flowers 
to gladden His sight.


06:18.093 --> 06:21.763
“‘Christ Jesus will heal us 
during his reign,


06:21.763 --> 06:25.000
“‘So no trace of sin 
will ever remain.


06:25.000 --> 06:27.803
“‘And far from the trials 
that we overcame,


06:27.803 --> 06:31.000
Forever we’ll praise 
Jehovah’s great name!’”


06:37.647 --> 06:40.650
True friends are such a blessing 
from Jehovah, 


06:40.650 --> 06:44.000
and you don’t really know 
who they are until disaster strikes.


06:49.292 --> 06:53.695
During my whole life, 
walking in the way of the truth, 


06:53.695 --> 06:58.600
I have often thought 
about the words of Psalm 119:63, 


06:58.600 --> 07:00.202
where it says: 


07:00.202 --> 07:02.705
“I am a friend of all who fear you 


07:02.705 --> 07:05.207
and of those who keep your orders.”


07:05.207 --> 07:08.779
Our serving side by side 
in the Kingdom work 


07:08.778 --> 07:11.000
has strengthened our friendship.


07:14.650 --> 07:18.000
It is only that sort of friendship 
that will last forever!


07:24.627 --> 07:26.995
What a beautiful friendship! 


07:26.995 --> 07:31.733
Our brotherhood truly is 
a blessing from Jehovah. 


07:31.733 --> 07:36.605
Brother Mikhail Savitsky spent many years 
as a circuit overseer,


07:36.605 --> 07:41.010
helping the Kingdom work progress 
in Siberia, northern Caucasus, 


07:41.010 --> 07:44.280
and the countries 
of Georgia and Armenia. 


07:44.280 --> 07:48.985
In 1992, he had the privilege 
of being one of those 


07:48.985 --> 07:53.000
who signed the documents that confirmed 
legal recognition of our work in Russia. 


07:55.157 --> 07:57.760
However, we regret to inform you 


07:57.760 --> 08:00.830
that some time 
after this segment was produced, 


08:00.830 --> 08:04.533
Brother Vladimir Varkholik 
fell asleep in death. 


08:04.533 --> 08:06.535
He was 88 years old 


08:06.535 --> 08:10.405
and had served Jehovah faithfully 
for over 59 years. 


08:10.405 --> 08:12.408
At the time of his death, 


08:12.408 --> 08:15.645
he had served as a pioneer 
for some 26 years 


08:15.645 --> 08:20.348
and as an elder 
in the congregation for 43 years. 


08:20.348 --> 08:24.453
From his interview, 
you can clearly see the faith 


08:24.453 --> 08:29.425
that kept his spirituality strong 
through 12 years of imprisonment. 


08:29.425 --> 08:32.928
And he is a good example for us. 


08:32.928 --> 08:37.900
Did you notice one aspect 
of his circumstances while incarcerated? 


08:37.900 --> 08:39.968
He said: 


08:39.968 --> 08:43.171
“In the camp, 
I didn’t have a Bible 


08:43.172 --> 08:45.507
“or any Bible literature at all. 


08:45.507 --> 08:47.810
“All I had to keep me going 


08:47.810 --> 08:50.212
was the knowledge I already had.” 


08:50.212 --> 08:52.449
That could happen to us. 


08:52.448 --> 08:56.051
When persecution starts, 
we need to be prepared. 


08:56.052 --> 08:59.422
That’s one reason 
why it is so important 


08:59.422 --> 09:01.924
not to neglect 
our study of the Bible 


09:01.923 --> 09:14.286
while we have the opportunity.

00:00 We’ve now invited
00:03 Brother and Sister Ortiz  from New Britain, Connecticut,
00:06 to visit our studio.
00:08 Brother Ortiz serves as an elder  and as a regular pioneer.
00:12 He’s had many additional privileges  of service over the years.
00:15 And Linnette has been regular pioneering  for over six years.
00:20 However, the reason we wanted  to talk with them is that thus far
00:25 they have successfully countered  Satan’s attacks on their family.
00:29 We’d like to hear  how they accomplished this.
00:32 First of all, Freddie,
00:34 tell us a little bit  about your family.
00:36 Neither Linnette nor I  were raised in the truth.
00:40 However, we met,  and we fell in love.
00:42 At that time,  marriage was not for me.
00:45 So we started  a romantic relationship for two years
00:48 before we started attending  the first meeting at the Kingdom Hall.
00:52 Soon thereafter,  we started studying the Bible;
00:55 and we took two studies per week;  we knew this was the truth.
00:58 But also we learned
01:00 how Jehovah sees immorality,  so we needed to do some changes.
01:03 Linnette’s parents  wanted her to continue
01:07 with her education,  so we needed to change our behavior.
01:12 So two years after,
01:14 we did the changes.
01:17 Number one  because we did love Jehovah.
01:19 Number two because we loved  what we were learning.
01:22 It was worth it  to follow Bible principles.
01:26 So two years later,  we got married
01:28 and we got baptized —and we got married.
01:31 Very good.
01:32 So, Linnette, you were raised  without a knowledge of Jehovah God.
01:36 What changes did you both  have to make to ensure
01:39 your own family  would have a fine foundation
01:42 and be successful?
01:44 Well, prior to our baptism,  Freddie had a serious drinking problem.
01:49 And based on the way we were raised,  there was a lot of jealousy going on
01:52 and, I would say, a lack of confidence  and trust in each other.
01:58 My Bible teacher,  thankfully, suggested to us
02:01 to study the book  Making Your Family Life Happy.
02:05 And we ended up studying  that book twice.
02:08 That publication and the Bible principles  in it became the foundation
02:12 of our wonderful marriage  and the happy family we enjoy today.
02:17 Very nice.
02:18 So, Freddie, maybe you  can tell us about your children
02:22 and what they are doing  with their lives now.
02:24 We have two sons.
02:25 Gabriel, he’s the oldest one.
02:27 He started regular pioneering  when he was 14 years old.
02:30 At 18, he was appointed  as a ministerial servant.
02:34 At 22 years old, he has been working  in the Plumbing Department
02:38 at the Warwick construction  for more than two years.
02:40 Adrian is now 18 years old.
02:43 And he also started  regular pioneering when he was 14.
02:47 Currently, he handles  the accounts for the congregation
02:50 and other privileges as well.
02:52 Well, they both have had  an early start in their theocratic careers.
02:57 That’s commendable.
02:59 I’m sure you’re both  proud of them.
03:01 And we’re confident  that Jehovah,
03:03 the One “to whom  every family . . . owes its name,”
03:06 is pleased that they are giving  an answer to his taunter.
03:10 In addition  to the Family Life book,
03:13 what else contributed  to the success your family
03:16 has experienced, Linnette?
03:18 The Governing Body has provided us  with so many publications
03:22 with direction for families,  of course, all based on Jehovah’s Word.
03:26 So we decided early on that whenever  a question or an issue came up,
03:31 we would not make  any decision based on impulse.
03:35 Instead, we would research it  in the publications.
03:38 We pray to Jehovah  for him to give us wisdom.
03:42 And we even pray  for him to guide us
03:45 to find the right time to talk  to each other or to counsel the boys.
03:50 I have always heard  that there are stages
03:53 in the child’s life  and personality development.
03:56 So I researched in advance  as to what to expect.
04:00 In that way,  we were not surprised
04:02 when we saw changes  in attitudes or ideas.
04:07 And that helped us  realize what needed
04:11 to be addressed or corrected  as opposed to what was normal
04:15 for that stage  in the boys’ lives.
04:18 Very practical.
04:19 Freddie,  what can you add?
04:21 Over the years, I have learned  how essential it is to become a good listener
04:26 —also understanding.
04:27 I tell my family  how much I love them every day
04:29 because we never know  when circumstances might change.
04:32 Family worship  is very important for us.
04:36 I know it is easy to put off,  but the benefits are hard to beat.
04:39 Well,  before this arrangement started,
04:43 we as a family, we valued  the Bible study with the family.
04:48 I learned that a fetus  that is six months,
04:53 he can recognize  the family’s voice.
04:55 So I started a Bible study with my sons  when they were still in the womb . . .
04:59 Isn’t that nice.
05:01 . . . and continued  to do so after that.
05:04 I know that secular work  and other activities
05:08 can block  a regular program,
05:12 but we need to fight that tendency  if we want to succeed in family worship.
05:16 Very good.
05:18 Well, it seems your efforts  paid off when we consider
05:20 how well your family  has done spiritually
05:23 and the close relationship  you have with each other.
05:27 Now Linnette,  it sounds as if the family is perfect
05:31 —no challenges.
05:33 Is that the case?
05:35 No, not at all.
05:37 First Corinthians 10:13 says  that Christians will face
05:41 challenges  that are “common to [all] men.”
05:43 And we have faced the normal challenges  that come with raising a family.
05:48 The same verse indicates
05:51 that if we do things  Jehovah’s way,
05:56 we may increase the opportunity  for him to “make the way out” for us.
06:00 One unexpected challenge
06:02 that has changed  our family dynamics
06:06 over the years now,  was when Freddie
06:08 was diagnosed  with cancer in 2012.
06:11 The treatment was aggressive  and took its toll on his health.
06:16 Our whole lifestyle changed.
06:19 We had to move out  from our house . . .
06:22 Oh, boy.
06:23 . . . to an apartment,
06:25 we gave away our dog, Spike,
06:27 and we have to watch our expenses  really closely to keep going.
06:34 This could have put a lot  of strain in our family,
06:38 in our marriage,  and in our spirituality.
06:41 But, again, by praying to Jehovah constantly and applying Bible principles,
06:46 I can say my marriage
06:49 and my family  have never been better.
06:51 Wow.
06:52 Spiritually, we kept our routine,  and we all stayed
06:57 in full-time service  throughout the ordeal.
06:59 The boys  have cooperated very well.
07:03 They have offered  to work to give us money.
07:06 But we prefer for them  to keep focused on the Kingdom
07:10 because we are confident  that Jehovah
07:13 will add on  to the things we need.
07:16 Freddie has been  a great example for all of us
07:19 because he pushes himself
07:21 to keep his spiritual routine.
07:24 You never see him  complaining or in a bad mood.
07:27 And that has been very inspiring  for the rest of the family.
07:31 Boy, that is quite a story.
07:34 You folks will certainly relate  to the convention drama video
07:38 that was advertised  on our April program.
07:41 Freddie, we’re very sorry to hear  about your physical condition.
07:45 Are there any  favorite scriptures that you use
07:49 to help keep you going spiritually  and to stay strong?
07:52 There are many of them.
07:55 Just to mention a few,  Philippians 4:6,7
08:00 has been my life since 2012,
08:04 where I have to pray  to Jehovah constantly
08:06 so that he can give me  the strength that I need
08:08 to overcome my health.
08:11 And also,  Philippians says
08:14 that he will give us  peace of mind.
08:18 In addition,  he will safeguard our heart.
08:21 And that’s something  I’ve been seeing from Jehovah.
08:25 Also, Isaiah 41:10 states:
08:29 “Do not be anxious,  for I am your God.”
08:34 Those words give me comfort  that he will keep on helping us
08:37 in these different circumstances  in our life.
08:41 I do understand that my wife has a lot  of responsibilities in the household,
08:45 so I had to reread  Proverbs 31
08:48 verses 10 to 31,
08:51 where it describes  all of the responsibility a good wife
08:54 might have to shoulder  for the family.
08:57 So Brother Morris,  she is my Proverbs 31 wife!
09:00 A good wife for sure.
09:03 You’ve obviously shown how much  you love and respect each other.
09:07 That’s commendable.
09:09 And your focus on being the best parents  you could be is a good example
09:12 for parents viewing  the program at this time.
09:16 This will come  as a surprise to you,
09:19 but we would like to invite your two sons  out to see what they remember
09:23 from growing up  in the family.
09:26 We have Gabriel  and Adrian with us.
09:35 Mom’s getting a little teary-eyed.
09:38 That’s understandable.  It was a surprise, see.
09:41 So Gabriel,  since you’re the oldest,
09:45 we will start with you.
09:48 What do you remember  about your family life,
09:50 first in Puerto Rico  and later here in the United States?
09:54 I remember faithfully going  to all the meetings and going out in service
09:59 every Saturday —that was just the routine.
10:02 In Puerto Rico,  my dad had to work a lot though,
10:05 and like he said before,  that’s easy to get in the way
10:08 of a good family worship routine.
10:11 But I can honestly say that once we made  that transition of moving over here,
10:16 that helped us to have  a good family worship routine,
10:19 and it has helped us  to get closer and closer each day.
10:22 Now, isn’t that nice?
10:24 Now, Adrian, anything you can add  about the homelife?
10:27 Yeah, my mom  and dad have always
10:29 shown a great love for Jehovah  but also for each other.
10:33 So as kids,  you could just sense that.
10:37 So love and respect  is what we’ve always known.
10:39 Even now that my brother and I are older,  we have a great bond with each other.
10:43 We love each other and we can tell  each other everything about our lives.
10:47 And it’s due to that love  and respect that they have shown.
10:50 And even if there are disagreements,
10:52 which there are always going  to be disagreements
10:54 because it’s an imperfect family,
10:56 but that love is always there  to bridge those differences.
11:00 I also would like to add,  something that helped me a lot
11:03 was a routine  that my dad and I had
11:06 right before going to school;  we would always read the daily text.
11:11 And he would always say, “Behave,  and remember that Jehovah loves you.”
11:15 I don’t think he knows  how much that really helped me
11:19 go through  everyday challenges at school.
11:22 That’s priceless.
11:24 Now, very nice observations.
11:26 Gabriel, I’m interested  in understanding what prompted you
11:31 to regular pioneer  when you were only 14 years old?
11:35 It was at a point  where my dad lost his job.
11:38 Rather than stressing about it —worrying about it
11:40 —he looked at things  with a spiritual perspective.
11:44 So he started to pioneer.
11:46 And since our schedules  matched perfectly,
11:49 I was his little pioneer buddy.
11:51 I would go out in service  with him whenever he needed it.
11:53 And I feel like if spiritual families,  you know, focus on spiritual matters,
11:57 it helps them  to become closer.
12:01 And I can’t imagine  how our relationship
12:03 and respect for one another  can be any better than what it is now.
12:06 Very nice.
12:08 Now, Adrian,  you began pioneering
12:11 when you were 14 as well.
12:13 How do you think  that affected you as a person?
12:16 Well, first of all,  the reason why I started pioneering
12:19 was because I was going out in service  with the rest of my family,
12:22 and since they were already pioneering,  I was getting the time in.
12:26 But I do think  that taking on the responsibility
12:29 of getting  at least 70 hours a month
12:32 in the service  does make you think differently
12:36 at 14 than it would have otherwise.
12:38 I think it has helped me  mature spiritually,
12:41 and it has contributed to me being used  to my full potential in the congregation.
12:45 And honestly, I wouldn’t trade it  for anything, well, maybe going to Bethel.
12:50 Gabriel, back to you.
12:54 Tell us what was it like  when you learned
12:56 that your dad  had a serious health problem
12:59 and would not be able to provide  for the family like he used to?
13:03 That was probably one  of the biggest challenges I have ever faced.
13:07 When my dad got diagnosed with cancer,  it was about the same time
13:11 that I got my call to Bethel.
13:14 And I was torn; I was divided.
13:16 I felt like if I was to go  to Bethel now,
13:19 it would be selfish of me  to leave my family at a time like that.
13:23 But my family  always had a spiritual view
13:26 on things and cited scriptures  like Matthew 6:33 constantly.
13:31 It helped me to see as a whole—as a family —we put Kingdom interests first;
13:35 that Jehovah  was going to provide
13:37 because he’s a loving father  and friend.
13:39 And then my dad lost his job,  and again all these feelings came up.
13:44 But my family was adamant.
13:47 They let me know that the congregation  had been taking care of them
13:51 for months now,  and then doing some simplifying
13:54 on their own  helped them as well.
13:56 And I didn’t have to worry  about anything.
13:58 I do know that there’s a scripture that says that we’ve got to take care of our own.
14:02 So I do anything I can  to help my family back home.
14:06 The only thing I hope  is that I can have a good faith
14:11 like they’ve shown  through these difficult times.
14:15 Well, thank all of you  for joining us.
14:19 I think all of us  are feeling that emotion
14:22 and feel very close  to you for sharing that.
14:24 Now, as a father, I can appreciate  all that Freddie is trying to do
14:28 as head of the family.
14:31 And, Linnette, your support  beyond normal
14:34 is very much  to be commended.
14:36 We can tell your family  is thriving spiritually,
14:40 and we pray Jehovah  will continue to bless your efforts,
14:43 come what may.
14:45 And we thank you,  Gabriel and Adrian,
14:47 for your surprise  to the studio.
14:51 Thank you very much  for taking the time to be interviewed.
14:55 Thank you for the privilege.
14:56 Thank you for the privilege.
14:56 Thank you.

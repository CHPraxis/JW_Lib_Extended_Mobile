00:02.773 --> 00:05.775
When someone loses a spouse, 


00:05.775 --> 00:08.000
they are a widower. 


00:09.447 --> 00:13.000
When someone loses their parents, 
they’re an orphan. 


00:15.535 --> 00:19.000
But there’s no word 
for when you lose your children.


00:25.378 --> 00:29.000
In 1948, 
I was born in Brainerd, Minnesota. 


00:30.508 --> 00:33.470
We never had a Bible in our house. 


00:33.470 --> 00:36.640
I asked my dad one time about God, 
and he said, 


00:36.640 --> 00:39.000
“Well, God knows everything.” 
End of lesson. 


00:40.685 --> 00:43.313
My dad had hardening of the arteries. 


00:43.313 --> 00:48.860
In 1962, he died of a heart attack. 


00:48.860 --> 00:50.278
I’d just turned 13. 


00:50.278 --> 00:53.031
And my parents were 
so close that my mother, 


00:53.032 --> 00:54.575
who had colon cancer, 


00:54.575 --> 00:57.202
she gave up the will to live. 


00:57.202 --> 01:00.872
So in February of the next year, 
she died. 


01:00.872 --> 01:05.377
About 1972, 
that’s when I met Pam.


01:05.377 --> 01:07.755
I was born in Portland, Oregon. 


01:07.755 --> 01:09.965
I was one of those high-strung children.


01:09.965 --> 01:11.800
I still am. 


01:11.800 --> 01:14.010
I worried about a lot of things. 


01:14.010 --> 01:17.555
I already had two children
by the time I met Larry, 


01:17.555 --> 01:21.435
and I didn’t want them 
to inherit a world


01:21.435 --> 01:24.000
that was just filled 
with killing each other. 


01:25.355 --> 01:28.525
I joined a lot of the movements. 


01:28.525 --> 01:31.403
I marched in the peace marches


01:31.403 --> 01:33.863
with thousands 
and thousands of people. 


01:33.863 --> 01:36.408
So I thought, 
‘Well, I’ll go door to door 


01:36.408 --> 01:40.786
for this particular candidate 
because he’s antiwar.’ 


01:40.787 --> 01:42.330
All these things I was doing


01:42.330 --> 01:45.000
—to put forth all this effort 
to change things—


01:46.168 --> 01:49.671
it wasn’t working.


01:49.672 --> 01:53.425
Pam and I had gotten married, 
and Nikki was born. 


01:53.425 --> 01:55.760
We were just ecstatic
—very happy. 


01:55.760 --> 01:58.847
He had this croup, 


01:58.847 --> 02:00.599
and we took him to the hospital. 


02:00.598 --> 02:04.060
And there was a doctor there, 
and he diagnosed it 


02:04.060 --> 02:05.895
as ataxia-telangiectasia. 


02:05.895 --> 02:08.000
And it’s a progressive disorder. 


02:09.650 --> 02:12.000
There’s no cure for it. 


02:14.738 --> 02:17.115
Pam was pregnant the second time,


02:17.115 --> 02:19.535
and we had Nathaniel Thomas. 


02:19.535 --> 02:22.872
And he too had this condition 


02:22.872 --> 02:25.457
of ataxia.


02:25.457 --> 02:27.209
I cried.


02:27.208 --> 02:28.585
I cried and cried. 


02:28.585 --> 02:31.000
I cried my eyes out during that time.


02:35.842 --> 02:38.554
So the Witnesses found me, 


02:38.553 --> 02:40.971
and they just kept calling 
and talking to me 


02:40.972 --> 02:43.000
and being so kind to me.


02:45.352 --> 02:47.939
When we studied that 
Jesus talked 


02:47.938 --> 02:51.650
about the little sparrow
even is important to him,


02:51.650 --> 02:54.653
and how much more important
a human is. 


02:54.653 --> 02:57.000
So that meant a lot to me.


02:59.867 --> 03:02.452
After Pam was baptized,


03:02.452 --> 03:06.000
I could see changes 
that this was good for the family.


03:07.540 --> 03:09.793
Once we were in the congregation,


03:09.793 --> 03:12.796
everybody loved them, 
and all the friends were wonderful.


03:12.797 --> 03:15.382
She told me that I could study 


03:15.382 --> 03:17.134
with any brother 
in the hall that I wanted; 


03:17.133 --> 03:18.635
just go ask him. 


03:18.635 --> 03:20.762
So I did. 


03:20.762 --> 03:23.515
That helped me to be 
a better father


03:23.515 --> 03:26.000
and to be a better husband.


03:29.397 --> 03:33.567
Nineteen eighty-six, 
October of that year, 


03:33.567 --> 03:38.989
our oldest boy, Nikki, 
he fell asleep in death. 


03:38.988 --> 03:41.000
He was 13 when he died. 


03:43.868 --> 03:47.000
Our youngest boy, Nate, 
was 16 when he died. 


03:48.582 --> 03:51.127
Debbie, she had melanoma, 


03:51.127 --> 03:55.714
and it had gone into her brain, 
and she had brain tumors. 


03:55.713 --> 03:58.216
Well, she didn’t last 
but a couple months, 


03:58.217 --> 04:01.000
and she fell asleep in death. 


04:02.470 --> 04:03.972
There we were;


04:03.972 --> 04:06.000
we had a complete empty nest. 


04:09.268 --> 04:13.273
And about that time, 
Pam got diagnosed with breast cancer.


04:13.273 --> 04:15.775
The first chemotherapy,
there were two,


04:15.775 --> 04:17.318
just about killed me. 


04:17.318 --> 04:20.196
It came really close 
because it was hard 


04:20.197 --> 04:22.532
to even breathe sometimes.


04:22.532 --> 04:26.000
Two bouts of breast cancer
—she kept on pioneering.


04:27.703 --> 04:31.291
When Larry got hurt
falling through the ceiling, 


04:31.292 --> 04:36.045
the whole left side of his face 
hit the corner of the metal wood stove 


04:36.045 --> 04:38.548
and broke it all the way through. 


04:38.548 --> 04:43.000
He had to be fed by a tube 
through a little opening in his teeth.


04:44.387 --> 04:50.602
Second Corinthians 1:3, 4 
talks about “the God of all comfort.” 


04:50.602 --> 04:54.000
It’s easy to be comfortable 
when everything is going well. 


04:56.192 --> 04:58.444
When these kinds of things happen, 


04:58.443 --> 05:01.000
to find true comfort


05:02.697 --> 05:08.000
is within Jehovah’s organization.


05:16.253 --> 05:19.338
You can go through something, 


05:19.338 --> 05:23.000
and you can still keep
a theocratic routine. 


05:25.053 --> 05:30.000
A theocratic routine
is what helps us to endure. 


05:31.185 --> 05:36.000
We knew that we would like to end 
this system of things as pioneers.


05:37.232 --> 05:41.110
Larry and I are out in service together 
almost every single day.


05:41.110 --> 05:44.573
We found that pioneering together 


05:44.573 --> 05:48.701
and having Bible studies together 
is very powerful.


05:48.702 --> 05:52.000
We helped 
on a regional building project together. 


05:54.082 --> 05:56.000
It’s a wonderful spiritual time.


05:57.710 --> 05:59.420
You don’t rely on yourself. 


05:59.420 --> 06:02.673
You have to rely on Jehovah.


06:02.673 --> 06:06.553
When Jehovah loves you, 
he takes care of you


06:06.553 --> 06:09.848
—keeps you on your feet.


06:09.848 --> 06:12.225
Every day I remember my children. 


06:12.225 --> 06:14.227
You don’t forget the people you love. 


06:14.227 --> 06:18.149
And if you love Jehovah, 
you won’t forget him. 


06:18.148 --> 06:22.026
“God is love,” 
and that love is what helps us 


06:22.027 --> 06:41.694
to be able to endure.

00:00.917 --> 00:03.787
There’s a common saying 
at Bethel 


00:03.787 --> 00:06.655
that the only thing 
that is constant is change. 


00:06.655 --> 00:11.660
But frankly, that’s an understatement now, 
wouldn’t you say? 


00:11.660 --> 00:16.665
In fact, wherever you turn, 
it seems like at every occasion 


00:16.665 --> 00:19.968
we see change coming about 
in one way or another. 


00:19.968 --> 00:23.406
In fact, when I first 
submitted this outline 


00:23.407 --> 00:26.142
and think back to that day, 


00:26.142 --> 00:29.745
it has changed so much 
just in those few months. 


00:29.745 --> 00:34.750
It really shows that we are 
in a time of great change.


00:34.750 --> 00:39.755
Of course, we’re in an organization 
that’s built on change. 


00:39.755 --> 00:43.527
We’re in an organization 
that as far back as Brother Russell 


00:43.527 --> 00:46.362
was willing 
to study God’s Word and see 


00:46.362 --> 00:51.367
where perhaps his belief did not align 
with what God’s Word said, and he changed. 


00:51.367 --> 00:56.039
And from that day forward, 
our organization has continued to change. 


00:56.038 --> 00:58.306
And aren’t we glad 
“the faithful and discreet slave” 


00:58.307 --> 01:02.012
continues to make adjustments 
where necessary 


01:02.012 --> 01:06.750
for the sake of the preaching work; 
for the sake of Jehovah’s name; 


01:06.750 --> 01:09.752
and, of course, 
for his people, his sheep. 


01:09.752 --> 01:12.355
So when we think about that, 


01:12.355 --> 01:15.558
we think, 
‘Change is not always bad.’


01:15.558 --> 01:19.095
Now, all change 
is not profound either. 


01:19.095 --> 01:22.832
We’ve had many changes 
right here in Bethel in the last few years


01:22.832 --> 01:25.969
—changes 
that have benefited us as well. 


01:25.968 --> 01:28.638
Perhaps maybe it’s having 
all our Saturdays off 


01:28.638 --> 01:32.908
so we can enjoy field service 
with the congregation more regularly. 


01:32.908 --> 01:37.046
Perhaps it’s an extra day off 
when we turn 70. 


01:37.047 --> 01:40.184
So, again, personal matters 
can be attended to; 


01:40.183 --> 01:43.118
field service can be enjoyed 
more fully by these. 


01:43.118 --> 01:44.553
What a blessing! 


01:44.553 --> 01:46.155
Even to have morning worship 


01:46.155 --> 01:48.157
and our Watchtower Study 
in our room when we’re sick. 


01:48.157 --> 01:49.959
These are nice changes. 


01:49.958 --> 01:54.896
We can just go on and on 
about the things that we enjoy in changes.


01:54.897 --> 01:58.902
But sometimes, 
sometimes in our life, 


01:58.902 --> 02:01.704
changes come about that maybe, 


02:01.703 --> 02:04.506
well, they cut a little deeper 
into our comfort zone. 


02:04.507 --> 02:06.509
Isn’t that true? 


02:06.508 --> 02:09.445
So maybe it can cause us 
a measure of personal anxiety


02:09.445 --> 02:11.647
—maybe it’s fear of the unknown.


02:11.647 --> 02:15.652
Or maybe it’s just the feeling 
that I don’t have as much control 


02:15.652 --> 02:19.455
in my life anymore because 
of this change that’s come about. 


02:19.455 --> 02:22.392
And so there is some anxiety 
that goes with that. 


02:22.392 --> 02:25.094
In fact, whatever the case, 


02:25.093 --> 02:28.030
if we allow ourselves 
to become too anxious, 


02:28.030 --> 02:31.968
the truth of Proverbs 12:25 
comes about, where it says: 


02:31.968 --> 02:35.605
“Anxiety in a man’s heart 
weighs it down.” 


02:35.605 --> 02:38.875
And so it can actually prevent us 
from moving forward. 


02:38.875 --> 02:42.678
It can prevent us or it can slow us down 
sometimes and we become overwhelmed 


02:42.678 --> 02:46.883
with anxious feelings 
about what’s going on around me. 


02:46.883 --> 02:49.000
How am I being affected?


02:50.620 --> 02:53.957
We use the example 
in the theme 


02:53.957 --> 02:58.027
to talk about those sailors 
on a sailing ship. 


02:58.027 --> 02:59.562
Why? 


02:59.562 --> 03:02.765
Well, because for a sailor 
while at sea, 


03:02.765 --> 03:06.035
it may seem that he 
is at the mercy of the elements. 


03:06.035 --> 03:09.705
And it’s true, 
he cannot control the weather, 


03:09.705 --> 03:14.577
but he can adjust 
to the weather. 


03:14.577 --> 03:17.647
An experienced sailor 
is able to keep control. 


03:17.647 --> 03:20.049
He’s able 
to stay on course


03:20.048 --> 03:24.820
—by adjusting his sails, 
by continuing to move forward, 


03:24.820 --> 03:28.758
by catching the wind from different angles, 
and by allowing himself 


03:28.758 --> 03:31.126
to keep making progress


03:31.127 --> 03:35.197
—even though at first 
bad weather can slow you down. 


03:35.197 --> 03:38.935
In fact, for a ship to keep moving, 
it has to have the winds 


03:38.935 --> 03:40.937
catching the sails. 


03:40.937 --> 03:45.174
And if you’ve ever seen a racing team 
that has raced these large sailing ships, 


03:45.173 --> 03:48.110
it’s amazing how they can maneuver them, 
how they can turn them, 


03:48.110 --> 03:52.782
how fast they can go 
because they are experienced.


03:52.782 --> 03:56.119
Well, in some ways, we think 


03:56.118 --> 03:59.188
we may not have complete control 
over our life at Bethel. 


03:59.188 --> 04:01.190
And that’s true, we don’t. 


04:01.190 --> 04:05.395
We do have changing circumstances, 


04:05.395 --> 04:09.765
but we also 
can keep control of our life. 


04:09.765 --> 04:11.767
Why? 
Why can we say that? 


04:11.767 --> 04:16.705
Well, turn with me 
to our first scripture in the 46th Psalm. 


04:16.705 --> 04:18.975
In Psalm 46, 


04:18.975 --> 04:22.845
notice what it says 
in the very first three verses. 


04:22.845 --> 04:27.850
It says: 
‘God is our refuge and strength, 


04:27.850 --> 04:31.587
‘a help that is readily found 
in times of distress. 


04:31.587 --> 04:35.725
‘That is why we will not fear, 
though the earth undergoes change, 


04:35.725 --> 04:38.260
‘though the mountains topple 
into the depths of the sea, 


04:38.260 --> 04:40.663
‘though the waters 
roar and foam over,


04:40.663 --> 04:44.166
though the mountains rock 
on account of its turbulence.’ 


04:44.167 --> 04:48.070
Of course, these 
are some pretty extreme circumstances. 


04:48.070 --> 04:50.573
I’m in no way 
saying that’s Bethel. 


04:50.573 --> 04:55.578
But if we think 
about the amount of change: 


04:55.578 --> 05:00.248
The entire earth is portrayed here 
as undergoing some massive changes


05:00.248 --> 05:04.320
—mountains falling into the sea, 
violent oceans—and yet the psalmist said 


05:04.320 --> 05:06.322
he didn’t have to worry. 


05:06.322 --> 05:08.659
He was in control; he had no fear. 
Why? 


05:08.658 --> 05:12.328
Because of verse 1: 
‘God is our refuge and strength, 


05:12.328 --> 05:15.731
‘a help readily found 
in times of distress. 


05:15.732 --> 05:19.002
That is why I will not fear.’ 


05:19.002 --> 05:21.737
And the psalmist 
did not fear because of that. 


05:21.737 --> 05:24.740
Jehovah is our strength; 


05:24.740 --> 05:26.942
he is our refuge. 


05:26.942 --> 05:28.945
And his stability


05:28.945 --> 05:33.783
—the fact that he can never be shaken 
in his stability—it grounds us. 


05:33.783 --> 05:37.186
It means that as long 
as we stick close to Jehovah, 


05:37.187 --> 05:41.057
then nothing is going to put us 
completely off balance. 


05:41.057 --> 05:43.459
And if it does 
for a short period of time, 


05:43.458 --> 05:45.961
if we experience 
a little bit of rough seas


05:45.962 --> 05:47.997
—well, we adjust. 


05:47.997 --> 05:48.464
Why? 


05:48.463 --> 05:52.401
Because we have Jehovah, 
and he helps us do that.


05:52.402 --> 05:57.407
In our discussion tonight, we’re going 
to consider three significant changes


05:57.407 --> 05:59.942
—some have already happened, 


05:59.942 --> 06:03.012
some are affecting 
our family even now, 


06:03.012 --> 06:07.015
and others will likely affect us 
more even into the future. 


06:07.015 --> 06:10.687
We are also going to give attention 
to three Bible accounts 


06:10.687 --> 06:15.057
that will help us to see
Jehovah’s unchanging love 


06:15.057 --> 06:20.062
for us and his ability 
to help us ride through any storm.


06:20.062 --> 06:25.034
The first has to do 
with a change of location. 


06:25.033 --> 06:29.305
Now, of course, 
think back to January 6, 2015. 


06:29.305 --> 06:30.907
It seems like a long time ago. 


06:30.907 --> 06:32.909
It is. 
In Bethel time, it seems. 


06:32.908 --> 06:34.710
It was a normal day at Bethel. 


06:34.710 --> 06:36.712
You made your way down 
to the dining room 


06:36.712 --> 06:40.000
for some cheese and chive egg white omelet 
and a little muesli. 


06:42.652 --> 06:47.124
Then came that historic Bethel announcement 
from the Governing Body. 


06:47.123 --> 06:50.058
It adjusted what departments 
would be transferring to Wallkill. 


06:50.058 --> 06:51.793
You remember. 


06:51.793 --> 06:55.531
Now, not the Computer Department, 
not Regional Design Construction 


06:55.532 --> 06:58.869
but now the Service Department 
and the Branch Committee Office 


06:58.868 --> 07:01.703
would be relocating to Wallkill. 


07:01.703 --> 07:03.705
So think about that. 


07:03.705 --> 07:06.308
How many people’s lives changed 


07:06.308 --> 07:10.680
with just a few sentences 
in a few minutes at morning worship? 


07:10.680 --> 07:13.615
Of course, 
the Regional Design Construction Department 


07:13.615 --> 07:15.885
would then be moving 
to Puerto Rico. 


07:15.885 --> 07:17.887
Who would have thought of that? 


07:17.887 --> 07:20.022
Did you see that one coming? 


07:20.022 --> 07:22.225
Change can happen quickly. 


07:22.225 --> 07:24.560
But, of course, 
as a result of that announcement,


07:24.560 --> 07:28.263
just beginning next month, 
some 400 members of our family 


07:28.263 --> 07:31.466
from Patterson and Brooklyn 
will be moving to Wallkill 


07:31.467 --> 07:35.404
in the beginning 
of large changes for all of us. 


07:35.403 --> 07:39.608
And as big as that was, 
it does seem like a long time ago. 


07:39.608 --> 07:44.613
Just when you were coming to grips with that, 
then September rolled around 


07:44.613 --> 07:47.683
and you came down 
to breakfast. 


07:47.683 --> 07:50.000
Yes, they served muesli again. 


07:54.223 --> 07:57.360
But the announcement given 
to the Bethel family that day 


07:57.360 --> 08:00.897
discussed additional changes 
to the organization. 


08:00.897 --> 08:05.902
It included a significant reduction 
to Bethel families around the world 


08:05.902 --> 08:10.907
and a reemphasis 
to the preaching work 


08:10.907 --> 08:15.912
and the assistance that could be given 
to that preaching work through this change. 


08:15.912 --> 08:20.415
For the United States Bethel family, 
we learned that we would not retain 


08:20.415 --> 08:23.618
the tunnel complex 
as had been previously planned. 


08:23.618 --> 08:27.155
Instead, all property in Brooklyn 
would be sold and any remaining departments 


08:27.155 --> 08:30.492
would have to fit 
within the properties upstate. 


08:30.492 --> 08:32.495
So more movement. 


08:32.495 --> 08:35.497
And that’s already, 
according to our recent update, 


08:35.497 --> 08:37.500
already beginning. 


08:37.500 --> 08:40.435
And we are seeing 
signs of that around, aren’t we? 


08:40.435 --> 08:43.772
So, of course, 
for many of us, what that meant 


08:43.772 --> 08:47.310
was family worship 
took a little detour that week. 


08:47.310 --> 08:50.045
We had to go home 
and talk about some of these things 


08:50.045 --> 08:54.850
because our families 
got affected by these changes.


08:54.850 --> 08:58.253
Of course, 
individually and as a family, 


08:58.253 --> 09:01.456
we do loyally comply 
with any direction. 


09:01.457 --> 09:03.927
The organization has reasons 


09:03.927 --> 09:05.995
for making adjustments, 
and we understand that.


09:05.995 --> 09:09.132
And so we want to be cooperative. 


09:09.132 --> 09:11.600
But for many, 
it does mean a big change. 


09:11.600 --> 09:15.805
Maybe leaving a complex that has been 
the one they’ve served at forever


09:15.805 --> 09:17.807
—since they’ve been at Bethel. 


09:17.807 --> 09:20.409
Maybe it’s where 
they’ve become very close 


09:20.408 --> 09:23.878
to not just friends there 
but in the congregation 


09:23.878 --> 09:26.915
that they’ve served in 
for many, many years. 


09:26.915 --> 09:31.920
Or consider others perhaps 
who have relocated their aging parents 


09:31.920 --> 09:34.723
into the area of the complex 
they’ve been serving in. 


09:34.723 --> 09:37.460
Now, can they move them again? 


09:37.460 --> 09:39.928
Are their parents 
well enough to even be moved? 


09:39.928 --> 09:41.930
These are real situations. 


09:41.930 --> 09:46.535
And we understand that, of course, 
they could give us a measure of anxiety 


09:46.535 --> 09:49.872
that can make us seem 
a little bit concerned 


09:49.872 --> 09:52.409
or maybe even overwhelmed 
sometimes.


09:52.408 --> 09:54.410
But how can we be helped? 


09:54.410 --> 09:57.880
What can we do 
so that we can move on? 


09:57.880 --> 09:59.882
What are some ways? 


09:59.882 --> 10:02.619
Obviously, 
we can’t change a decision. 


10:02.618 --> 10:04.820
That’s not our position, 
and we don’t want to. 


10:04.820 --> 10:08.423
We want to be cooperative 
with what’s being done. 


10:08.423 --> 10:10.425
So we’re looking 
for ways to do that. 


10:10.425 --> 10:15.000
Well, look at what the psalmist said, 
David’s words in the 40th Psalm. 


10:17.533 --> 10:21.070
In the 40th Psalm, 
notice what David said


10:21.070 --> 10:24.807
—the confidence he has 
in verse 5. 


10:24.807 --> 10:29.145
It says: “How many things 
you have done, O Jehovah my God, 


10:29.145 --> 10:32.348
“your wonderful works 
and your thoughts toward us. 


10:32.348 --> 10:34.616
“None can compare to you; 


10:34.617 --> 10:38.020
“if I were to try to tell 
and speak of them, 


10:38.020 --> 10:42.558
they would be 
too numerous to recount!” 


10:42.558 --> 10:47.530
So maybe it’s time 
to personally take stock


10:47.530 --> 10:52.335
—personally recount the saving acts 
that Jehovah has done 


10:52.335 --> 10:54.803
toward us personally 


10:54.803 --> 10:58.273
here at Bethel, 
in our family. 


10:58.273 --> 11:02.076
Perhaps, did he take you by the hand 
when you were nervous 


11:02.077 --> 11:06.615
about coming into Bethel 
for the first day? 


11:06.615 --> 11:11.587
Maybe he helped care for you 
when you were a new bride trying to adjust 


11:11.587 --> 11:16.392
to a new city, 
a new congregation, marriage 


11:16.392 --> 11:20.595
and, of course, a new job
—a new work you would do at Bethel. 


11:20.595 --> 11:24.433
Can you recall when you were feeling low 
and he sent not just the right person 


11:24.433 --> 11:27.770
but the right person 
at the right time with just the right words 


11:27.770 --> 11:32.442
to help kick you back into play a little bit 
and maybe even protect you 


11:32.442 --> 11:36.079
from making a mistake about leaving 
your Bethel service some time ago? 


11:36.078 --> 11:39.881
All of us probably can recount 
over and over again 


11:39.882 --> 11:43.419
things that Jehovah has done 
to show his love toward us 


11:43.418 --> 11:47.121
and his care for us, 
even as David was confident.


11:47.122 --> 11:51.660
But the question is, 
Do you think He can do it again? 


11:51.660 --> 11:55.130
We had a beautiful Watchtower 
just now that talked about faith. 


11:55.130 --> 11:57.132
And so we think about that. 


11:57.132 --> 11:59.402
Do we have that faith 
that He will do it again? 


11:59.402 --> 12:03.139
Isaiah 59:1 says: 
‘Jehovah’s hand will not be short.’ 


12:03.138 --> 12:06.008
There is nothing 
that cannot be accomplished 


12:06.008 --> 12:09.611
for those 
who are faithful to Jehovah. 


12:09.612 --> 12:12.014
So we can recount it. 


12:12.013 --> 12:14.150
It may be that we need 
to even write it down. 


12:14.150 --> 12:17.352
It may need to be that we pray 
about these things so that we say, 


12:17.352 --> 12:20.890
“Yes, I see how Jehovah 
has really taken care of me.”


12:20.890 --> 12:22.892
Now, for others . . .


12:22.892 --> 12:27.295
Another group that’s affected 
by that same announcement is . . . 


12:27.295 --> 12:29.298
Maybe they’re having 
a little anxiety 


12:29.298 --> 12:33.368
over not moving 
to another complex. 


12:33.368 --> 12:36.038
Maybe they had their hope set 
on where they were going, 


12:36.038 --> 12:38.040
and they 
were looking forward to it. 


12:38.040 --> 12:42.978
Of course, as all were, necessarily, 
because they adjust themselves. 


12:42.978 --> 12:47.248
They think, ‘OK, I’m ready. 
Well, now I’m not going.’ 


12:47.248 --> 12:51.753
And it may be that the tendency would be 
to say, “Well, why not me? 


12:51.753 --> 12:54.290
“Let’s see, 
my department is going, 


12:54.290 --> 12:57.693
“my work is going, 
my friends are going. 


12:57.693 --> 13:00.428
What? 
Did I do something wrong?” 


13:00.428 --> 13:03.965
And yet, really, 
that’s not the case. 


13:03.965 --> 13:07.168
But circumstances 
and decisions have to be made, 


13:07.168 --> 13:11.240
and so now we find ourselves . . .
We have to examine ourselves: 


13:11.240 --> 13:14.843
‘How am I going to react 
to those types of feelings 


13:14.843 --> 13:17.078
that come up within myself?’ 


13:17.078 --> 13:21.350
Proverbs 13:12 says: 


13:21.350 --> 13:24.820
“Expectation postponed 
makes the heart sick.” 


13:24.820 --> 13:27.690
But the footnote 
to that scripture says, 


13:27.690 --> 13:30.558
where it says “expectation,” 
it says “hope.” 


13:30.558 --> 13:35.163
And so it could be that our hopes, 
or our expectations, 


13:35.163 --> 13:37.365
are not realized, 
and it can take a toll on us. 


13:37.365 --> 13:38.367
That’s natural. 


13:38.367 --> 13:42.104
But the question is, 
Will we allow it


13:42.103 --> 13:44.906
—our emotions
—to override our clear thinking? 


13:44.907 --> 13:48.644
Will we allow it to blow us off course, 
so to speak, or slow us down 


13:48.643 --> 13:52.046
or even maybe change our direction 
for a while, that, 


13:52.047 --> 13:56.285
well, we just don’t seem to be heading 
in the same direction we thought we were? 


13:56.285 --> 13:59.355
We’re not making 
as much progress as we once were. 


13:59.355 --> 14:04.360
To stay positive, 
to stay levelheaded, to stay on course 


14:04.360 --> 14:09.232
requires sometimes that we 
give a little change to our thinking


14:09.232 --> 14:13.402
—especially if the circumstances 
aren’t going to change. 


14:13.402 --> 14:18.274
It is easy to compare ourselves 
with others, but it’s not healthy. 


14:18.273 --> 14:21.010
And Galatians 6:4 
tells us not to compare. 


14:21.010 --> 14:23.945
It says don’t compare 
ourselves or our work 


14:23.945 --> 14:28.083
with our fellow workers 
in the truth or in the congregation.


14:28.083 --> 14:30.085
So, what can be done? 


14:30.085 --> 14:33.022
Well, we would like to look 
at our first Scriptural account. 


14:33.022 --> 14:37.092
It really helps us to see 
the need to avoid comparing. 


14:37.092 --> 14:42.097
It has to do with Jesus’ selection 
of the 12 apostles. 


14:42.097 --> 14:46.702
Think of what it meant to be with Jesus 
at that time when he was on earth


14:46.702 --> 14:51.507
—getting to know him, 
working, learning from him personally, 


14:51.507 --> 14:53.942
listening to him 
maybe day after day for some. 


14:53.942 --> 14:55.544
What a privilege! 


14:55.543 --> 14:58.880
They got to do it 
for three and a half years. 


14:58.880 --> 15:03.885
We would trade a lot of time 
even to spend just a little bit of time 


15:03.885 --> 15:07.823
learning from Jesus directly 
like that, wouldn’t we? 


15:07.823 --> 15:11.426
Well, undoubtedly there were many 
who wanted the privilege 


15:11.427 --> 15:14.964
of being one of Jesus’ 
closest disciples and apostles. 


15:14.963 --> 15:18.366
But the time came 
that only 12 were chosen. 


15:18.367 --> 15:20.369
We know there were many 
to choose from. 


15:20.368 --> 15:23.000
Look at what it says 
in Acts the first chapter. 


15:25.007 --> 15:27.475
In Acts 1, 


15:27.475 --> 15:31.413
notice when they 
were going to replace Judas, 


15:31.413 --> 15:34.248
who they chose from. 


15:34.248 --> 15:37.720
So after Jesus had died 
and ascended to heaven, 


15:37.720 --> 15:40.990
verse 21, it says this 
in Acts the first chapter. 


15:40.990 --> 15:45.693
Or after Jesus had died, it says this: 
“It is therefore necessary 


15:45.693 --> 15:49.365
that of the men 
who accompanied us,” in verse 21, 


15:49.365 --> 15:54.370
“during all the time in which the Lord Jesus 
carried on his activities among us, 


15:54.370 --> 15:59.375
“starting with his baptism by John 
until the day he was taken up from us, 


15:59.375 --> 16:05.713
one of these men should become a witness 
with us of his resurrection.” 


16:05.713 --> 16:08.650
So there were many followers. 


16:08.650 --> 16:13.155
They knew who they were, 
and they were able to select from them. 


16:13.155 --> 16:16.358
So imagine what it was


16:16.358 --> 16:18.993
—a year and a half 
into Jesus’ ministry, 


16:18.993 --> 16:23.298
after his baptism
—it was time to select the Twelve. 


16:23.298 --> 16:25.600
This is what Mark 13 
says in that account.


16:25.600 --> 16:27.602
Mark the 3rd chapter, sorry.


16:27.602 --> 16:32.000
In Mark chapter 3, 
notice what it says 


16:34.075 --> 16:36.078
in verse 13. 


16:36.078 --> 16:38.680
It says of Jesus: 
“He ascended a mountain 


16:38.680 --> 16:42.083
“and summoned those whom he wanted, 
and they came to him. 


16:42.083 --> 16:46.455
“And he formed a group of 12, 
whom he also named apostles, 


16:46.455 --> 16:51.193
“those who were to accompany him 
and whom he would send out to preach 


16:51.193 --> 16:54.596
and to have authority 
to expel demons.” 


16:54.597 --> 16:58.667
So Jesus selected from those. 


16:58.667 --> 17:02.670
Luke’s account says 
he prayed all night about it first. 


17:02.670 --> 17:06.942
And then he came down, 
and then from the crowd of his disciples, 


17:06.942 --> 17:09.612
he selected those 12 men.


17:09.612 --> 17:12.680
Now, picture yourself there. 


17:12.680 --> 17:17.685
What if you were one of the men 
who loyally stuck by Jesus since His baptism? 


17:17.685 --> 17:21.823
Maybe, like Andrew 
and John and Peter and James, 


17:21.823 --> 17:23.825
you were 
an instantaneous believer too. 


17:23.825 --> 17:26.762
You left everything, 
and you followed Him immediately. 


17:26.762 --> 17:30.899
You believed, 
and you left all things behind. 


17:30.898 --> 17:34.970
But Jesus didn’t select you 
as one of his 12. 


17:34.970 --> 17:37.238
How would you feel? 
Slighted? Wronged?


17:37.238 --> 17:40.041
Maybe that some injustice 
had been done? 


17:40.042 --> 17:42.779
Would you begin to discount 
those who were selected? 


17:42.778 --> 17:43.845
No, of course not! 


17:43.845 --> 17:47.883
You would think: 
‘OK, I’m not going to be one of those 12. 


17:47.883 --> 17:51.620
But what are the blessings 
I do get to enjoy?’ 


17:51.620 --> 17:55.357
What were the blessings these men 
would still be able to enjoy? 


17:55.357 --> 17:59.294
And apparently from Acts, 
those men remained with Jesus. 


17:59.293 --> 18:03.365
Those followers—those disciples
—stuck close to him as well. 


18:03.365 --> 18:08.370
Well, they still got to listen 
to him teach and preach. 


18:08.370 --> 18:13.108
They still—just a few days later, really
—would be able to hear 


18:13.108 --> 18:17.445
that famous Sermon on the Mount 
if they had stayed right with him. 


18:17.445 --> 18:20.648
They were still entrusted 
with the privilege of the ministry. 


18:20.648 --> 18:24.118
In fact, Jesus sent 
the disciples out, the Twelve, 


18:24.118 --> 18:27.321
and then later 
sent 70 to preach. 


18:27.322 --> 18:30.859
So, many others enjoyed 
that blessing as well. 


18:30.858 --> 18:32.928
They could help others 
to find the Messiah, 


18:32.928 --> 18:37.165
and they still had the hope 
for the same reward 


18:37.165 --> 18:40.635
that those 12 apostles 
were going to have


18:40.635 --> 18:44.005
—being anointed and being able 
to be in heaven with Jesus 


18:44.005 --> 18:46.007
after their resurrection.


18:46.007 --> 18:48.010
So, what’s the lesson? 


18:48.010 --> 18:50.278
Well, rather than feeling 
passed over for something


18:50.278 --> 18:53.881
—maybe for the type of assignment
or even the location of an assignment


18:53.882 --> 18:56.885
—we think about it, we adjust. 


18:56.885 --> 19:00.522
‘What do I have? 
What are things I can enjoy?’ 


19:00.522 --> 19:05.494
We devote ourselves, our time, 
our energy, and all our mental resources 


19:05.493 --> 19:08.963
to fulfilling our ministry
—what we’ve been given to do 


19:08.963 --> 19:13.968
whether it’s our work here at Bethel 
or in the field, things we can control. 


19:13.968 --> 19:18.306
Because what’s the option
—lower our sails, 


19:18.307 --> 19:20.975
just start floating aimlessly? 


19:20.975 --> 19:22.978
None of us want to do that. 


19:22.978 --> 19:25.646
That’s not why we came 
to Bethel in the first place. 


19:25.647 --> 19:29.985
It also would be 
a very dangerous thing to do. 


19:29.985 --> 19:32.320
So we avoid that. 


19:32.320 --> 19:36.192
Instead, we stay focused 
on what’s most important. 


19:36.192 --> 19:40.000
Turn with me 
to the book of 2 Corinthians, 


19:42.197 --> 19:46.535
2 Corinthians and the 4th chapter. 


19:46.535 --> 19:51.207
Notice what it says after talking 
about the tribulation in verse 17 


19:51.207 --> 19:54.409
that’s “momentary and light” 
and going to pass. 


19:54.408 --> 19:56.811
Notice what it says though 
in verse 18: 


19:56.812 --> 19:59.749
“While we keep our eyes, 
not on the things seen, 


19:59.748 --> 20:01.983
“but on the things unseen. 


20:01.983 --> 20:06.988
For the things seen are temporary, 
but the things unseen are everlasting.” 


20:06.988 --> 20:09.725
What’s the lesson for us? 


20:09.725 --> 20:13.328
Everything in this system 


20:13.328 --> 20:17.731
except our relationship 
with Jehovah is temporary


20:17.732 --> 20:21.804
—our work assignments, 
likely temporary; 


20:21.803 --> 20:25.006
our work locations, 
temporary; 


20:25.007 --> 20:29.377
locations we live, 
probably temporary too. 


20:29.377 --> 20:34.182
What doesn’t change 
is our loyalty, 


20:34.182 --> 20:37.585
our devotion, 
and integrity to Jehovah. 


20:37.585 --> 20:41.188
That’s what lasts, 
and that’s why Jehovah promises 


20:41.188 --> 20:45.526
in Psalm 84:11: 
‘He will not hold back anything good 


20:45.527 --> 20:49.097
from those walking in integrity.’ 


20:49.097 --> 20:53.769
You notice, it didn’t require 
a location or a job assignment. 


20:53.768 --> 20:56.905
Psalm 18:25 says: 
“With someone loyal 


20:56.905 --> 21:00.175
you [or Jehovah] act in loyalty.” 


21:00.175 --> 21:03.845
That’s Jehovah’s promise 
to all of us.


21:03.845 --> 21:08.183
There’s another group affected 
by those couple of announcements, 


21:08.183 --> 21:10.318
and that’s our wives. 


21:10.318 --> 21:13.455
Now, our wives 
are often impacted in greater ways 


21:13.455 --> 21:16.257
than even we are 
by some of these changes. 


21:16.257 --> 21:19.795
Most of our dear wives, 
pretty much they’re going to move 


21:19.795 --> 21:21.797
if their husband is moving.


21:21.797 --> 21:24.199
Now, stop and think about that. 


21:24.198 --> 21:26.735
How could it make you feel? 


21:26.735 --> 21:28.803
What if their move 
to another complex 


21:28.803 --> 21:32.473
means losing 
the job that they love? 


21:32.473 --> 21:35.476
Maybe they 
are even good at it, right? 


21:35.477 --> 21:37.479
You know what that’s like. 


21:37.478 --> 21:40.481
Or even leaving those 
that they are enjoying working with, 


21:40.482 --> 21:42.750
but now they’re separating. 


21:42.750 --> 21:46.488
I know for our office, 
our Bethel Office in Brooklyn, 


21:46.488 --> 21:49.356
we are splitting 
into many different directions and going. 


21:49.357 --> 21:52.894
So we are feeling 
very personally that movement 


21:52.893 --> 21:56.365
of members 
of our very close family 


21:56.365 --> 21:59.533
of office mates 
that will be moving too. 


21:59.533 --> 22:03.071
But for our wives, 
they don’t even . . .


22:03.072 --> 22:05.740
Some of them do not yet know 
where they will work. 


22:05.740 --> 22:07.742
They’re waiting still on that. 


22:07.742 --> 22:10.345
So imagine how 
that would make them feel. 


22:10.345 --> 22:13.548
And they might even wonder: 
‘Does anybody outside of my husband 


22:13.548 --> 22:16.351
even understand the anxiety 
I am going through?’ 


22:16.352 --> 22:18.920
Are emotions involved? 
Absolutely! 


22:18.920 --> 22:22.257
Because often, 
isn’t it true that we have more detail 


22:22.257 --> 22:26.395
about what’s going to happen to us 
than sometimes even our wives do? 


22:26.395 --> 22:28.397
So it is good 
for us to think about that. 


22:28.397 --> 22:31.332
What can help our wives 
to cope with these feelings 


22:31.332 --> 22:36.270
and sometimes 
the staying balanced and staying on course 


22:36.270 --> 22:38.640
with this question 
hanging over their heads?


22:38.640 --> 22:41.577
Well, we would like to consider 
our second Scriptural example, 


22:41.577 --> 22:43.579
that of Esther.


22:43.578 --> 22:47.815
Of the women in the Bible, Esther was one 
who seemed to have very little say 


22:47.815 --> 22:51.085
on how she 
would spend her life. 


22:51.085 --> 22:53.355
But she willingly submitted. 


22:53.355 --> 22:58.227
Let’s turn to Esther 
and look at this account together. 


22:58.227 --> 23:00.895
In Esther the 2nd chapter, 
we want to learn a little something 


23:00.895 --> 23:04.632
about Esther first
—Esther the 2nd chapter, 


23:04.632 --> 23:07.835
verse 7, in the b part. 


23:07.835 --> 23:12.307
In the second part, it says: 
“The young woman was beautifully formed 


23:12.307 --> 23:15.544
“and attractive in appearance, 
and at the death 


23:15.543 --> 23:19.246
of her father and her mother,
Mordecai took her as his daughter.” 


23:19.247 --> 23:24.119
So she was 
a beautiful young woman 


23:24.118 --> 23:26.186
in Israel. 


23:26.187 --> 23:29.124
So no doubt, 
there was no shortage 


23:29.123 --> 23:31.191
of nice young men 


23:31.192 --> 23:33.195
in the nation 
that would have been interested,


23:33.195 --> 23:35.263
and she probably 
could have had her pick. 


23:35.263 --> 23:37.665
But did she get her pick? 


23:37.665 --> 23:39.667
No. 


23:39.667 --> 23:44.672
She, along with other 
beautiful young women in that nation, 


23:44.672 --> 23:48.344
were taken by a pagan king, 
Ahasuerus. 


23:48.343 --> 23:53.348
And look what it says 
in chapter 2, verse 12. 


23:53.348 --> 23:57.285
It says, first it says: 
“Each young woman had her turn 


23:57.285 --> 24:01.890
“to go in to King Ahasuerus 
after completing the 12-month treatment 


24:01.890 --> 24:05.227
“that was prescribed for the women, 
for this was the way 


24:05.227 --> 24:09.497
“they had to fulfill their beauty treatment
—six months with oil of myrrh 


24:09.497 --> 24:14.202
and six months with balsam oil 
and various ointments for beauty treatment.” 


24:14.202 --> 24:18.140
Verse 14, it says: 
“In the evening she would go in, 


24:18.140 --> 24:22.477
and in the morning she would return 
to the second house of the women.” 


24:22.477 --> 24:27.415
So, of course, 
instead of her getting to pick 


24:27.415 --> 24:31.252
a nice young man 
that she could raise a family with 


24:31.252 --> 24:34.857
and serve Jehovah with 
and maybe even be 


24:34.857 --> 24:38.727
someone who could 
produce the Messiah, 


24:38.727 --> 24:40.762
that was gone 


24:40.762 --> 24:45.300
because now she was with someone 
who didn’t love Jehovah. 


24:45.300 --> 24:49.838
A pagan, really, 
and he already had many wives. 


24:49.838 --> 24:53.241
So that’s a pretty difficult situation.


24:53.242 --> 24:55.377
Could you go along with that? 


24:55.377 --> 24:57.379
Well, Esther did. 
Why? 


24:57.378 --> 24:59.046
Well, this is what it says. 


24:59.047 --> 25:02.784
Even Mordecai told her, 
‘Don’t tell them you’re a Jew.’ 


25:02.783 --> 25:05.920
Now, that may have gotten her 
out of that whole arrangement. 


25:05.920 --> 25:07.922
Of course, 
it may have cost her her life too. 


25:07.922 --> 25:11.860
But Esther 2:20 says this: 


25:11.860 --> 25:15.597
“Esther did not say anything 
about her relatives and her people, 


25:15.597 --> 25:17.999
“just as Mordecai 
had instructed. . . . 


25:17.998 --> 25:20.668
“Esther continued to do 
what Mordecai said, 


25:20.668 --> 25:23.738
just as when she 
was under his care.” 


25:23.738 --> 25:27.608
Esther put her personal preferences 
and comforts aside. 


25:27.608 --> 25:29.610
She did just as she was told. 


25:29.610 --> 25:34.548
And, of course, we know what happened: 
her act of faith, she became queen. 


25:34.548 --> 25:37.151
But also, what really happened? 


25:37.152 --> 25:40.189
Well, the 4th chapter, verse 14, 


25:40.188 --> 25:43.123
Mordecai says to her 
in the latter part: 


25:43.123 --> 25:46.526
“Who knows whether 
it is for a time like this 


25:46.527 --> 25:49.030
that you have attained 
to your royal status?” 


25:49.030 --> 25:51.032
Jehovah used her. 


25:51.032 --> 25:53.034
She made herself available. 


25:53.033 --> 25:56.370
Her willingly complying
—even in difficult circumstances 


25:56.370 --> 26:01.375
that would have tested 
any Christian sister in our time


26:01.375 --> 26:04.312
—surely shows 
that she had 


26:04.312 --> 26:07.115
a beautiful, 
a beautiful spirit. 


26:07.115 --> 26:10.718
And do you think she ever looked back 
and regretted that decision


26:10.718 --> 26:15.256
—whether or not her cozy little life 
that she wished she would have had was lost?


26:15.257 --> 26:20.195
If she did, if so, all she had to do 
was look around and see 


26:20.195 --> 26:22.863
every little boy and little girl 


26:22.863 --> 26:25.866
that she saw pass by 
and realize that she had something. 


26:25.867 --> 26:28.470
Her self-sacrifice helped Jehovah 


26:28.470 --> 26:32.107
in preserving 
that young person alive. 


26:32.107 --> 26:35.644
So she was 
a powerful woman of faith 


26:35.643 --> 26:38.045
that we can call 
a good example.


26:38.045 --> 26:39.913
And our sisters are no different. 


26:39.913 --> 26:43.718
You aren’t simply here at Bethel 
because of your husbands. 


26:43.718 --> 26:47.721
You made a choice, 
a conscious decision to come to Bethel


26:47.722 --> 26:52.427
—to live a life of self-sacrifice 
and devotion through your Bethel service. 


26:52.427 --> 26:54.162
And we know that. 


26:54.162 --> 26:57.765
You could have said no 
when that young man was interested in you 


26:57.765 --> 27:00.568
and he asked you, “Would you like 
to get married and come to Bethel?” 


27:00.568 --> 27:05.573
You could have said no. 
He would’ve followed you anywhere, right? 


27:05.573 --> 27:10.211
Or you sisters who are already married, 
and you sat down with your husband 


27:10.212 --> 27:12.214
and you prayed about it 
and you talked about it: 


27:12.213 --> 27:15.416
“Can we make ourselves available 
for this avenue of service?” 


27:15.417 --> 27:18.820
And if you would’ve said no, 
he would’ve stuck with you. 


27:18.820 --> 27:20.822
But you didn’t. 


27:20.822 --> 27:25.627
You put your own 
personal comforts aside to a measure 


27:25.627 --> 27:29.564
so that you could have 
this additional avenue of service. 


27:29.563 --> 27:33.968
And you know, we often talk about 
telling people what we did in the new system


27:33.968 --> 27:37.505
when we’re in Paradise and others ask, 
“How did you spend your time?” 


27:37.505 --> 27:42.143
You’re not going to say, “Well, my husband 
was at Bethel, so I was there.” 


27:42.143 --> 27:47.148
You’re going to say: “No, 
I was at Bethel with my husband. 


27:47.148 --> 27:49.816
“And we got to 
serve Jehovah full-time 


27:49.817 --> 27:53.220
“in the most exciting time 
of the organization’s history, 


27:53.220 --> 27:56.557
“and we got to see beautiful things 
that strengthened our faith. 


27:56.557 --> 28:00.495
And we got to be a part of that
—a part of that history.” 


28:00.495 --> 28:03.030
So it is for us. 


28:03.030 --> 28:06.702
We feel honored 
to serve with you sisters 


28:06.702 --> 28:08.970
that are with us, our wives. 


28:08.970 --> 28:12.840
When Proverbs 31:31 speaks, 
we think of you. 


28:12.840 --> 28:15.910
It says: “Give her 
the reward for what she does, 


28:15.910 --> 28:20.582
and let her [own] works 
praise her in the city gates.”


28:20.582 --> 28:22.984
Now, that’s just one area of change. 


28:22.983 --> 28:25.586
What about a second area of change 
that’s affecting many of us. 


28:25.587 --> 28:28.255
We want to talk about that 
for just a few minutes. 


28:28.255 --> 28:30.592
And that’s the 
change of assignment. 


28:30.592 --> 28:33.127
We’ve been talking 
about reassignments. 


28:33.127 --> 28:36.799
But more specifically, 
we’d like to talk to you brothers and sisters 


28:36.798 --> 28:39.866
who have been working 
as temporary workers. 


28:39.867 --> 28:44.605
Some of you are temporary volunteers 
who have poured your heart and soul 


28:44.605 --> 28:49.543
into the Wallkill and Warwick projects, 
and we’re thankful for that. 


28:49.543 --> 28:54.148
You, many of you, 
have seen the project go from a pile of dirt, 


28:54.148 --> 28:56.550
to a deep hole, 
to beautiful structures. 


28:56.550 --> 29:01.555
At both locations, it’s been really marvelous 
to see the willing workers. 


29:01.555 --> 29:05.025
But now the projects 
are wrapping up, 


29:05.025 --> 29:09.763
and the majority of Wallkill work 
will be done in just a few months. 


29:09.763 --> 29:14.768
And Warwick, of course, now we got the news: 
move-in date of September 1. 


29:14.768 --> 29:16.771
So that’s exciting. 


29:16.772 --> 29:19.174
Some may have thought, 
‘Well, if I’d just worked hard enough, 


29:19.173 --> 29:23.000
if I’d just stayed long enough, 
maybe I’d get to stay afterward.’ 


29:24.345 --> 29:26.882
And we can’t blame you 
for feeling that way. 


29:26.882 --> 29:31.887
But, of course, it’s pretty clear now, 
many will be going home. 


29:31.887 --> 29:34.889
So, of course, 
that’s a change of assignment for you. 


29:34.888 --> 29:37.691
You may be wondering 
what you will do next. 


29:37.692 --> 29:41.229
Most, like you, are wondering, though, 
where are you going to get the same joy? 


29:41.228 --> 29:44.165
Where are you going to be able 
to do the same fulfilling work 


29:44.165 --> 29:46.167
that you made yourself 
available for here? 


29:46.167 --> 29:48.570
And that’s really commendable.


29:48.570 --> 29:52.007
We’d like you to consider 
the account of Bezalel. 


29:52.007 --> 29:54.009
Now, we’ve talked 
a lot about Bezalel. 


29:54.008 --> 29:56.276
Of course, during construction 
we always do, right? 


29:56.277 --> 30:00.482
If you turn to the account 
in Exodus 31, 


30:00.482 --> 30:04.285
let’s just look at this 
together for just a moment. 


30:04.285 --> 30:07.955
In speaking about Bezalel, 
this is what it says about him. 


30:07.955 --> 30:10.958
In verse 2 
of chapter 31 of Exodus, 


30:10.958 --> 30:14.028
it says: 
“See, I have chosen Bezalel 


30:14.028 --> 30:17.998
“the son of Uri the son of Hur 
of the tribe of Judah. 


30:17.998 --> 30:21.535
“I will fill him with the spirit of God, 
giving him wisdom, 


30:21.535 --> 30:26.407
understanding, and knowledge 
of every kind of craftsmanship.” 


30:26.407 --> 30:30.645
And verse 6 says: ‘Moreover, to assist him 
I have appointed Oholiab 


30:30.645 --> 30:35.250
‘the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, 
and I am putting wisdom into his heart 


30:35.250 --> 30:37.318
‘and all those who are skillful, 


30:37.318 --> 30:40.821
so that they may make everything 
I have commanded you.’ 


30:40.822 --> 30:44.692
Well, that was a powerful, 
powerful commission 


30:44.692 --> 30:47.295
by Jehovah for Bezalel. 


30:47.295 --> 30:51.765
He personally would be overseeing 
the building of the tabernacle, 


30:51.765 --> 30:55.102
but not just the tabernacle 
but everything that was in it


30:55.102 --> 30:59.540
—the furnishings, 
the utensils, the ark of the covenant, 


30:59.540 --> 31:02.877
the cover of the ark, 
the tables, 


31:02.877 --> 31:07.282
the alters, 
even the clothing for the priests.


31:07.282 --> 31:09.417
It’s really amazing 


31:09.417 --> 31:13.354
what he as well as these other 
skilled craftsman had been able to do! 


31:13.353 --> 31:16.490
But in a sense, 
isn’t that what Jehovah’s spirit


31:16.490 --> 31:21.328
has empowered you to do 
in your work at Wallkill and Warwick? 


31:21.328 --> 31:24.798
You came with skills, 
and you learned others. 


31:24.798 --> 31:29.736
Like Bezalel, Jehovah’s spirit has helped, 
and it’s been evident. 


31:29.737 --> 31:33.074
And no doubt Bezalel 
was admired and praised for what he did, 


31:33.073 --> 31:36.076
just as we admire and praise 
you for much of your work. 


31:36.077 --> 31:39.814
However, 
once that tabernacle was inaugurated, 


31:39.813 --> 31:42.550
things changed for Bezalel. 


31:42.550 --> 31:47.555
When the tabernacle was inaugurated, 
Bezalel could no longer enter it. 


31:47.555 --> 31:51.225
Leviticus 16 
says that only Aaron 


31:51.225 --> 31:55.630
could come into the Most Holy 
and only that during the appointed time. 


31:55.630 --> 31:59.867
Additionally, in Numbers 3:31, 
it says Bezalel could no longer 


31:59.867 --> 32:03.470
even touch the furnishings 
because now the Kohathites 


32:03.470 --> 32:07.542
had the sole responsibility 
of moving those utensils. 


32:07.542 --> 32:12.447
So now here is someone who had 
a personal hand in doing all of that work 


32:12.447 --> 32:16.717
for that tabernacle to be built, 
but now he couldn’t go inside, 


32:16.717 --> 32:20.254
couldn’t touch, 
couldn’t even look. 


32:20.253 --> 32:22.523
How do you think he felt? 


32:22.523 --> 32:25.626
Well, the scripture doesn’t say, 


32:25.627 --> 32:29.097
but likely 
to a man of devotion like him, 


32:29.097 --> 32:33.167
the work would’ve been more important 
than just his own personal feelings. 


32:33.167 --> 32:37.172
But we know this: 
What he couldn’t do 


32:37.172 --> 32:41.175
would only be overshadowed 
by what he could do. 


32:41.175 --> 32:43.243
He had beautiful memories. 


32:43.243 --> 32:47.581
Imagine telling his children 
and grandchildren of what work he did. 


32:47.582 --> 32:51.919
Imagine having them meet others 
who worked right alongside him. 


32:51.918 --> 32:56.923
Yes, a lasting monument to praise Jehovah
—that’s what he was working on, 


32:56.923 --> 32:59.526
and that’s what you’ve been 
working on. 


32:59.527 --> 33:03.197
Something to praise Jehovah, 
to make his name known. 


33:03.197 --> 33:07.735
But imagine how thrilled Bezalel 
is going to be when he learns 


33:07.735 --> 33:12.740
that his faithfulness and his actions 
were recorded in God’s Word for all of us. 


33:12.740 --> 33:15.543
What a privilege that will be too!


33:15.543 --> 33:18.011
What’s the lesson for us? 


33:18.012 --> 33:21.815
Don’t judge the quality 
or appreciation of your work 


33:21.815 --> 33:24.552
by whether or not 
you get to stay. 


33:24.552 --> 33:26.954
In our Bible reading 
this last week, 


33:26.953 --> 33:30.156
2 Chronicles 15:7 was cited. 


33:30.157 --> 33:34.895
It says: ‘But you, be strong 
and do not be discouraged,’ 


33:34.895 --> 33:39.733
or “do not let your hands drop” down, 
“for your activity will be rewarded.” 


33:39.733 --> 33:41.735
Yes, you don’t need 
to be discouraged. 


33:41.735 --> 33:46.607
Like Bezalel, you have a lifetime of memories 
to share and you can appreciate. 


33:46.607 --> 33:50.277
You’ll be able to bring your family 
to facilities that you’ve helped build. 


33:50.277 --> 33:53.414
You’ll be able to point out 
things that you did. 


33:53.413 --> 33:57.618
You’ll also have memories 
that no one can take away from you, 


33:57.618 --> 34:00.220
and those 
will be precious as well. 


34:00.220 --> 34:04.625
Maybe some of those bus rides 
you’ll be able to talk about. 


34:04.625 --> 34:07.095
And I know 
that the audience here 


34:07.095 --> 34:10.297
especially can appreciate 
those bus rides. 


34:10.297 --> 34:12.767
A mechanic 
told me once he was working 


34:12.767 --> 34:15.302
on the air conditioning 
for the bus in the middle of the night. 


34:15.302 --> 34:18.639
He said, 
“You do not want a hot bus 


34:18.638 --> 34:21.508
“full of 60 hot workers 


34:21.508 --> 34:25.078
stuck in midtown-Manhattan traffic 
coming home.” 


34:25.078 --> 34:27.615
But think of those memories. 


34:27.615 --> 34:32.553
Think of the things that went right; think 
of the things that maybe had a little glitch.


34:32.553 --> 34:36.256
Those are memories you have, 
and every time you get together with someone 


34:36.257 --> 34:38.860
who you served with, 
you’re going to talk about that. 


34:38.860 --> 34:41.995
And what was the biggest frustration 
that you had is now going to be something 


34:41.995 --> 34:46.600
you laugh about 
and talk about for an eternity. 


34:46.600 --> 34:50.872
Memories that can never ever 
be taken away from you. 


34:50.872 --> 34:53.875
So remember, 
this is not your last assignment. 


34:53.875 --> 34:55.877
We don’t retire 
from Jehovah’s service. 


34:55.877 --> 34:58.880
We don’t have a rocking chair 
somewhere on a porch, 


34:58.880 --> 35:02.015
and now we’re just going 
to rock ourselves into the sunset. 


35:02.015 --> 35:06.487
We have work to do, and Jehovah 
wants you to be part of it. 


35:06.487 --> 35:08.824
So it’s just like . . .


35:08.823 --> 35:11.025
If you have to leave Bethel, 


35:11.025 --> 35:13.828
one of the things 
that someone had said before is: 


35:13.828 --> 35:17.498
“The best way to leave Bethel 
is to take it with you when you go. 


35:17.498 --> 35:19.900
“Take your memories with you. 


35:19.900 --> 35:24.038
“Build enthusiasm 
and appreciation for others in Bethel. 


35:24.038 --> 35:27.241
“Take your friendships, 
and never stop volunteering 


35:27.242 --> 35:30.579
for any assignment 
the organization needs.” 


35:30.578 --> 35:35.215
They need us. 
They need you to do that work.


35:35.215 --> 35:39.887
Finally, the third and last change 
we want to talk about 


35:39.887 --> 35:43.892
has to do 
with changing circumstances personally 


35:43.892 --> 35:45.894
for many in our family. 


35:45.893 --> 35:50.163
Many of our older members 
of the family have served for decades. 


35:50.163 --> 35:52.766
They have witnessed 
an exciting growth 


35:52.767 --> 35:55.000
in the history 
of Jehovah’s people. 


35:56.803 --> 36:01.808
Maybe when Brooklyn 
was the only buildings at Bethel, 


36:01.808 --> 36:05.880
then Kingdom Farm, 
Mountain Farm, Wallkill, Patterson


36:05.880 --> 36:09.483
—tremendous expansion
—and now Warwick. 


36:09.483 --> 36:13.220
Many of our older ones at Bethel 
have experienced all of that. 


36:13.220 --> 36:15.355
They have seen all of that come. 


36:15.355 --> 36:18.292
What a beautiful privilege 
that they’ve had! 


36:18.292 --> 36:23.297
But maybe, some have been told 
that they won’t be going 


36:23.297 --> 36:27.569
with their department to Wallkill 
or even Warwick in some cases. 


36:27.568 --> 36:30.370
So that can be pretty disappointing. 


36:30.370 --> 36:33.840
That can stir 
some pretty deep-seated emotions. 


36:33.840 --> 36:37.912
They might feel as the psalmist did 
in Psalm 71:9, where he said: 


36:37.912 --> 36:41.849
“Do not cast me off in my old age; 
do not abandon me 


36:41.848 --> 36:44.685
when my strength fails.” 


36:44.685 --> 36:49.257
But we must remember 
that our changing circumstances


36:49.257 --> 36:53.727
—whoever we are, 
wherever we serve—have nothing to do 


36:53.727 --> 36:56.997
with how Jehovah views us. 


36:56.997 --> 37:02.002
So it doesn’t change our desire 
to be used by him as well.


37:02.002 --> 37:06.007
This last week 
Brother Larson mentioned 


37:06.007 --> 37:09.677
Isaiah the 46th chapter, 
and it’s an appropriate scripture 


37:09.677 --> 37:14.382
for us to consider when talking 
about this particular subject as well. 


37:14.382 --> 37:18.785
Isaiah 46:4, it says: 


37:18.785 --> 37:21.788
“Until you grow old 
I will be the same; 


37:21.788 --> 37:25.458
“until your hair is gray 
I will keep bearing you. 


37:25.458 --> 37:27.861
“As I have done, 


37:27.862 --> 37:32.199
I will carry you 
and bear you and rescue you.” 


37:32.198 --> 37:35.603
Jehovah has always done that for us. 


37:35.603 --> 37:41.000
And for you older members of the family 
with many decades of faithful service, 


37:42.310 --> 37:45.780
you’ve shown us how 
to let Jehovah do that, 


37:45.780 --> 37:48.115
so that you 
can get the work done. 


37:48.115 --> 37:51.918
It’s that same unchangeable God 


37:51.918 --> 37:55.790
that helps us 
continue to be stabilized. 


37:55.790 --> 37:59.260
It grounds us, 
and it guards our heart, 


37:59.260 --> 38:02.730
so that we know 
that Jehovah loves us 


38:02.730 --> 38:05.900
and cherishes us personally. 


38:05.900 --> 38:10.570
When our hair is gray 
and our strength is gone, Jehovah carries us. 


38:10.570 --> 38:15.175
So we know, you brothers 
and sisters did not come to Bethel 


38:15.175 --> 38:18.312
with the idea 
that one day you would retire. 


38:18.312 --> 38:22.249
You have worked hard. 
You didn’t plan for that day. 


38:22.248 --> 38:24.518
But Jehovah doesn’t view it that way. 


38:24.518 --> 38:28.521
We think about Daniel 
in the 10th chapter. 


38:28.522 --> 38:33.560
Jehovah described Daniel 
as a “very precious man.” 


38:33.560 --> 38:36.597
He was likely 
around 100 years of age, 


38:36.597 --> 38:40.802
and yet he was 
still very precious in Jehovah’s eyes


38:40.802 --> 38:42.804
—even as you are. 


38:42.803 --> 38:45.471
So it’s important to remember 
that just because we cannot do 


38:45.472 --> 38:50.144
what we once did, does not mean
we cannot do anything at all.


38:50.143 --> 38:52.713
We’d like to consider, finally, 


38:52.713 --> 38:56.716
the example 
of the apostle John 


38:56.717 --> 38:59.587
to help us maybe 
get a perspective on this. 


38:59.587 --> 39:03.457
Now, of course, 
John was used mightily by Jehovah. 


39:03.457 --> 39:05.525
He was a man of action, of faith. 


39:05.525 --> 39:10.530
Jesus called him 
and his brother the “Sons of Thunder.” 


39:10.530 --> 39:15.535
So they were people 
who were full of action. 


39:15.535 --> 39:21.000
John 21:7 also says he’s described 
as “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” 


39:22.308 --> 39:26.046
He sat directly next to Jesus 
at mealtimes. 


39:26.047 --> 39:28.782
He was a very special friend. 


39:28.782 --> 39:31.985
Maybe even Jesus shared things 
with him that He didn’t 


39:31.985 --> 39:35.990
with the other disciples 
around Him. 


39:35.990 --> 39:39.793
He was one of the few 
to witness the transfiguration. 


39:39.793 --> 39:42.128
He was one of the three 
that accompanied Jesus 


39:42.128 --> 39:47.000
into the house of Jairus 
to witness the resurrection of his daughter. 


39:47.000 --> 39:50.603
He even had the honor 
of caring 


39:50.603 --> 39:54.006
for Jesus’ mother 
after his death. 


39:54.007 --> 39:57.679
Still, after Jesus’ ascension 
to heaven, 


39:57.678 --> 40:01.215
when all of this activity 
was going on, 


40:01.215 --> 40:03.417
what did John do? 


40:03.417 --> 40:06.620
Well, he preached. 


40:06.620 --> 40:09.090
He was a faithful member 
of the congregation. 


40:09.090 --> 40:14.095
He was with Peter when some 
of the most fiery speeches were given, 


40:14.095 --> 40:17.898
miracles were performed, 
and when they stood up to say: 


40:17.898 --> 40:21.435
‘We will obey God 
as ruler rather than men.’ 


40:21.435 --> 40:25.973
All of those things show 
that John was a man of faith. 


40:25.973 --> 40:29.110
But a long time went by 


40:29.110 --> 40:32.647
when we catch up with John 
later in life.


40:32.647 --> 40:35.182
In the meantime, 
so much else had happened. 


40:35.182 --> 40:37.519
Many had written 
their own Gospel, right? 


40:37.518 --> 40:41.588
Matthew had written it 
some eight years after Jesus’ death. 


40:41.588 --> 40:45.191
Fifteen to seventeen years later, 
Luke wrote his. 


40:45.192 --> 40:47.194
A few years after that, 
Mark wrote his. 


40:47.193 --> 40:50.396
But not John, 
he still hadn’t written his. 


40:50.397 --> 40:54.067
Sixty-three years later, 
where do we find John? 


40:54.067 --> 40:56.704
Well, apparently where most Christians 
were back then


40:56.703 --> 40:59.071
—preaching or in prison. 


40:59.072 --> 41:02.810
So look at what it says, 
Revelation 1:9, 


41:02.810 --> 41:05.745
Revelation 1:9. 


41:05.745 --> 41:10.283
Now imagine, he’s old; 
he’s well into his 90’s. 


41:10.283 --> 41:15.221
He’s the last 
of the apostles to be alive. 


41:15.222 --> 41:18.359
Revelation 1:9 says: 
“I John, your brother 


41:18.358 --> 41:21.528
“and a sharer with you 
in the tribulation and kingdom 


41:21.528 --> 41:24.865
“and endurance 
in association with Jesus, 


41:24.865 --> 41:28.935
“was on the island called Patmos 
for speaking about God 


41:28.935 --> 41:32.472
and bearing witness 
concerning Jesus.” 


41:32.472 --> 41:36.677
John was old, 
but he was active. 


41:36.677 --> 41:38.945
His faith was intact, 


41:38.945 --> 41:42.883
and he found himself 
in prison. 


41:42.883 --> 41:46.553
But that’s not even 
fully the point. 


41:46.553 --> 41:51.491
You see, John was yet to receive, 
was just about to receive, 


41:51.492 --> 41:54.829
or had just received 
what was arguably 


41:54.828 --> 41:58.231
the greatest privilege 
he would ever have. 


41:58.232 --> 42:03.237
Yes, because Jehovah caused him 
to see a thrilling vision of the future. 


42:03.237 --> 42:06.040
It brings it all the way down 
to the time of the end 


42:06.040 --> 42:08.908
and the conclusion 
of this system of things. 


42:08.908 --> 42:13.913
He got to pen 
the vision of Revelation. 


42:13.913 --> 42:17.785
And then after that, 
he got to write his Gospel 


42:17.785 --> 42:20.453
and three other books 
with his name. 


42:20.453 --> 42:23.223
Do you think he was worthless? 


42:23.223 --> 42:26.093
No. 
He was at an all-time peak. 


42:26.093 --> 42:29.296
His value was the best ever. 


42:29.297 --> 42:31.299
But isn’t it amazing! 


42:31.298 --> 42:34.568
We think sometimes that maybe 
there’s nothing left for us to do, 


42:34.568 --> 42:37.303
but that’s not 
how Jehovah sees it. 


42:37.303 --> 42:41.841
What a grand privilege for John 
to cap some 70 years of faithful service!


42:41.842 --> 42:42.977
What’s the lesson? 


42:42.977 --> 42:47.114
We never lose our value 
to Jehovah or his organization 


42:47.113 --> 42:49.583
as long as we remain faithful. 


42:49.583 --> 42:52.318
And it’s true 
that for our older ones here at Bethel, 


42:52.318 --> 42:57.056
you’ve taught us 
as young ones coming into Bethel 


42:57.057 --> 42:59.192
what it means 
to work for Jehovah. 


42:59.192 --> 43:02.129
What it means 
to really put yourself out for that. 


43:02.128 --> 43:05.731
The example I always think of 
is when it snows outside in Brooklyn. 


43:05.732 --> 43:07.669
We have a nice arrangement. 


43:07.668 --> 43:10.003
The Transportation Office will go out; 


43:10.003 --> 43:11.938
they’ll actually see 
if the roads can be traveled.


43:11.938 --> 43:13.940
They’ll call the Bethel Office. 


43:13.940 --> 43:15.943
The Bethel Office 
will call the Branch Committee. 


43:15.943 --> 43:18.678
We’ll put an announcement together: 
It’s too snowy to go out. 


43:18.678 --> 43:20.413
You know what we spend 
the most time on? 


43:20.413 --> 43:23.550
Trying to figure out how to tell 
the senior members of the family 


43:23.550 --> 43:26.000
it’s OK 
not to go to work. 


43:28.355 --> 43:31.000
You would think we’re trying 
to make them renounce their faith. 


43:33.793 --> 43:38.731
And don’t let those sidewalks dry up 
before noon, because they’ll be out there. 


43:38.732 --> 43:40.734
They’ll be going to work. 


43:40.733 --> 43:44.805
Yes, you have taught us 
how to be 


43:44.805 --> 43:48.775
really devoted servants of Jehovah, 
and you will continue to do that. 


43:48.775 --> 43:53.780
Your example is one that comes 
like a tree that has maturity. 


43:53.780 --> 43:57.117
It’s so much more valuable 
than just a sapling 


43:57.117 --> 43:59.654
that is waiting 
to produce fruitage. 


43:59.653 --> 44:04.000
So it is that we know you’re 
like “big trees of righteousness” to Jehovah.


44:05.525 --> 44:09.597
So these are areas 
that all of us face. 


44:09.597 --> 44:12.399
We haven’t covered them all. 


44:12.398 --> 44:14.868
It’s just a few 
we’ve considered tonight. 


44:14.868 --> 44:19.406
But we recognize that change is a fact 
of life, and we’re all affected by it.


44:19.407 --> 44:22.475
It’s going to continue; 
we expect it to. 


44:22.475 --> 44:27.480
But we’ve all learned that the one thing 
that doesn’t change is Jehovah. 


44:27.480 --> 44:31.552
He’s the one who will keep us; 
he’s the one who will ground us, 


44:31.552 --> 44:34.154
and he is our refuge 
and our strength. 


44:34.153 --> 44:37.758
In our Bible examples today, 
do we have one that can help us 


44:37.758 --> 44:39.926
in Bezalel, in Esther, 


44:39.927 --> 44:44.097
in the apostle John, 
and their faithful examples?


44:44.097 --> 44:47.902
When we go back 
to our illustration of sailing, 


44:47.902 --> 44:50.570
rarely is a boat able 


44:50.570 --> 44:53.440
to get somewhere 
sailing in a direct line. 


44:53.440 --> 44:56.443
Now, sometimes you’ll have great weather 
and that can happen. 


44:56.443 --> 44:59.045
But when sailing into the wind, 


44:59.045 --> 45:02.048
a sailor needs to employ 
what they call tacking, 


45:02.048 --> 45:06.853
and the organization has used that 
in talking about maneuvering and changes. 


45:06.853 --> 45:11.291
But in short, it means that they steer 
upwind in a zigzag fashion 


45:11.292 --> 45:14.662
so that they get the wind hitting 
both sides of the sail, 


45:14.662 --> 45:19.667
and it pushes them forward 
in spite of riding into the wind. 


45:19.667 --> 45:23.237
For us, 
we have the advantage. 


45:23.237 --> 45:25.239
Jesus is at the helm. 


45:25.238 --> 45:28.975
He knows exactly where 
he wants us to be going. 


45:28.975 --> 45:32.512
We’re not alone 
in going through changes at Bethel either. 


45:32.512 --> 45:35.549
First Corinthians 12:25 
tells us: 


45:35.548 --> 45:39.018
“There should be 
no division in the body, 


45:39.018 --> 45:41.955
but its members should have 
mutual concern for one another.” 


45:41.955 --> 45:44.825
So our concern for others 
should help us 


45:44.825 --> 45:47.828
to not just think 
about ourselves. 


45:47.828 --> 45:51.365
We have many who 
are changing assignments even now


45:51.365 --> 45:55.568
—temporary workers who are leaving,
Bethel family members being reassigned, 


45:55.568 --> 45:58.171
and others 
who will be moving very soon. 


45:58.172 --> 46:01.775
These are changes, 
and they affect us. 


46:01.775 --> 46:04.377
But Jehovah 
is that same person, 


46:04.377 --> 46:07.647
even as we read 
in the 46th Psalm. 


46:07.647 --> 46:11.652
The One who can be 
with us no matter what.


46:11.652 --> 46:15.822
Bigger, 
more exciting changes? 


46:15.822 --> 46:20.827
I appreciate Brother Lett saying that, 
even in his Watchtower study today. 


46:20.827 --> 46:23.164
Armageddon is coming. 


46:23.163 --> 46:25.898
Does it get 
any bigger than that? 


46:25.898 --> 46:29.301
Wickedness will be 
a thing of the past. 


46:29.302 --> 46:34.307
Paradise will be real 
and here. 


46:34.307 --> 46:37.912
The resurrection will happen, 


46:37.912 --> 46:40.714
and old age and death 
will be a thing of the past. 


46:40.713 --> 46:45.585
These are changes we can believe in, 
and we can look forward to. 


46:45.585 --> 46:48.422
When we think about that, 


46:48.422 --> 46:52.392
whatever changes come our way,
we can be confident that


46:52.392 --> 46:56.664
we will not just go through them, 
but we can actually embrace them. 


46:56.663 --> 46:59.398
We can even grow 
from them; 


46:59.398 --> 47:02.601
we can even make sure 
we’re moving ahead with them. 


47:02.602 --> 47:06.607
We can be sure 
that our unchanging God, Jehovah, 


47:06.607 --> 47:08.642
will stick by us, 


47:08.642 --> 47:22.540
and he’s our rewarder 
everlastingly.

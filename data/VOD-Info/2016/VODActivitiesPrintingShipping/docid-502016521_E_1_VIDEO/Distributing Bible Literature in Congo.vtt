The Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also called the DRC,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an African country that is
almost one quarter the size of Europe.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, despite the challenges,
Jehovah’s Witnesses successfully

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distribute Bibles
and Bible-based publications

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the people of Congo.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This journey begins at the South Africa
branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commonly known as Bethel.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Journals and other publications
are printed here,

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these are loaded onto trucks
traveling to Congo.

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each month,

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these trucks pass through many borders

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a journey of 4,500 kilometers.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will take about 21 days
to travel toward the equator,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cutting through some of the most
challenging conditions in Africa

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to arrive safely at
the Kinshasa branch office in Congo.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some of the literature
still has a long way to go.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Kinshasa,

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a boat will travel up the Congo River

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 14 days,

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
covering a distance of 1,200 kilometers.

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is in this part of the journey

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the literature crosses
the equator to reach Bumba.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because infrastructure is limited,

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bicycles and motorcycles

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the most practical means
of transport on land.

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bumba,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the local Witnesses
quickly coordinate efforts

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver the literature on time.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippe volunteers to travel

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:12.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Bumba to Yandongi,

00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a village about 100 kilometers away,

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a load of 180 kilograms on his bicycle.

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to make the trip in only two days

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I can be back
to study the Bible with my family.

On another route,

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.301 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he travels from Bumba to Bondo.

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This 425-kilometer trek

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.015 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
takes seven days one way.

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The roads are badly maintained,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when it rains,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the state of the roads is terrible
—a catastrophe.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I arrive
at the brothers with the literature,

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone receives me with cries of happiness.

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:04.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are the ones who off-load my bike,

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:07.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep it upright, and off-load the packages.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By then, I am sitting somewhere,
and I feel very content.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthieu will travel 200 kilometers
upstream in his canoe

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver literature to Mombongo.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is one of the volunteers
who helps transport the literature

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on its epic journey every month.

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It usually takes him four days,
depending on the weather.

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:36.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me,
this journey is like working at Bethel.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I’m in the dugout canoe,
I feel like I’m in a floating Bethel.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we arrive,
the brothers welcome us with love.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are really happy
and thank Jehovah for the provision

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:51.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
given by his organization
to have the literature reach them on time.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> is published simultaneously

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in over 240 languages around the world.

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This epic journey
into the far reaches of Congo

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one example of the efforts
Jehovah’s Witnesses make

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the Bible’s lifesaving message.

00:01 Now we invite you  to enjoy a special presentation
00:05 that highlights  the relocation of headquarters
00:09 from Brooklyn to Warwick.
00:34 We’d like to let you know
00:36 that the Governing Body  has decided that if the approvals
00:40 are received  for the Warwick project,
00:44 we will be moving completely  out of Brooklyn.
00:47 The world headquarters  will be relocated at Warwick.
00:53 Jehovah is telling us  through the Governing Body,
00:55 “It’s time to move out of Brooklyn.”
00:57 The Governing Body,  these brothers,
01:00 as soon as they see  Jehovah’s direction, they just move.
01:02 It doesn’t matter if it’s  long-held cherished ideas.
01:06 This is the way it has to be done.
01:08 As soon as they see  Jehovah’s direction, it’s done.
01:10 Jehovah had everything in control.
01:11 He just kept nudging imperfect humans.
01:13 You know,  he knew where he wanted us,
01:15 and then we end up  where we’re supposed to be.
01:19 In the world, actually,  they can accomplish projects quickly.
01:24 They basically say,
01:28 “Time is of the essence,”  and they mean it.
01:31 Cost has to be almost  not a consideration.
01:36 People are not a consideration.
01:39 Jehovah’s organization is different.
01:47 What made the Warwick project  different than all the others,
01:52 and Jehovah knew,  is the fact that he realized
01:56 that we needed  constant spiritual food.
01:58 We would arrive on our buses,  arrive in our vans,
02:01 and we would go to  morning worship.
02:03 The spirituality of the family
02:05 really made this  a theocratic project
02:09 that stood out  in the minds of many.
02:11 The outside contractors there,
02:13 they noticed that we were putting  spiritual things before physical things,
02:18 and they commented on that,
02:20 “While we arrive and get right to work,
02:23 you arrive and you worship your God.”
02:27 The Branch Committee  contacted four of us
02:30 to set up a team to do the move out  from Brooklyn to Warwick.
02:34 Now it became the reality  of completely clearing out,
02:37 and I mean that’s everything.
02:39 That was a pretty daunting thing
02:42 because when people  want to buy your properties,
02:44 they want to take  possession right away.
02:46 There are six buildings that are connected  through tunnels underground.
02:50 And so, if a buyer is not interested  in purchasing multiple buildings,
02:55 the sale of the properties  are going to disconnect those tunnels.
02:58 New York City law requires  we fill those up with concrete.
03:02 We didn’t anticipate that.
03:04 Once we fill those tunnels,
03:06 that cuts off the utilities  to the rest of the buildings.
03:09 So how do you heat  the other buildings?
03:11 How do you keep their electricity,  their communication going?
03:14 When can you shut it off?  When will the people be moving?
03:17 Those are all the logistics  that came into question
03:20 and that we had  to work through.
03:22 When we look at the work,  it’s like an iceberg
03:24 —16 properties to empty;
1.6 million square feet;
03:27 over 2,000 individuals  to get moved out
03:30 in 13 months;
03:32 take that and look at 70 departments
03:34 —and you start to get  a picture of the growth
03:36 of the job already expanded.
03:38 If you shut down this service  to the Bethel family
03:41 because you’re moving that department,
03:43 you still have maybe 1,500,
03:46 1,200 people  relying on that type of service.
03:48 So now you put in  a temporary service.
03:50 But if you locate it  in the wrong location,
03:52 well, now, that can hinder  the operation of the move out.
03:55 So you have to know where to put it;
03:57 so your job just grows again.
04:01 The process starts many months,  even more than a year previous,
04:05 as you identify who  from departments are coming.
04:09 You realize that in this department  is perhaps a husband,
04:13 but in this other department is a wife,
04:15 and they’re scheduled  for two different times.
04:17 So now, how do you  make that work?
04:19 Do we have the support system  in place in order
04:21 to handle both of those assignments  at the same time?
04:24 Those logistics are all part of the process  that we had to go through at the same time.
04:27 You’re planning for two things,  not one, or sometimes even three.
04:30 Because at the same time,
04:32 when we were ramping up  the movement into Warwick,
04:35 the construction family was leaving.
04:37 So all that was part of it.
04:38 Then it was just a matter of making sure  that we could schedule
04:40 all the moves in the necessary time.
04:42 On the other side,  once you start moving out of Brooklyn
04:44 —once we began the move out of Brooklyn  and every building that got sold—
04:49 someone had to go in  and clean the place.
04:51 Everything had to be cleared out.
04:53 So the collaboration  between departments
04:55 has been really nice to see.
04:57 When we would come in  and start to speak with groups,
05:00 they were 100% cooperative.
05:02 Then they wanted to know:  How can they help? What can they do?
05:04 Are there other areas that they can help out —other departments?
05:08 So it was not a,  “This is my department,
05:10 and I’m going  to protect everything.”
05:12 It was more:  “This is the arrangement.
05:15 How can we help out?”
05:17 A move that size—
05:19 We couldn’t do it on our own,  so we had the help
05:22 of the Furniture Moving Department.
05:24 Brothers even at the other sites
05:26 —in Patterson and Wallkill,  in those libraries—
05:28 helped us to pack
05:31 and somehow to extract books  that we needed in our main library
05:34 because we have, I would say,
05:37 some 65,000 books at last counting.
05:41 The main repository, really,
05:44 for research are our books.
05:46 Writers, they have to work.
05:48 They can’t just say,
05:49 “OK, now for two months,  I won’t do anything.”
05:51 Thanks to all those moving
05:54 —they did a wonderful job helping us out.
05:56 Without them,  I think we still would be in Brooklyn
06:00 counting our books.
06:06 A lot of things go into moving  the Broadcasting Department.
06:09 Even in just the studio,  the number of departments
06:13 that have assisted  in some way is staggering.
06:16 And really, there was no other way  it could have gotten done
06:18 without the help of all those  different brothers and sisters.
06:25 We got contacted  by the Brooklyn Heights Association.
06:28 They wanted to know:  How is this move going to happen?
06:31 Brooklyn is very complicated
06:33 —there’s traffic everywhere,
06:36 people crossing the sidewalk,
06:38 trying to get around buses,
06:40 construction right behind  the office building here.
06:43 So they were very appreciative
06:45 of how we had it organized
06:48 —how we’d already communicated  with the police
06:50 on what we were doing  and how we were going to handle it.
06:52 So it was sort of an unexpected,
06:54 but we saw Jehovah’s blessing  in that activity as well.
07:00 The older ones in Bethel  were the ones who set the pace for us.
07:04 The things we learn from them —their work ethic,
07:07 their broad view  of the worldwide field—
07:10 to me,  is what our organization is about.
07:14 And so for me,  it’s extremely gratifying
07:18 to be able to help.
07:20 Are they nervous?  Yes.
07:21 But really, they are faithful  and want to work
07:24 along with Jehovah’s organization,  so they’ve been very cooperative.
07:29 When you have a lot of people helping you,  you can’t go wrong.
07:32 They know me like the back of their hand.
07:35 But, we’ve laughed about it,  and we’re all happy.
07:38 And they’re providing us  a lot of assistance in whatever we’re doing,
07:42 and I love them for that.
07:44 It’s encouraging to see those ones do that.
07:46 It sets a nice example for the rest of us.
07:50 So some have asked me the question,  “What was the difference between Warwick
07:53 and all the other construction projects  that you did under the U.S. branch?”
07:57 This one was a little unique.
07:59 There was a need  for great communication,
08:02 not good communication,  great communication.
08:05 We had to trust our brothers and sisters —implicit trust.
08:09 We had to yield to other departments.
08:12 I think it’s only been  a training ground, really,
08:16 for Jesus Christ to use it  to teach people
08:19 and to teach us skills  that we’re going to use for an eternity.
08:27 I think it has made  a great impression
08:31 on all those who have had  the privilege of working on it.
08:34 Once the Bethel family makes  the move out of Brooklyn
08:38 and begins to inhabit Warwick,
08:41 that’s when you’re going to see  some significant changes.
08:44 I am looking forward to the effect  that it has on the brotherhood.
08:49 Everywhere we go around the world,  that’s one of the first questions
08:52 people ask is: “How is Warwick?
08:54 We’re planning to come to Warwick.  We want to come see it.”
08:57 And when they come  and they see the beautiful surroundings,
09:00 when they see what is there —the museum that will be there—
09:05 it is really going  to touch many people.
09:08 As we look to the future,  we have no idea,
09:11 but we know that Jehovah  has amazing things in store.
09:14 When you see  an organization like this
09:17 come together  to accomplish a common goal,
09:20 you know  it can only be done by Jehovah.
09:22 It touches your heart.
09:24 It touches your faith.
09:27 It helps you  to really see that, yes,
09:30 Jehovah is running  this organization.
09:32 And his earthly part  of the organization
09:34 is amazing.
09:49 When we think about  this first morning worship
09:52 from our beautiful new headquarters,
09:56 the Governing Body  thought it would be appropriate
09:59 to provide an open letter
10:01 to thank all who have shared
10:05 in the hard work  that went into this project.
10:08 How we appreciate it!
10:10 But permit me, please,
10:12 to read this open letter  from the Governing Body.
10:17 “Dear Brothers:
10:19 “On behalf of the Warwick Bethel family,
10:22 “the Governing Body  would like to express deep appreciation
10:27 “for our lovely new home  here at Warwick Bethel.
10:32 “How we love  our new residences and offices!
10:37 “The fresh air, quiet environment,
10:40 “and beautiful scenery
10:42 “are already having  a beneficial effect on how we feel.
10:47 “We are confident that now
10:50 “—with Jehovah’s blessing and help—
10:53 “we will be able to work even harder
10:55 “and accomplish even more  in behalf of Kingdom interests.
11:00 “Even though we do not deserve
11:03 “such a wonderful place  to live and work,
11:05 “we truly appreciate  this generous expression
11:09 “of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.
11:13 “—1 Peter 4:10.
11:17 “We are most grateful to Jehovah
11:19 “for the more than 27,000  different brothers and sisters
11:24 “who volunteered to work  on the construction of this project.
11:28 “Many of you dear friends  took vacation time,
11:31 “paid your own transportation costs,  lived in small rooms,
11:36 “and got up very early in the morning
11:38 “to ride buses or shuttles  to the work site.
11:41 “Then you worked tirelessly  in all kinds of weather,
11:46 “putting your heart into supporting
11:49 “this theocratic building project.
11:52 “Many of you accepted  multiple invitations to work here.
11:56 “Unquestionably,  Jehovah loves you very much
12:01 “for what you have done.
12:03 “Please be assured that the Governing Body
12:06 “loves you very much too!
12:09 “To borrow Paul’s words to the Thessalonians,
12:14 “‘you have become so beloved to us.’
12:18 “—1 Thessalonians 2:8.
12:21 “In addition to those who shared  in the actual construction work,
12:26 “countless other dear brothers and sisters
12:29 “supported this project from afar.
12:32 “Self-sacrificing wives  backed their husbands’ participation,
12:38 “diligent remote workers lent a hand,
12:41 “generous publishers assisted financially,
12:44 “and other loyal ones
12:47 “encouraged and provided practical help
12:50 “to those who were able  to work at the Warwick site.
12:55 “Reflecting on those  who helped from far away
12:58 “reminds us of 1 Samuel 30:24.
13:02 “God’s Word tells us that the ones  who stayed behind with the baggage
13:07 “received the same share
13:10 “as the ones who went into battle.
13:14 “Even though we do not personally know  the vast majority
13:18 “of you brothers and sisters  who have supported this project,
13:22 “for a certainty, Jehovah knows  each and every one of you.
13:28 “As Hebrews 6:10 assures:
13:30 “‘God is not unrighteous  so as to forget your work
13:35 “‘and the love you showed for his name
13:37 “‘by ministering . . . to the holy ones.’
13:41 “Jehovah expects us  to give him our best.
13:45 “That is why He found  Cain’s sacrifice displeasing.
13:49 “He knew that Cain could have done better.
13:52 “—Genesis 4:5.
13:55 “But like Abel,
13:57 “you dear friends  have given Jehovah your best.
14:01 “We are confident that you will continue  to show your wholehearted love
14:06 “for Jehovah in harmony  with your circumstances.
14:10 “—Genesis 4:4; Matthew 22:37.
14:15 “Additionally, the Governing Body
14:18 “would like to thank  from the bottom of our heart
14:20 “the five brothers
14:22 “who served on the  Warwick Construction Project Committee
14:26 “for their inexhaustible labors of love.
14:32 “We also want to thank profusely  the many Bethelites
14:36 “who worked  ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with us
14:38 “in connection  with this massive theocratic endeavor.
14:42 “—Zephaniah 3:9.
14:45 “Included are the brothers  on the United States Branch Committee
14:50 “and the hardworking brothers and sisters
14:53 “in the Furniture Moving Department,
14:56 “the Maintenance Department,  the Computer Department,
14:59 “the Broadcasting Department,  the Transportation Department,
15:02 “and the Bethel Office
15:04 “who are still carrying out  the gigantic task
15:09 “of moving the Bethel family  from Brooklyn to Warwick.
15:15 “We would certainly be remiss  if we failed to thank also
15:20 “the thousands upon thousands  of devoted brothers and sisters
15:25 “who labored  on the project at Wallkill.
15:29 “That too was a massive undertaking!
15:34 “May Jehovah bless the willing spirit  that you dear ones have shown.
15:40 “In the Bible,  sometimes a thought
15:43 “is repeated three times  for emphasis.
15:45 “In this vein, we say,
15:49 “‘thank you, thank you, thank you’
15:53 “to all who have helped us
15:56 “and are continuing  to help us bring
15:59 “this wonderful theocratic project  at headquarters to completion!
16:04 “‘May Jehovah reward you  for what you have done,
16:09 “‘and may there be  a perfect wage for you
16:12 “‘from Jehovah the God of Israel,
16:15 “‘under whose wings  you have come to seek refuge.’
16:19 “—Ruth 2:12.
16:22 “We express our warm love
16:25 “and affection for all of you!
16:29 Your brothers,  Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

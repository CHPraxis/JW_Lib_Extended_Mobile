00:01.063 --> 00:05.775
Now we invite you 
to enjoy a special presentation 


00:05.775 --> 00:09.738
that highlights 
the relocation of headquarters 


00:09.738 --> 00:13.000
from Brooklyn to Warwick.


00:34.805 --> 00:36.807
We’d like to let you know 


00:36.807 --> 00:40.477
that the Governing Body 
has decided that if the approvals 


00:40.477 --> 00:44.022
are received 
for the Warwick project, 


00:44.022 --> 00:47.484
we will be moving completely 
out of Brooklyn. 


00:47.483 --> 00:52.000
The world headquarters 
will be relocated at Warwick.


00:53.782 --> 00:55.659
Jehovah is telling us 
through the Governing Body, 


00:55.658 --> 00:57.535
“It’s time to move out of Brooklyn.”


00:57.535 --> 01:00.580
The Governing Body, 
these brothers, 


01:00.580 --> 01:02.792
as soon as they see 
Jehovah’s direction, they just move. 


01:02.792 --> 01:06.920
It doesn’t matter if it’s 
long-held cherished ideas. 


01:06.920 --> 01:08.213
This is the way it has to be done. 


01:08.213 --> 01:10.631
As soon as they see 
Jehovah’s direction, it’s done.


01:10.632 --> 01:11.634
Jehovah had everything in control. 


01:11.633 --> 01:13.635
He just kept nudging imperfect humans. 


01:13.635 --> 01:15.637
You know, 
he knew where he wanted us, 


01:15.637 --> 01:17.000
and then we end up 
where we’re supposed to be.


01:19.975 --> 01:24.980
In the world, actually, 
they can accomplish projects quickly. 


01:24.980 --> 01:28.400
They basically say, 


01:28.400 --> 01:31.570
“Time is of the essence,” 
and they mean it. 


01:31.570 --> 01:36.367
Cost has to be almost 
not a consideration.


01:36.367 --> 01:39.454
People are not a consideration. 


01:39.453 --> 01:41.000
Jehovah’s organization is different.


01:47.878 --> 01:52.841
What made the Warwick project 
different than all the others, 


01:52.842 --> 01:56.220
and Jehovah knew, 
is the fact that he realized 


01:56.220 --> 01:58.888
that we needed 
constant spiritual food. 


01:58.888 --> 02:01.933
We would arrive on our buses, 
arrive in our vans, 


02:01.933 --> 02:03.935
and we would go to 
morning worship.


02:03.935 --> 02:05.770
The spirituality of the family 


02:05.770 --> 02:09.232
really made this 
a theocratic project 


02:09.232 --> 02:11.235
that stood out 
in the minds of many.


02:11.235 --> 02:13.945
The outside contractors there, 


02:13.945 --> 02:18.450
they noticed that we were putting 
spiritual things before physical things, 


02:18.450 --> 02:20.285
and they commented on that, 


02:20.285 --> 02:23.163
“While we arrive and get right to work, 


02:23.163 --> 02:27.625
you arrive and you worship your God.”


02:27.625 --> 02:30.378
The Branch Committee 
contacted four of us 


02:30.378 --> 02:34.090
to set up a team to do the move out 
from Brooklyn to Warwick.


02:34.090 --> 02:37.385
Now it became the reality 
of completely clearing out, 


02:37.385 --> 02:39.388
and I mean that’s everything. 


02:39.388 --> 02:42.140
That was a pretty daunting thing 


02:42.140 --> 02:44.142
because when people 
want to buy your properties, 


02:44.142 --> 02:46.145
they want to take 
possession right away.


02:46.145 --> 02:50.982
There are six buildings that are connected 
through tunnels underground. 


02:50.982 --> 02:55.112
And so, if a buyer is not interested 
in purchasing multiple buildings, 


02:55.112 --> 02:58.990
the sale of the properties 
are going to disconnect those tunnels.


02:58.990 --> 03:02.660
New York City law requires 
we fill those up with concrete. 


03:02.660 --> 03:04.663
We didn’t anticipate that. 


03:04.663 --> 03:06.665
Once we fill those tunnels, 


03:06.665 --> 03:09.418
that cuts off the utilities 
to the rest of the buildings. 


03:09.418 --> 03:11.420
So how do you heat 
the other buildings? 


03:11.420 --> 03:14.673
How do you keep their electricity, 
their communication going? 


03:14.673 --> 03:17.300
When can you shut it off? 
When will the people be moving? 


03:17.300 --> 03:20.220
Those are all the logistics 
that came into question 


03:20.220 --> 03:22.222
and that we had 
to work through. 


03:22.222 --> 03:24.934
When we look at the work, 
it’s like an iceberg


03:24.933 --> 03:27.978
—16 properties to empty; 
1.6 million square feet; 


03:27.978 --> 03:30.105
over 2,000 individuals 
to get moved out 


03:30.105 --> 03:32.107
in 13 months; 


03:32.107 --> 03:34.485
take that and look at 70 departments


03:34.485 --> 03:36.820
—and you start to get 
a picture of the growth 


03:36.820 --> 03:38.988
of the job already expanded. 


03:38.988 --> 03:41.741
If you shut down this service 
to the Bethel family 


03:41.742 --> 03:43.744
because you’re moving that department, 


03:43.743 --> 03:46.330
you still have maybe 1,500, 


03:46.330 --> 03:48.707
1,200 people 
relying on that type of service. 


03:48.707 --> 03:50.709
So now you put in 
a temporary service. 


03:50.708 --> 03:52.710
But if you locate it 
in the wrong location, 


03:52.710 --> 03:55.755
well, now, that can hinder 
the operation of the move out. 


03:55.755 --> 03:57.758
So you have to know where to put it; 


03:57.758 --> 04:00.000
so your job just grows again.


04:01.512 --> 04:05.515
The process starts many months, 
even more than a year previous, 


04:05.515 --> 04:09.812
as you identify who 
from departments are coming.


04:09.812 --> 04:13.815
You realize that in this department 
is perhaps a husband, 


04:13.815 --> 04:15.817
but in this other department is a wife, 


04:15.817 --> 04:17.820
and they’re scheduled 
for two different times. 


04:17.820 --> 04:19.237
So now, how do you 
make that work? 


04:19.237 --> 04:21.240
Do we have the support system 
in place in order 


04:21.240 --> 04:24.075
to handle both of those assignments 
at the same time?


04:24.075 --> 04:27.872
Those logistics are all part of the process 
that we had to go through at the same time. 


04:27.872 --> 04:30.707
You’re planning for two things, 
not one, or sometimes even three. 


04:30.707 --> 04:32.709
Because at the same time, 


04:32.708 --> 04:35.086
when we were ramping up 
the movement into Warwick, 


04:35.087 --> 04:37.130
the construction family was leaving. 


04:37.130 --> 04:38.548
So all that was part of it. 


04:38.548 --> 04:40.550
Then it was just a matter of making sure 
that we could schedule 


04:40.550 --> 04:42.593
all the moves in the necessary time. 


04:42.593 --> 04:44.888
On the other side, 
once you start moving out of Brooklyn


04:44.888 --> 04:49.433
—once we began the move out of Brooklyn 
and every building that got sold—


04:49.433 --> 04:51.436
someone had to go in 
and clean the place. 


04:51.437 --> 04:53.147
Everything had to be cleared out.


04:53.147 --> 04:55.315
So the collaboration 
between departments 


04:55.315 --> 04:57.525
has been really nice to see. 


04:57.525 --> 05:00.737
When we would come in 
and start to speak with groups, 


05:00.737 --> 05:02.739
they were 100% cooperative. 


05:02.738 --> 05:04.991
Then they wanted to know: 
How can they help? What can they do? 


05:04.992 --> 05:08.620
Are there other areas that they can help out
—other departments? 


05:08.620 --> 05:10.955
So it was not a, 
“This is my department, 


05:10.955 --> 05:12.958
and I’m going 
to protect everything.” 


05:12.958 --> 05:15.085
It was more: 
“This is the arrangement. 


05:15.085 --> 05:17.087
How can we help out?”


05:17.087 --> 05:19.297
A move that size— 


05:19.297 --> 05:22.717
We couldn’t do it on our own, 
so we had the help 


05:22.717 --> 05:24.887
of the Furniture Moving Department. 


05:24.887 --> 05:26.889
Brothers even at the other sites


05:26.888 --> 05:28.931
—in Patterson and Wallkill, 
in those libraries—


05:28.932 --> 05:31.394
helped us to pack 


05:31.393 --> 05:34.813
and somehow to extract books 
that we needed in our main library 


05:34.813 --> 05:37.481
because we have, I would say, 


05:37.482 --> 05:41.320
some 65,000 books at last counting.


05:41.320 --> 05:44.615
The main repository, really, 


05:44.615 --> 05:46.825
for research are our books. 


05:46.825 --> 05:48.077
Writers, they have to work. 


05:48.077 --> 05:49.077
They can’t just say, 


05:49.077 --> 05:51.539
“OK, now for two months, 
I won’t do anything.” 


05:51.538 --> 05:54.081
Thanks to all those moving


05:54.082 --> 05:56.960
—they did a wonderful job helping us out. 


05:56.960 --> 06:00.880
Without them, 
I think we still would be in Brooklyn 


06:00.880 --> 06:02.000
counting our books.


06:06.845 --> 06:09.765
A lot of things go into moving 
the Broadcasting Department. 


06:09.765 --> 06:13.018
Even in just the studio, 
the number of departments 


06:13.018 --> 06:16.813
that have assisted 
in some way is staggering.


06:16.813 --> 06:18.815
And really, there was no other way 
it could have gotten done 


06:18.815 --> 06:22.000
without the help of all those 
different brothers and sisters.


06:25.780 --> 06:28.783
We got contacted 
by the Brooklyn Heights Association. 


06:28.783 --> 06:31.620
They wanted to know: 
How is this move going to happen?


06:31.620 --> 06:33.872
Brooklyn is very complicated


06:33.872 --> 06:36.917
—there’s traffic everywhere, 


06:36.917 --> 06:38.919
people crossing the sidewalk, 


06:38.918 --> 06:40.961
trying to get around buses, 


06:40.962 --> 06:43.465
construction right behind 
the office building here.


06:43.465 --> 06:45.633
So they were very appreciative 


06:45.633 --> 06:48.053
of how we had it organized


06:48.053 --> 06:50.055
—how we’d already communicated 
with the police 


06:50.055 --> 06:52.598
on what we were doing 
and how we were going to handle it. 


06:52.598 --> 06:54.935
So it was sort of an unexpected, 


06:54.935 --> 06:57.000
but we saw Jehovah’s blessing 
in that activity as well.


07:00.398 --> 07:04.068
The older ones in Bethel 
were the ones who set the pace for us. 


07:04.068 --> 07:07.446
The things we learn from them
—their work ethic, 


07:07.447 --> 07:10.659
their broad view 
of the worldwide field—


07:10.658 --> 07:14.996
to me, 
is what our organization is about. 


07:14.997 --> 07:18.334
And so for me, 
it’s extremely gratifying 


07:18.333 --> 07:20.335
to be able to help.


07:20.335 --> 07:21.337
Are they nervous? 
Yes. 


07:21.337 --> 07:24.089
But really, they are faithful 
and want to work 


07:24.088 --> 07:27.000
along with Jehovah’s organization, 
so they’ve been very cooperative.


07:29.093 --> 07:32.763
When you have a lot of people helping you, 
you can’t go wrong. 


07:32.763 --> 07:35.183
They know me like the back of their hand. 


07:35.183 --> 07:38.895
But, we’ve laughed about it, 
and we’re all happy. 


07:38.895 --> 07:42.648
And they’re providing us 
a lot of assistance in whatever we’re doing, 


07:42.648 --> 07:44.860
and I love them for that.


07:44.860 --> 07:46.862
It’s encouraging to see those ones do that. 


07:46.862 --> 07:49.000
It sets a nice example for the rest of us.


07:50.323 --> 07:53.993
So some have asked me the question, 
“What was the difference between Warwick 


07:53.993 --> 07:57.788
and all the other construction projects 
that you did under the U.S. branch?” 


07:57.788 --> 07:59.791
This one was a little unique. 


07:59.792 --> 08:02.752
There was a need 
for great communication, 


08:02.752 --> 08:05.714
not good communication, 
great communication. 


08:05.713 --> 08:09.258
We had to trust our brothers and sisters
—implicit trust. 


08:09.258 --> 08:12.970
We had to yield to other departments.


08:12.970 --> 08:16.642
I think it’s only been 
a training ground, really, 


08:16.642 --> 08:19.812
for Jesus Christ to use it 
to teach people 


08:19.812 --> 08:24.000
and to teach us skills 
that we’re going to use for an eternity.


08:27.777 --> 08:31.030
I think it has made 
a great impression 


08:31.030 --> 08:34.242
on all those who have had 
the privilege of working on it. 


08:34.242 --> 08:38.622
Once the Bethel family makes 
the move out of Brooklyn 


08:38.622 --> 08:41.875
and begins to inhabit Warwick, 


08:41.875 --> 08:44.920
that’s when you’re going to see 
some significant changes.


08:44.920 --> 08:49.465
I am looking forward to the effect 
that it has on the brotherhood. 


08:49.465 --> 08:52.427
Everywhere we go around the world, 
that’s one of the first questions 


08:52.427 --> 08:54.764
people ask is: “How is Warwick? 


08:54.763 --> 08:57.515
We’re planning to come to Warwick. 
We want to come see it.” 


08:57.515 --> 09:00.810
And when they come 
and they see the beautiful surroundings, 


09:00.810 --> 09:05.148
when they see what is there
—the museum that will be there—


09:05.148 --> 09:08.110
it is really going 
to touch many people.


09:08.110 --> 09:11.278
As we look to the future, 
we have no idea, 


09:11.278 --> 09:14.615
but we know that Jehovah 
has amazing things in store.


09:14.615 --> 09:17.660
When you see 
an organization like this 


09:17.660 --> 09:20.872
come together 
to accomplish a common goal, 


09:20.872 --> 09:22.874
you know 
it can only be done by Jehovah. 


09:22.873 --> 09:24.876
It touches your heart. 


09:24.877 --> 09:27.004
It touches your faith. 


09:27.003 --> 09:30.465
It helps you 
to really see that, yes, 


09:30.465 --> 09:32.675
Jehovah is running 
this organization. 


09:32.675 --> 09:34.970
And his earthly part 
of the organization 


09:34.970 --> 09:37.000
is amazing.


09:49.358 --> 09:52.778
When we think about 
this first morning worship 


09:52.778 --> 09:56.073
from our beautiful new headquarters, 


09:56.073 --> 09:59.535
the Governing Body 
thought it would be appropriate 


09:59.535 --> 10:01.913
to provide an open letter


10:01.913 --> 10:05.208
to thank all who have shared 


10:05.208 --> 10:08.128
in the hard work 
that went into this project. 


10:08.128 --> 10:10.130
How we appreciate it! 


10:10.130 --> 10:12.173
But permit me, please, 


10:12.173 --> 10:15.000
to read this open letter 
from the Governing Body.


10:17.095 --> 10:19.097
“Dear Brothers: 


10:19.097 --> 10:22.600
“On behalf of the Warwick Bethel family, 


10:22.600 --> 10:27.438
“the Governing Body 
would like to express deep appreciation 


10:27.438 --> 10:32.360
“for our lovely new home 
here at Warwick Bethel. 


10:32.360 --> 10:37.323
“How we love 
our new residences and offices! 


10:37.323 --> 10:40.826
“The fresh air, quiet environment, 


10:40.827 --> 10:42.995
“and beautiful scenery 


10:42.995 --> 10:47.875
“are already having 
a beneficial effect on how we feel. 


10:47.875 --> 10:50.503
“We are confident that now


10:50.503 --> 10:53.130
“—with Jehovah’s blessing and help—


10:53.130 --> 10:55.592
“we will be able to work even harder 


10:55.592 --> 11:00.472
“and accomplish even more 
in behalf of Kingdom interests. 


11:00.472 --> 11:03.140
“Even though we do not deserve 


11:03.140 --> 11:05.810
“such a wonderful place 
to live and work, 


11:05.810 --> 11:09.688
“we truly appreciate 
this generous expression 


11:09.688 --> 11:13.235
“of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.


11:13.235 --> 11:16.000
“—1 Peter 4:10. 


11:17.030 --> 11:19.740
“We are most grateful to Jehovah 


11:19.740 --> 11:24.120
“for the more than 27,000 
different brothers and sisters 


11:24.120 --> 11:28.123
“who volunteered to work 
on the construction of this project. 


11:28.123 --> 11:31.711
“Many of you dear friends 
took vacation time, 


11:31.712 --> 11:36.215
“paid your own transportation costs, 
lived in small rooms, 


11:36.215 --> 11:38.385
“and got up very early in the morning 


11:38.385 --> 11:41.888
“to ride buses or shuttles 
to the work site. 


11:41.888 --> 11:46.851
“Then you worked tirelessly 
in all kinds of weather, 


11:46.852 --> 11:49.354
“putting your heart into supporting 


11:49.353 --> 11:52.523
“this theocratic building project. 


11:52.523 --> 11:56.986
“Many of you accepted 
multiple invitations to work here. 


11:56.987 --> 12:01.199
“Unquestionably, 
Jehovah loves you very much 


12:01.198 --> 12:03.243
“for what you have done. 


12:03.243 --> 12:06.328
“Please be assured that the Governing Body


12:06.328 --> 12:09.456
“loves you very much too! 


12:09.457 --> 12:14.004
“To borrow Paul’s words to the Thessalonians, 


12:14.003 --> 12:18.173
“‘you have become so beloved to us.’


12:18.173 --> 12:21.510
“—1 Thessalonians 2:8.


12:21.510 --> 12:26.473
“In addition to those who shared 
in the actual construction work, 


12:26.473 --> 12:29.643
“countless other dear brothers and sisters 


12:29.643 --> 12:32.813
“supported this project from afar. 


12:32.813 --> 12:38.193
“Self-sacrificing wives 
backed their husbands’ participation, 


12:38.193 --> 12:41.321
“diligent remote workers lent a hand, 


12:41.322 --> 12:44.867
“generous publishers assisted financially, 


12:44.867 --> 12:47.370
“and other loyal ones 


12:47.370 --> 12:50.498
“encouraged and provided practical help 


12:50.498 --> 12:55.253
“to those who were able 
to work at the Warwick site. 


12:55.253 --> 12:58.756
“Reflecting on those 
who helped from far away 


12:58.757 --> 13:02.594
“reminds us of 1 Samuel 30:24. 


13:02.593 --> 13:07.473
“God’s Word tells us that the ones 
who stayed behind with the baggage 


13:07.473 --> 13:10.143
“received the same share 


13:10.143 --> 13:14.563
“as the ones who went into battle. 


13:14.563 --> 13:18.025
“Even though we do not personally know 
the vast majority 


13:18.025 --> 13:22.447
“of you brothers and sisters 
who have supported this project, 


13:22.447 --> 13:27.000
“for a certainty, Jehovah knows 
each and every one of you. 


13:28.118 --> 13:30.955
“As Hebrews 6:10 assures: 


13:30.955 --> 13:35.168
“‘God is not unrighteous 
so as to forget your work 


13:35.168 --> 13:37.836
“‘and the love you showed for his name 


13:37.837 --> 13:41.632
“‘by ministering . . . to the holy ones.’ 


13:41.632 --> 13:45.429
“Jehovah expects us 
to give him our best. 


13:45.428 --> 13:49.515
“That is why He found 
Cain’s sacrifice displeasing. 


13:49.515 --> 13:52.602
“He knew that Cain could have done better.


13:52.602 --> 13:55.230
“—Genesis 4:5. 


13:55.230 --> 13:57.440
“But like Abel, 


13:57.440 --> 14:01.610
“you dear friends 
have given Jehovah your best. 


14:01.610 --> 14:06.282
“We are confident that you will continue 
to show your wholehearted love 


14:06.282 --> 14:10.537
“for Jehovah in harmony 
with your circumstances.


14:10.537 --> 14:15.959
“—Genesis 4:4; Matthew 22:37.


14:15.958 --> 14:18.001
“Additionally, the Governing Body 


14:18.002 --> 14:20.797
“would like to thank 
from the bottom of our heart 


14:20.797 --> 14:22.799
“the five brothers


14:22.798 --> 14:26.803
“who served on the 
Warwick Construction Project Committee


14:26.803 --> 14:31.000
“for their inexhaustible labors of love. 


14:32.225 --> 14:36.813
“We also want to thank profusely 
the many Bethelites 


14:36.813 --> 14:38.856
“who worked
 ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with us 


14:38.857 --> 14:42.694
“in connection 
with this massive theocratic endeavor.


14:42.693 --> 14:45.071
“—Zephaniah 3:9. 


14:45.072 --> 14:50.077
“Included are the brothers 
on the United States Branch Committee 


14:50.077 --> 14:53.162
“and the hardworking brothers and sisters 


14:53.162 --> 14:56.249
“in the Furniture Moving Department, 


14:56.248 --> 14:59.126
“the Maintenance Department, 
the Computer Department, 


14:59.127 --> 15:02.880
“the Broadcasting Department, 
the Transportation Department, 


15:02.880 --> 15:04.965
“and the Bethel Office 


15:04.965 --> 15:09.053
“who are still carrying out 
the gigantic task 


15:09.053 --> 15:14.000
“of moving the Bethel family 
from Brooklyn to Warwick.


15:15.393 --> 15:20.356
“We would certainly be remiss 
if we failed to thank also


15:20.357 --> 15:25.112
“the thousands upon thousands 
of devoted brothers and sisters 


15:25.112 --> 15:29.574
“who labored 
on the project at Wallkill. 


15:29.573 --> 15:34.036
“That too was a massive undertaking! 


15:34.037 --> 15:39.000
“May Jehovah bless the willing spirit 
that you dear ones have shown. 


15:40.210 --> 15:43.003
“In the Bible, 
sometimes a thought 


15:43.003 --> 15:45.840
“is repeated three times 
for emphasis. 


15:45.840 --> 15:49.010
“In this vein, we say, 


15:49.010 --> 15:53.932
“‘thank you, thank you, thank you’ 


15:53.932 --> 15:56.725
“to all who have helped us 


15:56.725 --> 15:59.187
“and are continuing 
to help us bring 


15:59.187 --> 16:04.942
“this wonderful theocratic project 
at headquarters to completion! 


16:04.942 --> 16:09.114
“‘May Jehovah reward you 
for what you have done, 


16:09.113 --> 16:12.325
“‘and may there be 
a perfect wage for you 


16:12.325 --> 16:15.162
“‘from Jehovah the God of Israel, 


16:15.162 --> 16:19.707
“‘under whose wings 
you have come to seek refuge.’


16:19.707 --> 16:22.002
“—Ruth 2:12. 


16:22.002 --> 16:25.589
“We express our warm love 


16:25.588 --> 16:29.383
“and affection for all of you! 


16:29.383 --> 16:47.756
Your brothers, 
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

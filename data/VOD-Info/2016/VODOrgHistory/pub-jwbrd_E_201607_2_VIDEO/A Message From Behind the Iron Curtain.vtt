00:00.950 --> 00:03.553
In the late 1950’s, 


00:03.553 --> 00:05.855
the opposition 
against Jehovah’s Witnesses 


00:05.855 --> 00:07.857
in the former Soviet Union 


00:07.857 --> 00:11.494
resulted in homes being searched, 
brothers being followed, 


00:11.493 --> 00:14.063
and many of our brothers 
and sisters being sent 


00:14.063 --> 00:16.065
to Communist concentration camps 


00:16.065 --> 00:18.602
in Siberia, 
among other places. 


00:18.602 --> 00:22.272
In 1956 and 1957, 


00:22.272 --> 00:27.044
over 462,000 
convention delegates worldwide 


00:27.043 --> 00:29.711
unanimously adopted a petition 


00:29.712 --> 00:33.650
which clearly outlined the treatment 
Jehovah’s Witnesses were enduring. 


00:33.650 --> 00:36.485
It was sent 
to the Soviet authorities, 


00:36.485 --> 00:39.555
but sadly, not much changed. 


00:39.555 --> 00:43.393
The next year, 
at the 1958 international convention 


00:43.393 --> 00:45.395
at Yankee Stadium 
in New York, 


00:45.395 --> 00:49.598
a talk was given entitled 
“Behind the Iron Curtain.” 


00:49.598 --> 00:52.601
During the talk, 
delegates were surprised 


00:52.602 --> 00:54.970
when a recording of greetings 
and songs from brothers 


00:54.970 --> 00:57.673
and sisters in the Soviet Union 
was played. 


00:57.673 --> 01:00.676
Despite the risk of losing 
their freedom, 


01:00.677 --> 01:03.914
the brothers produced 
and sent these recordings. 


01:03.913 --> 01:05.981
Well, a few months ago, 


01:05.982 --> 01:09.119
some of those who were involved 
in making the recording 


01:09.118 --> 01:12.088
were able to listen to it 
for the first time


01:12.088 --> 01:15.091
Several of them 
found out only then 


01:15.092 --> 01:18.762
that the recording had been played 
at the convention at Yankee Stadium. 


01:18.762 --> 01:23.000
Our team was present 
at that gathering.


01:38.413 --> 01:42.951
The brothers told us 
to prepare songs for a recording.


01:42.952 --> 01:46.489
When we were singing, 
I never imagined 


01:46.488 --> 01:49.658
that it was for a convention, 
because I did not know about that. 


01:49.658 --> 01:51.660
We sang as usual.


01:51.660 --> 01:56.365
The chorus was made up 
of about 20 persons, 


01:56.365 --> 01:59.335
and the recording 
was made in a room 


01:59.335 --> 02:03.000
in a barrack-like building.


02:07.143 --> 02:12.148
I just looked after the chorus 
to give them the right tone.


02:12.148 --> 02:16.485
If someone sang a little off-key, 
she would right away remark: 


02:16.485 --> 02:20.823
“Altos, you are off!” 
or “Tenor, you are off!” 


02:20.823 --> 02:24.000
so that there would be no slips, 
no mistakes.


02:26.562 --> 02:28.999
We had to be very careful 


02:28.998 --> 02:31.800
when we were recording.


02:31.800 --> 02:33.970
And so we knew not to talk. 


02:33.970 --> 02:36.038
I could not tell 
anyone about it. 


02:36.038 --> 02:39.000
It was secret
—absolutely secret.


02:45.113 --> 02:47.583
They chose a brother 
who spoke very good Russian, 


02:47.583 --> 02:50.753
who had good intonation, 
and who had a good voice. 


02:50.753 --> 02:55.000
And as I recall, we made 
the recording on our first attempt.


02:58.127 --> 03:02.000
Brother Yuriy Dobychin 
said the greetings.


03:04.867 --> 03:08.270
I was young then, 
and I had a good voice. 


03:08.270 --> 03:12.275
So I had to say 
the greetings 


03:12.275 --> 03:15.712
from the brothers 
in the Soviet Union 


03:15.712 --> 03:19.000
for the brothers gathered 
at Yankee Stadium.


03:30.327 --> 03:34.330
As the brothers who made 
the recording told me, 


03:34.330 --> 03:36.532
the most difficult assignment 
for them 


03:36.532 --> 03:38.802
was how to get this recording 


03:38.802 --> 03:41.000
across the border. 


03:42.038 --> 03:44.973
The brothers cut it up 
into pieces 


03:44.973 --> 03:47.710
and sewed it into 
the lining of a jacket 


03:47.710 --> 03:52.148
because that’s how 
confidential letters were sent. 


03:52.148 --> 03:55.351
One married couple 
from Poland, 


03:55.352 --> 03:57.354
who were vacationing 
in Russia, 


03:57.353 --> 03:59.621
agreed to take it 
back with them


03:59.622 --> 04:03.660
—to take it 
out of the Soviet Union. 


04:03.660 --> 04:07.000
And that’s where they ran 
into serious problems.


04:11.167 --> 04:13.202
From Brother Scheider’s letter, 


04:13.202 --> 04:16.000
who received 
the audio recording in Poland: 


04:19.475 --> 04:22.000
“The security officers separated 
our brother from the others. 


04:23.880 --> 04:26.215
“Then an officer said to him: 


04:26.215 --> 04:29.000
‘Please give us the film 
and the three letters you have with you.’ 


04:30.420 --> 04:32.422
“The brother saw now, 
of course, 


04:32.422 --> 04:34.824
“that there had been 
a traitor somewhere. 


04:34.823 --> 04:37.960
“He and his wife 
were now thoroughly searched. 


04:37.960 --> 04:40.530
“Every square centimeter 
of their cases 


04:40.530 --> 04:44.000
“was carefully examined 
together with their contents. 


04:44.000 --> 04:46.502
“Then both were stripped naked. 


04:46.502 --> 04:49.872
“While this was going on, 
they yelled at the brother: 


04:49.872 --> 04:53.242
‘Tell us where you have hidden everything 
or to whom you have given it!’ 


04:53.242 --> 04:57.947
“They were absolutely convinced 
that he had everything with him. 


04:57.947 --> 04:59.982
“Several times they took him 
to the office 


04:59.982 --> 05:02.785
“of the frontier police 
and to the security police, 


05:02.785 --> 05:05.153
“searching him 
again and again 


05:05.153 --> 05:08.290
“and being terribly angry. 


05:08.290 --> 05:10.593
“But they finally had to give up. 


05:10.593 --> 05:12.995
“They kept him back 
for 24 hours 


05:12.995 --> 05:16.765
“and questioned him 
in the presence of ten specialists. 


05:16.765 --> 05:20.000
But he came out victorious.”


05:24.273 --> 05:27.143
Sadly, even the brothers 


05:27.143 --> 05:30.480
who were involved 
don’t know who this couple 


05:30.480 --> 05:33.000
who brought the tape 
into Poland was.


07:19.688 --> 07:22.891
Well, for me it was, of course, a great joy, 
since the goal was reached after all.


07:22.892 --> 07:25.895
Everything was so wonderful 
at that time. 


07:25.895 --> 07:27.897
I really enjoyed it all!


07:27.897 --> 07:31.367
Nothing could describe 
the joy I felt.


07:31.367 --> 07:36.000
I was overwhelmed with feelings.


07:40.375 --> 07:45.380
And so my voice was recorded, 
and the greetings were heard 


07:45.380 --> 08:16.295
in New York 
at Yankee Stadium.

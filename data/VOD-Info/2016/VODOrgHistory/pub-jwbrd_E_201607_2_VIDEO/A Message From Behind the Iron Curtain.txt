00:00 In the late 1950’s,
00:03 the opposition  against Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:05 in the former Soviet Union
00:07 resulted in homes being searched,  brothers being followed,
00:11 and many of our brothers  and sisters being sent
00:14 to Communist concentration camps
00:16 in Siberia,  among other places.
00:18 In 1956 and 1957,
00:22 over 462,000  convention delegates worldwide
00:27 unanimously adopted a petition
00:29 which clearly outlined the treatment  Jehovah’s Witnesses were enduring.
00:33 It was sent  to the Soviet authorities,
00:36 but sadly, not much changed.
00:39 The next year,  at the 1958 international convention
00:43 at Yankee Stadium  in New York,
00:45 a talk was given entitled  “Behind the Iron Curtain.”
00:49 During the talk,  delegates were surprised
00:52 when a recording of greetings  and songs from brothers
00:54 and sisters in the Soviet Union  was played.
00:57 Despite the risk of losing  their freedom,
01:00 the brothers produced  and sent these recordings.
01:03 Well, a few months ago,
01:05 some of those who were involved  in making the recording
01:09 were able to listen to it  for the first time
01:12 Several of them  found out only then
01:15 that the recording had been played  at the convention at Yankee Stadium.
01:18 Our team was present  at that gathering.
01:38 The brothers told us  to prepare songs for a recording.
01:42 When we were singing,  I never imagined
01:46 that it was for a convention,  because I did not know about that.
01:49 We sang as usual.
01:51 The chorus was made up  of about 20 persons,
01:56 and the recording  was made in a room
01:59 in a barrack-like building.
02:07 I just looked after the chorus  to give them the right tone.
02:12 If someone sang a little off-key,  she would right away remark:
02:16 “Altos, you are off!”  or “Tenor, you are off!”
02:20 so that there would be no slips,  no mistakes.
02:26 We had to be very careful
02:28 when we were recording.
02:31 And so we knew not to talk.
02:33 I could not tell  anyone about it.
02:36 It was secret —absolutely secret.
02:45 They chose a brother  who spoke very good Russian,
02:47 who had good intonation,  and who had a good voice.
02:50 And as I recall, we made  the recording on our first attempt.
02:58 Brother Yuriy Dobychin  said the greetings.
03:04 I was young then,  and I had a good voice.
03:08 So I had to say  the greetings
03:12 from the brothers  in the Soviet Union
03:15 for the brothers gathered  at Yankee Stadium.
03:30 As the brothers who made  the recording told me,
03:34 the most difficult assignment  for them
03:36 was how to get this recording
03:38 across the border.
03:42 The brothers cut it up  into pieces
03:44 and sewed it into  the lining of a jacket
03:47 because that’s how  confidential letters were sent.
03:52 One married couple  from Poland,
03:55 who were vacationing  in Russia,
03:57 agreed to take it  back with them
03:59 —to take it  out of the Soviet Union.
04:03 And that’s where they ran  into serious problems.
04:11 From Brother Scheider’s letter,
04:13 who received  the audio recording in Poland:
04:19 “The security officers separated  our brother from the others.
04:23 “Then an officer said to him:
04:26 ‘Please give us the film  and the three letters you have with you.’
04:30 “The brother saw now,  of course,
04:32 “that there had been  a traitor somewhere.
04:34 “He and his wife  were now thoroughly searched.
04:37 “Every square centimeter  of their cases
04:40 “was carefully examined  together with their contents.
04:44 “Then both were stripped naked.
04:46 “While this was going on,  they yelled at the brother:
04:49 ‘Tell us where you have hidden everything  or to whom you have given it!’
04:53 “They were absolutely convinced  that he had everything with him.
04:57 “Several times they took him  to the office
04:59 “of the frontier police  and to the security police,
05:02 “searching him  again and again
05:05 “and being terribly angry.
05:08 “But they finally had to give up.
05:10 “They kept him back  for 24 hours
05:12 “and questioned him  in the presence of ten specialists.
05:16 But he came out victorious.”
05:24 Sadly, even the brothers
05:27 who were involved  don’t know who this couple
05:30 who brought the tape  into Poland was.
07:19 Well, for me it was, of course, a great joy,  since the goal was reached after all.
07:22 Everything was so wonderful  at that time.
07:25 I really enjoyed it all!
07:27 Nothing could describe  the joy I felt.
07:31 I was overwhelmed with feelings.
07:40 And so my voice was recorded,  and the greetings were heard
07:45 in New York  at Yankee Stadium.

I’ve really enjoyed talking with you.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to get off at the next stop,

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’d like to give you this.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you mentioned
that you don’t read much,

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I think you’ll really like this website.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has free information and videos
for your whole family.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.
I’ll take a look at it.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.
Have a great day!

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, soon the whole earth will be a paradise

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’ll be no more sickness.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I had faith like yours.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would really help me
to cope with this health problem.

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know, the hope I just described

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found in the Bible.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This card takes you to a website

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has more information.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The code on the back directs you to a video

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that briefly explains why there are
so many problems in the world.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will definitely watch it when I go home.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next patient, please.

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it looks like they’re ready for me.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for the card and for listening.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:08.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Sabrina, where did you get
that information for your class report?

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found it on this website, jw.org.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has a whole section for teens,
and everything is free.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks!

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll check it out after class.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, would you like something to read?

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have anything in Korean?

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately, we don’t today.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our website, jw.org,
does have literature in Korean.

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:31.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have a moment, I can show you.

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, great!

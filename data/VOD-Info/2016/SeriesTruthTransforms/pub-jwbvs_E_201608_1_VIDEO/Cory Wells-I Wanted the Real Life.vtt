WEBVTT

00:05.442 --> 00:09.000
The first rodeo I performed in front 
of an audience, I was eight years old.


00:17.788 --> 00:21.000
We were considered 
one of the top two acts in rodeo. 


00:22.877 --> 00:27.000
My strength lay in my fearlessness.


00:31.885 --> 00:36.265
Even though there was 
a certain amount of excitement


00:36.265 --> 00:41.978
—it was fun to travel, 
to be together as a family—


00:41.978 --> 00:44.000
it was empty.


00:48.318 --> 00:51.946
Trick riding is like gymnastics 
on the back of a running horse. 


00:51.947 --> 00:54.909
We’ve had horses all of our lives. 


00:54.908 --> 00:58.000
My father specialized in training horses. 


00:59.830 --> 01:02.373
He used to send us to the mountains, 


01:02.373 --> 01:05.835
riding all day long. 


01:05.835 --> 01:08.005
And then we’d come home 
in the evening, 


01:08.005 --> 01:10.925
and we would start trick riding.


01:10.925 --> 01:13.677
The way we learned was by a book. 


01:13.677 --> 01:17.097
We looked at stick pictures 
that showed how it should be done, 


01:17.097 --> 01:19.725
and so it was trial and error. 


01:19.725 --> 01:22.000
At the same time that we were learning,
our horses were learning. 


01:23.645 --> 01:27.000
The horse that I rode 
just let me do anything. 


01:28.108 --> 01:30.151
My horse’s name was Sweet Lips. 


01:30.152 --> 01:33.489
I was eight when I got him, 
and I named him myself. 


01:33.488 --> 01:37.241
He was like my best friend.


01:37.242 --> 01:41.039
My parents were very active 
in the rodeo as competitors. 


01:41.038 --> 01:43.040
My mom was barrel racing; 


01:43.040 --> 01:45.917
my father was 
a saddle bronc rider. 


01:45.917 --> 01:50.505
I grew up as 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


01:50.505 --> 01:53.550
but when I was very young, 
maybe six or seven, 


01:53.550 --> 01:55.677
my father stopped 
serving Jehovah. 


01:55.677 --> 01:57.847
To be honest with you, 


01:57.847 --> 02:00.224
when they announced that 
at the Kingdom Hall, 


02:00.223 --> 02:03.393
it really didn’t have 
much meaning to me at the time. 


02:03.393 --> 02:06.021
I didn’t know what it meant. 


02:06.022 --> 02:08.774
And I could see people crying, 
and so I cried. 


02:08.773 --> 02:11.776
But I didn’t really understand it. 


02:11.777 --> 02:16.000
Really, from that point, our family 
was not active as Jehovah’s Witnesses.


02:17.532 --> 02:21.287
I grew up on the road, 
traveling rodeo to rodeo


02:21.287 --> 02:25.374
—from coast to coast 
and from the south to the north—


02:25.373 --> 02:28.835
as far as the roads go. 


02:28.835 --> 02:31.338
The four of us rode initially


02:31.338 --> 02:34.675
—Connie; Kelly; myself; 
and my brother, Jim. 


02:34.675 --> 02:36.677
Our family traveled together. 


02:36.677 --> 02:39.179
That meant a lot to me. 


02:39.178 --> 02:43.391
What separated us 
from the others at the time 


02:43.392 --> 02:47.104
was the high speed 
that we did it at and also  


02:47.103 --> 02:49.856
the difficulty with the tricks 
that we chose to do. 


02:49.857 --> 02:51.859
People were very excited. 


02:51.858 --> 02:55.695
They would hire us back 
at the same place year after year. 


02:55.695 --> 02:58.407
Throughout all that time, 


02:58.407 --> 03:02.077
we did not miss one Memorial. 


03:02.077 --> 03:04.497
We were always there. 
There was something in us.


03:04.497 --> 03:07.165
We didn’t know it 
when we were little, 


03:07.165 --> 03:09.208
but my parents 
had succeeded 


03:09.208 --> 03:12.336
in planting 
the truth in our hearts. 


03:12.337 --> 03:16.800
My link to the truth 
was my grandmother. 


03:16.800 --> 03:19.302
I can remember going 
to the ranch and visiting her. 


03:19.302 --> 03:23.474
She was very busy, but one thing 
that really sticks in my mind


03:23.473 --> 03:27.268
is she always studied
—every day. 


03:27.268 --> 03:31.106
She read her Bible. 
Her magazines were studied. 


03:31.107 --> 03:36.000
And I think it just put a seed in there 
that later on started to grow.


03:37.487 --> 03:40.574
I just felt like 
I needed direction. 


03:40.573 --> 03:43.493
It’s like a line 
was drawn in the sand. 


03:43.493 --> 03:46.663
Take one path or the other. 


03:46.663 --> 03:49.248
And so, ironically, 
the first book 


03:49.248 --> 03:52.543
that I picked up 
to read was the Bible.


03:52.543 --> 03:54.838
One of the scriptures 
that probably 


03:54.838 --> 03:58.000
meant the most to me 
was Proverbs 3:5,6:


03:59.217 --> 04:01.387
“Trust in Jehovah 
with all your heart 


04:01.387 --> 04:03.889
“and do not lean upon 
your own understanding. 


04:03.888 --> 04:06.100
“In all your ways 
take notice of him, 


04:06.100 --> 04:09.000
and he himself 
will make your paths straight.” 


04:10.187 --> 04:12.564
I used to think 
about those words 


04:12.563 --> 04:15.000
and what I would have to do 
to live up to them.


04:16.235 --> 04:18.445
Although we traveled 
with the rodeo 


04:18.445 --> 04:20.488
about ten months 
out of the year, 


04:20.488 --> 04:22.490
we did go 
to the district convention, 


04:22.490 --> 04:25.535
and the Live Forever book 
came out. 


04:25.535 --> 04:28.538
And there just came a time 
when I knew


04:28.538 --> 04:31.333
I—I needed to make changes.


04:31.333 --> 04:33.543
A sister started 
studying with me, 


04:33.543 --> 04:36.963
and as I started reading 
the Bible for myself and studying, 


04:36.963 --> 04:39.841
then Jehovah became real. 


04:39.842 --> 04:41.885
All it took was one or two people, 


04:41.885 --> 04:43.928
and the whole family followed. 


04:43.928 --> 04:47.000
My father too returned to the truth.


04:49.017 --> 04:51.019
Trick riding was our family business. 


04:51.018 --> 04:54.731
It was our livelihood, 
but we had decided that we were done. 


04:54.732 --> 04:56.734
We were going to stop. 


04:56.733 --> 05:01.155
With that decision would come 
giving up everything we knew.


05:01.155 --> 05:04.742
I think—I think the most difficult thing


05:04.742 --> 05:07.000
for me to do was to sell the horse


05:08.537 --> 05:12.374
—you just, you just get 
such a close bond with them 


05:12.373 --> 05:16.378
when you’re putting 
your life in their hands like that—


05:16.378 --> 05:18.588
but I was willing to do that.


05:18.588 --> 05:19.590
I just— 


05:19.590 --> 05:23.000
I knew what I wanted to do;
I did it.


05:24.720 --> 05:27.000
I got baptized 
in October of ʼ85. 


05:29.182 --> 05:32.185
Our last performance 
was in February of ʼ86. 


05:32.185 --> 05:34.187
We just finished out 
our contracts. 


05:34.187 --> 05:37.607
I started pioneering 
in September of ʼ86, 


05:37.607 --> 05:40.069
and I’ve never stopped.


05:40.068 --> 05:43.113
I also married a man 
who loves Jehovah. 


05:43.113 --> 05:45.156
We’ve had 
the privilege of working  


05:45.157 --> 05:47.159
on international construction projects. 


05:47.158 --> 05:49.160
We went to Mexico. 


05:49.160 --> 05:51.205
We went to Venezuela. 


05:51.205 --> 05:54.498
My father is an elder. 
My mom is pioneering. 


05:54.498 --> 05:57.376
In fact, all of my siblings 
have been able 


05:57.377 --> 06:00.380
to regular pioneer 
at some point in their lives.


06:00.380 --> 06:03.050
We’re presently in the circuit work. 


06:03.050 --> 06:06.512
Serving Jehovah together 
is such a blessing. 


06:06.512 --> 06:11.000
Everything that we do 
every day is for Jehovah. 


06:12.308 --> 06:14.310
That’s what I wanted to do 


06:14.310 --> 06:17.000
when I made this decision.


06:18.690 --> 06:22.318
If I would have taken 
that other path when I was young, 


06:22.318 --> 06:25.030
I may not be alive today. 


06:25.030 --> 06:27.908
What I did was dangerous. 


06:27.908 --> 06:31.620
Even fame and fortune in the world
—there’s nothing there. 


06:31.620 --> 06:33.622
I wanted “the real life.” 


06:33.622 --> 06:36.000
I wanted to serve Jehovah.


06:37.750 --> 06:40.837
I have no regrets. 


06:40.837 --> 06:42.924
If I could change anything 


06:42.923 --> 06:45.425
when it comes 
to my service to Jehovah,


06:45.425 --> 06:47.427
I would change nothing! 


06:47.427 --> 07:07.344
I would just do it better.

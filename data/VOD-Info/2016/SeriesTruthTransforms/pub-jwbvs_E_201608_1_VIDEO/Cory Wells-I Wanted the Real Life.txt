00:05 The first rodeo I performed in front  of an audience, I was eight years old.
00:17 We were considered  one of the top two acts in rodeo.
00:22 My strength lay in my fearlessness.
00:31 Even though there was  a certain amount of excitement
00:36 —it was fun to travel,  to be together as a family—
00:41 it was empty.
00:48 Trick riding is like gymnastics  on the back of a running horse.
00:51 We’ve had horses all of our lives.
00:54 My father specialized in training horses.
00:59 He used to send us to the mountains,
01:02 riding all day long.
01:05 And then we’d come home  in the evening,
01:08 and we would start trick riding.
01:10 The way we learned was by a book.
01:13 We looked at stick pictures  that showed how it should be done,
01:17 and so it was trial and error.
01:19 At the same time that we were learning, our horses were learning.
01:23 The horse that I rode  just let me do anything.
01:28 My horse’s name was Sweet Lips.
01:30 I was eight when I got him,  and I named him myself.
01:33 He was like my best friend.
01:37 My parents were very active  in the rodeo as competitors.
01:41 My mom was barrel racing;
01:43 my father was  a saddle bronc rider.
01:45 I grew up as  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:50 but when I was very young,  maybe six or seven,
01:53 my father stopped  serving Jehovah.
01:55 To be honest with you,
01:57 when they announced that  at the Kingdom Hall,
02:00 it really didn’t have  much meaning to me at the time.
02:03 I didn’t know what it meant.
02:06 And I could see people crying,  and so I cried.
02:08 But I didn’t really understand it.
02:11 Really, from that point, our family  was not active as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:17 I grew up on the road,  traveling rodeo to rodeo
02:21 —from coast to coast  and from the south to the north—
02:25 as far as the roads go.
02:28 The four of us rode initially
02:31 —Connie; Kelly; myself;  and my brother, Jim.
02:34 Our family traveled together.
02:36 That meant a lot to me.
02:39 What separated us  from the others at the time
02:43 was the high speed  that we did it at and also
02:47 the difficulty with the tricks  that we chose to do.
02:49 People were very excited.
02:51 They would hire us back  at the same place year after year.
02:55 Throughout all that time,
02:58 we did not miss one Memorial.
03:02 We were always there.  There was something in us.
03:04 We didn’t know it  when we were little,
03:07 but my parents  had succeeded
03:09 in planting  the truth in our hearts.
03:12 My link to the truth  was my grandmother.
03:16 I can remember going  to the ranch and visiting her.
03:19 She was very busy, but one thing  that really sticks in my mind
03:23 is she always studied —every day.
03:27 She read her Bible.  Her magazines were studied.
03:31 And I think it just put a seed in there  that later on started to grow.
03:37 I just felt like  I needed direction.
03:40 It’s like a line  was drawn in the sand.
03:43 Take one path or the other.
03:46 And so, ironically,  the first book
03:49 that I picked up  to read was the Bible.
03:52 One of the scriptures  that probably
03:54 meant the most to me  was Proverbs 3:5,6:
03:59 “Trust in Jehovah  with all your heart
04:01 “and do not lean upon  your own understanding.
04:03 “In all your ways  take notice of him,
04:06 and he himself  will make your paths straight.”
04:10 I used to think  about those words
04:12 and what I would have to do  to live up to them.
04:16 Although we traveled  with the rodeo
04:18 about ten months  out of the year,
04:20 we did go  to the district convention,
04:22 and the Live Forever book  came out.
04:25 And there just came a time  when I knew
04:28 I—I needed to make changes.
04:31 A sister started  studying with me,
04:33 and as I started reading  the Bible for myself and studying,
04:36 then Jehovah became real.
04:39 All it took was one or two people,
04:41 and the whole family followed.
04:43 My father too returned to the truth.
04:49 Trick riding was our family business.
04:51 It was our livelihood,  but we had decided that we were done.
04:54 We were going to stop.
04:56 With that decision would come  giving up everything we knew.
05:01 I think—I think the most difficult thing
05:04 for me to do was to sell the horse
05:08 —you just, you just get  such a close bond with them
05:12 when you’re putting  your life in their hands like that—
05:16 but I was willing to do that.
05:18 I just—
05:19 I knew what I wanted to do; I did it.
05:24 I got baptized  in October of ʼ85.
05:29 Our last performance  was in February of ʼ86.
05:32 We just finished out  our contracts.
05:34 I started pioneering  in September of ʼ86,
05:37 and I’ve never stopped.
05:40 I also married a man  who loves Jehovah.
05:43 We’ve had  the privilege of working
05:45 on international construction projects.
05:47 We went to Mexico.
05:49 We went to Venezuela.
05:51 My father is an elder.  My mom is pioneering.
05:54 In fact, all of my siblings  have been able
05:57 to regular pioneer  at some point in their lives.
06:00 We’re presently in the circuit work.
06:03 Serving Jehovah together  is such a blessing.
06:06 Everything that we do  every day is for Jehovah.
06:12 That’s what I wanted to do
06:14 when I made this decision.
06:18 If I would have taken  that other path when I was young,
06:22 I may not be alive today.
06:25 What I did was dangerous.
06:27 Even fame and fortune in the world —there’s nothing there.
06:31 I wanted “the real life.”
06:33 I wanted to serve Jehovah.
06:37 I have no regrets.
06:40 If I could change anything
06:42 when it comes  to my service to Jehovah,
06:45 I would change nothing!
06:47 I would just do it better.

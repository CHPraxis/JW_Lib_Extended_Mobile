00:06 Nurdup is a small island about 10 to 15 minutes by boat
00:10 from the Panama mainland.
00:19 Life on these islands is simple,
00:22 though this one in particular is special.
00:25 Even though the island only has 24 inhabitants,
00:29 7 of them,  along with 5 from other islands,
00:33 attend the only congregation
00:35 of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the region.
00:38 Buna Tejada is one of them.
00:40 Though until very recently, she could neither read nor write.
00:45 I wanted to learn about the Bible,
00:47 even though I didn’t know how to read.
00:52 My parents didn’t send me to school,
00:55 but my brother taught me a little.
01:00 I felt that books spoke to people,
01:03 but to me they were speechless.
01:07 My teacher even said that books could talk.
01:09 But I was never able to hear them.
01:12 When I saw people  going to the Kingdom Hall,
01:15 I thought: ‘These meetings look good.
01:18 I should go too.’
01:20 I knew that no one would say: “Why are you here?
01:23 You won’t understand anything.”
01:24 That’s why I started going to meetings,
01:27 and I’ve never stopped since.
01:29 Sometimes it’s difficult.
01:32 But I know if I miss a meeting, I will feel bad.
01:35 So even if I can only listen, I still go.
01:41 Some people don’t like to see you progressing.
01:44 They say, “Buna thinks she’s a man —always with her books.”
01:48 Even one of my brothers, who has since passed away,
01:51 used to tell me the same.
01:56 At first, I felt ashamed reading in front of others,
02:02 and sometimes I still feel ashamed.
02:04 So I would wait until I was alone at night before I read.
02:10 But I did not always understand.
02:12 I needed someone to help me
02:14 —to encourage me and explain what I was reading.
02:19 At first,
02:21 there was only material in Spanish, so that’s all I had.
02:24 I don’t speak Spanish.
02:26 So I didn’t understand anything,
02:28 and nobody could explain to me in Guna what was written.
02:32 It was like a secret.
02:35 I really appreciate what I’ve learned about Jehovah.
02:39 If I didn’t know about him, I would be like everyone else.
02:44 Studying the Bible has helped me to understand right from wrong.
02:53 When the videos are in Guna,
02:55 I can understand them very well.
02:59 I love that the videos encourage
03:01 Guna speakers to attend the meetings.
03:08 I have seen that preaching from door to door makes you happy.
03:12 When I think about it,
03:13 I would like to be able to preach more freely, like others do.
03:16 But we’re very isolated here,
03:19 and it is hard to leave this island.
03:24 When I see pictures of the Paradise,
03:26 I want to be there.
03:28 I want to survive and live there.
03:32 In the future, the earth will be a paradise.
03:34 There is no doubt at all!
03:38 This motivates me to learn more.
03:40 I really want it to reach my heart.
03:43 Thanks to the efforts of our brothers
03:45 in translation offices,  even those with little or no education
03:50 can grasp Bible truths
03:52 and come to know God.
03:54 Jehovah’s organization cares for us all,
03:59 even the little ones.
04:04 I want to be among those taught by Jehovah
04:07 and this organization.
04:09 By the work they do,
04:11 I can see that Jehovah cares
04:13 —even for me.

What many notice when they
first attend meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:09.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that they hear God’s name, Jehovah.

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:14.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this life story,
Soten Yoeun relates the impact

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:17.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that learning God’s name had on her

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after surviving
the killing fields of Cambodia.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the killing fields in Cambodia,

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to God,

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:33.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I didn’t know his name.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a very young girl,

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they separated our family

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they put me to work in the rice field

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:53.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from five in the morning 

00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
till nine in the evening.

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:59.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some other children that get killed,

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you really desperately cry for help inside.

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:06.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always think that you are next.

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:09.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in my heart I always believed

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there had to be a true God somewhere,

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:15.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somehow that can help me get through this.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One year later, my family decided

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:19.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to escape Cambodia.

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We walk close to six or seven months

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:27.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Thailand.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have 20 brothers and sisters

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—only 4 of us survived.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a blind aunt

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that holds on my shoulder all the time.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:47.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one day, we got caught.

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they start shooting, I push my aunt down

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the ground and try to pretend

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are dead.

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:00.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I got up,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no idea where my parent was.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent many months in the jungle.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I try to survive,

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I eat whatever I can find,

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also help my auntie to survive.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day when I go out to look for food,

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:22.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I walked so far away

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:24.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t find my way back.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I start crying really hard underneath a tree

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:31.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look up to the sky

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pray to the true God.

00:02:34.504 --> 00:02:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised as a child to pray to Buddhas.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on this night

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I start praying, I specifically said

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:47.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m not praying to Buddha

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I’m praying to the true God.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I say,

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“True God, if you are really here,

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“please help me because I am really scared

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:04.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m hungry and I’m cold.”

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:07.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I pray,

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just fall to sleep under the big tree.

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I make it into the refugee camp

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:16.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Thailand,

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was reunited with my family.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We lived in the refugee camp in Thailand

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for about ten years

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we come to United States.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My searching for the true God,

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it didn’t stop there.

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tried to go to different churches,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we didn’t understand anything.

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day when I come home from school,

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I met this gentlemen named Herold,

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he asked if he can talk to me about God.

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I agree because I saw he have a Bible;

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he must be a good man.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he talked to me,

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to pay attention so hard,

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still didn’t understand

00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was saying.

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he went very slow.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he said, “Your name?”

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “My name Soten.”

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:09.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he said, “Your name, Soten;

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my name is Herold.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name, Jehovah.”

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought that God had name.

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And ever since that day on,

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never forget Jehovah’s name.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s superglued in my heart.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:28.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his phone number.

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:30.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He say he gonna ask his wife

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:31.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stop by someday,

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then I move away from where I lived.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t do the truth at that time,

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always pray to Jehovah.

00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I learned God’s name,

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went back to the church.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The priest would start out

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “heavenly Father”

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but leave out Jehovah’s name.

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I raised my hand.

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sir, when you pray, ‘heavenly Father,’

00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“why don’t you say, ‘heavenly Father,

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’?

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why you not using God’s name?”

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:07.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he told me

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God does not force me to be here,

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’m welcomed to leave

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stay if I want.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So because I realized

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they don’t use Jehovah’s name, 

00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left and never returned.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after many years, I tried to call Herold,

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but no one picked up the phone.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I leave a message.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:38.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was hoping that they remembered me.

00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:44.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two weeks later, Herold comes to my door,

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at the time, I was working at night

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asleep during the day.

00:05:52.635 --> 00:05:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Herold never give up; he come back.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I keep on praying to Jehovah,

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:03.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking for someone to knock on my door.

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:07.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, one day I open the door,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I saw him, I almost couldn’t talk.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was teared up.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy to see him

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this is the man

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:19.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who introduced me to Jehovah’s name.

00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:23.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I start to study with a sister,

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she helped me grow spiritually.

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To know that you have a heavenly Father

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cares about you

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that was the best feeling on earth.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me want to know more about him

00:06:38.614 --> 00:06:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—want to learn more about him.

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would ask questions: “Did he like this?

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he like that?”

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then when I go to the Kingdom Hall,

00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hear Jehovah’s name so many times.

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel, that’s it!

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:58.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found my place.

00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized in 2013.

00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My blind aunt

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:06.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I help her survive through the jungle,

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she’s still living until today.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:12.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now that I can get a chance

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to talk to her about Jehovah,

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was a blessing.

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can’t stress enough how wonderful

00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:23.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and big privilege that I receive from Jehovah

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just to know who he is

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:31.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to learn that there is true God.

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He have a name,

00:02.022 --> 00:06.360
So, if the Devil tempted Jesus, 


00:06.360 --> 00:09.112
don’t you think 
he will try to tempt us 


00:09.112 --> 00:13.909
in order to jeopardize 
our relationship with God?


00:13.908 --> 00:15.911
This is the best contract 
we’ve ever offered you. 


00:15.912 --> 00:17.664
Listen, I’ll get you a plan 


00:17.663 --> 00:19.665
so you can attend 
your religious meetings during the week. 


00:19.665 --> 00:22.000
Just do the concert 
for us on the weekend!


00:26.213 --> 00:28.215
People always ask me, 


00:28.215 --> 00:31.885
“Why did you leave 
the music world?”


00:31.885 --> 00:33.887
When I was still a boy, 


00:33.887 --> 00:37.000
I had dreams 
about becoming a famous singer. 


00:38.600 --> 00:40.602
Then I learned the truth, 


00:40.602 --> 00:44.565
but I never fully removed 
those dreams from my heart. 


00:44.565 --> 00:49.152
And then I started listening 
to some bad influences from my past, 


00:49.152 --> 00:51.572
and they got me hooked. 


00:51.572 --> 00:55.000
Then they reeled me 
into the recording studio. 


00:57.077 --> 00:59.079
The lyrics in the songs


00:59.078 --> 01:02.000
—they really bothered 
my conscience. 


01:03.167 --> 01:06.004
So they offered me 
some liquor to loosen me up, 


01:06.003 --> 01:09.256
and then I started 
to feel more comfortable. 


01:09.257 --> 01:12.509
I started singing, 
and they liked what they were hearing. 


01:12.508 --> 01:16.221
And those songs ended up 
all over the radio stations. 


01:16.222 --> 01:18.807
It was as if Satan 
gave me a trophy 


01:18.807 --> 01:21.310
for abandoning Jehovah.


01:21.310 --> 01:25.000
I became addicted to the applause.


01:27.565 --> 01:29.652
Everything looks so beautiful, 


01:29.652 --> 01:31.737
but when you’re on top


01:31.737 --> 01:34.490
—when you’re really at the top 
of Satan’s world—


01:34.490 --> 01:36.742
there’s nothing beautiful there.


01:36.742 --> 01:38.244
I was an actor, 


01:38.243 --> 01:39.953
and when the cameras 
turned on, 


01:39.953 --> 01:42.790
my face and my smile 
turned on too. 


01:42.790 --> 01:44.792
But when I would get back
to the hotel, 


01:44.792 --> 01:46.794
it was a huge letdown. 


01:46.793 --> 01:48.961
There was no applause


01:48.962 --> 01:52.000
—just that silence 
that tormented my conscience.


01:55.760 --> 01:58.513
So basically, you had to find 


01:58.513 --> 02:01.225
other distractions,
and one of those for me 


02:01.225 --> 02:03.477
was the slot machine. 


02:03.477 --> 02:07.105
And, of course, casinos 
don’t just come with slot machines.


02:07.105 --> 02:10.692
They also expose you 
to prostitution and alcohol.


02:10.692 --> 02:13.487
My conscience would ask, 


02:13.487 --> 02:16.074
‘What are you doing here?’


02:16.073 --> 02:18.825
I remember those times on tour, 


02:18.825 --> 02:21.662
from my limousine, 
I’d see the brothers preaching, 


02:21.662 --> 02:24.039
and that would always touch my heart. 


02:24.038 --> 02:26.291
I would say to myself, ‘Wow! 


02:26.292 --> 02:28.794
‘Jehovah trained you 
to be doing that, 


02:28.793 --> 02:30.753
and look at what you’re doing!’ 


02:30.753 --> 02:33.048
That really cut deep into my heart.


02:33.048 --> 02:37.720
The road back to the truth was, 
really, very hard. 


02:37.720 --> 02:41.807
Every time I was going to retire, 
I’d say, “This is it!” 


02:41.807 --> 02:45.560
But then there would always be 
a bigger contract. 


02:45.560 --> 02:47.897
I had to make drastic decisions.


02:47.897 --> 02:49.982
But finally I said: 


02:49.982 --> 02:52.400
“I don’t care what they offer me. 


02:52.400 --> 02:54.612
“I have to return to Jehovah. 


02:54.612 --> 02:56.655
“I have to fulfill the vow 


02:56.655 --> 02:59.073
“I made to him 
when I was a young man, 


02:59.073 --> 03:01.618
when I dedicated my life to him.”


03:01.618 --> 03:05.038
So I prayed to Jehovah 
very earnestly and said: 


03:05.038 --> 03:07.875
“Jehovah, 
I need to return to you. 


03:07.875 --> 03:10.210
“I need to return 
to your loving arms. 


03:10.210 --> 03:13.213
“Satan has ripped me 
away from you. 


03:13.213 --> 03:16.841
Please help me.” 


03:16.842 --> 03:20.345
I remember that before I went 
in to that first meeting, 


03:20.345 --> 03:24.223
I told Jehovah, “Please give me a sign 
that you will take me back.” 


03:24.223 --> 03:27.143
And there was 
an elderly sister there. 


03:27.143 --> 03:29.980
She gave me a great big hug 


03:29.980 --> 03:32.398
and said, “Welcome back, son!” 


03:32.398 --> 03:34.401
And she took my hand 


03:34.402 --> 03:37.695
and sat by me 
during the entire meeting.


03:37.695 --> 03:41.000
I had betrayed Jehovah, 
but I thank— 


03:44.202 --> 03:46.622
I thank the brothers 


03:46.622 --> 03:50.542
because Jehovah 
put brothers at every turn. 


03:50.542 --> 03:53.087
They showed me with the Bible 


03:53.087 --> 03:55.089
how far I had strayed 


03:55.088 --> 03:57.758
from the paths of the true God, 


03:57.758 --> 04:01.095
and everything you do 
has consequences. 


04:01.095 --> 04:04.765
I have asked Jehovah many times 
to forgive me for all the things 


04:04.765 --> 04:06.850
I have done
—and the brothers too—


04:06.850 --> 04:10.020
all the people 
I offended by my actions.


04:10.020 --> 04:12.022
All those trophies I won


04:12.022 --> 04:14.107
—every last one of them—


04:14.107 --> 04:16.194
are there collecting dust. 


04:16.193 --> 04:18.361
But Jehovah has given me 


04:18.362 --> 04:20.989
a different kind of trophy 
in his organization


04:20.988 --> 04:24.910
—helping others to dedicate 
their lives to him. 


04:24.910 --> 04:28.538
That’s something no one 
can take away from you.


04:28.538 --> 04:30.540
We don’t all 
have to learn the hard way. 


04:30.540 --> 04:32.542
We have to keep enduring 


04:32.542 --> 04:35.962
and never turn 
our backs on Jehovah. 


04:35.962 --> 04:38.000
That’s the worst mistake 
anyone could make. 


04:39.550 --> 04:43.095
We know that it’s Jehovah 
who gives us our talents, 


04:43.095 --> 04:46.598
so we should use them 
all in his service. 


04:46.598 --> 04:50.643
I have found happiness, 
and that gives me 


04:50.643 --> 04:53.021
a glow that’s not just 
for the cameras. 


04:53.022 --> 05:14.105
Everyone who knows me 
can see it.

00:07 The blessings that I enjoy today
00:09 are so numerous.
00:13 I have a true inner sense
00:15 of joy and happiness.
00:18 I can’t help  but be appreciative,
00:21 so grateful for  all that Jehovah does.
00:24 But it wasn’t  always this way for us.
00:41 It was a dark world growing up.
00:48 I never knew  what being a child was like.
00:54 I was afraid
00:56 of who I would grow up to be.
00:59 I felt like I had no choice.
01:04 Then at a very young age,   I, as well,
01:07 started to partake of
01:09 what I saw going on around me.
01:11 I learned quickly that it helped numb
01:14 the feelings that I had.
01:16 Drugs were a way  to escape that.
01:19 I was in a lot of trouble  with the law.
01:22 I knew I needed change,
01:25 so I joined the military  at a young age.
01:29 Around my teenage years,  my life became difficult.
01:34 I started to turn to drugs and alcohol  and self-destructive ways,
01:38 but none of these things  were making me happy.
01:42 I was very lonely.
01:45 No one knew me;  no one cared to know me.
01:49 I felt so lost,
01:51 and I was trying  to fill this big hole in my heart
01:54 with so many things,
01:57 and none of it worked.
02:01 One of my many car accidents,  due to drugs and alcohol,
02:05 ended me up in jail
02:09 for 30 days straight.
02:15 I felt like a hopeless mess.
02:18 I just knew  something’s got to change.
02:23 So I joined the military,
02:25 thinking it was going to be
02:27 the positive great change  that I needed,
02:30 but it was not.
02:34 I remember  joining the military
02:36 hoping that it  would bring some sort
02:38 of authority into my life,
02:40 but I again started  to spiral
02:45 into my anger, my alcohol and drug abuse.
02:49 The military decided  to let me out.
02:53 But during deployment  is where I met Holly.
02:58 Holly also got  out of the military,
03:01 and we started  to live a life together.
03:04 But we were still searching  for something to fill
03:08 the emptiness  that we both felt in our lives.
03:11 Jeremiah and I were both working  in a steel factory in Montana.
03:15 During this time,  I was being trained on a drill
03:20 by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,  a sister named Molly.
03:23 Molly said, “You’re  going to have down time
03:25 “on this machine,  maybe a couple of hours,
03:28 so feel free to read  whatever I have in my tool box.”
03:31 I opened it
03:33 and immediately  a little yellow book,
03:35 What Does the Bible Really Teach?,  caught my eye.
03:38 I loved the pictures.
03:40 The scriptures  at the beginning of the book,
03:43 they touched my heart immediately,  and I felt like,
03:46 ‘These answer all the questions
03:49 I’ve been searching  for my entire life!’
03:52 Another sister came over,  her name was Cory,
03:55 and she said: “Molly and I can come over,
03:57 “and we can talk to you  about the Bible tomorrow.
03:59 If you have any questions,  we’d love to answer them using the Bible.”
04:03 I said, “Yes, come over!”
04:06 I was a little bit  more apprehensive.
04:11 but this was finally
04:13 something very different.
04:16 And I realized what they were saying  came from the Bible.
04:19 I’d never seen that before.
04:21 They invited us  to the Kingdom Hall.
04:23 We went in,  everybody had their Bible,
04:27 had time to look  the scriptures up together,
04:30 and everybody was  so warm and inviting.
04:33 These were the people  I’d been searching for my entire life.
04:37 All of a sudden change  was possible.
04:39 We knew what changes  we needed to make in our life.
04:42 What we were doing,  our actions,
04:44 we had to clear out things  that Jehovah hates.
04:47 Like just going through  our house and deciding
04:49 what it is  that we need to get rid of.
04:51 By allowing the truth  to transform our lives,
04:54 Holly and I’ve received  many blessings,
04:56 and eventually we were able  to come here together and serve at Bethel.
05:01 We got the truth in a weld shop,
05:03 and now I get to weld  here in Jehovah’s house for him.
05:07 I perform maintenance  on water fountains,
05:10 refrigerators, coolers.
05:13 Being trained by the brothers  and sisters I work with
05:16 just helps me to refine  my Christian personality.
05:18 It’s so nice to know  that Jehovah
05:21 is looking down on us;
05:23 that he was able  to see through
05:26 all of the trash  that was there in our life.
05:28 He was able to find something
05:30 and decided to work with it.
05:32 And I really think of a scripture,  Psalm 145:19:
05:37 “He satisfies the desire  of those
05:41 “who fear him;  he hears their [cry] for help,
05:46 and [he] rescues them.”
05:47 Jehovah did that for us.
05:49 If you ask Jehovah  to display his hand in your life,
05:52 no doubt at all in my mind,
05:55 that will happen.

00:00:16 We really want to imitate our God, To be impartial, as we know he is.
00:00:25 To save all sorts of people is his will; He welcomes all to come and to be his.
00:00:36 It’s the person, not the place; It’s the heart and not the face.
00:00:43 God’s message to all people we extend. So because we really care,
00:00:50 We keep preaching ev’rywhere:
00:00:53 “All sorts of people can become God’s friend.”
00:01:06 It doesn’t matter where they may be found Or what at first they might appear to be.
00:01:16 What really counts is what they are at heart—
00:01:22 The inner self, the one Jehovah sees.
00:01:28 It’s the person, not the place; It’s the heart and not the face.
00:01:33 God’s message to all people we extend. So because we really care,
00:01:41 We keep preaching ev’rywhere:
00:01:44 “All sorts of people can become God’s friend.”
00:01:57 Jehovah welcomes all who make the choice To leave the world and all its ways behind.
00:02:07 This we have learned,  and this we want to share,
00:02:12 And so we preach to people of all kinds.
00:02:18 It’s the person, not the place; It’s the heart and not the face.
00:02:24 God’s message to all people we extend. So because we really care,
00:02:32 We keep preaching ev’rywhere:
00:02:34 “All sorts of people can become God’s friend.”

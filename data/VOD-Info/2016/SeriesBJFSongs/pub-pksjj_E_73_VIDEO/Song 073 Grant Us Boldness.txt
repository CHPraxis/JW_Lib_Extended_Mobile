00:00:08 As we tell about the Kingdom, As we witness for your name,
00:00:16 There are many who oppose us And who try to bring us shame.
00:00:24 But instead of fearing men, It’s really you we must obey.
00:00:32 So we beg you now for your spirit; O Jehovah, hear what we pray.
00:00:40 Grant us boldness as we witness; Help us overcome our fear.
00:00:48 Give us confidence and courage So that all the world may hear.
00:00:55 Armageddon draws ever near, But until that great day is here,
00:01:04 Grant us boldness as we witness. This is our prayer.
00:01:12 Even though we may be fearful, You remember we are dust.
00:01:20 Your assurance to support us Is a promise we can trust.
00:01:28 Give attention to the threats Of those who persecute and blame.
00:01:36 May you help us all to continue As we boldly speak in your name.
00:01:44 Grant us boldness as we witness; Help us overcome our fear.
00:01:51 Give us confidence and courage So that all the world may hear.
00:01:59 Armageddon draws ever near, But until that great day is here,
00:02:08 Grant us boldness as we witness. This is our prayer.

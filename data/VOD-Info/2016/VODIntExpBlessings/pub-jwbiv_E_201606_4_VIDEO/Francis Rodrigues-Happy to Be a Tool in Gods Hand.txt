00:00:01 Like many older ones before them,
00:00:03 younger brothers and sisters are taking on challenging assignments
00:00:07 that bring them rich spiritual rewards.
00:00:10 We go next to India to hear from Brother Francis Rodrigues.
00:00:14 He’s using his training from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:00:18 to teach people in the Indian Sign Language field.
00:03:54 Brother Rodrigues searches for those rightly disposed for everlasting life
00:03:59 wherever he can find them despite the obstacles.
00:04:02 And you may have noted that his joy comes from directing people
00:04:06 to the congregation to be part of our true spiritual brotherhood.
00:04:10 That example is repeated millions of times over through the diligent efforts
00:04:15 of publishers and pioneers around the world.
00:04:18 Why not examine your ministry to find ways to help
00:04:22 yet more people to build a good relationship with Jehovah?

00:00.950 --> 00:03.987
Millions of our brothers 
and sisters around the world 


00:03.987 --> 00:05.989
can recount 
the blessings they’ve gained 


00:05.988 --> 00:09.625
by remaining loyal 
to Jehovah and his organization. 


00:09.625 --> 00:13.997
And we’re privileged to have 
two such examples here with us today: 


00:13.997 --> 00:16.734
Brother and Sister 
William and Sandra Malenfant. 


00:16.733 --> 00:19.468
Brother Malenfant is a helper 
to the Teaching Committee, 


00:19.468 --> 00:23.071
and Sister Malenfant’s current assignment 
is in the Service Department. 


00:23.072 --> 00:27.710
And we’re looking forward to hearing 
about their rich spiritual history.


00:27.710 --> 00:29.878
So, Bill and Sandra, 
we’re so happy 


00:29.878 --> 00:32.048
that we could have you 
here in the studio with us, 


00:32.048 --> 00:34.683
and we do look forward 
to learning more about you.


00:34.683 --> 00:36.685
Maybe we would like 
to go back. 


00:36.685 --> 00:39.255
How did you get 
on the road that has led you 


00:39.255 --> 00:43.092
to so many years of faithful, 
loyal service to Jehovah?


00:43.092 --> 00:45.529
It was back in 1954. 


00:45.528 --> 00:49.331
My mother had contact on and off 
with the Witnesses for years. 


00:49.332 --> 00:51.400
I was about 20 years old, 


00:51.400 --> 00:54.037
and she was 
invited to a public talk 


00:54.037 --> 00:56.672
at the Oakland Central Congregation 
in California. 


00:56.672 --> 00:58.675
She asked me, 
“Would you accompany me?” 


00:58.675 --> 01:01.643
And I said: “Yeah. 
Sure, I’ll be happy to go.” 


01:01.643 --> 01:05.948
Well, I recognized a young man 
I knew from high school at the meeting, 


01:05.948 --> 01:09.618
and he approached me after 
and told me I needed a Bible study. 


01:09.618 --> 01:12.588
I really didn’t want a Bible study, 
but he insisted, 


01:12.588 --> 01:14.590
and so I said, 
“Well, you can come by.” 


01:14.590 --> 01:16.592
Would you believe it? 


01:16.592 --> 01:20.464
I started a Bible study 
in the “Let God Be True” book. 


01:20.463 --> 01:22.731
Four months later, 
I was baptized. 


01:22.732 --> 01:26.369
It was exactly what I was looking for, 
but I didn’t realize it.


01:26.368 --> 01:27.536
Excellent! 


01:27.537 --> 01:31.740
Now, I understand that you were 
also very involved with sports.


01:31.740 --> 01:36.445
Yes, I was playing ball 
for a basketball team in Alameda, 


01:36.445 --> 01:39.015
and I enjoyed 
very much playing ball. 


01:39.015 --> 01:42.218
But then, a decision came up 
as to what I was going to do


01:42.218 --> 01:46.288
because the evenings 
when the team played was the same time 


01:46.288 --> 01:49.825
that we had the Service Meeting 
and the Theocratic Ministry School. 


01:49.825 --> 01:51.828
So I had to 
make a decision. 


01:51.828 --> 01:53.963
And my decision was: 
Forget the sports, 


01:53.963 --> 01:57.666
and let’s go to the meetings 
and enjoy being built up spiritually.


01:57.667 --> 01:58.669
Good choice. 
Thank you. 


01:58.668 --> 02:03.473
And, Sandra, your start on the road 
to a career serving Jehovah?


02:03.473 --> 02:07.643
I suppose you could say 
that it actually started before I was born.


02:07.643 --> 02:11.948
Before I was born, my parents 
started on this search for the truth. 


02:11.948 --> 02:15.418
It happened because they 
had lost a little girl in death, 


02:15.418 --> 02:19.521
and they went from church to church 
looking for some kind of comfort. 


02:19.522 --> 02:21.959
And, of course, the clergy 
had no comfort for them. 


02:21.958 --> 02:25.961
They just said, “Well, God wanted 
another angel in heaven.” 


02:25.962 --> 02:28.765
And that angered my father. 
He thought: ‘No. 


02:28.765 --> 02:31.100
‘If God wants another angel, 
he can make one. 


02:31.100 --> 02:33.102
He wouldn’t take my little girl!’ 


02:33.102 --> 02:35.104
So it just happened 


02:35.103 --> 02:38.373
that one evening 
they were listening to the radio


02:38.373 --> 02:40.410
—long before TV, of course—


02:40.410 --> 02:44.480
and they heard 
a Jehovah’s Witness give a talk. 


02:44.480 --> 02:47.317
And the title of that talk was 
“Where Are the Dead?” 


02:47.317 --> 02:48.952
Imagine! 


02:48.952 --> 02:51.922
He gave all the Scriptural proof 
about the condition of the dead 


02:51.922 --> 02:54.090
and the hope 
for the resurrection. 


02:54.090 --> 02:57.793
And my father immediately said, 
“This is the truth!” 


02:57.793 --> 03:01.196
So they wrote to the radio station; 


03:01.197 --> 03:04.100
got a copy 
of the booklet of the talk; 


03:04.100 --> 03:07.137
and then, also, 
they started receiving 


03:07.137 --> 03:09.405
the subscription 
to The Watchtower. 


03:09.405 --> 03:12.575
But it wasn’t until I was born 
and three years old 


03:12.575 --> 03:14.877
that the Witnesses 
finally made contact with us.


03:14.877 --> 03:15.745
Interesting.


03:15.745 --> 03:17.247
In fact, it was interesting. 


03:17.247 --> 03:20.917
It was a real cold winter day,
and even though I was only three years old,


03:20.917 --> 03:22.952
I remember
 this family coming in. 


03:22.952 --> 03:25.255
And they stayed hours. 


03:25.255 --> 03:27.790
I even hid in the closet 
and went to sleep. 


03:27.790 --> 03:30.327
But, you know, 
it was just—


03:30.327 --> 03:32.629
It was that contact 
with the visible organization 


03:32.628 --> 03:34.630
that my family needed. 


03:34.630 --> 03:36.132
Because they knew 
much of the truth. 


03:36.132 --> 03:38.869
They’d been reading 
The Watchtower for a long time. 


03:38.868 --> 03:43.740
So my elder sisters, they got baptized 
 right away and started pioneering. 


03:43.740 --> 03:47.177
For my brother and I
—we were a lot smaller, of course—


03:47.177 --> 03:51.747
we just went along with our parents 
and came right into the truth. 


03:51.747 --> 03:54.984
In fact, I remember, 
it was just a couple of years later 


03:54.983 --> 03:58.688
that we were all going to go 
to the big convention 


03:58.688 --> 04:02.491
in 1950 at Yankee Stadium. 


04:02.492 --> 04:05.529
But I knew there was going to be 
a big baptism there, 


04:05.528 --> 04:08.731
but I wanted to go 
as a baptized Jehovah’s Witness. 


04:08.732 --> 04:11.167
So my father—
Everybody made arrangements, 


04:11.167 --> 04:13.369
and my father baptized me 


04:13.368 --> 04:15.538
in our pond on our farm 


04:15.538 --> 04:16.805
with another young sister.


04:16.805 --> 04:17.907
Is that right?


04:17.907 --> 04:19.375
So that was my beginning.


04:19.375 --> 04:22.612
You know, Ron, there’s a point 
I’d like to recall also. 


04:22.612 --> 04:27.550
Sandra was at a special convention 
back in 1941.


04:27.550 --> 04:30.152
That’s true, 
even before that. 


04:30.152 --> 04:34.457
That was probably my first, 
you know, big event theocratically. 


04:34.457 --> 04:38.862
Our family—my brother 
was four years older than I, 


04:38.862 --> 04:43.834
along with my parents—
we went to the St. Louis convention 


04:43.833 --> 04:48.003
where Brother Rutherford 
gave his famous talk on children. 


04:48.003 --> 04:50.573
And they separated—
The lower level 


04:50.573 --> 04:53.643
of this place that they rented, 
this stadium,  


04:53.643 --> 04:55.945
was dedicated 
to just the young children, 


04:55.945 --> 04:58.682
well, from 5 to 18 years of age. 


04:58.682 --> 05:02.519
And it was just fantastic, 
you know, with this man. 


05:02.518 --> 05:05.655
When you’re small, this man 
would look so big and huge, 


05:05.655 --> 05:07.690
and he had 
this great big voice. 


05:07.690 --> 05:12.528
And I’ll never forget when he looked out 
on the audience, and he said:


05:12.528 --> 05:17.433
“Behold, more than 
15,000 new witnesses to the Kingdom!” 


05:17.433 --> 05:19.101
So it was very emotional.


05:19.102 --> 05:20.537
Oh, you still remember it 
like it happened yesterday.


05:20.537 --> 05:21.204
Oh, yes!


05:21.203 --> 05:23.205
Right, how exciting!


05:23.205 --> 05:25.342
So, what motivated you 
to make a choice 


05:25.342 --> 05:29.479
to get into the full-time service 
and give your life to Jehovah?


05:29.478 --> 05:31.513
Well, what motivated me 


05:31.513 --> 05:35.150
was when I attended 
a convention, also in ’56. 


05:35.150 --> 05:37.487
I got baptized in ’54. 


05:37.487 --> 05:41.590
But in ’56, I went to a district convention 
in Albany, California, 


05:41.590 --> 05:43.592
and there was a pioneer booth.


05:43.592 --> 05:46.662
Because in those days they had a booth 
set up at the district conventions, 


05:46.662 --> 05:48.732
and various brothers and sisters 
would man the booth 


05:48.732 --> 05:51.134
and answer your questions 
about pioneer service.


05:51.133 --> 05:54.303
So I approached the booth, 
and an older sister there looked at me 


05:54.303 --> 05:56.338
and said: 
“You’re young and strong. 


05:56.338 --> 05:58.440
Why aren’t you a pioneer?” 


05:58.440 --> 06:00.843
I felt, ‘Well, yes. 
Why not?’ 


06:00.843 --> 06:03.678
So I started 
pioneering in 1956. 


06:03.678 --> 06:05.113
That’s what motivated me. 


06:05.113 --> 06:07.116
And I was—
Really, I look back at that; 


06:07.117 --> 06:09.819
it was one of the best decisions 
I made in my life.


06:09.818 --> 06:10.553
Excellent! 


06:10.553 --> 06:13.655
Yeah, so you have been making 
wise decisions from your youth up.


06:13.655 --> 06:15.658
Sandra, how about you? 


06:15.658 --> 06:17.893
Motivated to get 
into full-time service.


06:17.893 --> 06:21.563
Well, for pioneer service, you know, 
it was—it was like a given. 


06:21.563 --> 06:24.266
Young people were 
just encouraged to pioneer.


06:24.267 --> 06:27.104
And you knew that when 
you graduated from high school, 


06:27.103 --> 06:29.238
you started out pioneering.


06:29.238 --> 06:31.973
And most of the young people 
were doing that. 


06:31.973 --> 06:35.445
You know, after a year or two, maybe they
would get married and start a family. 


06:35.445 --> 06:39.048
But those years in pioneering
—starting out their life that way—


06:39.048 --> 06:44.020
gave them a wonderful basis 
for loyal service the rest of their life.


06:44.020 --> 06:48.557
And not only that, 
I remember that in those days 


06:48.557 --> 06:51.394
the traveling overseer 
would stay in the homes 


06:51.393 --> 06:53.830
of the brothers 
when he served the congregation. 


06:53.830 --> 06:55.632
And we always played host 


06:55.632 --> 06:58.000
to the circuit overseer 
and his wife when they came. 


06:58.000 --> 07:01.037
And for my brother and I, 
they were role models. 


07:01.037 --> 07:05.240
My sisters, as I told you, 
were out pioneering in another assignment.


07:05.240 --> 07:08.177
But for us, these brothers 
were so full of zeal, 


07:08.177 --> 07:11.314
and they were 
like heroes to us. 


07:11.313 --> 07:15.618
In particular, I remember when I was, 
I think, about 12 years old. 


07:15.618 --> 07:19.588
This couple came around on the circuit, 
Percy and Ilma Iszlaub, 


07:19.588 --> 07:23.758
they were from Australia 
and, of course, we loved their accent too. 


07:23.758 --> 07:26.228
And they had just graduated 
from Gilead, 


07:26.228 --> 07:28.430
and they were assigned 
to Japan, 


07:28.430 --> 07:31.267
but they had to wait a number 
of months to get their visa. 


07:31.267 --> 07:33.870
They served 
 in our congregation, 


07:33.870 --> 07:36.705
and it was really 
them that instilled in me 


07:36.705 --> 07:38.707
the desire to 
become a missionary.


07:38.707 --> 07:40.309
Beautiful. 


07:40.308 --> 07:42.311
So you were pioneering. 


07:42.312 --> 07:44.614
How did your paths 
eventually meet?


07:44.613 --> 07:46.648
It was 
at a circuit assembly 


07:46.648 --> 07:50.886
in Oakland, California, 1956. 


07:50.887 --> 07:53.155
Very interesting things 
took place. 


07:53.155 --> 07:56.592
I had the job 
of dismantling the stage.


07:56.592 --> 07:58.227
I had not yet met Sandra. 


07:58.227 --> 08:03.065
She was out visiting her sister 
who lived in the same area where I was.


08:03.065 --> 08:06.502
And I was carrying 
this large piece of plywood off the stage, 


08:06.502 --> 08:09.372
and I ran right into Sandra 
and knocked her flat! 


08:09.372 --> 08:11.874
Well, I took advantage 
of the opportunity. 


08:11.873 --> 08:15.210
I thought, ‘Well, that’s not 
the best way to introduce yourself.’ 


08:15.210 --> 08:18.247
But I said, “By the way, 
would you like to accompany me 


08:18.247 --> 08:20.282
to a get-together 
some of the friends are having?”


08:20.282 --> 08:22.685
And she accepted. 
And . . .


08:22.685 --> 08:23.887
Very good, Bill.


08:23.887 --> 08:25.922
Well, yes, 
and I followed through on it. 


08:25.922 --> 08:27.890
We had a lot 
of association, 


08:27.890 --> 08:30.292
and after a number of months, 
we got married. 


08:30.292 --> 08:32.295
And both of us 
were pioneering


08:32.295 --> 08:34.597
—very happy in our ministry 
serving Jehovah.


08:34.597 --> 08:36.865
You really swept her off her feet. 
Literally.


08:36.865 --> 08:38.067
I fell for him.


08:38.067 --> 08:38.800
Very good. 


08:38.800 --> 08:41.137
So, shortly after 
you were married, 


08:41.137 --> 08:43.339
I understand 
that you received some direction.


08:43.338 --> 08:46.975
Yes, the circuit overseer 
visited our congregation. 


08:46.975 --> 08:49.078
We were only married about a month, 
I think, when he came through.


08:49.078 --> 08:50.245
I think so.


08:50.245 --> 08:54.717
And he told us that the organization 
was looking for pioneers


08:54.717 --> 08:57.654
who’d be willing to serve 
as special pioneers and go wherever, 


08:57.653 --> 09:00.956
where the need was great 
in the United States particularly. 


09:00.957 --> 09:04.427
So we told him: 
“Sure. We’d be delighted to do it.” 


09:04.427 --> 09:07.062
And four months 
after our marriage, 


09:07.062 --> 09:11.167
we received an assignment 
as special pioneers to Decorah, Iowa.


09:11.167 --> 09:13.802
Now, that was 
a very interesting place 


09:13.802 --> 09:16.972
because there were 
only eight publishers in the congregation. 


09:16.972 --> 09:19.175
But we arrived 
and started with the meetings 


09:19.175 --> 09:21.010
there at the Kingdom Hall. 


09:21.010 --> 09:23.612
And the Kingdom Hall was up 
above Hunt’s Variety Store 


09:23.612 --> 09:27.684
in downtown Decorah, 
and we lived in a room behind it.


09:27.683 --> 09:30.786
Well, sometimes, 
especially during the wintertime 


09:30.787 --> 09:33.855
because it could be very cold, 
there’d be no one at the meeting. 


09:33.855 --> 09:35.825
After all, there were 
only eight publishers. 


09:35.825 --> 09:37.827
But I was insisting that: 


09:37.827 --> 09:41.730
“No, I’m going to give my public talk, 
whether anyone is here or not.” 


09:41.730 --> 09:44.533
So I’d tell Sandra, “You sit there, 
and I’ll give my public talk.”


09:44.533 --> 09:48.203
A one hour talk, and then I’d conduct 
the Watchtower Study


09:48.203 --> 09:50.505
and have her answer 
every question.


09:50.505 --> 09:52.508
Well, you know, 
you’re on your own like that


09:52.508 --> 09:54.510
—not a lot of brothers around—


09:54.510 --> 09:56.612
so you look 
for encouragement and company. 


09:56.612 --> 09:59.982
And we would travel down 
to Strawberry Point, Iowa, 


09:59.982 --> 10:03.085
to where 
Charles and Shirley Sinutko lived 


10:03.085 --> 10:06.188
in a log cabin
—one-room log cabin. 


10:06.188 --> 10:09.791
And we’d go visit with them in order 
to have some mutual encouragement.


10:09.792 --> 10:12.562
Yeah, because they
were special pioneering also.


10:12.562 --> 10:14.064
OK. 
Well, you were both special.


10:14.063 --> 10:16.465
It’s a nice picture of you 
in that log cabin too 


10:16.465 --> 10:18.500
as you were 
special pioneering. 


10:18.500 --> 10:20.068
So you’re busy 
in that work. 


10:20.068 --> 10:22.605
What special invitation 
did you receive?


10:22.605 --> 10:26.175
Well, we received 
the invitation to attend Gilead


10:26.175 --> 10:29.012
—the 34th class of Gilead School—


10:29.012 --> 10:32.949
and that was a wonderful thing 
after two and half years of pioneering,


10:32.948 --> 10:34.950
special pioneering in Iowa.


10:34.950 --> 10:38.787
Our instructors were 
Albert Schroeder, Maxwell Friend, 


10:38.787 --> 10:41.890
Bob Porter, and Jack Redford. 


10:41.890 --> 10:46.562
And we had a delightful time at Gilead, 
as you can imagine.


10:46.562 --> 10:48.764
And we were assigned 
to Lebanon, 


10:48.763 --> 10:53.068
but we were unable to enter Lebanon 
because we couldn’t get the visa. 


10:53.068 --> 10:55.170
So, then, the organization 
asked us, 


10:55.170 --> 10:57.540
“Well, will you take 
an assignment to Morocco?” 


10:57.540 --> 10:59.208
We were ready to go anywhere.


10:59.208 --> 11:01.476
We were pioneering 
with the Canarsie Congregation 


11:01.477 --> 11:04.247
just waiting to go out 
into the field.


11:04.247 --> 11:06.882
So that’s how we took 
a boat from New York City


11:06.882 --> 11:09.919
—five days across the Atlantic—
to Casablanca.


11:09.918 --> 11:11.586
Very nice. 


11:11.587 --> 11:14.924
Well, what was it like to be 
in the missionary service in Morocco?


11:14.923 --> 11:17.058
It was very interesting. 


11:17.058 --> 11:19.895
We really enjoyed it. 
But, you know, we only spoke English. 


11:19.895 --> 11:22.532
So in Morocco, 
we had to learn French. 


11:22.532 --> 11:26.102
And the first month 
of our missionary service in Morocco, 


11:26.102 --> 11:30.339
for 30 days we studied 
the language 11 hours a day. 


11:30.338 --> 11:33.308
Well, that could get pretty tiring 
for 11 hours a day, 


11:33.308 --> 11:36.978
so we’d go to the French movies 
and count that as language time. 


11:36.978 --> 11:39.215
And then, we were moved 
to Tangier. 


11:39.215 --> 11:41.550
And there was 
a Spanish congregation in Tangier, 


11:41.550 --> 11:44.687
so we had to learn 
the Spanish language too. 


11:44.687 --> 11:47.322
But that was 
really a rich blessing 


11:47.322 --> 11:49.959
for the two of us 
to be exposed to that culture 


11:49.958 --> 11:52.293
and to have 
that privilege of serving there.


11:52.293 --> 11:54.363
But you know 
what I really enjoyed? 


11:54.363 --> 11:57.265
We had a variety 
of people we preached to. 


11:57.265 --> 12:00.035
We had 
a very large Jewish population, 


12:00.035 --> 12:02.370
and they were 
almost all Orthodox. 


12:02.370 --> 12:05.273
But, you know, 
they were very forthright, 


12:05.273 --> 12:08.476
and they were open 
and quite curious. 


12:08.477 --> 12:11.347
You know, like they’d come up 
to us sometimes and say: 


12:11.347 --> 12:13.349
“Well, you’re Christian, 
aren’t you? 


12:13.348 --> 12:15.683
Why do you accept 
Jesus as the Messiah?” 


12:15.683 --> 12:19.388
So we had to get familiar 
with a lot of scriptures, you know, 


12:19.388 --> 12:23.558
that dealt with the prophecies the Messiah 
would fulfill, in the Hebrew Scriptures. 


12:23.558 --> 12:25.560
And really, it was a delight.


12:25.560 --> 12:29.432
Sandra, do you remember, there were 
a lot of French people in Morocco?


12:29.432 --> 12:32.067
Because it used to be 
a colony under France, 


12:32.067 --> 12:35.470
so that’s why 
the French language was so important. 


12:35.470 --> 12:39.142
And then we had Spanish people 
and many other nationalities there.


12:39.142 --> 12:42.445
So you had four years 
of serving in Morocco


12:42.445 --> 12:45.848
—faithfully, loyally meeting 
all those of different languages 


12:45.848 --> 12:47.850
and learning 
the language yourself.


12:47.850 --> 12:52.187
So after four years, I understand 
that you came back to visit your family. 


12:52.187 --> 12:55.290
What events 
were challenging thereafter?


12:55.290 --> 12:57.793
I think Sandra can relate that.


12:57.793 --> 13:00.561
Well, it was 
usually permitted 


13:00.562 --> 13:02.565
that after you were 
in your assignment four years, 


13:02.565 --> 13:04.567
then you were allowed 
to come home 


13:04.567 --> 13:06.835
and at least have a vacation 
and visit your family.


13:06.835 --> 13:09.872
And so we made arrangements 
to come back. 


13:09.872 --> 13:13.942
We got some tickets 
on a Yugoslav freighter; 


13:13.942 --> 13:16.845
took us two weeks 
to get back to New York.


13:16.845 --> 13:17.680
But we got back. 


13:17.680 --> 13:21.883
We visited our family, 
and while there, 


13:21.883 --> 13:26.088
I had a medical examination and found out 
that I had a serious health problem. 


13:26.088 --> 13:28.390
Of course, we didn’t have 
the funds to cover that. 


13:28.390 --> 13:32.193
So Bill wrote to the Society, 
and we made arrangements. 


13:32.193 --> 13:35.096
They said, 
“Well, just take care of your situation, 


13:35.097 --> 13:37.165
and let us know when you’re free.” 


13:37.165 --> 13:39.568
So he got a job 
to take care 


13:39.568 --> 13:42.971
of our medical needs 
as well as living conditions. 


13:42.972 --> 13:46.742
But you know, 
we just felt like we were failures.


13:46.742 --> 13:49.044
I’d always wanted 
to be a missionary, 


13:49.043 --> 13:51.580
and there we were 
four years into our assignment, 


13:51.580 --> 13:54.048
and we come back and poof! 


13:54.048 --> 13:55.283
We’re just there. 


13:55.283 --> 13:58.020
But, you know,
Jehovah knew we were discouraged. 


13:58.020 --> 14:00.522
He knew we felt 
distraught about this. 


14:00.522 --> 14:04.125
So he knew just what we needed, 
and he gave it to us. 


14:04.125 --> 14:08.197
As I got to feeling better 
and we got more free 


14:08.197 --> 14:11.234
in our use of time, 
we started pioneering. 


14:11.233 --> 14:15.203
And Jehovah blessed 
our ministry just incredibly. 


14:15.203 --> 14:20.208
There were times, 
in this supposedly “unproductive territory” 


14:20.208 --> 14:23.445
that we had up to 25 people 
attending the meetings. 


14:23.445 --> 14:27.182
Many of them got baptized, 
and they’re our fast friends to this day.


14:27.182 --> 14:28.250
That’s incredible!


14:28.250 --> 14:30.887
So Jehovah knows what you need, 
and he provides it.


14:30.887 --> 14:33.222
That is beautiful! 


14:33.222 --> 14:35.590
What temptation 
did you have to resist 


14:35.590 --> 14:38.260
when you came back 
and were going through these difficulties?


14:38.260 --> 14:41.163
Well, I think it’s 
a temptation that confronts 


14:41.163 --> 14:45.300
a lot of brothers and sisters 
who return because of health reasons, 


14:45.300 --> 14:49.972
and some just end up settling down 
because of their circumstances. 


14:49.972 --> 14:52.675
But the temptation there was: 
‘Well, you’re home. 


14:52.675 --> 14:56.212
‘You’ve already done your service 
in Morocco for a number of years. 


14:56.212 --> 14:57.780
‘You’ve been 
in the full-time ministry. 


14:57.780 --> 15:00.715
Just settle down now. 
Buy a house.’ 


15:00.715 --> 15:03.485
But really, 
that wasn’t our desire. 


15:03.485 --> 15:05.587
So as soon as Sandra 
got on her feet 


15:05.587 --> 15:08.224
and was feeling well enough, 
we got pioneering. 


15:08.223 --> 15:10.691
And then I wrote headquarters, 
and I said: ‘Here we are. 


15:10.692 --> 15:12.695
‘We’re ready 
to take on whatever. 


15:12.695 --> 15:14.697
What would you 
like us to do?’


15:14.697 --> 15:16.965
You know, 
I’d like to say here, Ron, 


15:16.965 --> 15:21.703
that I really appreciate 
Bill as my spiritual head 


15:21.703 --> 15:24.840
because even though these things 
presented themselves 


15:24.840 --> 15:27.977
in the course 
of our theocratic history,


15:27.977 --> 15:32.114
he was always quick to accept 
the responsibility of what we felt 


15:32.113 --> 15:36.185
was our spiritual, familial, 
and moral responsibility


15:36.185 --> 15:39.488
but as soon as these obligations 
were taken care of, 


15:39.488 --> 15:41.990
he was very quick 
to get us back on the road 


15:41.990 --> 15:44.793
to meet our spiritual goals 
that we had. 


15:44.793 --> 15:46.395
And I really do appreciate that.


15:46.395 --> 15:47.930
Good example. 
Thank you. 


15:47.930 --> 15:50.765
So you made yourself 
available to the organization. 


15:50.765 --> 15:52.735
Where did they send you next?


15:52.735 --> 15:54.202
A wonderful assignment. 


15:54.202 --> 15:58.140
We were sent 
as special pioneers to Washington D.C., 


15:58.140 --> 16:02.477
to help start 
a Spanish congregation. 


16:02.477 --> 16:05.947
And that was indeed 
a very rich blessing. 


16:05.947 --> 16:08.317
We were there 
a year and a half 


16:08.317 --> 16:12.287
until that little congregation 
was solid and was formed. 


16:12.287 --> 16:14.724
And then we received 
another blessing. 


16:14.723 --> 16:17.125
We were appointed 
to the circuit work. 


16:17.125 --> 16:19.762
So I had 
the Spanish circuit in Florida 


16:19.762 --> 16:24.265
from Key West to Orlando
—one circuit in the whole state. 


16:24.265 --> 16:27.670
Then we came to New York City
—lived in the Bronx. 


16:27.670 --> 16:31.073
I had a circuit, and we did 
district work in the Spanish field.


16:31.073 --> 16:33.075
Then, to Texas


16:33.075 --> 16:35.577
—to what they call the Valley of Texas, 
the Rio Grande Valley—


16:35.577 --> 16:37.579
for a couple 
of years in the circuit. 


16:37.578 --> 16:40.481
Then the district in Spanish 


16:40.482 --> 16:43.619
from Houston, Texas, 
to Yuba City, California. 


16:43.618 --> 16:45.520
And we loved 
every minute of it.


16:45.520 --> 16:47.522
Well, that’s definitely 
the traveling work.


16:47.522 --> 16:50.025
I know you were 
in that work for nearly ten years, 


16:50.025 --> 16:52.027
so I’m sure 
you really benefited 


16:52.027 --> 16:54.062
a lot of brothers 
and sisters along the way.


16:54.062 --> 16:57.867
Then 1977 rolls around 
and you receive another invitation.


16:57.867 --> 16:58.967
Yes, indeed! 


16:58.967 --> 17:01.204
We were doing 
preconvention work


17:01.203 --> 17:04.473
in the L.A. area 
at the Leimert Assembly Hall,


17:04.473 --> 17:09.076
and we received a letter 
inviting us to come to Bethel. 


17:09.077 --> 17:13.682
That was a very, very special privilege: 
to be invited to Bethel. 


17:13.682 --> 17:15.717
I went 
into the Service Department, 


17:15.717 --> 17:18.720
because at that time they 
invited a number of traveling overseers 


17:18.720 --> 17:21.090
to come in and work 
in the Service Department, 


17:21.090 --> 17:23.492
and Sandra went 
into housekeeping. 


17:23.492 --> 17:26.195
And we were both 
delighted to come to Bethel.


17:26.195 --> 17:28.563
Well, sort of. 


17:28.563 --> 17:31.966
I really loved the ministry; 


17:31.967 --> 17:34.269
I loved, especially, 
the district work


17:34.268 --> 17:36.571
—being with 
the circuit overseer and his wife 


17:36.572 --> 17:38.907
every week 
and out in service. 


17:38.907 --> 17:42.979
So I wasn’t too anxious 
for this Bethel thing. 


17:42.978 --> 17:46.815
But, you know. 
Jehovah, again, knows what you need. 


17:46.815 --> 17:50.985
We came here, and we 
started adjusting to Bethel life. 


17:50.985 --> 17:54.288
And it really proved out 
to be a real blessing 


17:54.288 --> 17:57.325
because we got 
the close association 


17:57.325 --> 18:00.862
with so many 
other loyal Witnesses of Jehovah.


18:00.862 --> 18:03.099
Yes. 
And then for the rest of us 


18:03.098 --> 18:05.166
that have been able
to work with you over the decades,


18:05.167 --> 18:07.770
we appreciate your loyal example 
and working with you. 


18:07.770 --> 18:10.705
But, I understand that shortly 
after you arrived to Bethel, 


18:10.705 --> 18:14.275
you also received 
some challenging family difficulties 


18:14.275 --> 18:16.278
that you needed to deal with.


18:16.278 --> 18:19.915
Yes, Sandra had 
an older sister who needed help.


18:19.915 --> 18:22.683
Yeah. 
We were still adjusting, like I said. 


18:22.683 --> 18:26.655
And we heard 
that one of my older sisters, 


18:26.655 --> 18:29.357
who had spent most 
of her life in the pioneer service, 


18:29.357 --> 18:33.995
she had now entered the terminal stages 
in her long fight with cancer, 


18:33.995 --> 18:37.032
and she needed some homecare. 


18:37.032 --> 18:42.004
And the brothers in the organization 
were very kind to me, 


18:42.003 --> 18:44.238
and they allowed 
me some free time to go 


18:44.238 --> 18:46.408
and care 
for that responsibility. 


18:46.408 --> 18:48.710
Then, it was 
just a few years later 


18:48.710 --> 18:51.713
that my mother 
was facing a similar situation. 


18:51.713 --> 18:55.050
And this time, 
again, the brothers allowed 


18:55.050 --> 18:58.387
both Bill and me 
to be free to go back there. 


18:58.387 --> 19:01.022
My mother was now aged 89. 


19:01.022 --> 19:05.294
She had health situations 
and she lived alone, so she needed care. 


19:05.293 --> 19:08.796
And again they allowed us this time; 
we went back. 


19:08.797 --> 19:11.500
And just as 
in the case with my sister,


19:11.500 --> 19:16.205
I was able to keep my mother home 
just until she died. 


19:16.205 --> 19:20.475
And, you know, we appreciate 
so much being granted that free time. 


19:20.475 --> 19:22.477
Even though when we left, 


19:22.477 --> 19:26.482
we didn’t know if it might mean 
the end of our Bethel career. 


19:26.482 --> 19:30.652
But again we felt the need 
to fulfill that responsibility. 


19:30.652 --> 19:34.957
And, you know, Ron, it was-it was 
a bittersweet experience. 


19:34.957 --> 19:38.794
This is Satan’s wicked world; 
death is our enemy. 


19:38.793 --> 19:41.430
And it hurts 
to see a loved one suffer. 


19:41.430 --> 19:45.000
But, you know, 
there’s the sweet side of it too, 


19:45.000 --> 19:48.137
because we had shared 
some wonderful moments 


19:48.137 --> 19:52.674
together with my family 
and experiences, shared experiences. 


19:52.673 --> 19:55.776
And we felt good 
that we had been able 


19:55.777 --> 19:59.014
to help these people 
that had been mentors for us.


19:59.013 --> 20:02.250
Yes.  So loyalty to your family 
and loyalty to Jehovah.


20:02.250 --> 20:03.585
Exactly.


20:03.585 --> 20:05.020
So you returned back 
to Bethel. 


20:05.020 --> 20:07.022
You were busy 
in your assignments. 


20:07.022 --> 20:10.125
And, as you mentioned, you worked 
with many loyal ones at Bethel. 


20:10.125 --> 20:13.128
Could you share 
one such experience of a loyal sister?


20:13.128 --> 20:14.028
Oh yes.  


20:14.028 --> 20:16.298
I was assigned 
to the Alterations Department,


20:16.298 --> 20:18.333
the Sewing Department. 


20:18.333 --> 20:21.001
And recently before that, 


20:21.002 --> 20:24.239
Sister Gertrude 
and her husband, Martin Poetzinger, 


20:24.238 --> 20:27.741
had been called into Bethel, and he was 
a member of the Governing Body. 


20:27.742 --> 20:32.414
And she had been trained under a tailor, 
so she was excellent in alterations. 


20:32.413 --> 20:36.385
But most valuable 
were our spiritual conversations. 


20:36.385 --> 20:38.953
I learned 
so much from that sister. 


20:38.953 --> 20:41.423
Once, we were talking
—a group of us—


20:41.423 --> 20:45.493
about what our relationship 
to Jehovah really means. 


20:45.493 --> 20:48.230
And Gertrude 
gave us her idea, 


20:48.230 --> 20:51.400
her understanding, 
of her relationship with Jehovah. 


20:51.400 --> 20:56.372
She said, “You know, sometimes in life 
a situation presents itself, 


20:56.372 --> 21:00.609
“and it’s so personal 
and so touching 


21:00.608 --> 21:04.411
that you don’t tell anybody about it
—except Jehovah, of course.” 


21:04.412 --> 21:09.384
And she said: “So you pray to Jehovah, 
and you pray to Jehovah. 


21:09.383 --> 21:13.488
And then pass a little time, 
and you feel he’s answered your prayer.” 


21:13.488 --> 21:15.956
She said: “You know, 
that is like a little thread 


21:15.957 --> 21:18.894
“that unites you with Jehovah. 


21:18.893 --> 21:22.763
“Now, this is 
the only person in the universe 


21:22.763 --> 21:24.966
“that shares 
this experience with you. 


21:24.967 --> 21:26.869
“So it’s very personal. 


21:26.868 --> 21:28.903
“OK. Time goes by; 


21:28.903 --> 21:32.106
“another situation presents itself, 
and you pray again. 


21:32.107 --> 21:34.342
“Well, here is another thread. 


21:34.342 --> 21:37.679
“And over a period of time, 
you’ve got a bunch of threads 


21:37.678 --> 21:40.548
connecting you with Jehovah.” 


21:40.548 --> 21:44.485
And she said, 
“And those threads are all knitted together, 


21:44.485 --> 21:48.423
and they form a cord 
that unites you with Jehovah.” 


21:48.423 --> 21:51.560
And then she’d say, 
“And don’t you ever do anything 


21:51.560 --> 21:54.228
to endanger that relationship.” 


21:54.228 --> 21:56.998
But, to me, it just—
It really hit my heart. 


21:56.998 --> 21:59.066
I thought, ‘This is so true.’ 


21:59.067 --> 22:02.270
Our relationship with Jehovah 
and our loyalty to him 


22:02.270 --> 22:05.773
has to be 
the first important thing in our life.


22:05.773 --> 22:07.408
Well, thank you for sharing that. 


22:07.408 --> 22:10.345
That has affected all of our hearts. 
Appreciate that. 


22:10.345 --> 22:13.815
So, Bill, you have received 
many privileges of service 


22:13.815 --> 22:17.452
before Bethel and your 40 years 
since you’ve been at Bethel. 


22:17.452 --> 22:21.857
One of the privileges that you have had 
is traveling to different branches 


22:21.857 --> 22:24.760
as a headquarters representative, 
or a zone overseer. 


22:24.760 --> 22:28.230
What are some memories you have 
of all those various visits?


22:28.230 --> 22:31.132
It’s a very rich privilege 
to do it, Ron, 


22:31.132 --> 22:34.002
to serve at that time 
as a zone overseer. 


22:34.002 --> 22:36.037
The brothers receive you so well. 


22:36.037 --> 22:39.107
Basically, the zone overseer, 
or now the branch representative, 


22:39.107 --> 22:41.142
he goes to be 
of encouragement to brothers. 


22:41.142 --> 22:45.314
And he visits the branch; meets 
with all the Bethelites whenever possible; 


22:45.313 --> 22:48.015
tries to talk to all of them, 
giving encouragement; 


22:48.015 --> 22:50.652
meets with all of the missionaries 
in the country. 


22:50.652 --> 22:53.255
And you’re received 
so warmly. 


22:53.255 --> 22:57.292
I remember 
when Sandra and I visited Tahiti. 


22:57.292 --> 23:00.329
We flew into Tahiti
—Papeete, Tahiti—


23:00.328 --> 23:04.065
and it was three in the morning 
when we arrived. 


23:04.065 --> 23:06.402
The brothers were 
absolutely wonderful. 


23:06.402 --> 23:09.337
There were about 35 brothers 
waiting for us there, 


23:09.337 --> 23:13.875
piling flower leis upon us, 
giving us a kiss on each cheek. 


23:13.875 --> 23:17.045
But the warmth of the brothers 
and the joy of being 


23:17.045 --> 23:19.147
with the Bethel family 
was something.


23:19.147 --> 23:21.349
Well, the one sister 
didn’t find any room 


23:21.348 --> 23:23.351
left on your cheeks, 
remember, she kissed you . . .


23:23.352 --> 23:25.087
No. So I got a kiss 
on the top of the head. 


23:25.087 --> 23:27.089
But the joy of the brothers 
was just wonderful, 


23:27.088 --> 23:31.125
and we’ve had the great privilege 
of visiting a number of branches.


23:31.125 --> 23:33.595
And I understand 
that you traveled to Bolivia, 


23:33.595 --> 23:36.030
and you had 
a nice experience in Bolivia.


23:36.030 --> 23:40.968
I just loved this work because I got 
to play missionary when I was out there. 


23:40.968 --> 23:43.638
And, of course, my heart 
was always in the missionary field. 


23:43.638 --> 23:47.908
But I remember when we went to Bolivia; 
since it was a smaller branch, 


23:47.908 --> 23:51.178
I was allowed to go out 
and work in service with the missionaries. 


23:51.178 --> 23:53.748
And they came, and they picked me up 
at eight o’clock in the morning. 


23:53.748 --> 23:57.751
And they said, “We are going to take you 
out to a Mennonite colony.” 


23:57.752 --> 24:01.924
And so I left at eight, and I didn’t get back 
until eleven o’clock at night.


24:01.923 --> 24:04.325
And I was a little bit disturbed 
about that hour. 


24:04.325 --> 24:05.860
That late for her getting back.


24:05.860 --> 24:07.862
Well, you see, 
it’s a Mennonite community. 


24:07.862 --> 24:11.165
They don’t have electricity, 
and we didn’t have cell phones at that time, 


24:11.165 --> 24:14.937
so he had no idea 
what was happening to me. 


24:14.937 --> 24:17.772
But we studied 
all day with this family, 


24:17.772 --> 24:21.710
and eventually, by the way, 
they all came in to the truth. 


24:21.710 --> 24:25.013
And their experience 
came out in 2005, 


24:25.013 --> 24:28.450
September 1 issue 
of The Watchtower, 


24:28.450 --> 24:31.653
about this family of Mennonites 
that came into the truth. 


24:31.653 --> 24:35.423
And now the work is spreading 
like wildfire among the Mennonites. 


24:35.423 --> 24:40.428
But, anyway, toward the end of the day, 
it was getting near dusk 


24:40.428 --> 24:44.833
and the missionary 
(just to tease me) said to the family, 


24:44.833 --> 24:47.535
“Well, it’s time 
to milk the cows now. 


24:47.535 --> 24:51.573
So bring up the meanest one you’ve got, 
and ask Sandra to milk her.” 


24:51.573 --> 24:54.175
So, of course, he didn’t know 
I was raised on a farm.


24:54.175 --> 24:55.077
Hmm. OK.


24:55.077 --> 24:59.580
So it had rained all day, 
and it was muddy and nasty out there. 


24:59.580 --> 25:05.287
But I had my high heels on, silk blouse, 
earrings, but we went out to the barn. 


25:05.287 --> 25:09.124
And they gave me a bucket, 
and I was able to milk the cow.


25:09.123 --> 25:09.958
What a nice experience.


25:09.958 --> 25:10.725
And she wasn’t mean at all.


25:10.725 --> 25:13.262
Well, I’m sure you 
have many more experiences 


25:13.262 --> 25:16.532
to let us know about, 
but we appreciate you sharing those. 


25:16.532 --> 25:20.335
The Governing Body 
has made significant adjustments 


25:20.335 --> 25:24.572
in the work that is taking place 
at Bethel and the field, 


25:24.572 --> 25:27.842
and it has affected 
many long-time faithful brothers


25:27.842 --> 25:30.279
—loyal brothers 
in the traveling work, 


25:30.278 --> 25:34.315
overseers in the congregation, 
overseers at Bethel. 


25:34.315 --> 25:38.220
Bill, what do you think 
about some of these changes 


25:38.220 --> 25:40.222
that the Governing Body 
has made recently?


25:40.222 --> 25:42.290
I think they’re 
very wise decisions. 


25:42.290 --> 25:44.525
They know what is needed; 


25:44.525 --> 25:47.428
they appreciate the older men 
who have served for years. 


25:47.428 --> 25:51.365
We know that the older brothers 
in circuit work, district work, 


25:51.365 --> 25:54.735
wherever, they’re “worthy of double honor” 
because of the way


25:54.735 --> 25:57.072
they’ve given 
of themselves to the work. 


25:57.072 --> 26:00.175
But we have to recognize, too, 
there comes a time 


26:00.175 --> 26:03.412
when we want the younger men 
to come along, 


26:03.412 --> 26:05.414
to accept responsibility. 


26:05.413 --> 26:07.615
And, really, 
when we were young, 


26:07.615 --> 26:12.387
we received responsibilities 
with very little background and training. 


26:12.387 --> 26:15.390
Now we’ve got all these schools 
for Kingdom Evangelizers 


26:15.390 --> 26:18.192
and the Kingdom Ministry School. 


26:18.192 --> 26:21.495
So many opportunities 
for younger ones to be trained. 


26:21.495 --> 26:24.532
And so I think 
it’s a wonderful arrangement. 


26:24.532 --> 26:27.669
Many thousands of young men 
are doing so well, 


26:27.668 --> 26:29.670
ready to accept responsibility. 


26:29.670 --> 26:32.007
It’s a blessing 
for the entire organization.


26:32.007 --> 26:34.009
Well, thank you for sharing that. 


26:34.008 --> 26:36.043
That’ll benefit many brothers. 


26:36.043 --> 26:38.413
So we look 
at this couple before us, 


26:38.413 --> 26:42.316
and we see some who have made 
wise choices along the way. 


26:42.317 --> 26:45.854
So we look back at over 60 years 
of faithful, loyal service. 


26:45.853 --> 26:47.855
As you look back at decisions 


26:47.855 --> 26:50.000
you made in life, any regrets?


26:51.760 --> 26:54.028
Oh, absolutely none! 


26:54.028 --> 26:56.931
We consider that whatever 


26:56.932 --> 27:01.837
we have given up or done 
it’s been our gift to Jehovah. 


27:01.837 --> 27:05.207
You know, when I was a little girl, 
I remember I used to go out on our farm 


27:05.207 --> 27:09.277
and, especially when there 
was a full moon, I used to pray to Jehovah. 


27:09.277 --> 27:13.749
And I’d say, 
“Just let me use up my life in your service.”


27:13.748 --> 27:17.518
You know, he’s answered 
that prayer because my life, 


27:17.518 --> 27:21.221
the majority of it, is used up 
and he’s let me do it in his service.


27:21.222 --> 27:24.192
Sort of makes me think 
of one of my favorite scriptures, 


27:24.192 --> 27:26.795
Jeremiah 29:11. 


27:26.795 --> 27:31.733
It’s where Jehovah, 
referring to his faithful, loyal ones, says:


27:31.733 --> 27:35.303
‘I well know the thoughts 
I am thinking toward you, 


27:35.303 --> 27:40.275
not of calamity but of peace 
and a future and a hope.’ 


27:40.275 --> 27:44.278
Now the calamities 
that we face in life, 


27:44.278 --> 27:48.983
that doesn’t come from Jehovah; 
that comes from Satan’s wicked old world. 


27:48.983 --> 27:53.821
But Jehovah promises us peace, 
a future, and a hope. 


27:53.822 --> 27:57.125
Now, how could you 
not be loyal to such a God?


27:57.125 --> 27:58.292
Beautiful. 


27:58.292 --> 28:01.529
Bill, how do you view sacrifices 
that you have made along the way?


28:01.528 --> 28:03.531
Well, as you know, a sacrifice 


28:03.532 --> 28:07.369
can be something 
you give up to serve God, perhaps. 


28:07.368 --> 28:10.671
Or a sacrifice can be 
what you give to Jehovah, 


28:10.672 --> 28:12.674
like David said in Psalm 54. 


28:12.673 --> 28:14.941
“I will sacrifice to you willingly.” 


28:14.942 --> 28:18.145
And that’s how I view sacrifice. 


28:18.145 --> 28:22.183
We’re happy to give of ourselves 
to Jehovah God—to serve him. 


28:22.183 --> 28:24.751
And I want to add, too, 
Sandra has been 


28:24.752 --> 28:28.055
a wonderful partner with me
—willing to go anywhere, 


28:28.055 --> 28:31.492
put up with all kinds
of circumstances and difficulties,


28:31.492 --> 28:33.962
never complaining 
about the travel 


28:33.962 --> 28:37.932
or whatever circumstances 
we found ourselves in, 


28:37.932 --> 28:42.870
living very close to the earth 
for a number of years as special pioneers. 


28:42.870 --> 28:45.073
But Jehovah has been with us.


28:45.073 --> 28:47.208
A scripture that I—
There are a number 


28:47.208 --> 28:49.376
of good Scriptures, 
obviously, that we all love. 


28:49.377 --> 28:52.214
But one in particular 
that stays in my mind 


28:52.213 --> 28:55.450
is Romans 14:7,8: 


28:55.450 --> 28:58.753
‘We live, we live to Jehovah. 


28:58.753 --> 29:02.023
‘We die, we die to Jehovah. 


29:02.023 --> 29:05.560
So whether we live or we die, 
we belong to Jehovah.’ 


29:05.560 --> 29:08.597
And we’ve made that decision, 
not just because he’s the Creator. 


29:08.597 --> 29:12.800
We’ve made the decision 
to give ourselves to Jehovah God. 


29:12.800 --> 29:17.238
So, absolutely, 
we’ve had the best life possible. 


29:17.238 --> 29:20.040
We have no regrets at all 


29:20.040 --> 29:24.712
about what we’ve done with our life, 
giving Jehovah the first place.


29:24.712 --> 29:27.115
Bill and Sandra, 
it’s been a real privilege 


29:27.115 --> 29:30.385
to hear more about you, and I know 
there are more stories to tell. 


29:30.385 --> 29:34.488
How can you boil down 60-plus years 
of loyal service to Jehovah? 


29:34.488 --> 29:36.490
But you have given us 
great insights. 


29:36.490 --> 29:50.422
Thank you for sharing 
those gems with us.

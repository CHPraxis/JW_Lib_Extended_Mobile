00:01 There’s something common  to every successful marriage
00:04 between two Christians.
00:06 It is their putting Jehovah first
00:08 and supporting  each other’s personal dedication to God.
00:12 This is certainly true  with Viv and Ann Mouritz,
00:15 serving  in the Australasia branch.
00:18 They’ve been married for 65 years
00:22 and have  a combined 131 years
00:25 in full-time service.
00:27 Listen to their advice  for younger ones
00:30 deciding what to do  in Jehovah’s organization.
00:35 I started pioneering  in November 1948.
00:38 That’s a while ago now.
00:40 And that’s what I thought  I would do—pioneer.
00:47 So I said, “Well, Jehovah,  if I do what you ask me,
00:52 “I accept whatever assignment  you give me,
00:54 “and I’ll just go  where you send me,
00:56 and I won’t seek an assignment,  but I won’t refuse one.”
00:59 That’s all I intended to do  as far as I knew,
01:01 but then I had only been pioneering  about a year
01:04 when I got this envelope,  and the letter said:
01:06 “Please fill in the enclosed form.”
01:08 It was an application for Bethel,  and I thought,
01:10 ‘Goodness, I didn’t think of Bethel.
01:12 I told Jehovah I’d go where he sent me,  so don’t argue, just do it.’
01:18 I was working in the printery  cleaning out old ink tins
01:22 and making schedules  for printing and so on.
01:25 And then I got to work  on the press too,
01:28 but I wasn’t there very long  when they moved me to the office.
01:34 Well, you learn a lot in Bethel.
01:36 You learn how to live  with your brothers,
01:38 which you’re not used to.
01:40 You learn about Jehovah’s organization —you see how it operates.
01:45 I had the privilege of working alongside  brothers who had lots of experience.
01:51 I got assigned  to Metropolitan Congregation.
01:54 That’s where Ann was.
01:56 Yeah, we got married  in October 1951,
01:59 and two weeks later,
02:01 I started pioneering.
02:05 I was 20 at that time  when we started circuit work,
02:09 and I’d only pioneered for a year;
02:12 so of course I was very worried
02:14 and scared about having to witness  with sisters
02:18 that had pioneered for years  and some of them even of the anointed.
02:23 I cried halfway to Melbourne.
02:27 We got very close  to the brothers and sisters
02:30 and especially to the children,  so we really loved that.
02:33 And then we  got the opportunity to go
02:36 to New York  to the international convention
02:39 in 1958.
02:42 When the Society found out  we were going, they sent us
02:45 an application for Gilead,  and we thought, ‘Oh, my goodness.
02:48 How can we do that?’
02:51 So we said,  “Well, we don’t say no.”
02:56 After the ‘58 convention,
02:58 we were assigned to special pioneer
03:00 in Canada for six months.
03:03 Brother Knorr said  we were in cold storage,
03:05 so there were about 40 of us
03:07 from British Commonwealth countries.
03:09 So that was a good experience too.
03:12 We saw winter for the first time.  I did, anyway.
03:16 And we took pictures  of snow and ice and icicles
03:19 to show in our assignment when we  got into India or Africa or somewhere.
03:24 And Jehovah had a sense of humor;  he sent us to Finland.
03:29 Well, the schooling you get from Gilead
03:31 or the other schools
03:33 helps you to see Jehovah’s organization
03:36 and how it works.
03:40 We didn’t know a lot about Finland  except that we knew it was cold
03:43 and clean
03:49 and a long way from Australia.
03:51 Being so far from Australia,
03:55 we knew that we  wouldn’t be able to get home
03:57 to see our families,  not for a long, long time.
04:04 When we moved into Finland,  the brothers
04:06 in Russia and those countries  were under ban.
04:10 They needed spiritual food,
04:12 and so it had to be supplied to them.
04:16 So we used to send people in as tourists,  and they would meet
04:19 the brothers there  and deliver the food to them.
04:24 Without Jehovah’s blessing  and his spirit,
04:26 we couldn’t have done it at all.
04:29 It’s amazing to think  that the amount of spiritual food
04:32 that got in there,  they translated it,
04:35 and they made it available.
04:37 And we did that for over 20 years
04:39 without any mishaps.
04:42 It couldn’t happen  without Jehovah’s blessing.
04:45 Leaving Finland was not easy,  of course.
04:47 We had mixed feelings,
04:49 but, actually,  I saw Jehovah’s hand
04:52 in the assignment
04:54 because we really got back  to Australia
04:57 at a time when my parents  were needing help,
04:59 so we didn’t have to leave Bethel
05:02 or full-time service  to give that help.
05:05 We were asked  to go to Russia in 1999.
05:08 That turned out  to be two and a half years.
05:11 I was a little apprehensive  about going to Russia,
05:14 but it was really one of the most  memorable assignments
05:17 we’ve ever had.
05:20 In Russia, the brothers  were not used to house-to-house work
05:23 because of all the years under ban.
05:27 And that was quite different  because you go to the door;
05:29 you can’t just strike up a conversation.
05:32 The person wants to know  why you are there.
05:34 And you can’t make
05:35 a return visit on someone  you met on the street
05:37 —well, you don’t know  where he lives.
05:39 If you’ve called at his house, you do,  and you can make a return visit.
05:42 The brothers saw  the advantage of that.
05:44 But they had to learn.  It was a new thing.
05:48 Circuit overseers had to learn  how to visit congregations,
05:51 and Polish brothers came in  and helped a lot with that
05:55 —did circuit work— but they too had to learn.
05:59 So it was a big change for them
06:01 to come from working  under ban all their lives
06:04 to now working the way  the rest of the world does.
06:10 The best decision I ever made
06:12 was to put my life  in Jehovah’s hands,
06:14 and to say, “You decide
06:16 where I go and what I do.”
06:20 I’ve had the feeling all along,  and it’s proven true so far,
06:23 that everything I have done
06:25 has been training for something else.
06:28 So, what I’m doing now  is still training.
06:30 It must be for the new world because I haven’t got
06:32 much time left in this one.
06:34 What will it be?  Well, who knows?
06:41 So my recommendation  to everyone is:
06:43 Don’t decide for yourself.
06:45 Let Jehovah do it.
06:50 Brother and Sister Mouritz  always looked to Jehovah
06:52 for their assignments.
06:54 For Brother Mouritz,  that’s meant serving
06:57 on the Branch Committees  in Finland, India,
07:00 Russia, Poland, Ukraine,
07:02 and Australasia
07:04 and the privilege of making visits
07:06 to more than 70 countries
07:08 as a representative  of world headquarters.
07:12 We can certainly pursue  any form of service
07:15 that our circumstances allow.
07:17 But when we pray  for Jehovah’s direction,
07:20 we rely on him to send us
07:22 where it benefits his organization
07:24 and ourselves the most.

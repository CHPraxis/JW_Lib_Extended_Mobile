00:01.685 --> 00:04.553
There’s something common 
to every successful marriage 


00:04.553 --> 00:06.588
between two Christians. 


00:06.588 --> 00:08.791
It is their putting Jehovah first 


00:08.792 --> 00:12.395
and supporting 
each other’s personal dedication to God. 


00:12.395 --> 00:15.998
This is certainly true 
with Viv and Ann Mouritz, 


00:15.998 --> 00:18.935
serving 
in the Australasia branch. 


00:18.935 --> 00:22.138
They’ve been married
for 65 years 


00:22.138 --> 00:25.141
and have 
a combined 131 years 


00:25.142 --> 00:27.210
in full-time service. 


00:27.210 --> 00:30.213
Listen to their advice 
for younger ones 


00:30.213 --> 00:34.000
deciding what to do 
in Jehovah’s organization.


00:35.185 --> 00:38.722
I started pioneering 
in November 1948. 


00:38.722 --> 00:40.724
That’s a while ago now. 


00:40.723 --> 00:44.000
And that’s what I thought 
I would do—pioneer.


00:47.063 --> 00:51.000
So I said, “Well, Jehovah, 
if I do what you ask me, 


00:52.202 --> 00:54.270
“I accept whatever assignment 
you give me,


00:54.270 --> 00:56.338
“and I’ll just go 
where you send me, 


00:56.338 --> 00:59.375
and I won’t seek an assignment, 
but I won’t refuse one.” 


00:59.375 --> 01:01.912
That’s all I intended to do 
as far as I knew, 


01:01.912 --> 01:04.247
but then I had only been pioneering 
about a year 


01:04.247 --> 01:06.382
when I got this envelope, 
and the letter said: 


01:06.382 --> 01:08.785
“Please fill in the enclosed form.” 


01:08.785 --> 01:10.987
It was an application for Bethel, 
and I thought, 


01:10.987 --> 01:12.989
‘Goodness, I didn’t think of Bethel. 


01:12.988 --> 01:16.000
I told Jehovah I’d go where he sent me, 
so don’t argue, just do it.’


01:18.862 --> 01:22.332
I was working in the printery 
cleaning out old ink tins 


01:22.332 --> 01:25.135
and making schedules 
for printing and so on. 


01:25.135 --> 01:28.203
And then I got to work 
on the press too, 


01:28.203 --> 01:32.000
but I wasn’t there very long 
when they moved me to the office.


01:34.477 --> 01:36.679
Well, you learn a lot in Bethel. 


01:36.678 --> 01:38.681
You learn how to live 
with your brothers, 


01:38.682 --> 01:40.684
which you’re not used to. 


01:40.683 --> 01:44.000
You learn about Jehovah’s organization
—you see how it operates. 


01:45.488 --> 01:49.000
I had the privilege of working alongside 
brothers who had lots of experience.


01:51.393 --> 01:54.596
I got assigned 
to Metropolitan Congregation. 


01:54.597 --> 01:56.599
That’s where Ann was.


01:56.598 --> 01:59.635
Yeah, we got married 
in October 1951, 


01:59.635 --> 02:01.637
and two weeks later, 


02:01.637 --> 02:04.000
I started pioneering.


02:05.608 --> 02:09.578
I was 20 at that time 
when we started circuit work, 


02:09.578 --> 02:12.448
and I’d only pioneered for a year; 


02:12.448 --> 02:14.950
so of course I was very worried 


02:14.950 --> 02:18.788
and scared about having to witness 
with sisters 


02:18.788 --> 02:22.000
that had pioneered for years 
and some of them even of the anointed. 


02:23.727 --> 02:26.000
I cried halfway to Melbourne.


02:27.663 --> 02:30.466
We got very close 
to the brothers and sisters 


02:30.467 --> 02:33.469
and especially to the children, 
so we really loved that.


02:33.468 --> 02:36.771
And then we 
got the opportunity to go


02:36.772 --> 02:39.109
to New York 
to the international convention 


02:39.108 --> 02:41.000
in 1958. 


02:42.512 --> 02:45.114
When the Society found out 
we were going, they sent us 


02:45.113 --> 02:48.250
an application for Gilead, 
and we thought, ‘Oh, my goodness. 


02:48.250 --> 02:51.487
How can we do that?’ 


02:51.487 --> 02:55.000
So we said, 
“Well, we don’t say no.”


02:56.125 --> 02:58.460
After the ‘58 convention, 


02:58.460 --> 03:00.997
we were assigned to special pioneer 


03:00.997 --> 03:03.199
in Canada for six months. 


03:03.198 --> 03:05.335
Brother Knorr said 
we were in cold storage, 


03:05.335 --> 03:07.470
so there were about 40 of us 


03:07.470 --> 03:09.772
from British Commonwealth countries. 


03:09.772 --> 03:12.342
So that was a good experience too. 


03:12.342 --> 03:16.379
We saw winter for the first time. 
I did, anyway.


03:16.378 --> 03:19.781
And we took pictures 
of snow and ice and icicles 


03:19.782 --> 03:23.000
to show in our assignment when we 
got into India or Africa or somewhere. 


03:24.253 --> 03:27.000
And Jehovah had a sense of humor; 
he sent us to Finland.


03:29.492 --> 03:31.694
Well, the schooling you get from Gilead 


03:31.693 --> 03:33.696
or the other schools 


03:33.697 --> 03:36.165
helps you to see Jehovah’s organization 


03:36.165 --> 03:39.000
and how it works.


03:40.437 --> 03:43.774
We didn’t know a lot about Finland 
except that we knew it was cold 


03:43.773 --> 03:46.000
and clean 


03:49.112 --> 03:51.147
and a long way from Australia.


03:51.147 --> 03:55.919
Being so far from Australia, 


03:55.918 --> 03:57.920
we knew that we 
wouldn’t be able to get home 


03:57.920 --> 04:01.000
to see our families, 
not for a long, long time.


04:04.660 --> 04:06.997
When we moved into Finland, 
the brothers 


04:06.997 --> 04:09.000
in Russia and those countries 
were under ban. 


04:10.567 --> 04:12.569
They needed spiritual food, 


04:12.568 --> 04:15.000
and so it had to be supplied to them. 


04:16.138 --> 04:19.275
So we used to send people in as tourists, 
and they would meet 


04:19.275 --> 04:22.000
the brothers there 
and deliver the food to them.


04:24.080 --> 04:26.748
Without Jehovah’s blessing 
and his spirit, 


04:26.748 --> 04:29.151
we couldn’t have done it at all. 


04:29.152 --> 04:32.889
It’s amazing to think 
that the amount of spiritual food 


04:32.888 --> 04:35.891
that got in there, 
they translated it, 


04:35.892 --> 04:37.960
and they made it available. 


04:37.960 --> 04:39.962
And we did that for over 20 years 


04:39.962 --> 04:42.165
without any mishaps. 


04:42.165 --> 04:45.602
It couldn’t happen 
without Jehovah’s blessing.


04:45.602 --> 04:47.737
Leaving Finland was not easy, 
of course. 


04:47.737 --> 04:49.539
We had mixed feelings, 


04:49.538 --> 04:52.441
but, actually, 
I saw Jehovah’s hand 


04:52.442 --> 04:54.344
in the assignment 


04:54.343 --> 04:57.380
because we really got back 
to Australia 


04:57.380 --> 04:59.648
at a time when my parents 
were needing help, 


04:59.648 --> 05:02.718
so we didn’t have to leave Bethel 


05:02.718 --> 05:05.755
or full-time service 
to give that help.


05:05.755 --> 05:08.490
We were asked 
to go to Russia in 1999. 


05:08.490 --> 05:11.893
That turned out 
to be two and a half years.


05:11.893 --> 05:14.296
I was a little apprehensive 
about going to Russia, 


05:14.297 --> 05:17.567
but it was really one of the most 
memorable assignments 


05:17.567 --> 05:19.000
we’ve ever had.


05:20.235 --> 05:23.638
In Russia, the brothers 
were not used to house-to-house work 


05:23.638 --> 05:26.000
because of all the years under ban. 


05:27.543 --> 05:29.945
And that was quite different 
because you go to the door; 


05:29.945 --> 05:32.248
you can’t just strike up a conversation. 


05:32.248 --> 05:34.250
The person wants to know 
why you are there. 


05:34.250 --> 05:35.652
And you can’t make 


05:35.652 --> 05:37.654
a return visit on someone 
you met on the street


05:37.653 --> 05:39.655
—well, you don’t know 
where he lives. 


05:39.655 --> 05:42.525
If you’ve called at his house, you do, 
and you can make a return visit. 


05:42.525 --> 05:44.927
The brothers saw 
the advantage of that. 


05:44.927 --> 05:48.264
But they had to learn. 
It was a new thing. 


05:48.263 --> 05:51.400
Circuit overseers had to learn 
how to visit congregations, 


05:51.400 --> 05:55.137
and Polish brothers came in 
and helped a lot with that


05:55.137 --> 05:59.309
—did circuit work—
but they too had to learn. 


05:59.308 --> 06:01.310
So it was a big change for them 


06:01.310 --> 06:04.047
to come from working 
under ban all their lives 


06:04.047 --> 06:07.000
to now working the way 
the rest of the world does.


06:10.420 --> 06:12.422
The best decision I ever made 


06:12.422 --> 06:14.690
was to put my life 
in Jehovah’s hands, 


06:14.690 --> 06:16.758
and to say, “You decide 


06:16.758 --> 06:19.000
where I go and what I do.” 


06:20.095 --> 06:23.432
I’ve had the feeling all along, 
and it’s proven true so far, 


06:23.432 --> 06:25.435
that everything I have done 


06:25.435 --> 06:28.403
has been training for something else. 


06:28.403 --> 06:30.540
So, what I’m doing now 
is still training. 


06:30.540 --> 06:32.642
It must be for the new world
because I haven’t got 


06:32.642 --> 06:34.710
much time left in this one. 


06:34.710 --> 06:37.000
What will it be? 
Well, who knows?


06:41.017 --> 06:43.285
So my recommendation 
to everyone is: 


06:43.285 --> 06:45.287
Don’t decide for yourself. 


06:45.287 --> 06:48.000
Let Jehovah do it.


06:50.058 --> 06:52.661
Brother and Sister Mouritz 
always looked to Jehovah 


06:52.662 --> 06:54.664
for their assignments. 


06:54.663 --> 06:57.133
For Brother Mouritz, 
that’s meant serving 


06:57.133 --> 07:00.101
on the Branch Committees 
in Finland, India, 


07:00.102 --> 07:02.539
Russia, Poland, Ukraine, 


07:02.538 --> 07:04.540
and Australasia 


07:04.540 --> 07:06.542
and the privilege of making visits 


07:06.542 --> 07:08.544
to more than 70 countries 


07:08.543 --> 07:12.681
as a representative 
of world headquarters. 


07:12.682 --> 07:15.284
We can certainly pursue 
any form of service 


07:15.283 --> 07:17.353
that our circumstances allow. 


07:17.353 --> 07:20.355
But when we pray 
for Jehovah’s direction, 


07:20.355 --> 07:22.358
we rely on him to send us 


07:22.358 --> 07:24.626
where it benefits his organization 


07:24.627 --> 07:37.624
and ourselves the most.

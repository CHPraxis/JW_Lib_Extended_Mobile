00:05 People often tell me,
00:07 “Why, I never talked to a person
00:09 that was 107 years old.”
00:12 And I tell them,  “You know what?
00:14 I never did either.”
00:19 I would describe Alma
00:21 as probably the most energetic
00:23 100-plus-year-old lady  that I’ve ever met.
00:27 She has, pretty much,
00:28 the whole theocratic history  in her mind that she carries with her.
00:32 So you can ask her anything  about the organization,
00:34 and she can be able to tell you about it
00:35 because she’s even met  a lot of those people.
00:38 We read about it, but she lived it.  She’s amazing.
00:42 Even though she’s 107,  she has an incredible memory.
00:47 I go back quite a ways.
00:50 When I was very young,  ten years old,
00:52 we saw the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
00:58 And it was just packed with people.
01:01 They were even standing in the back.
01:05 We were so thrilled.  We never forgot it.
01:09 And we realized  that we found the truth.
01:14 My father left the church
01:17 and he became  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
01:20 and they were called Bible Students  at that time.
01:25 In the early days,  we went to special conventions,
01:28 and some places,  they had a big field
01:31 where they put the cars  and they set up their tents.
01:35 They even named different streets.
01:38 It was just like a little city.
01:42 I was really thrilled  to see Brother Rutherford speak
01:46 at the conventions I attended.
01:50 I got married to Harold Miller in 1931.
01:55 That was when the depression  was going on,
01:58 and times were very difficult.
02:00 Everything was scarce.
02:04 There were no jobs to be had.
02:06 Food was rationed.
02:09 People were really hungry.
02:11 And they moved in any little shack
02:14 that they could just to get by.
02:20 We didn’t have anything.
02:22 And we couldn’t drive the car,
02:26 so we used to have a little white horse
02:30 —the name was Lou.
02:34 And we went out witnessing  with the horse and buggy.
02:38 She took us all over the place,  far distances.
02:44 They would take this buggy,  and they would go
02:47 20-30 miles in one direction;
02:49 20-30 miles the other direction.
02:52 All the hard work that they put forth
02:54 has resulted  in several congregations in the area.
02:59 We used to carry that magazine bag
03:03 when we were witnessing for awhile there.
03:07 And so we put it around the horse’s neck,
03:09 so the horse was taking part  in our witnessing.
03:14 People knew  who was coming when they saw
03:16 the little white horse come into their yard.
03:20 Sometimes it was cold,
03:23 and I remember wearing two coats.
03:26 Yeah, it was tiresome,
03:29 but we were young.
03:32 They would just go out  regardless of rain or shine
03:35 or whatever was going on at the time,  and they didn’t have a car.
03:37 And to me, that’s amazing  because we get so used to
03:40 the conveniences —I guess you could call it—
03:42 the coffee breaks,  the cars, and everything.
03:44 It’s like, well,  if Alma can do it, surely I can do it.
03:48 One time, Harold went out witnessing,
03:51 and 50 years later,  he talked to the same man.
03:54 He said, “50 years ago,
03:57 “there was a young guy  that came through here
04:01 “riding on horseback
04:03 and telling people that,”  he said,
04:07 “I think it’s ‘Armaggigon,’
04:09 he said was coming soon.”
04:12 And he remembered  Harold riding horseback
04:15 50 years ago in that territory,
04:17 and he got there again.
04:20 And that happened  a couple times more.
04:23 So it was a long life of witnessing.
04:32 Alma is so zealous for the ministry.
04:35 She does not like not-at-homes.
04:38 She wants to talk to people.
04:40 Yeah, I enjoy the ministry.
04:43 I go out as much as I can  in my old age.
04:48 We want to help the people  to see the truth.
04:52 There’s no greater joy.
04:58 I try to read the publications,
05:01 so I have a reading machine.
05:06 The letters come right out of the screen,
05:09 and I can study all my lessons.
05:13 I would be lost without it.
05:17 It helps me to keep up  in present truth.
05:20 What does dedication mean?
05:25 Sister Miller, please.
05:27 Dedication means that. . .
05:30 Some young ones might be concerned  about what they should do
05:32 with their life,  what choices they should make.
05:34 Well, here we see an example  of somebody who has served Jehovah
05:36 for over 100 years.
05:39 And we see that she’s happy  and has no regrets with her life.
05:41 And that’s an example  that we want to imitate.
05:45 Well, giving my life to Jehovah,
05:48 that’s the best thing  I could do for myself.
05:53 If I have any advice  for young ones today,
05:57 I would say  to keep on in the truth.
06:01 They have a whole world before them
06:05 to serve Jehovah
06:07 —something that endures forever.

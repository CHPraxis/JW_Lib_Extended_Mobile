00:01 Sister Margarita Königer has seen
00:03 the growth of the Kingdom work  all her life.
00:06 She has served  as a missionary since 1966,
00:10 and we met her in Hungary,
00:12 where she has now served  for about nine years.
05:51 In the 50 years  since she graduated from Gilead,
05:54 Sister Königer has learned  seven languages
05:58 and has served  in five different countries.
06:00 And recently,  she received a new assignment
06:04 —the Chinese field  in Munich, Germany.
06:07 Daily reading  and meditating on God’s Word, the Bible,
06:12 has given her  the strength she needs
06:14 to continue with joy  in her missionary assignment.

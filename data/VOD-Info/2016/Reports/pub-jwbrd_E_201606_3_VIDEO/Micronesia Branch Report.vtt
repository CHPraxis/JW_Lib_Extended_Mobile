00:01.017 --> 00:03.620
The islands of Micronesia 


00:03.620 --> 00:07.157
are tiny specks in the Pacific Ocean. 


00:07.157 --> 00:09.459
But these beautiful islands are home 


00:09.458 --> 00:13.830
to some 1,400 worshippers of Jehovah. 


00:13.830 --> 00:16.532
Formerly called the Guam branch, 


00:16.532 --> 00:19.302
the Micronesia branch oversees the work 


00:19.302 --> 00:22.672
in nine lands in addition to Guam. 


00:22.672 --> 00:27.377
There are currently 64 Bethel family members 
and full-time commuters, 


00:27.377 --> 00:31.347
but only 25 are at the branch office. 


00:31.347 --> 00:33.984
The rest have the privilege 
of working 


00:33.983 --> 00:37.153
in six remote translation offices.


00:37.153 --> 00:39.288
A significant milestone 


00:39.288 --> 00:42.025
was recently reached in Micronesia. 


00:42.025 --> 00:44.493
The Kingdom Hall construction program 


00:44.493 --> 00:46.896
that began in 2008 


00:46.897 --> 00:49.532
will be complete this month. 


00:49.532 --> 00:53.470
Among the projects completed 
were 13 Kingdom Halls, 


00:53.470 --> 00:56.072
6 remote translation offices, 


00:56.072 --> 00:58.675
and 4 missionary homes. 


00:58.675 --> 01:01.577
Some of these projects 
were new construction, 


01:01.577 --> 01:04.847
whereas others were renovations. 


01:04.847 --> 01:09.752
Many experiences showed 
Jehovah’s blessing on these projects, 


01:09.752 --> 01:15.959
some of which were shared 
in this month’s JW Broadcasting program.


01:15.958 --> 01:18.093
Despite very poor conditions 


01:18.093 --> 01:20.096
on many of these islands, 


01:20.097 --> 01:22.632
there has been 
a heartwarming response 


01:22.632 --> 01:26.735
to the May 2015 JW Broadcast 


01:26.735 --> 01:30.440
concerning our privilege 
to support Kingdom interests 


01:30.440 --> 01:32.442
through our donations. 


01:32.442 --> 01:36.212
Following the program, 
one couple of humble means 


01:36.212 --> 01:40.184
decided to set aside 20 U.S. dollars 


01:40.183 --> 01:42.551
each month as a donation. 


01:42.552 --> 01:45.020
Just last month, however, 


01:45.020 --> 01:47.990
their bills exceeded their income 


01:47.990 --> 01:50.627
by some 80 dollars. 


01:50.627 --> 01:54.230
Not knowing how they were going 
to come up with the extra money, 


01:54.230 --> 01:59.102
they thought about using the 20 dollars 
to help pay for the expenses. 


01:59.102 --> 02:03.272
In the end, though, 
they decided it was more important 


02:03.272 --> 02:06.509
to donate the funds, 
as they had resolved, 


02:06.508 --> 02:09.878
and look for another way 
to cover the deficit. 


02:09.878 --> 02:13.550
Well, shortly after making the donation, 


02:13.550 --> 02:17.453
they both were surprised to learn 
that they had been selected 


02:17.453 --> 02:20.756
as employees of the month 
for their good work. 


02:20.757 --> 02:22.759
The reward? 


02:22.758 --> 02:26.595
A cash gift of 50 dollars each. 


02:26.595 --> 02:31.000
The couple gives all the praise 
to Jehovah for the positive outcome.


02:32.435 --> 02:36.538
In 2014, our branch received training 


02:36.538 --> 02:41.143
to do audio/video recording 
in the remote translation offices. 


02:41.143 --> 02:44.446
As a result, the publishers 
have enjoyed using 


02:44.447 --> 02:46.984
more videos in the ministry. 


02:46.983 --> 02:49.351
One missionary brother 
had invited 


02:49.352 --> 02:51.955
the Chuukese couple 
he was studying with 


02:51.955 --> 02:54.157
to the meeting many times, 


02:54.157 --> 02:58.862
but they had only attended 
once in the past year and a half. 


02:58.862 --> 03:02.032
When the video 
What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? 


03:02.032 --> 03:04.467
became available in their language, 


03:04.467 --> 03:07.104
the brother played the video for them. 


03:07.103 --> 03:09.471
The couple was impressed 
and commented 


03:09.472 --> 03:13.275
that the Kingdom Hall was 
very different from their church. 


03:13.275 --> 03:15.878
They attended 
the very next meeting, 


03:15.878 --> 03:18.413
which happened 
to be the Memorial. 


03:18.413 --> 03:22.518
Experiencing for themselves 
what they saw in the video, 


03:22.518 --> 03:25.000
they continued 
attending meetings.


03:26.422 --> 03:29.625
Last year, the branch office 
encouraged congregations 


03:29.625 --> 03:32.995
to consider working 
unassigned territory. 


03:32.995 --> 03:36.798
In Micronesia, 
these are often 


03:36.798 --> 03:40.870
isolated atolls 
located hundreds of miles 


03:40.870 --> 03:43.205
from the nearest congregation. 


03:43.205 --> 03:46.175
One group sailed to the Aur Atoll 


03:46.175 --> 03:48.277
in the Marshall Islands. 


03:48.277 --> 03:51.314
On the little atoll island 
of Tobal, 


03:51.313 --> 03:54.050
they preached 
and invited the residents 


03:54.050 --> 03:57.620
to attend a public meeting 
the very next day. 


03:57.620 --> 04:02.192
To their surprise, 
42 residents attended, 


04:02.192 --> 04:06.495
which is about 25 percent 
of the islands’ population. 


04:06.495 --> 04:09.632
They were intrigued 
by the talk entitled 


04:09.632 --> 04:11.935
“How Does God View the Dead?” 


04:11.935 --> 04:16.172
The subject was timely because 
a father of three children 


04:16.172 --> 04:18.274
had died in an accident, 


04:18.273 --> 04:22.311
and the local minister 
said it was God’s will. 


04:22.312 --> 04:27.050
Following the talk, about 20 people 
stayed to ask questions


04:27.050 --> 04:30.118
—some for up to two hours. 


04:30.118 --> 04:33.623
Altogether, the group 
of five publishers 


04:33.623 --> 04:36.491
placed 1,000 pieces of literature 


04:36.492 --> 04:40.464
and started many Bible studies 
in this atoll. 


04:40.463 --> 04:43.866
Needless to say, 
this group is looking forward 


04:43.867 --> 04:47.000
to making another trip 
to this receptive territory.


04:48.303 --> 04:51.373
At Isaiah 42:12, 


04:51.373 --> 04:53.776
it was foretold 
that Jehovah’s people 


04:53.777 --> 04:57.180
would “declare 
his praise in the islands.” 


04:57.180 --> 05:00.917
We are happy that this prophecy 
is being fulfilled


05:00.917 --> 05:03.119
in the islands of Micronesia. 


05:03.118 --> 05:06.388
And it is a pleasure 
to bring to you all 


05:06.388 --> 05:21.120
the love and greetings 
from these beautiful people.

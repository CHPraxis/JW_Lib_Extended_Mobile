00:01.022 --> 00:05.109
On September 23, 2015, 
it was announced 


00:05.108 --> 00:09.280
at all branches that 
the Governing Body was requesting 


00:09.280 --> 00:13.492
all Bethel families to reduce in size.


00:13.492 --> 00:14.827
For me personally, 


00:14.827 --> 00:16.204
when they made that announcement 


00:16.203 --> 00:17.830
on Wednesday, September 23, 


00:17.830 --> 00:19.457
that was exciting. 


00:19.457 --> 00:20.415
It was—


00:20.415 --> 00:22.000
I knew it was momentous.


00:22.000 --> 00:24.002
When the announcement was made, 


00:24.002 --> 00:25.295
tears welled up in my eyes


00:25.295 --> 00:26.797
because I realized how close we are


00:26.797 --> 00:27.840
to the end. 


00:27.840 --> 00:29.383
And I remember just closing my eyes 


00:29.383 --> 00:30.425
and saying to Jehovah, 


00:30.425 --> 00:31.677
“Whatever you want, we’ll do.”


00:31.677 --> 00:34.847
When I received news of my reassignment, 


00:34.847 --> 00:36.849
initially I was numb.


00:36.848 --> 00:38.475
When I got the news 


00:38.475 --> 00:40.352
about my reassignment, 


00:40.352 --> 00:43.105
I was so scared in the beginning.


00:43.105 --> 00:45.273
It caught me off guard. 


00:45.273 --> 00:46.858
I wasn’t expecting it.


00:46.858 --> 00:50.445
We were quite shocked and sad, 


00:50.445 --> 00:54.198
but we were encouraged by the brothers 


00:54.198 --> 00:56.701
at Bethel and also in the congregation.


00:56.702 --> 00:58.579
The direction from the Governing Body


00:58.578 --> 01:00.956
was that we were being reassigned 


01:00.957 --> 01:02.457
as regular pioneers. 


01:02.457 --> 01:07.295
We signed the forms for pioneering 
that very Thursday.


01:07.295 --> 01:11.633
For me, I’ve always appreciated 
the scripture at 1 Samuel 12:22 


01:11.633 --> 01:13.760
where it states there: 
“For the sake of his great name, 


01:13.760 --> 01:15.887
Jehovah will not abandon his people.”


01:15.887 --> 01:18.724
I don’t want to forget my Bethel time,


01:18.723 --> 01:20.016
because it was lovely, 


01:20.017 --> 01:21.644
but I want to stretch forward ahead 


01:21.643 --> 01:23.228
to pioneering and really enjoy it.


01:23.228 --> 01:26.065
We prayed specifically for a place 


01:26.065 --> 01:28.942
that is going to help us 
to be as simple


01:28.942 --> 01:32.989
as possible so that we can focus 
our attention to the ministry.


01:32.988 --> 01:36.616
All that I’d love to say 
to everyone who has been reassigned 


01:36.617 --> 01:39.287
is that Jehovah is our Father, 


01:39.287 --> 01:42.455
and he will never relinquish 
his responsibility as a Father. 


01:42.455 --> 01:44.542
He will take care of us.


01:44.542 --> 01:46.502
We are losing four couples 


01:46.502 --> 01:48.462
from our congregation. 


01:48.462 --> 01:50.464
And I would like to tell 


01:50.463 --> 01:53.300
the congregations 
where they have been assigned to 


01:53.300 --> 01:55.552
that they are getting 
real spiritual people 


01:55.552 --> 01:58.264
and that they are 
really going to be an asset 


01:58.263 --> 02:00.556
to their congregation.


02:00.557 --> 02:02.559
I just want to also thank 


02:02.558 --> 02:04.978
the brothers in the congregation 
where we are going to 


02:04.978 --> 02:08.065
because they organized 
secular work for us 


02:08.065 --> 02:11.068
and also, as Bonnie mentioned, 
accommodation. 


02:11.068 --> 02:13.320
So they made it easier for us 


02:13.320 --> 02:15.738
to look forward to our assignment. 


02:15.738 --> 02:18.825
But we know this, 
of course, comes from Jehovah.


02:18.825 --> 02:21.120
And so the Branch Committee said, 


02:21.120 --> 02:23.122
“Well, we have to move quickly with this.” 


02:23.122 --> 02:24.205
We asked the family,


02:24.205 --> 02:26.917
“Please, give us two, 
three weeks to work things out,” 


02:26.917 --> 02:29.169
and that is what they appreciated. 


02:29.168 --> 02:31.088
Congregations phoned in. 


02:31.088 --> 02:33.715
The Bethelites were offered jobs. 


02:33.715 --> 02:35.550
They were offered accommodation.


02:35.550 --> 02:37.970
Our congregation is delighted 


02:37.970 --> 02:40.513
having two young Bethelites


02:40.513 --> 02:41.556
coming and joining us. 


02:41.557 --> 02:45.144
Our congregation 
has quite a number of young people. 


02:45.143 --> 02:46.395
We can already see that 


02:46.395 --> 02:48.813
it’s going to benefit them quite a lot. 


02:48.813 --> 02:50.731
We’ve actually assisted them 


02:50.732 --> 02:52.735
in getting a place 
where they could stay, 


02:52.735 --> 02:54.778
and also we’ve assisted them 
to settle in


02:54.778 --> 02:57.280
and be part of the congregation.


02:57.280 --> 02:58.907
Welcome to our new home! 


02:58.907 --> 03:00.825
We’ve been here
a little over a week now.


03:00.825 --> 03:03.245
The brothers helped 
to paint the house, 


03:03.245 --> 03:06.623
to put tiles on, 
to clean the entire place. 


03:06.623 --> 03:09.208
So they really did 
a lot of work in our behalf.


03:09.208 --> 03:11.586
Also, memories 
of our friends from Bethel.


03:11.587 --> 03:13.755
It was about six months ago 


03:13.755 --> 03:15.132
when we enjoyed pioneer school.


03:15.132 --> 03:18.844
Thanks to our brothers, 
we were able to find employment.


03:18.843 --> 03:21.011
Jehovah has been 
answering our prayers,


03:21.012 --> 03:23.432
and sometimes 
he has been answering 


03:23.432 --> 03:26.144
our concerns 
even before we even pray about it.


03:26.143 --> 03:27.643
No doubt, 


03:27.643 --> 03:30.646
these extraordinary experiences 
in South Africa 


03:30.647 --> 03:33.000
are mirrored all over the world. 


03:34.150 --> 03:37.445
The love we show 
to each other is a reflection 


03:37.445 --> 03:40.698
of Jehovah’s great love 
for each of us, 


03:40.698 --> 03:43.618
and we thank him to be a part 


03:43.618 --> 04:00.115
of this amazing brotherhood.

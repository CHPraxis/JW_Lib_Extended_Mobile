00:01 On September 23, 2015,  it was announced
00:05 at all branches that  the Governing Body was requesting
00:09 all Bethel families to reduce in size.
00:13 For me personally,
00:14 when they made that announcement
00:16 on Wednesday, September 23,
00:17 that was exciting.
00:19 It was—
00:20 I knew it was momentous.
00:22 When the announcement was made,
00:24 tears welled up in my eyes
00:25 because I realized how close we are
00:26 to the end.
00:27 And I remember just closing my eyes
00:29 and saying to Jehovah,
00:30 “Whatever you want, we’ll do.”
00:31 When I received news of my reassignment,
00:34 initially I was numb.
00:36 When I got the news
00:38 about my reassignment,
00:40 I was so scared in the beginning.
00:43 It caught me off guard.
00:45 I wasn’t expecting it.
00:46 We were quite shocked and sad,
00:50 but we were encouraged by the brothers
00:54 at Bethel and also in the congregation.
00:56 The direction from the Governing Body
00:58 was that we were being reassigned
01:00 as regular pioneers.
01:02 We signed the forms for pioneering  that very Thursday.
01:07 For me, I’ve always appreciated  the scripture at 1 Samuel 12:22
01:11 where it states there:  “For the sake of his great name,
01:13 Jehovah will not abandon his people.”
01:15 I don’t want to forget my Bethel time,
01:18 because it was lovely,
01:20 but I want to stretch forward ahead
01:21 to pioneering and really enjoy it.
01:23 We prayed specifically for a place
01:26 that is going to help us  to be as simple
01:28 as possible so that we can focus  our attention to the ministry.
01:32 All that I’d love to say  to everyone who has been reassigned
01:36 is that Jehovah is our Father,
01:39 and he will never relinquish  his responsibility as a Father.
01:42 He will take care of us.
01:44 We are losing four couples
01:46 from our congregation.
01:48 And I would like to tell
01:50 the congregations  where they have been assigned to
01:53 that they are getting  real spiritual people
01:55 and that they are  really going to be an asset
01:58 to their congregation.
02:00 I just want to also thank
02:02 the brothers in the congregation  where we are going to
02:04 because they organized  secular work for us
02:08 and also, as Bonnie mentioned,  accommodation.
02:11 So they made it easier for us
02:13 to look forward to our assignment.
02:15 But we know this,  of course, comes from Jehovah.
02:18 And so the Branch Committee said,
02:21 “Well, we have to move quickly with this.”
02:23 We asked the family,
02:24 “Please, give us two,  three weeks to work things out,”
02:26 and that is what they appreciated.
02:29 Congregations phoned in.
02:31 The Bethelites were offered jobs.
02:33 They were offered accommodation.
02:35 Our congregation is delighted
02:37 having two young Bethelites
02:40 coming and joining us.
02:41 Our congregation  has quite a number of young people.
02:45 We can already see that
02:46 it’s going to benefit them quite a lot.
02:48 We’ve actually assisted them
02:50 in getting a place  where they could stay,
02:52 and also we’ve assisted them  to settle in
02:54 and be part of the congregation.
02:57 Welcome to our new home!
02:58 We’ve been here a little over a week now.
03:00 The brothers helped  to paint the house,
03:03 to put tiles on,  to clean the entire place.
03:06 So they really did  a lot of work in our behalf.
03:09 Also, memories  of our friends from Bethel.
03:11 It was about six months ago
03:13 when we enjoyed pioneer school.
03:15 Thanks to our brothers,  we were able to find employment.
03:18 Jehovah has been  answering our prayers,
03:21 and sometimes  he has been answering
03:23 our concerns  even before we even pray about it.
03:26 No doubt,
03:27 these extraordinary experiences  in South Africa
03:30 are mirrored all over the world.
03:34 The love we show  to each other is a reflection
03:37 of Jehovah’s great love  for each of us,
03:40 and we thank him to be a part
03:43 of this amazing brotherhood.

Billions of people

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
have died throughout history.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the death of one person stands alone

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that of Jesus Christ.

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:26.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did he die?

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did his death have a purpose?

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find the answer,

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to go back
to the beginning of human history.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible explains

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God created the man Adam perfect,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
without sin.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was free to eat from all the trees

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the garden of Eden

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:49.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
—except one.

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:51.655 line:10% position:50% align:center
God gave the simple command

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:53.741 line:10% position:50% align:center
not to eat from that particular tree.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
This tree symbolized God’s right

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set the standards of good and bad.

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as Adam
remained obedient to Jehovah,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had the prospect of living forever

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a paradise earth.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Adam did not appreciate

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the good things God had done for him.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chose to disobey God.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.352 line:10% position:50% align:center
As a result,

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:24.188 line:10% position:50% align:center
he lost the opportunity to live forever.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was not the only one affected.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of his descendants

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
have inherited the fatal effects of sin.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
By themselves,

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
humans could not break free
from sin and death.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
They needed someone to rescue them.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason,
Jehovah miraculously caused

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of his perfect spirit sons

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:50.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to earth as a human.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was a perfect man,

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:58.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Adam had been.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, unlike Adam,

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus remained obedient.

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:06.355 line:10% position:50% align:center
This allowed him “to give his life

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.358 line:10% position:50% align:center
as a ransom in exchange for many.”

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how could the death of one man

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit all of mankind?

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, imagine that the manager
of a large factory

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
steals money from the company.

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
His actions plunge the company into debt,

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
forcing it to shut down.

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
The workers lose their jobs

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cannot pay their bills.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:46.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many suffer
because of that one man’s corruption.

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now suppose
a kind and generous man feels sorry

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all those who are suffering.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is moved to pay off the debt
and reopen the company.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
By canceling that one debt,

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:11.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
he brings relief to all the employees

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:13.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their families.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam is like that corrupt manager.

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he rebelled,

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:25.225 line:10% position:50% align:center
he incurred a large debt of sin

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.561 line:10% position:50% align:center
and passed it on to his children.

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.564 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus is like the generous man.

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
When he gave up his perfect human life,

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:36.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
he paid off the debt of sin

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:40.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reopened the prospect of living forever
for each of us.

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may wonder:

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did Jesus really exist?

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is believing in Jesus enough for salvation?

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is Jesus God?’

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90% position:50% align:center

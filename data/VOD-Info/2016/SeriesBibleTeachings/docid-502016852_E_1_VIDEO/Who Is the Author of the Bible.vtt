Who is the Author of the Bible?

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is a collection of 66 small books.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 3,500 years ago,

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses began writing the first of those books.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the next 1,600 years,

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 40 different men

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:31.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrote the remaining books
that make up the Bible.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
If men wrote the text,

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
why is the Bible called “the word of God”?

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this:

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a businessman
wants to send an important message,

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
he might use a secretary
to write a letter or an email.

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
The employer tells his secretary
the thoughts he wants to convey,

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the secretary
compiles those thoughts into the email.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the secretary types the email,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is not the author.

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:07.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a similar way,

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:09.006 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Bible writers expressed

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.341 line:10% position:50% align:center
thoughts and feelings

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
in their own style,

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.678 line:10% position:50% align:center
but the message did not originate with them.

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
So where did it come from?

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says:
“All Scripture is inspired of God.”

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:25.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God used his power
to guide their minds,

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
transmitting his thoughts to them.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.402 line:10% position:50% align:center
How did he do this?

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.072 line:10% position:50% align:center
While the prophet Daniel was asleep,

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:36.075 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah caused him to have dreams.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others, like the prophet Ezekiel,

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:42.748 line:10% position:50% align:center
were awake when God caused them

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:44.959 line:10% position:50% align:center
to see incredible visions.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes, Jehovah used angels

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.839 line:10% position:50% align:center
to communicate his thoughts,

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:53.258 line:10% position:50% align:center
such as when he spoke with the apostle John.

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could Jehovah God
really transmit his message in these ways?

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today,

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
people can communicate their thoughts
over great distances.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can even communicate
with astronauts in outer space.

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
If humans can do this,

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
is it not reasonable to conclude
that their Creator can do far more?

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust the Bible

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it was authored, not by man,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by our loving Creator, Jehovah God.

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may wonder,

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:47.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why read the Bible?

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can you start reading the Bible?

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Has the Bible been changed

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
or tampered with?’

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90% position:50% align:center

With one act of defiance,

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mankind became lost,

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“alienated from the life
that belongs to God.”

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sin and death have become inescapable

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every human born on earth,

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the exception of one—Jesus Christ.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:42.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used his God-given powers
to heal sicknesses,

feed thousands

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he even resurrected people back to life.

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus performed many miracles while on earth.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But are they simply a collection
of stories from the past

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or clues to something far grander

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a glimpse into a wondrous future,

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:26.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a future where God will
“satisfy the desire of every living thing,”

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “real life” that God promises

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to each of his faithful servants?

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can
this beautiful future be possible?

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:37.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of what Jesus did for us.

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came to earth for a purpose.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave his life for those he loved.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The curse of inherited sin and death
could now be lifted

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from each one of us.

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:04.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look intently to Jesus,
we will no longer be lost.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:11.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will show us the way “to the Father.”

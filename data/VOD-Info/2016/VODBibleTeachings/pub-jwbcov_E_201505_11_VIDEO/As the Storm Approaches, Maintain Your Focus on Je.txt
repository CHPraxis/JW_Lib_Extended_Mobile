00:00:06 With one act of defiance,
00:00:10 mankind became lost,
00:00:14 “alienated from the life that belongs to God.”
00:00:20 Sin and death have become inescapable
00:00:23 for every human born on earth,
00:00:30 with the exception of one—Jesus Christ.
00:00:37 He used his God-given powers to heal sicknesses,
00:00:42 feed thousands
00:00:45 —he even resurrected people back to life.
00:00:50 Jesus performed many miracles while on earth.
00:00:54 But are they simply a collection of stories from the past
00:00:59 or clues to something far grander
00:01:03 —a glimpse into a wondrous future,
00:01:21 a future where God will “satisfy the desire of every living thing,”
00:01:30 the “real life” that God promises
00:01:35 to each of his faithful servants?
00:02:26 But how can this beautiful future be possible?
00:02:33 Because of what Jesus did for us.
00:02:38 He came to earth for a purpose.
00:02:48 He gave his life for those he loved.
00:03:17 The curse of inherited sin and death could now be lifted
00:03:22 from each one of us.
00:03:59 If we look intently to Jesus, we will no longer be lost.
00:04:08 He will show us the way “to the Father.”

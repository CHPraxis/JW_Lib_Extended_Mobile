00:00 Brother Erich Frost  was a young man in Germany
00:04 who set a good example  in making wise decisions early in life.
00:09 He was born in 1900,  baptized 23 years later,
00:14 and entered  the full-time ministry in 1928.
00:18 Not long after, he was put in charge  of the underground work
00:21 of the persecuted  Witnesses of Jehovah in Germany,
00:25 caring well for that assignment  for eight months
00:29 until he was incarcerated.
00:31 In this archived audio recording,
00:34 you will hear the fascinating experience  of how Brother Frost
00:38 composed a Kingdom melody  in the middle of Sachsenhausen
00:42 —a Nazi concentration camp.
00:49 I always had the desire  to compose music.
00:57 As everybody knows,  we had the hardest work
00:59 and suffered the hardest  in the concentration camps.
01:03 We were starved,  the labor
01:05 exceeded our strength,  and the harassment was often unbearable.
01:18 So, as usual, I wanted to find  a way to build up the brothers.
01:23 We had such a fine unity  there in the Sachsenhausen camp.
01:29 I felt moved  to compose a song
01:31 that we could sing together  for our mutual encouragement.
01:41 Every morning we marched  to the construction site
01:43 of a sewage plant  in Oranienburg.
01:49 Our labor group  consisted of about 40 brothers
01:52 under the strict watch of the SS.
02:02 While marching,  my mind went back and forth
02:07 and “Bum Bam Badam  Bam Tarambambamba.”
02:13 And gradually,  a melody formed.
02:17 That’s how the music  was developed.
02:19 But how could the verses  enter the camp
02:22 without being able  to write them down?
02:24 I found a few brothers  who helped me.
02:28 I repeated the first verse  to one of them until he knew it by heart,
02:32 either while marching or while driving  the wheelbarrow at work.
02:35 I told the second verse  to another brother,
02:38 still to others the third  and the fourth.
02:43 In the evening, I asked  each of the brothers to recite his verse.
02:47 That’s how the song came to life.
02:50 In the mornings,  when the 40 of us were marching
02:54 through the streets of Oranienburg,  we already felt worn out.
02:58 When one started humming  that melody,
03:01 the entire labor group  trembled with excitement.
03:04 We had to control ourselves  to not break out in loud singing.
03:09 That would have been dangerous,  of course.
03:11 They would have brought us  back to the camp
03:13 and severely punished us.
04:19 As we sat together in the evenings  and someone started humming that melody,
04:23 quite a number of us  sang along, and we rejoiced.
04:28 Our eyes were shining.
04:30 This gave us  new courage and hope.
04:39 We also had evenings of worship.
04:41 Talks were given, and we had copies  of The Watchtower that we studied together.
04:46 So we were able to have  some real times of peace
04:49 and special encouragement  and felt uplifted by that song.
05:49 Brother Frost,  who was one of the anointed,
05:54 finished  his earthly course in 1987.
05:58 After World War II  and nine years of imprisonment,
06:02 he served as the overseer  of our branch office
06:04 in Germany for ten years.
06:06 This was before  the arrangement was instituted
06:09 of having a Branch Committee  oversee the work.
06:13 The very descriptive paintings  that you saw in this segment
06:17 were painted by a brother  who was imprisoned
06:20 in a concentration camp  similar to the one Brother Frost was in.
06:24 And I’m sure  you recognized the song.
06:27 You can find it in our songbook,  though the tune is a little different.
06:32 When Brother Frost found out  that his song had been included in it,
06:36 he was overjoyed  and said, “My clumsy lyrics
06:40 were transformed  into three wonderful verses.”
06:44 If you turn to song 17  in your songbook,
06:47 you’ll find the song  originally composed by Brother Frost
06:51 —“Forward, You Witnesses!”

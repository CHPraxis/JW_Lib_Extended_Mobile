00:00.917 --> 00:04.520
Brother Erich Frost 
was a young man in Germany 


00:04.520 --> 00:09.458
who set a good example 
in making wise decisions early in life. 


00:09.458 --> 00:14.396
He was born in 1900, 
baptized 23 years later, 


00:14.397 --> 00:18.134
and entered 
the full-time ministry in 1928. 


00:18.133 --> 00:21.971
Not long after, he was put in charge 
of the underground work 


00:21.972 --> 00:25.709
of the persecuted 
Witnesses of Jehovah in Germany, 


00:25.708 --> 00:29.245
caring well for that assignment 
for eight months 


00:29.245 --> 00:31.580
until he was incarcerated. 


00:31.580 --> 00:34.417
In this archived audio recording, 


00:34.417 --> 00:38.622
you will hear the fascinating experience 
of how Brother Frost 


00:38.622 --> 00:42.492
composed a Kingdom melody 
in the middle of Sachsenhausen


00:42.492 --> 00:45.000
—a Nazi concentration camp.


00:49.498 --> 00:53.000
I always had the desire 
to compose music.


00:57.140 --> 00:59.175
As everybody knows, 
we had the hardest work 


00:59.175 --> 01:03.045
and suffered the hardest 
in the concentration camps. 


01:03.045 --> 01:05.515
We were starved, 
the labor 


01:05.515 --> 01:10.000
exceeded our strength, 
and the harassment was often unbearable.


01:18.562 --> 01:23.434
So, as usual, I wanted to find 
a way to build up the brothers. 


01:23.433 --> 01:27.000
We had such a fine unity 
there in the Sachsenhausen camp. 


01:29.438 --> 01:31.775
I felt moved 
to compose a song 


01:31.775 --> 01:34.000
that we could sing together 
for our mutual encouragement.


01:41.183 --> 01:43.920
Every morning we marched 
to the construction site 


01:43.920 --> 01:46.000
of a sewage plant 
in Oranienburg. 


01:49.358 --> 01:52.461
Our labor group 
consisted of about 40 brothers


01:52.462 --> 01:55.000
under the strict watch of the SS.


02:02.572 --> 02:07.210
While marching, 
my mind went back and forth 


02:07.210 --> 02:12.000
and “Bum Bam Badam 
Bam Tarambambamba.” 


02:13.048 --> 02:17.053
And gradually, 
a melody formed. 


02:17.053 --> 02:19.588
That’s how the music 
was developed.


02:19.588 --> 02:22.925
But how could the verses 
enter the camp 


02:22.925 --> 02:24.927
without being able 
to write them down? 


02:24.927 --> 02:28.130
I found a few brothers 
who helped me. 


02:28.130 --> 02:32.235
I repeated the first verse 
to one of them until he knew it by heart, 


02:32.235 --> 02:35.705
either while marching or while driving 
the wheelbarrow at work. 


02:35.705 --> 02:38.975
I told the second verse 
to another brother, 


02:38.975 --> 02:43.045
still to others the third 
and the fourth. 


02:43.045 --> 02:47.917
In the evening, I asked 
each of the brothers to recite his verse. 


02:47.917 --> 02:50.920
That’s how the song came to life.


02:50.920 --> 02:54.123
In the mornings, 
when the 40 of us were marching 


02:54.123 --> 02:58.628
through the streets of Oranienburg, 
we already felt worn out. 


02:58.628 --> 03:01.496
When one started humming 
that melody, 


03:01.497 --> 03:04.934
the entire labor group 
trembled with excitement. 


03:04.933 --> 03:09.338
We had to control ourselves 
to not break out in loud singing. 


03:09.338 --> 03:11.640
That would have been dangerous, 
of course. 


03:11.640 --> 03:13.643
They would have brought us 
back to the camp 


03:13.643 --> 03:16.000
and severely punished us.


04:19.142 --> 04:23.847
As we sat together in the evenings 
and someone started humming that melody,


04:23.847 --> 04:28.652
quite a number of us 
sang along, and we rejoiced. 


04:28.652 --> 04:30.854
Our eyes were shining. 


04:30.853 --> 04:34.000
This gave us 
new courage and hope.


04:39.128 --> 04:41.663
We also had evenings of worship. 


04:41.663 --> 04:46.335
Talks were given, and we had copies 
of The Watchtower that we studied together.


04:46.335 --> 04:49.738
So we were able to have 
some real times of peace 


04:49.738 --> 04:54.000
and special encouragement 
and felt uplifted by that song.


05:49.932 --> 05:54.270
Brother Frost, 
who was one of the anointed, 


05:54.270 --> 05:58.073
finished 
his earthly course in 1987. 


05:58.073 --> 06:02.211
After World War II 
and nine years of imprisonment, 


06:02.212 --> 06:04.947
he served as the overseer 
of our branch office 


06:04.947 --> 06:06.949
in Germany for ten years.


06:06.948 --> 06:09.351
This was before 
the arrangement was instituted 


06:09.352 --> 06:12.000
of having a Branch Committee 
oversee the work. 


06:13.923 --> 06:17.560
The very descriptive paintings 
that you saw in this segment 


06:17.560 --> 06:20.095
were painted by a brother 
who was imprisoned 


06:20.095 --> 06:24.767
in a concentration camp 
similar to the one Brother Frost was in. 


06:24.767 --> 06:27.904
And I’m sure 
you recognized the song. 


06:27.903 --> 06:32.308
You can find it in our songbook, 
though the tune is a little different. 


06:32.308 --> 06:36.311
When Brother Frost found out 
that his song had been included in it, 


06:36.312 --> 06:40.182
he was overjoyed 
and said, “My clumsy lyrics 


06:40.182 --> 06:44.387
were transformed 
into three wonderful verses.” 


06:44.387 --> 06:47.657
If you turn to song 17 
in your songbook, 


06:47.657 --> 06:51.494
you’ll find the song 
originally composed by Brother Frost


06:51.493 --> 07:04.625
—“Forward, You Witnesses!”

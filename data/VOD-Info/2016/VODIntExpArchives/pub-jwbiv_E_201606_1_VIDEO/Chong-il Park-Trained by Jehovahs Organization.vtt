00:00.550 --> 00:03.620
When the preaching work 
was getting started 


00:03.620 --> 00:06.022
in such countries 
as South Korea, 


00:06.022 --> 00:10.060
Jehovah often used missionaries 
to help strengthen our brothers. 


00:10.060 --> 00:13.195
In an archived interview, 
Brother Chong-il Park 


00:13.195 --> 00:16.398
describes the effect 
this had on his sacred service 


00:16.398 --> 00:20.000
and how it prepared him 
for the trials he would face.


00:22.972 --> 00:26.109
From 1939 on, 
our brothers 


00:26.108 --> 00:29.778
didn’t have any contact 
with Jehovah’s organization, 


00:29.778 --> 00:34.150
and they thought 
that no organization existed. 


00:34.150 --> 00:36.285
Then, in 1948, 


00:36.285 --> 00:39.388
a brother 
read from a newspaper 


00:39.388 --> 00:42.525
about the activity 
of Watchtower Society. 


00:42.525 --> 00:45.462
And it surprised the brothers. 


00:45.462 --> 00:48.599
So brothers wrote the Society, 
and the Society 


00:48.598 --> 00:52.001
was so happy 
hearing from Korean brothers, 


00:52.002 --> 00:54.070
and they answered 


00:54.070 --> 00:58.542
with many booklets 
in Korean. 


00:58.542 --> 01:01.277
There were 
two different reactions. 


01:01.277 --> 01:04.380
Some brothers was excited 
about preaching work. 


01:04.380 --> 01:07.883
Yet, 
another group questioned: 


01:07.883 --> 01:11.855
“Is that true organization 
of Jehovah?” 


01:11.855 --> 01:15.992
First missionary group
—Brother and Sister Steele—


01:15.992 --> 01:20.530
arrived on August 9, 1949. 


01:20.530 --> 01:22.798
All the questions 
were answered 


01:22.798 --> 01:26.401
by Brother Steele, 
and then 


01:26.402 --> 01:29.405
right away 
brothers were preaching 


01:29.405 --> 01:32.242
in unity.


01:32.242 --> 01:34.677
I began pioneering 


01:34.677 --> 01:38.147
in January 1950. 


01:38.147 --> 01:40.684
And then in March 1950, 


01:40.683 --> 01:44.253
six more missionaries 
arrived from Gilead School. 


01:44.253 --> 01:47.190
We had only one congregation 
in Seoul. 


01:47.190 --> 01:51.527
And the missionaries 
were busy for many Bible studies. 


01:51.527 --> 01:55.965
So many interested persons 
coming to the meetings. 


01:55.965 --> 01:58.367
The public talk was arranged 


01:58.367 --> 02:01.770
in school auditorium
—first time. 


02:01.770 --> 02:05.040
And there were 


02:05.040 --> 02:09.712
over 360 people attended, 


02:09.712 --> 02:14.684
whereas the publishers was 


02:14.683 --> 02:19.621
about 60.


02:19.622 --> 02:22.725
The same day, 
Korean War broke out, 


02:22.725 --> 02:26.662
and the missionaries 
had to leave 


02:26.662 --> 02:29.932
on 27th of June 


02:29.932 --> 02:33.135
to Japan. 


02:33.135 --> 02:37.940
And then our brothers 
had to take refuge 


02:37.940 --> 02:40.910
to southern part 
of Korea. 


02:40.910 --> 02:44.247
I was hiding 
in the country. 


02:44.247 --> 02:46.249
Then few days later, 


02:46.248 --> 02:49.785
the secret police 
from Communist found us. 


02:49.785 --> 02:51.820
We explained to him 


02:51.820 --> 02:55.625
as a Christian 
we cannot participate in the war, 


02:55.625 --> 03:01.000
so we had 
to hide ourselves. 


03:02.332 --> 03:06.735
And then he says: “Well, 
I do not know much about religion, 


03:06.735 --> 03:11.140
“so I better take 
one of my friends 


03:11.140 --> 03:13.175
“who knows about religion. 


03:13.175 --> 03:15.512
“So I will 
come back tomorrow. 


03:15.512 --> 03:18.649
Don’t leave from here.” 


03:18.648 --> 03:22.585
So, then, 
we waited until next day, 


03:22.585 --> 03:24.953
and he came with another. 


03:24.953 --> 03:28.223
So I started preaching 
from the Bible 


03:28.223 --> 03:32.361
about why 
this war broke out 


03:32.362 --> 03:34.364
and the many problems 
in the world 


03:34.363 --> 03:37.633
and so on, 
because the fulfillment 


03:37.633 --> 03:40.670
of Jesus’ prophecy 
in Matthew 24. 


03:40.670 --> 03:42.872
And then they say, 
“Well, thank you very much 


03:42.872 --> 03:45.809
for your preaching.” 


03:45.808 --> 03:47.943
And then say, “Goodbye.” 


03:47.943 --> 03:51.380
Then two days later, 
the latter one came 


03:51.380 --> 03:54.850
with another friend 
so that we could preach to them. 


03:54.850 --> 03:58.320
During three months 
they were staying in Seoul, 


03:58.320 --> 04:02.000
and, in fact, 
they protected us.


04:05.060 --> 04:10.132
I was picked 
by South Korean army 


04:10.132 --> 04:15.237
to serve the back support 


04:15.237 --> 04:19.742
of the military 
in front line to carry arms 


04:19.742 --> 04:21.877
to the soldiers, 


04:21.877 --> 04:25.482
which I could not accept, 


04:25.482 --> 04:29.019
so I refused it. 


04:29.018 --> 04:31.753
And then 


04:31.753 --> 04:36.325
I was beaten.


04:36.325 --> 04:38.460
And then one day 


04:38.460 --> 04:41.563
this company has to move 
to another place. 


04:41.563 --> 04:43.565
I hide myself 


04:43.565 --> 04:46.068
in behind the ceiling 


04:46.068 --> 04:50.038
so that they don’t notice 


04:50.038 --> 04:52.641
when they leave the place. 


04:52.642 --> 04:56.479
And the next morning 
when I came down, 


04:56.478 --> 04:59.281
there was nothing left. 


04:59.282 --> 05:04.287
I walked on one street, 
toward one direction, 


05:04.287 --> 05:08.024
and then I found a sign 


05:08.023 --> 05:11.293
that said 
“International Bible Students Association.” 


05:11.293 --> 05:15.798
So I stayed with the brothers 
for six months.


05:15.798 --> 05:20.403
Brother Steele 
came back from Japan 


05:20.403 --> 05:24.973
by himself to take care 
of the brothers. 


05:24.973 --> 05:28.576
In 1952, Brother Steele 
recommended me 


05:28.577 --> 05:31.380
to Gilead School. 


05:31.380 --> 05:36.385
So that I was invited 
in 22nd class. 


05:36.385 --> 05:40.557
So I took the steps 


05:40.557 --> 05:43.159
to get the passport. 


05:43.158 --> 05:48.196
And then the government find out 
that I didn’t serve in military. 


05:48.197 --> 05:53.202
They gave me draft notice 
instead of passport. 


05:53.202 --> 05:57.740
So I had to stand 
for the neutrality 


05:57.740 --> 06:02.212
instead of going to Gilead School, 
which made me to be confined 


06:02.212 --> 06:05.782
in military prison 
for two years.


06:05.782 --> 06:09.919
Then 1958, I was enrolled 


06:09.918 --> 06:14.590
in Gilead School in 32nd class. 


06:14.590 --> 06:17.127
I really appreciate 


06:17.127 --> 06:20.664
that great Gilead School training. 


06:20.663 --> 06:25.668
Since my job in the branch, 
especially in translation work


06:25.668 --> 06:29.871
—and translation work 
involves much deep knowledge—


06:29.872 --> 06:32.475
the Gilead training 


06:32.475 --> 06:35.745
has certainly helped 
in translation work.


06:35.745 --> 06:38.313
The real appreciation 


06:38.313 --> 06:41.850
about the truth 
and the organization, 


06:41.850 --> 06:46.855
the brothers’ qualities, 
the humbleness and meekness, 


06:46.855 --> 06:50.627
certainly it helped me 


06:50.627 --> 06:52.695
to follow the examples 


06:52.695 --> 06:56.000
to apply 
in the full-time service.


07:01.170 --> 07:04.573
Did you note what Brother Park 
said he appreciated most 


07:04.573 --> 07:08.510
even after enduring persecution 
and prison for his faith? 


07:08.510 --> 07:11.447
It was the Christlike qualities 
of his brothers 


07:11.447 --> 07:15.317
and the training he received 
from Jehovah’s organization


07:15.317 --> 07:19.989
—another example of the benefits 
that result from our meeting together. 


07:19.988 --> 07:23.860
If you’d like to find more ways 
to imitate Brother Park’s faith, 


07:23.860 --> 07:26.595
you can read his life story 
beginning on page 12 


07:26.595 --> 07:41.595
of the December 2008 issue 
of Awake!

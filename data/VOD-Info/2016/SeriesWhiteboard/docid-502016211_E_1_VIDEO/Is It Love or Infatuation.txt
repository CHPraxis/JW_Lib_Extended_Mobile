00:06 Well, it’s finally happened.
00:09 You think you’ve found the person  of your dreams, and now . . .
00:13 You’re hopelessly in love!
00:16 Or are you?
00:20 How can you tell if it’s really love?
00:24 The key is:
00:25 You’ve got to learn  the differences between attraction,
00:30 infatuation,
00:32 and actual love.
00:35 Attraction is based on what you see.
00:38 You know, how a person looks and acts.
00:41 The problem is, what you see
00:45 isn’t always what you get.
00:51 So then,
00:53 what is infatuation?
00:56 Infatuation is not only about what you see;
00:59 it’s about how you feel.
01:01 You may have romantic feelings.
01:04 But those feelings can change . . .
01:06 and fast!
01:09 Infatuation may seem like love.
01:13 But because it’s based only
01:15 on how you feel at the moment, . . .
01:17 it can just fall apart.
01:21 So how do you know if it’s really love?
01:24 One that will last?
01:26 Real love grows
01:28 when two people are kind,
01:30 hard-working,
01:32 and share the same spiritual outlook.
01:34 At 1 Corinthians 13:5,
01:37 the Bible says that real love  ‘doesn’t look for its own interests.’
01:40 For example,  that guy you like so much,
01:45 how does he handle money?
01:47 Does he have to drink alcohol
01:50 to have a good time?
01:52 What are his goals?
01:55 Is he really working toward them?
01:58 Or is he all talk and no action?
02:03 And what about that girl  you just can’t stop thinking about?
02:07 Who are her friends?
02:10 And how does she treat them?
02:17 How does she treat her family?
02:21 There’s a lot to learn about another person.
02:24 It takes time!
02:27 So before you get swept off your feet,
02:31 remember:
02:33 Attraction is based on what you see.
02:35 Infatuation is based on what you feel.
02:39 But real love . . .
02:42 is based on what you know.

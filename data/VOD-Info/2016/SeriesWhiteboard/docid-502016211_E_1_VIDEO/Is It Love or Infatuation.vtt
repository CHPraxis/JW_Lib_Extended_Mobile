00:06.985 --> 00:09.815
Well, it’s finally happened. 


00:09.822 --> 00:13.872
You think you’ve found the person 
of your dreams, and now . . .


00:13.867 --> 00:16.947
You’re hopelessly in love!


00:16.953 --> 00:19.003
Or are you?


00:20.917 --> 00:24.127
How can you tell if it’s really love?


00:24.127 --> 00:25.547
The key is: 


00:25.545 --> 00:28.995
You’ve got to learn 
the differences between attraction,


00:30.175 --> 00:32.965
infatuation,


00:32.970 --> 00:35.510
and actual love.


00:35.513 --> 00:38.023
Attraction is based on what you see.


00:38.017 --> 00:41.647
You know, how a person looks and acts.


00:41.645 --> 00:45.105
The problem is, what you see 


00:45.107 --> 00:47.997
isn’t always what you get.


00:51.322 --> 00:53.322
So then, 


00:53.323 --> 00:55.003
what is infatuation?


00:56.618 --> 00:59.498
Infatuation is not only about what you see; 


00:59.497 --> 01:01.997
it’s about how you feel.


01:01.998 --> 01:04.418
You may have romantic feelings. 


01:04.418 --> 01:06.458
But those feelings can change . . .


01:06.462 --> 01:09.972
and fast!


01:09.965 --> 01:13.005
Infatuation may seem like love. 


01:13.010 --> 01:15.010
But because it’s based only 


01:15.012 --> 01:17.012
on how you feel at the moment, . . .


01:17.013 --> 01:19.003
it can just fall apart.


01:21.227 --> 01:24.307
So how do you know if it’s really love? 


01:24.313 --> 01:26.903
One that will last?


01:26.898 --> 01:28.688
Real love grows 


01:28.692 --> 01:30.742
when two people are kind,


01:30.735 --> 01:32.235
hard-working, 


01:32.237 --> 01:34.737
and share the same spiritual outlook.


01:34.740 --> 01:37.120
At 1 Corinthians 13:5, 


01:37.117 --> 01:40.787
the Bible says that real love 
‘doesn’t look for its own interests.’


01:40.787 --> 01:43.997
For example, 
that guy you like so much, 


01:45.917 --> 01:47.917
how does he handle money?


01:47.920 --> 01:50.090
Does he have to drink alcohol 


01:50.088 --> 01:52.628
to have a good time?


01:52.633 --> 01:55.183
What are his goals?


01:55.177 --> 01:58.347
Is he really working toward them? 


01:58.347 --> 02:01.997
Or is he all talk and no action?


02:03.435 --> 02:07.815
And what about that girl 
you just can’t stop thinking about?


02:07.815 --> 02:10.935
Who are her friends?


02:10.942 --> 02:13.002
And how does she treat them?


02:17.115 --> 02:19.995
How does she treat her family?


02:21.995 --> 02:24.745
There’s a lot to learn about another person. 


02:24.748 --> 02:27.038
It takes time!


02:27.042 --> 02:30.002
So before you get swept off your feet, 


02:31.005 --> 02:33.085
remember:


02:33.090 --> 02:35.510
Attraction is based on what you see.


02:35.508 --> 02:39.258
Infatuation is based on what you feel.


02:39.262 --> 02:42.062
But real love . . .


02:42.057 --> 03:06.807
is based on what you know.

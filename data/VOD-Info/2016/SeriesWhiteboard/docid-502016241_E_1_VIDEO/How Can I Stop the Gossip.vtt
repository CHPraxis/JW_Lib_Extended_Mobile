Psst!
Hey!

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:07.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Check this out!

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gossip.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may seem like nothing
more than harmless talk.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is it?

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:18.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve ever found out
somebody was talking about you

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind your back, then you know

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gossip can hurt!

00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says at Proverbs 12:18

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that words can ‘stab like a sword.’

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:39.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can you make sure
that <i>you </i> aren’t the one doing the stabbing?

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you supposed to stop talking completely?

00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:47.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Philippians 2:4, the Bible says

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:50.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re supposed to be interested
in the lives of others.

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s normal to talk about other people.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that talk can quickly turn ugly

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and damage a person’s good reputation.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can you do <i>before </i> this happens?

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:10.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when comments
about others get sarcastic or negative,

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s a sign the conversation
is going in the wrong direction.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get dragged in!

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Change the subject!

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:21.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to take action—and fast!

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:25.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take responsibility.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:29.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, even if you’re not
the source of a rumor,

00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:32.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
repeating it can make you guilty
of spreading falsehood.

00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:37.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, save yourself a lot of pain

00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by following the Bible’s wise counsel

00:01:40.062 --> 00:01:42.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 4:11:

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mind your own business.”

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you start talking about others,
ask yourself:

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I really know all the facts?

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If what I say gets repeated,

00:01:54.604 --> 00:01:57.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is the other person’s reputation
going to be damaged?

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about my <i>own </i> reputation?’

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, whenever harmful gossip

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
creeps into your conversation, take action!

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:15.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people around you will feel happy
—and so will you!

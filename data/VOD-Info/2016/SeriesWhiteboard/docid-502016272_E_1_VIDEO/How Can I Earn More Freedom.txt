00:03 Do you think it’s about time  you had more freedom?
00:07 You may think you’re ready  to be treated as an adult,
00:10 but do your parents agree?
00:15 Have you proven to them  that you can handle more freedom?
00:32 You see, if you want more freedom,
00:34 you have to gain your parents’ trust.
00:38 Earning their trust takes time.
00:40 But every time  you prove yourself responsible,
00:43 you get one step closer to your goal.
00:46 Some ways you can show   you are trustworthy are:
00:48 diligently completing your chores,
00:50 especially without being reminded;
00:53 managing your time wisely
00:56 and being punctual;
00:59 taking care of your things;
01:02 showing that you can handle  money in a responsible way;
01:08 and following through  on the promises you make.
01:14 Of course, nobody’s perfect.
01:16 So if you make a mistake,  it’s not the end of the world.
01:20 Follow the Bible’s advice  at Hebrews 13:18
01:23 to conduct yourself  “honestly in all things.”
01:26 Tell the truth  and be straightforward.
01:28 If you admit your mistake  and apologize,
01:31 your parents will see  that you are willing
01:33 to take responsibility  for your actions,
01:35 and they’ll appreciate  your honesty.
01:37 But what if you feel  that despite your best efforts,
01:40 your parents still aren’t giving  you enough freedom?
01:43 Don’t just get annoyed
01:45 —talk to them!
01:47 Respectfully ask what they think  you need to do to earn their trust.
01:51 You may be surprised  to learn of some other areas
01:54 where you can show  you’re responsible.
01:59 At 2 Corinthians 13:5,   the Bible says:
02:03 “Keep proving what you . . . are.”
02:06 So you need to build up  a record of consistency.
02:09 That way you’ll prove  you’re worthy of trust.
02:12 Every step you take  brings you closer to your goal.
02:16 Of course, trust is much harder  to gain than it is to lose.
02:21 But the effort is worth it.
02:23 When your parents see you  working hard to earn their trust,
02:26 they will likely be happy  to give you more freedom,
02:29 and you’ll be another step closer  to becoming a responsible adult.

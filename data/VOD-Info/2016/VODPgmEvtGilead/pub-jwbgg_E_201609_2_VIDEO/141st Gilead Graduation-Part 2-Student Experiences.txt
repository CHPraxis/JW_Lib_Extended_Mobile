00:08 We always enjoy this part  at our Gilead graduations
00:12 —the student experiences  that they’ve had
00:15 from the field activity  while they were at school.
00:20 Kenneth Olson, an instructor
00:22 with Theocratic Schools Department,  will handle this part.
00:26 And they have the theme  “The Scene of This World Is Changing.”
00:41 The apostle Paul once wrote  to the congregation in Corinth:
00:45 “The scene of this world is changing.”  (1Co 7:31)
00:49 And in doing so,  he likened the world to a stage
00:52 with actors playing their various roles  until a change of scenes.
00:57 So surrounded  by the potential distractions
01:00 of the world  there in the first century,
01:03 our brothers needed to give  priority to spiritual matters.
01:07 True worship had to come first.
01:11 And an important way they showed  that they kept their spiritual focus
01:15 was through their obedience  to Jesus’ command to preach and teach.
01:20 And they did this in various ways.
01:22 Notice the example of the apostle Paul
01:25 at Acts 17:17.
01:30 There in Acts 17:17, it says:
01:35 “So he began to reason  in the synagogue with the Jews
01:39 “and the other people  who worshipped God
01:41 “and every day  in the marketplace
01:45 with those who happened  to be on hand.”
01:48 So we notice that Paul,  in the marketplace,
01:52 was ready to talk to whoever  happened to be on hand.
01:56 Now, he didn’t know who they would be,  but he was ready.
01:59 So the principles that apply then,
02:02 apply now  because many of the concerns
02:04 that people had back then,  people have now.
02:07 And so our work is  like it was in the first century.
02:12 Now, as Brother and Sister Cook  were traveling to Gilead School,
02:17 they, like Paul, were ready.
02:19 They were alert to speak with those  who happened to be on hand.
02:24 This time, it was not in the marketplace;  it was at a train station.
02:28 And notice how they were ready  to discuss various topics
02:32 as we watch this video reenactment.
02:37 Thank you so much, Manny,  for helping us with the bags.
02:39 We really appreciate that.
02:41 Well, you certainly have a lot of bags.
02:43 Where are you going?
02:44 We are going to Patterson, New York,
02:46 to attend a Bible school  for the next six months.
02:49 Really?  A six-month Bible school?
02:51 Wow, that is amazing!
02:53 Yeah, we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, Manny.
02:55 I’m sure you’ve heard about us.
02:56 There’s our little card.
02:58 Yeah, I have seen Jehovah’s Witnesses  going from door to door.
03:01 You even go out when  the weather is really cold.
03:04 I have a lot of respect for you people.
03:06 Oh, thank you.
03:08 Well, we love sharing  the Bible message with people.
03:11 Here, Manny, on the back of this tract,  there’s a QR Code
03:14 and it takes you  to our website, jw.org.
03:17 So on there, there are publications  you can download and read,
03:20 but also there’s a section that answers  questions you might have about the Bible.
03:24 Hmm, that’s good.  I have some questions.
03:27 In fact,  my mother died last year.
03:32 She suffered for such a long time.
03:35 Oh, sorry.
03:35 So sorry to hear that.
03:37 We’re very sorry.
03:38 Losing someone  dear must be so difficult.
03:42 Yeah, well,  it kind of affected my faith.
03:44 You know,  she was a wonderful person.
03:47 Why did she have  to suffer like that?
03:49 I can understand you  feeling that way, Manny.
03:52 When you’ve lived a life like your mom,  and she’s been such a good person,
03:57 and then she suffers like that, I mean, it’s— it’s difficult to bear, isn’t it?
04:01 It’s difficult to bear.
04:02 This tract, it’s asking the question:  “Will Suffering Ever End?”
04:06 Do you think that’s the sort of question  you’re really asking?
04:09 Yes, it is.
04:10 Well, thank you.  Thank you very much.
04:12 You know, I can stay with you  until your friend comes for you. That’s OK?
04:16 Oh, will you?
04:16 Oh, thank you!
04:17 Thank you!
04:18 Thank you very much!
04:18 I’ve been thinking about this.
04:20 You know,  the whole world is a mess.
04:23 We agree with you.
04:25 But why is it a mess?
04:27 I can show you another tract.
04:29 It does have an interesting question.
04:31 It says,  “Who Really Controls the World?”
04:34 And you will be surprised  to know the answer.
04:37 Notice what the Bible says:
04:39 “The Evil One controls the whole world.”
04:44 So did you notice who is in control?
04:46 What does the Bible say?
04:48 Hmm. It says the Evil One —means the Devil?
04:50 That’s right.
04:51 Well, that explains why  the world is in such a bad condition.
04:54 Uh-huh.
04:55 And you know, Manny,  the Bible says that God has set up a kingdom
05:00 that is going to overrule the Devil,
05:02 and also He is going to bring  the suffering to an end.
05:05 Oh, may I have that tract as well?
05:07 Of course, yeah, this is for you.
05:09 I just wanted to point  on the back again in this tract
05:12 is our website  that Richard just mentioned.
05:14 If you would like,  you can go there,
05:16 and you can ask for somebody  to come and visit you,
05:19 and you can discuss  all the questions you have,
05:21 and they will answer you  from the Bible.
05:24 Oh, well, thank you very much.  Thank you.
05:26 You are welcome.
05:27 Excuse me,  Brother and Sister Cook?
05:28 Oh, this is our driver!
05:29 Yes, pleased to meet you!
05:30 Nice to meet you.
05:31 Thank you for collecting us.
05:32 Here are their bags. Thank you.
05:33 Thank you.
05:34 Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.
05:35 Thank you.
05:36 Thank you, Manny.  We really appreciate all your help.
05:37 Thank you for your help.
05:38 Bye-bye.
05:39 Goodbye.
05:39 Take care.
05:40 So, hope you had  a good trip coming here.
05:41 Yeah, it was really good.
05:46 So, did you see how  Brother and Sister Cook were prepared?
05:50 They had literature ready.
05:52 They didn’t know who it would be  or what the topic would be,
05:54 but they were ready.
05:56 Another way that our first-century brothers  and sisters obeyed Jesus’ command
06:01 is found at Acts 5:42.
06:05 At Acts 5:42,
06:10 it says there:
06:13 “And every day in the temple  and from house to house
06:16 “they continued without letup
06:19 “teaching and declaring the good news
06:21 about the Christ, Jesus.”
06:24 So it says they went  “from house to house.”
06:27 Now, this was shortly  after Pentecost of 33 C.E.,
06:31 and already the young congregation  is active in the door-to-door ministry,
06:35 talking to people face-to-face.
06:38 And this work is still at the center —it’s at the forefront—
06:41 of our worldwide preaching effort.
06:44 So contacting people directly
06:46 helps us to help them individually.
06:49 Now, in the first century,  Jesus helped people face-to-face,
06:53 very often with the resurrection hope.
06:55 He built them up;  he gave them hope.
06:57 Now we do the same.
06:59 However, very often,  when we talk to people from house to house,
07:03 we’re there,  we have a scripture, we’re prepared,
07:05 we have a topic  we want to talk about.
07:07 And all of a sudden,  the householder wants
07:09 to talk about what’s  on their mind and heart.
07:12 Essentially, they change the subject.
07:14 So, what do we do?
07:16 Well, an alert teacher will follow
07:19 the concern of the householder  and address that concern.
07:23 So watch how Brother Mbanzulu
07:26 followed the householder’s concern
07:28 and comforted him  with the resurrection hope
07:31 when he was invited into a man’s home  for the very first time.
07:34 And see how he changed the subject,  and Brother Mbanzulu followed it.
07:40 Thank you for inviting us in.
07:42 You’re welcome.
07:44 How would you describe  the situation in the world today?
07:47 I lost my wife a few years ago,
07:51 and life is not easy.
07:54 We are so sorry to hear  that you lost your wife.
07:57 That must be difficult to deal with.
08:00 It is difficult.
08:02 But I know you’re going to say  that I should be—
08:06 there’s the hope of the resurrection
08:08 and that with a little bit of money,  I’ll be able to see my wife again.
08:11 But I don’t know if I believe that.
08:15 Did someone say to you  that you need to pay something
08:18 like money to see your wife again?
08:20 Yes, that’s what the church said.
08:23 Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that.
08:25 But really, do you believe  that God needs our money?
08:29 Of course not!
08:31 But I don’t believe  that the resurrection is true.
08:35 What is your point of view?
08:37 Where do we come from?
08:39 I guess, of course,
08:41 there had to be  some person that made us.
08:45 Life just couldn’t come about by itself.
08:48 So I would say that person is God.
08:51 So let me give you an example.
08:54 Suppose that you own  a company that makes cars.
08:58 Let’s say you make Mercedes-Benz,
09:02 and you decide to give  a new one to your friend.
09:05 He’s very happy.
09:07 But the very first day  he drives that car, he has a crash.
09:11 Then he calls you;  he’s sad; he says,
09:14 “You know, I just had a crash.”
09:17 What will you say?
09:19 Just bring it back.  I’ll fix it.
09:23 But what if he said to you:
09:25 “Friend, I’m not sure you will fix it.
09:28 It’s totally broken.”
09:30 What will you say to him?
09:32 If I made it, I can fix it.
09:35 I could even make a new one.
09:37 You know, when something  does not work properly in our body,
09:41 or let’s say,  when our body stops working,
09:44 we call it death.
09:46 But actually,  from the point of view
09:49 of the One who created life,  we can say this is just like a crash.
09:53 Would you agree with that?
09:54 Yeah, I would agree with that.
09:57 And when this happens,  usually we are very sad
10:00 because that person that died
10:02 may be someone we really loved.
10:05 But could the One who created life
10:09 be able to fix the problem
10:11 or recreate that person?
10:14 Yeah, He should be able to do that.
10:17 But you know, we three here,
10:19 we’ve never seen someone  raised from the dead.
10:23 So talking about the resurrection
10:26 must be something strange to us.
10:29 And God understands that.
10:31 But you know what Jesus said  in the past when he was here on earth?
10:36 He said something very interesting,  and I would like to share it with you.
10:39 It’s found in the book of John,
10:42 chapter 5, verses 28 and 29.
10:47 And while Sulamite  is reading that scripture,
10:49 please try to imagine that God  is speaking to you personally.
10:53 Please Sula, can you read it?
10:55 Uh-huh.
10:56 John 5:28,29:
10:59 “Do not be amazed at this,
11:01 “for the hour is coming in which  all those in the memorial tombs
11:06 “will hear his voice and come out,
11:08 “those who did good things  to a resurrection of life,
11:12 and those who practiced vile things  to a resurrection of judgment.”
11:17 God knows that may look  impossible to you,
11:20 but he assures us  that this will take place.
11:24 It’s clear now.
11:25 You know, there are  many other good promises
11:28 in the Bible  from God for humankind.
11:30 And if you want,  we can help you to know them.
11:33 Yeah, I would like that.
11:46 Did you see  how Brother Mbanzulu was willing
11:48 to drop the topic  he wanted to talk about
11:51 and follow the concern  of the man instead?
11:54 Very loving and very alert.
11:56 Now, in the first century,
11:58 there were many different ideas  and philosophies of life.
12:01 Pontius Pilate expressed one  when he said to Jesus:
12:04 “What is truth?”
12:06 And he said that rather scornfully.
12:08 But today some feel unsure
12:11 if it’s possible to know truth.
12:13 Well, our first-century brothers
12:15 would often find  common ground with someone,
12:18 to reason with them  and help them see the point.
12:20 And we do the same today.
12:22 Watch how Sister Martinez  found common ground
12:26 to reason with a man  who seemed unsure
12:29 if it were possible to know truth.
12:35 Good morning, Sir.
12:37 Good morning.
12:38 I’m glad to find you here,
12:39 and we’re asking people  in the area a question,
12:42 and I’d like your opinion.
12:43 OK, sure.
12:45 Do you think  that it’s actually possible
12:47 for us to get to know  what the truth is,
12:50 living in a world  where more half-truths exist?
12:53 No, I don’t think so.  Nobody has the truth.
12:56 I’m sure you have  your own religion and, in fact,
12:58 your own translation of the Bible.
13:00 And everyone’s entitled
13:02 to believe what they  want to believe.
13:05 Yeah,  we all have the right to believe
13:07 in what we want to believe in.
13:09 But do you think that God
13:11 wants us to get to know  what the truth is?
13:14 Hmm, yeah, sure.
13:15 You know,  I noticed that you have an accent.
13:17 If you don’t mind me asking,  where are you from?
13:19 Oh, I don’t mind.  I’m from Ecuador.
13:21 Oh!  Wow!
13:22 You know,  I’ve been living in South America
13:24 for the past few years with my husband.
13:26 Oh, really?  What country?
13:28 In Paraguay.
13:29 Oh, yeah.  OK, I know Paraguay. Nice.
13:31 Yeah, you know,  they speak Spanish there also,
13:34 and they have  a little bit of an accent.
13:36 Uh-huh.
13:37 They also use certain expressions
13:39 that are unfamiliar to me.
13:41 But, generally,  I can understand what they’re saying.
13:44 True, it is slightly different.  Mhm.
13:46 This reminds me  of when we study the Bible.
13:50 For example,  the translation that we use,
13:53 they’re in many languages.
13:55 The Bible that we have in Spanish
13:57 wasn’t originally in Spanish.
13:59 It’s a translation.
14:00 Uh-huh.  Right.
14:01 And although one Bible  may differ slightly from another,
14:06 even within the same language,
14:08 they generally convey the same idea.
14:11 Hmm.  Yeah, that makes sense. Sure.
14:13 Now, do you think that God is aware
14:15 of these apparent difficulties that exist?
14:18 Hmm. Good question.  Yeah, I think so.
14:21 Yeah, he definitely has to know.
14:24 And, you know,  he actually encourages us
14:27 through the Bible  to get to know what these truths are.
14:30 Hmm.
14:31 These truths are revealed clearly here
14:34 in this Bible text
14:36 at 1 Timothy 2:3,4  that I’d like to read to you.
14:40 It says:  “This is fine and acceptable
14:43 “in the sight of our Savior, God,
14:46 “whose will is that all sorts of people  should be saved and,”
14:50 notice this part,
14:52 “come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”
14:55 Hmm.  OK.
14:57 Not half-truths.
14:58 Right.
14:58 So God is really concerned about us
15:01 coming to an accurate knowledge of truth.
15:04 Now,  do you think that this is possible
15:07 if we dedicate time
15:10 researching the Bible  on a superficial level?
15:12 No, I don’t think so.
15:13 You can’t come  to accurate knowledge like that.
15:16 It’s impossible.
15:17 Yeah, I think the same way.
15:19 It really means  that we have to investigate
15:22 in what God is trying to tell us  in such a large book.
15:26 Hmm.
15:26 You know,  I have this book with me
15:29 that has this very interesting theme
15:32 “What Does the Bible Really Teach?”
15:34 Hmm.  Sounds interesting.
15:35 And it reveals  what those Bible truths are.
15:38 I would like  to get this available to you.
15:41 I only have it in English.
15:42 OK.
15:43 How can I do this?
15:44 Well, I have to leave now.
15:46 I have to go to work,  but I’ll give you my contact information,
15:49 and then we can make arrangements.
15:51 Oh, that sounds great.
15:52 Yeah.
15:53 OK.
16:05 No doubt you saw how  Sister Martinez was able to use
16:08 things that they had in common
16:10 to help the man reason about the point.
16:13 Now, we’ve seen so far,  students preaching in the train station,
16:18 peoples’ homes, a parking lot.
16:20 Well, really,  Jesus set the example
16:23 about reaching people  wherever they may be.
16:26 Notice in Matthew 9:9,
16:30 there in Matthew 9:9,
16:34 it says there:
16:36 “Next, while moving on from there,
16:39 “Jesus caught sight  of a man named Matthew
16:42 “sitting at the tax office,
16:44 “and he said to him:  ‘Be my follower.’
16:47 At that he rose up  and followed him.”
16:49 So Matthew  was sitting at the tax office.
16:53 He was in his place of employment.
16:55 So Jesus preached in business territory.
16:59 Well, we do the same thing today.
17:01 We preach in business territory.
17:03 We try to reach people where they are.
17:05 Now, back in the first century,
17:06 we know the main theme was the Kingdom.
17:09 This was the theme of the preaching work.
17:11 This is still the case today.
17:13 This is the theme of the preaching work.
17:15 In our last reenactment,  it takes place in a beauty salon.
17:19 Our sister is coming back  to the woman’s place of business
17:23 in order to cultivate the interest  shown in the very first conversation,
17:27 and notice how she  directs attention to the Kingdom.
17:33 Hi, Deanne!
17:34 Hi!
17:34 It’s so nice to see you again.
17:36 Today I brought a video to show you.
17:38 It’s called Does God Have a Name?
17:43 Does God have a name?
17:46 . . . at a time and place  convenient for you.
17:54 So as you saw in the video,
17:56 we all have names  to identify ourselves.
17:58 Your name is Deanne,  and my name is Claire.
18:01 So wouldn’t it make sense for God  to have a name to identify himself with?
18:05 Sure, that makes perfect sense.
18:07 And did you know that the name Jehovah  is in the Bible about 7,000 times?
18:12 Wow!
18:13 If it’s in there that much,  it must be important.
18:15 You know, Claire,  I do read the Bible every day.
18:18 And I’ve been trying  to get closer to God,
18:21 but it’s not easy.
18:23 You know,  I’m so busy running the business
18:25 and looking after my children.
18:27 And that’s another thing,  I’m constantly worried about my children.
18:30 The world is just getting so bad.
18:32 I wonder about their future.
18:34 Yeah, I can imagine that it’s not easy.
18:36 But it’s good  that you’re looking to the Bible.
18:38 In fact, today I wanted  to show you a verse
18:40 from Daniel 2:44,
18:43 it says:
18:45 “In the days of those kings  the God of heaven
18:47 “will set up a kingdom  that will never be destroyed.
18:50 “And this kingdom  will not be passed on to any other people.
18:54 “It will crush and put an end  to all these kingdoms,
18:58 and it alone will stand forever.”
19:00 Perhaps you’ve heard of people  pray the Our Father,
19:03 and they’re asking  for God’s Kingdom to come.
19:05 They want to see God’s will done
19:07 on the earth as it was in heaven.
19:09 And really, that’s what  this Kingdom is talking about.
19:12 It’s God’s government to bring  an end to suffering in the world.
19:15 I would really like to see that change.
19:18 Yeah, we all want to see  an end to suffering.
19:20 But what do you think?
19:22 Do you think God really has the power  to bring about these changes?
19:26 Of course!  I think he has all the power.
19:29 Yeah, that’s right, he does.
19:31 And, you know, he also wants
19:33 to see an end to this suffering.
19:35 In fact,  that’s why it’s so important for us
19:37 to try and learn as much as we can  about his purpose for the earth.
19:41 I would like to learn more about God
19:43 and what he’s going to do for the future.
19:46 Yeah, that’s so good.
19:47 I really enjoy speaking  to you about this.
19:50 I was thinking, do you usually work here  on Saturday mornings?
19:54 I do.  I work here just about every Saturday.
19:56 So if you come, we can sit down  for a few minutes and talk.
19:58 Oh, I would really appreciate  if we can have a little bit
20:01 of time together  to talk about that subject.
20:03 Sure.
20:04 Thank you so much.  It was nice to see you today.
20:06 You too.
20:07 Bye-bye.
20:08 Bye-bye.
20:13 Our Gilead students  have been doing a very good job
20:19 directing people to the Kingdom
20:21 as the only true hope for mankind.
20:24 Now, in the first century,
20:27 our brothers and sisters faced
20:29 many of the challenges  that are common today.
20:32 How should they  view higher education,
20:34 how to keep focused  on spiritual goals,
20:37 how to avoid the dangers  of bad association?
20:41 Well, our Gilead students have faced  these very issues successfully.
20:45 And the decisions  that they’ve made in the past
20:48 have helped them be here today.
20:50 Now notice how our students  met the various challenges posed
20:53 by what to do  with higher education,
20:56 potential distractions  from their spiritual goals,
20:58 and avoiding bad associations.
21:00 Would you like to meet  some of our Gilead students
21:03 and get to know them  just a little bit better?
21:24 Well, we have with us  Brother and Sister Mbanzulu,
21:28 Fall and Sulamite Mbanzulu,  from Congo Kinshasa.
21:31 We have Brother Elipaz  and Nancy Rosenzvig, from Israel,
21:36 and Sister Turkijana Gasi,  from Serbia.
21:40 And we’re glad to have  all of you with us.
21:42 Brother Mbanzulu,  let’s start with you.
21:45 What spiritual goal did you set  for yourself as you were growing up?
21:51 I wanted to be a special pioneer.
21:53 Well, that’s an excellent spiritual goal  for a young man.
21:57 Now as that—  Once you set that goal, however,
22:00 a potential obstacle arose.
22:03 Yes, this happened  when I was 14 years old.
22:07 My father said to me that he  would support me financially
22:10 and even pay for my education
22:12 if I would like to be  a lawyer or a physician.
22:18 So he offered you  free higher education.
22:20 Yeah.
22:21 But you had  this other spiritual goal in mind.
22:23 Yeah.
22:24 What did you do?
22:26 I kindly explained to him  that I had the goal to be
22:28 a special pioneer,  so I declined his offer.
22:33 Well, that sounds like a good thing.
22:35 You kept your focus on spiritual matters.
22:38 What did your father think about that?
22:40 He was very disappointed
22:42 because he didn’t expect that answer.
22:45 He said to me  if I did not take his offer,
22:49 I will have to support myself.
22:51 And if, in the future,  I have to face some difficulties,
22:54 I should not go back to him.
22:56 And he even mentioned  that I was no longer his son,
23:01 and that hurt me deeply.
23:03 But I’m happy  that I made that decision,
23:06 because otherwise  I would not have benefited
23:09 from the highest education
23:11 —the divine education  that I’ve enjoyed in Gilead.
23:13 Well, we know  that was not an easy situation
23:15 to face as a young man
23:18 —quite a lot of faith and spiritual focus—
23:20 and we’re glad that you did that.
23:22 So you went ahead with your goal  to special pioneer.
23:24 So when did you  become a special pioneer?
23:26 I never did.
23:27 What happened?
23:30 I was invited to serve in Bethel,  and I accepted that invitation.
23:33 Well, we know  that Jehovah’s blessed you there too.
23:36 Yeah, I received  many blessings in Bethel,
23:39 and one of them,  actually, is my marriage
23:42 with Sulamite.
23:44 It’s really a gift  coming from Jehovah.
23:47 And Sulamite loves Jehovah  and supports me in my service.
23:51 Yes.
23:52 Well, Sister Mbanzulu,  now, your father was Muslim.
23:56 Yes.
23:56 And what did he think  about the family being Jehovah’s Witnesses?
24:00 My father never opposed the truth.
24:02 He saw that this was good  and even encouraged us.
24:05 All right.  So that allowed you to set spiritual goals.
24:07 Yes.
24:08 What spiritual goal  did you set for yourself?
24:10 I wanted to be a special pioneer.
24:12 That’s an excellent spiritual goal!
24:15 And what did your family  think about that goal?
24:18 My immediate family was supportive.
24:20 But others in the family  pressured me to pursue
24:23 higher education and travel to Europe.
24:26 That could have been a temptation,  but it was a trap.
24:29 Spiritual education is far more valuable.
24:33 I’m glad I made a good decision —the right choice.
24:37 Well, so we’re glad too.
24:38 So both of you  had to stay spiritually focused there.
24:41 So you went ahead with your goal  of being a special pioneer.
24:44 When did you become a special pioneer?
24:46 I didn’t become a special pioneer.
24:49 I was invited to serve  at Bethel for two weeks,
24:52 and then I was invited  to stay in Bethel service.
24:56 Well, that’s good.
24:57 You both remained focused on spiritual goals
24:59 but flexible to Jehovah’s direction,
25:01 and we’re glad that you did.
25:03 Brother Rosenzvig,
25:06 now, you come  from a very spiritually active family.
25:09 What did your parents do to raise you
25:12 in such a fine spiritual environment?
25:14 It’s true,  today when I’m looking back,
25:17 I see that my parents did so much.
25:20 In addition to our family study,
25:23 my parents studied  with all five of us separately.
25:27 They went with us to service;
25:30 we read together the daily text.
25:32 And also my father,
25:34 he prayed with each one of us every night.
25:39 So, what influence did all that  have on your spiritual routine?
25:43 So I still pray every night with my wife.
25:46 And recently,  I asked my brothers and sisters
25:49 if they have the same habit until today.
25:52 And all of them said, “Yes.”
25:54 So all of us pray every night  like we did with our father.
25:58 Excellent.
26:00 Well, I know that you  met a spiritually-minded sister
26:02 in your congregation;  you got married.
26:05 And then what did you do  to make yourself more available
26:08 to pursue spiritual goals?
26:10 So we began to simplify our life,
26:13 we avoided financial obligation,
26:16 and we expanded our ministry.
26:19 After a while,  we were invited to Bethel.
26:22 Well, that’s excellent —wonderful invitation.
26:24 I’m sure you were very excited.
26:25 Now, when that happened, though,
26:27 a potential distraction arose.
26:31 Yeah, my employer,  he really wanted me to stay.
26:33 So he offered me a big raise,
26:36 stock in the company, a car.
26:38 But the real riches are found  in the full-time service.
26:42 And look!
26:43 Here we are, getting the divine education  that Jehovah provides.
26:47 Yeah, very true.
26:48 Now Sister Rosenzvig,  so when your husband received
26:52 the invitation to Bethel,  obviously it’s to you too,
26:55 and you also had some potential distractions  come at the same time.
26:59 True.
27:00 The same week  we were invited to Bethel,
27:03 I got a phone call from a company  that offered me a well-paying job.
27:07 And just before that,  I had said no to a full scholarship
27:10 to pursue more education.
27:12 And both of us got  so many offers during that time,
27:15 it was very clear somebody  was not happy about our decision.
27:18 Yes.
27:19 Now your first name,
27:22 Sister Rosenzvig,  doesn’t sound very Israeli.
27:25 How did you come to be called Nancy?
27:29 So my father  is from an Arabic background
27:32 and my mom  from a Jewish background.
27:34 As you know, in Israel,  it’s not so common
27:36 for a Jew to marry an Arab.
27:38 But this is what’s so beautiful  about our organization.
27:41 And the brothers and sisters in Israel
27:43 really give a good witness in this regard.
27:45 But still my parents decided  to make both sides
27:48 of the family happy  and gave me an American name.
27:51 That’s very diplomatic of them.
27:54 And how did your parents help you
27:56 to have a spiritual environment
27:58 in which you could set  good spiritual goals?
28:01 Both of my parents are  really good students of the Bible.
28:04 And I would always see them  prepare for the meeting,
28:07 and we would never miss a meeting  without a good reason.
28:09 Additionally, my mom,
28:11 before she got married,  she was a special pioneer.
28:14 Both her and my dad,  they loved talking about Jehovah
28:16 and going out in the ministry.
28:18 I know that your mother  also made considerable effort
28:21 to cultivate your love for the ministry.
28:24 Yes.
28:24 There is one experience I really remember.
28:27 I was very young.
28:28 She took me to preach  in unassigned territory
28:30 in a city near Mount Hermon,  and we preached for some hours.
28:34 And after that,  she took me to eat my favorite food
28:37 —hummus and french fries.
28:39 Ah, and how has their example  influenced you until today?
28:44 Until today, I have good study habits,
28:47 I have deep appreciation for our meetings,
28:49 and I love talking about Jehovah.
28:51 And I still like hummus and french fries.
28:55 Now, when you were in school,
28:57 you were different  from all of the other children.
28:59 All of the other children were Jewish.
29:01 And we know that as a young person,  it can be especially difficult
29:05 to be different from everyone else.
29:07 How did you handle that?
29:09 For a while, I found it difficult  to speak about my religion at school,
29:13 but then I thought to myself,  ‘I need to be proud
29:15 that I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.’
29:17 So I just decided to speak  with one of my classmates.
29:20 And when I told her, she said,
29:21 “Oh, now I understand  why you are so different.”
29:24 And the conversation went so well.
29:26 I felt relief, and things were  much easier at school after that.
29:31 So, what advice would you have  for young people who are in school today?
29:35 I would say: “Just be proud that you  are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
29:39 “We are serving the best God,
29:41 “and tell your classmates  about it as soon as possible.
29:44 “That will make you happy,  and more important,
29:46 it will make Jehovah happy,  and he will bless your efforts.”
29:49 Yes.
29:50 Sister Gasi.
29:52 Sister Gasi, you serve in Serbia,
29:55 you live there,  but you didn’t grow up there.
29:58 No, I was born in Kosovo.
30:00 I grew up in the Roma culture  with the Muslim background.
30:03 All right.
30:04 I know that your father  is fairly well-known in the Roma community,
30:08 and there are some deeply held traditions
30:11 that had an impact on you  concerning your schooling.
30:15 Yeah, culturally  among the Roma people it was expected
30:18 that the oldest girl stop going  to school when she is quite young.
30:22 So my father wanted me  to stop going to school.
30:26 And honestly, I was very unhappy  because of that
30:29 because I really loved going to school.
30:31 So I explained— I told my father
30:34 that I will respect his decision,
30:37 but also I took the opportunity  to explain to him
30:40 that I wanted to pioneer.
30:42 I explained to him what it means,  and he agreed.
30:45 Well, that was very good.
30:46 So you respected your father’s wishes
30:48 but also clearly set out  your spiritual goals.
30:53 We’re glad he supported you in that.
30:55 But now that you’re out  preaching in the town
30:57 that must have called attention.
31:00 Yes. A neighbor approached  my father about it,
31:03 and he said: “You’re Muslim.
31:05 Why do you allow your daughter  to go house to house?”
31:08 And my father told him
31:10 he never had a problem with his girls
31:13 since they started to study the Bible.
31:16 Well, your good conduct spoke out there.
31:18 Now, we know that, unfortunately,  war broke out in the region
31:22 and Kosovo was affected.
31:25 And at that time,  there were no brothers in the area,
31:27 there was no congregation, no meetings.
31:29 And even your father and brothers
31:32 were not there at that time,
31:34 leaving you,  your sister, and your mother
31:37 to rely on Jehovah there.
31:39 And we know Jehovah can do that,  but that can be very stressful.
31:42 But there was  an additional situation that arose.
31:45 Tell us about that.
31:47 Our neighbor  had a basement in his house,
31:50 and many of us —where our area was bombed—
31:53 many of us took shelter there.
31:55 Physically it was safe,
31:57 but people talked  about how we were going to die
32:00 and about the horrible things  that could happen to us,
32:05 and it was very discouraging  to listen to that.
32:08 I realized that it was bad association.
32:11 I had to make a change  to keep spiritually alive.
32:14 All right.
32:16 So you had the basement  which served as a bomb shelter
32:18 giving physical security,  but it came with bad association.
32:22 So you said you had to make a change.
32:24 What did you do?
32:25 We stayed home,
32:27 we read the experiences  from the yearbook,
32:30 we held the meetings in our kitchen,
32:33 and also we read
32:36 and studied the Bible,  we prayed together.
32:38 This built up our faith,  and Jehovah helped us to endure.
32:42 And what has been the result?
32:44 Jehovah has given me  the best school here at Gilead
32:48 and also the best association  with my fellow classmates.
32:52 Well, we thank all of you for sharing  some of your experiences involving decisions
32:56 that helped you be here today  with Jehovah’s blessing.
33:00 Well, the scene of the world is changing,
33:03 but our faithfulness to Jehovah  remains steadfast.
33:07 May Jehovah continue to bless the students
33:10 of the 141st class of Gilead
33:12 and the entire worldwide brotherhood
33:15 as we work shoulder to shoulder  to Jehovah’s praise.
33:35 Thank you very much.
33:36 We always enjoy  the experiences in the field
33:40 as well as their personal experiences.
33:42 Next, Brother Ronald Curzan,  a helper to the Teaching Committee,
33:47 is going to interview  others from the class.
33:50 And the question in his theme  is “How Will You Use Your Gift?”
33:57 We all love gifts.
33:59 We love to receive gifts,  and we like to give gifts.
34:03 And where do we get that from?
34:05 The originator of gift-giving,  Jehovah God.
34:08 He loves to give  ‘good gifts and perfect presents.’
34:12 And of Jehovah’s gifts,  Insight on the Scriptures says
34:16 that ‘Assignments of service  in God’s organization
34:20 ‘are really gifts from Jehovah.
34:23 ‘Those favored with assignments of service  by God’s undeserved kindness
34:27 are also called “gifts in men”’.
34:30 And we can say gifts in women.
34:32 And what do they do with this gift?
34:35 ‘They’re given to the congregation  in order that its members individually
34:40 might be built up  and attain maturity.’
34:44 Gilead School is a precious gift from Jehovah
34:48 that has enabled 141 classes to do just that
34:52 —build up their brothers and their sisters.
34:56 The question is,  How will the 141st class use this gift?
35:01 Let’s find out.
35:03 We have four students  that we would like to interview
35:06 —two single students  and a married couple.
35:08 First of all, we have Anita Schumi,  who is originally from Austria.
35:13 We have Ben Pritchard,  from Britain,
35:15 and a married couple  from the United States,
35:18 Niell and Deanne Ryan.
35:22 In preparing for this interview,  it was very heartwarming to learn
35:25 that all four of you received  a precious gift from Jehovah
35:29 and that is being raised  in the truth by God-fearing parents
35:34 who instilled a love  for Jehovah in your hearts
35:37 as well as the pioneer spirit.
35:40 So eventually all four of you pioneered.
35:43 But here’s a question.
35:44 We’ll start out with Anita.
35:46 What other gifts of service  did you receive from Jehovah
35:49 before coming to Gilead?
35:52 After my schooling,  I moved to France and started pioneering.
35:56 There were many Tamil-speaking people  in the territory,
35:59 so I started learning that language  and finally moved to Asia.
36:03 Then I was invited  to serve in the Tamil field
36:05 in Germany as a special pioneer.
36:08 And after seven wonderful years there,
36:10 I was sent back to Asia,  where I now am.
36:13 Thank you.  And, Ben.
36:15 A few years after attending
36:17 the Ministerial Training School in England,
36:19 I was assigned to Burkina Faso,  in West Africa,
36:22 serving as a missionary, which is where  I’ve been serving up until now.
36:26 A big challenge for me was learning
36:29 the local African language called Mooré.
36:32 And after about a year or so  of learning and struggling with the language,
36:37 I wasn’t really up to reading the paragraphs
36:40 or saying a prayer at the book study.
36:42 However, it was  at that point that I was invited
36:44 to take up the traveling work  on a circuit in that very language.
36:48 In fact, the first full-length talk  that I did in the language
36:53 was the needs of the circuit  at the circuit assembly.
36:56 But with holy spirit and a lot of patience  on the part of the brothers,
37:00 I was able gradually to get  to grasp with the challenge.
37:05 Jehovah certainly helped you.
37:05 Deanne.
37:06 Well, after Niell and I were married,
37:08 I went and joined him at Brooklyn Bethel,
37:10 and we served there together until 2004.
37:13 And then we left to assist family,  and we pioneered together.
37:17 And then in 2009,  our circumstances opened up
37:20 and we reapplied for Bethel service.
37:22 However, we were encouraged at that time
37:24 to pursue other theocratic goals.
37:27 So that’s when we started considering  serving in a foreign country.
37:32 And I must say,  we were definitely nervous
37:34 about going to another country—foreign.
37:36 But we prayed about it,  and we did research.
37:38 And then we wrote 31 letters  to various branches
37:42 to see if we could serve in their territory,
37:45 and we got invited to serve in Ghana.
37:47 So we’ve been at the Ghana branch  for almost six years now.
37:50 And although we  were very hesitant at first,
37:52 we’re very glad we moved,  and we enjoy that assignment very much.
37:57 So, no doubt, serving in a foreign country  has so many blessings,
38:00 so many rewards,  but also it has its challenges.
38:04 So how have the local brothers and sisters
38:06 become “gifts in men” and gifts in women  to help you to adjust?
38:10 Anita.
38:12 Not only did they give me  a lot of practical help to settle in,
38:16 they also patiently explained  to me the meaning
38:19 and the feelings behind cultural habits.
38:22 And that’s worth so much in order to adapt.
38:24 So despite cultural differences initially,
38:27 many brothers —they took me in like family.
38:30 I realized how much more I have in common  with my brothers in other countries
38:34 than with people from my birth country  or my language or my color
38:39 who don’t love Jehovah.
38:41 Listening to my brothers express their love  for the same Father I love
38:46 and seeing how he blesses them  and helps them
38:49 as he helps me,  I feel very close to them.
38:51 I feel at home.
38:53 We have a family wherever we go in the world.
38:55 We don’t only call each other
38:58 brothers and sisters,  we really are.
39:00 What a gift!
39:02 And through their marvelous example —many in this family—
39:06 they taught me  valuable lessons in endurance,
39:09 patience, devotion,  hospitality, and so on.
39:12 They trained me  so that I could even come here.
39:16 They are a very precious gift to me.
39:19 Thank you for sharing that.
39:20 Ben.
39:21 My color means that everywhere I go
39:24 I stand out as different to everyone else.
39:27 Serving in the traveling work in rural areas,
39:31 it’s very, very rare to see white people.
39:34 So the word that I hear  called out to me by the local people
39:37 more than anything else —from morning to evening—
39:41 is Nasara, which means “white man.”
39:44 It means that whatever efforts you make
39:47 to learn the local language and the customs,
39:51 you’re nearly always viewed as an outsider.
39:54 So in contrast, though, the friendship
39:58 and support that I enjoy  from the local brothers
40:01 really is a gift.
40:03 Being taken in by the brothers,  eating with them,
40:08 living with their family,  and being treated by them as family,
40:12 whilst outsiders look on
40:14 —perhaps surprised— that really is special.
40:16 A favorite moment for me in service  is when an African brother
40:20 working with me  will introduce me as “my brother.”
40:24 Sometimes the reaction  from the householder is:
40:27 “How can he be your brother?  He’s white and you’re black.”
40:30 Then often the reaction will come  from the brother,
40:32 “Well, he’s more my brother than anyone  born in the same village as me.”
40:36 So when you hear that kind of statement,  in those circumstances, it’s really a gift.
40:41 But more than that,  I think that the support and friendship
40:46 from so many brothers  in my assignment has helped me
40:49 to keep a positive attitude.
40:51 And I can really say it’s because of that,  it’s because of them,
40:54 that I qualify to be here
40:57 and to enjoy  this undeserved privilege of Gilead.
41:01 Because of that,  I really feel the responsibility
41:04 now to go back, get to work,  and to pass onto others
41:07 the gift that I’ve been privileged  to receive here.
41:10 Thank you.
41:11 And going to Ghana,  what about you, Deanne?
41:14 What do you think  about the local brothers and sisters?
41:16 How have they helped you?
41:18 I really appreciate the kindness  of the brothers and sisters in Ghana.
41:21 They go out of their way to help you.
41:23 And I remember  when I was new to the country,
41:25 going out in the ministry,  I met so many interested people,
41:28 but I worried how was I ever going  to find them again
41:31 because the territory oftentimes doesn’t have
41:33 street names and house numbers.
41:35 So I would just write  a description of where I was.
41:38 And the brothers and sisters were so kind.
41:40 They wouldn’t just tell me  how to get back to my return visits,
41:43 they always physically took me there
41:45 even if they had to go  out of their way to do it.
41:48 And that kindness has been repeated  in so many different ways.
41:51 I don’t have time to relate,  but it helped me not only to adjust
41:55 to my assignment in Ghana  but also to stay in it,
41:57 and even to be able  to come here to Gilead today.
42:00 And, Niell.
42:02 I’d say being in a new assignment  away from family and friends,
42:05 you definitely have your ups and downs,  especially in the beginning.
42:09 But that scripture at Colossians 4:11
42:13 helps me to see that my brothers  can be “a source of great comfort”
42:16 or “strengthening aid” to us.
42:19 And we definitely felt  that with the Bethelites
42:21 there in Ghana and the congregation.
42:23 They were like a second family to us.
42:26 They invited us over  for hospitality right away.
42:29 If you looked a little down,  you got an extra warm smile
42:32 or a hug or an arm around you.
42:35 They just accepted us  as a part of their family.
42:37 I can definitely say  that’s one of the main reasons
42:39 why we’re still in that assignment.
42:41 And we really appreciate this gift  of the worldwide brotherhood.
42:45 It’s really helped us  to be where we are today
42:48 —tasting of this undeserved kindness.
42:50 So a recurring theme that “gifts in men,”
42:53 gifts in women,  really has helped you to adjust.
42:56 And I’m sure you will use that going forward.
42:59 Now, you have received  many gifts of training at Gilead
43:02 thus far over the last couple of months.
43:05 Is there a specific gem or a gift  that has really touched your heart
43:08 that you would like to share with us?
43:12 So often I was made aware  of how little I measure up
43:14 to Jehovah’s image in my personality.
43:17 And that awareness is good  for developing more humility,
43:20 but it can be  also quite discouraging at times.
43:23 It’s a struggle to come to that sound mind,
43:26 that balance between I’m not always  an outstanding success,
43:30 but I’m not a constant failure either.
43:33 The course was a marvelous training
43:36 in how not to concentrate  on my strong points only
43:38 —that’s unrealistic—
43:40 but also how not to concentrate  on my weaknesses only
43:43 and then despair,  because that’s unhealthy as well.
43:47 And that ignores Jehovah’s mercy  and his patience with us.
43:51 And he showers us with his affections
43:53 and wants us to feel joy in serving him.
43:55 So I will continue to pray  for Jehovah’s help in this regard,
44:00 because I want Jehovah to feel more joy
44:02 when he watches my thinking and my feelings
44:06 become more balanced, more pleasing to him.
44:09 Very well expressed.  We’ll remember that.
44:11 And, Ben.
44:12 For me, one point was regarding Abraham
44:15 who after having as good as offered up Isaac,
44:18 never understood for the rest of his life
44:20 the reason why Jehovah asked him
44:23 to do that specific thing  as a test of his faith.
44:26 However, he didn’t then  go on to negotiate with Jehovah
44:32 —either beforehand or after—
44:34 as he had done 25 years before  with Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah.
44:38 He didn’t obsess with the questions:
44:40 “Why? Why would Jehovah allow me
44:44 “to go through such a traumatic experience?
44:46 Why? Why? Why?”
44:48 He just got on  with faithfully serving Jehovah.
44:51 And in the resurrection he,  unlike us who understand the reason why,
44:56 he will come to understand  the reason why and will feel privileged.
44:59 So the application that was made—
45:02 The question was asked of us,  “What is your personal Isaac?”
45:05 Perhaps a situation in this system of things
45:08 that we’ll never be rid of,
45:10 or a change of assignment, a reassignment,
45:15 another difficult change in our service.
45:17 Rather than obsessing with the questions:
45:21 “Why? Why me?  Why did this happen?”
45:23 Like Abraham, we should  just carry on serving Jehovah loyally.
45:28 Deanne.
45:29 I really was affected by the lessons  in the “Growing Spiritually” section.
45:32 In one of them, the instructor  used a vivid illustration about—
45:38 He said we shouldn’t let  the 20 weeks of Gilead pass by
45:41 without lancing the boil  and cleaning out the pus.
45:44 Well, as a nurse,  I instantly got a mental image of that
45:47 because if someone does have chronic boils
45:49 and they don’t do anything about it,  it could make them very sick.
45:52 So I thought in a spiritual way  if through my in-depth study of the Bible
45:56 I found negative qualities in my personality
45:59 and I did nothing about it,
46:01 that spiritually  that could infect my whole personality
46:05 and make me spiritually sick
46:07 and then not as useful  to Jehovah as I could be.
46:11 And, Niell, a gem for you.
46:13 Well, time and again,  it was sounded down into our minds
46:15 and deep within our hearts  that one remains useful to Jehovah
46:19 as long as one remains humble.
46:22 So I thought about that,  that if I begin to think
46:24 that it’s all about me  or if it’s about my wife, Deanne,
46:27 and really forget the much larger picture
46:29 —it’s about Jehovah’s sovereignty,  his name, the disciple-making work,
46:32 and loving and assisting the brothers  we’ve been sent there to assist.
46:37 Well, then we begin to focus on ourselves,
46:39 and we damage  our relationship with Jehovah,
46:41 and we damage those  that we’ve been sent to help.
46:44 So throughout the course,  Scriptural warnings were studied
46:47 on King Uzziah, King Saul, and Korah
46:50 who started out  as humble but they went—
46:54 they lost that humility  and became very prideful.
46:57 They forgot the place  that Jehovah had put them in.
47:00 And I won’t forget a point made  by a Governing Body member
47:03 that was relating what Brother Knorr
47:05 used to say to the students —to Gilead students.
47:07 He said that if you leave Gilead  with a bigger head than a bigger heart,
47:12 then we have failed you.
47:14 And so we want to be  very willing to be humble
47:16 and do whatever  Jehovah has asked of us.
47:19 So how do you plan on using  this beautiful gift of Gilead training?
47:23 Anita.
47:25 The whole Gilead experience
47:26 has stressed how much Jehovah  cares for each of our brothers.
47:30 For example, at 1 Kings 10:9,
47:33 we learned that Jehovah  put Solomon in place as king,
47:36 not for Solomon’s glory,
47:38 but he was used as a channel  for Jehovah to show His love for Israel.
47:42 So likewise,  Jehovah gave us this training here,
47:45 not for our glory,  but for our brothers.
47:48 He equipped us to show
47:51 how to take care of our brothers  in a more loving way,
47:54 to transmit the gifts  and Jehovah’s love to them,
47:58 make them feel his care,  and strengthen their attachment to Jehovah.
48:01 So I am eager to return  and try my best to do just that
48:06 —as a little thank you to Jehovah  for the marvelous time here
48:09 but also as a thank you to my brothers  back home to whom I owe so much.
48:14 Very good.
48:15 And, Ben.
48:16 It’s true that Gilead has given us knowledge,
48:19 but Gilead isn’t about knowing things.
48:22 So I want to keep in mind  what Ephesians 3:19 says,
48:26 ‘The love of the Christ surpasses knowledge.’
48:28 Which means taking knowledge  and then transforming it
48:32 into experience by imitation
48:35 —imitation of Christ.
48:37 So I hope to be  a better imitator of Christ
48:40 as I go back  and serve with the brothers.
48:45 But that means  not just imitating Jesus in my actions
48:50 but also coming to have  the same feelings
48:52 that Jesus has about things  and about people.
48:58 In addition to that,  Jehovah really has used—
49:02 has given me  so many “gifts in men” here at Gilead
49:07 that have helped me  to increase my love for him
49:10 but also to have a real deep affection
49:14 for the organization that he’s using.
49:16 So as I go back,  I want to be a factor in helping others
49:20 to come to see how much  Jehovah loves them
49:23 and see how wonderful  the organization that he is using really is.
49:28 And last, we’ll hear from the Ryans.
49:30 Deanne.
49:31 At Psalm 78:5-7,
49:34 it speaks of parents  making known Jehovah’s reminders
49:37 to the next generation so they  can put their confidence in Jehovah.
49:40 And I’d like to do something similar  when I go back to Ghana,
49:43 especially with the young ones,
49:45 to share the many spiritual gems  that I’ve been given
49:48 so that they can more fully put  their confidence in Jehovah.
49:52 So I’d like to do that whenever  I see them at the meetings,
49:56 or talking before and after,  working with them in the ministry,
49:59 when they come over  to visit me in my room at Bethel,
50:02 really, whatever opportunity  I have to share those gems with them.
50:07 And 2 Timothy 2:2 reminds me
50:10 that after we’ve received  this beautiful training,
50:13 we have responsibility,  and that is, in turn,
50:15 to teach or train others.
50:18 So as I go back to my assignment,
50:19 I hope to keep learning  from the brothers and sisters there
50:22 but also to share these gems  and gifts with them.
50:25 Not as a heavy downpour  that drowns our brothers and sisters,
50:29 but as a gentle shower  that encourages them.
50:32 For example,  I’d love to work with the young ones
50:35 and share the experience of young Samuel  when he went to the tabernacle
50:38 and how he served Jehovah faithfully
50:40 despite the wicked influence  of Eli’s two sons,
50:43 and that they too can be faithful
50:45 despite the negative influence  of this world around them.
50:48 If we share these gifts  with the brothers and sisters
50:51 —like a gentle shower—
50:53 we’ll show that we haven’t missed  the purpose of this Gilead training,
50:57 and that is to encourage  and strengthen the brothers
51:00 and bring honor and glory to Jehovah.
51:02 We’d like to thank all four of you  for your heartfelt comments,
51:05 and you really expressed yourselves so well,
51:07 and you represented  the rest of your class so well.
51:10 So with Jehovah’s help,  we know that you will use
51:12 all the gifts  that have been given to you
51:14 to be a gift to all those  in your assignments.
51:17 Thank you.
51:33 Thank you very much Brother Curzan.
51:35 That was very refreshing.
51:37 Appreciate them sharing those thoughts.
51:40 Now we invite you to stand
51:42 and we’ll sing this beloved song,  number 29,
51:47 “Walking in Integrity,”  song number 29.

00:08.653 --> 00:12.658
We always enjoy this part 
at our Gilead graduations


00:12.658 --> 00:15.953
—the student experiences 
that they’ve had 


00:15.953 --> 00:20.081
from the field activity 
while they were at school. 


00:20.082 --> 00:22.835
Kenneth Olson, an instructor 


00:22.835 --> 00:26.172
with Theocratic Schools Department, 
will handle this part. 


00:26.172 --> 00:31.000
And they have the theme 
“The Scene of This World Is Changing.”


00:41.270 --> 00:45.273
The apostle Paul once wrote 
to the congregation in Corinth: 


00:45.273 --> 00:49.110
“The scene of this world is changing.” 
(1Co 7:31) 


00:49.110 --> 00:52.657
And in doing so, 
he likened the world to a stage 


00:52.657 --> 00:57.202
with actors playing their various roles 
until a change of scenes. 


00:57.202 --> 01:00.872
So surrounded 
by the potential distractions 


01:00.872 --> 01:03.167
of the world 
there in the first century, 


01:03.167 --> 01:07.462
our brothers needed to give 
priority to spiritual matters. 


01:07.462 --> 01:11.009
True worship had to come first. 


01:11.008 --> 01:15.511
And an important way they showed 
that they kept their spiritual focus 


01:15.512 --> 01:20.517
was through their obedience 
to Jesus’ command to preach and teach. 


01:20.517 --> 01:22.895
And they did this in various ways. 


01:22.895 --> 01:25.855
Notice the example of the apostle Paul 


01:25.855 --> 01:28.000
at Acts 17:17. 


01:30.610 --> 01:35.615
There in Acts 17:17, it says: 


01:35.615 --> 01:39.243
“So he began to reason 
in the synagogue with the Jews 


01:39.243 --> 01:41.788
“and the other people 
who worshipped God 


01:41.788 --> 01:45.291
“and every day 
in the marketplace 


01:45.292 --> 01:48.545
with those who happened 
to be on hand.” 


01:48.545 --> 01:52.423
So we notice that Paul, 
in the marketplace, 


01:52.423 --> 01:56.220
was ready to talk to whoever 
happened to be on hand. 


01:56.220 --> 01:59.682
Now, he didn’t know who they would be, 
but he was ready. 


01:59.682 --> 02:02.309
So the principles that apply then, 


02:02.308 --> 02:04.603
apply now 
because many of the concerns 


02:04.603 --> 02:07.731
that people had back then, 
people have now. 


02:07.732 --> 02:12.069
And so our work is 
like it was in the first century. 


02:12.068 --> 02:17.073
Now, as Brother and Sister Cook 
were traveling to Gilead School, 


02:17.073 --> 02:19.868
they, like Paul, were ready. 


02:19.868 --> 02:24.205
They were alert to speak with those 
who happened to be on hand. 


02:24.205 --> 02:28.627
This time, it was not in the marketplace; 
it was at a train station. 


02:28.627 --> 02:32.297
And notice how they were ready 
to discuss various topics 


02:32.297 --> 02:35.000
as we watch this video reenactment.


02:37.887 --> 02:39.930
Thank you so much, Manny, 
for helping us with the bags. 


02:39.930 --> 02:41.182
We really appreciate that.


02:41.182 --> 02:43.642
Well, you certainly have a lot of bags. 


02:43.642 --> 02:44.727
Where are you going?


02:44.727 --> 02:46.729
We are going to Patterson, New York, 


02:46.728 --> 02:49.356
to attend a Bible school 
for the next six months.


02:49.357 --> 02:51.942
Really? 
A six-month Bible school? 


02:51.942 --> 02:53.485
Wow, that is amazing!


02:53.485 --> 02:55.528
Yeah, we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, Manny. 


02:55.528 --> 02:56.905
I’m sure you’ve heard about us. 


02:56.905 --> 02:58.198
There’s our little card.


02:58.198 --> 03:01.410
Yeah, I have seen Jehovah’s Witnesses 
going from door to door. 


03:01.410 --> 03:04.872
You even go out when 
the weather is really cold. 


03:04.872 --> 03:06.999
I have a lot of respect for you people.


03:06.998 --> 03:08.166
Oh, thank you. 


03:08.167 --> 03:11.462
Well, we love sharing 
the Bible message with people.


03:11.462 --> 03:14.715
Here, Manny, on the back of this tract, 
there’s a QR Code 


03:14.715 --> 03:17.550
and it takes you 
to our website, jw.org. 


03:17.550 --> 03:20.970
So on there, there are publications 
you can download and read, 


03:20.970 --> 03:24.725
but also there’s a section that answers 
questions you might have about the Bible.


03:24.725 --> 03:27.643
Hmm, that’s good. 
I have some questions. 


03:27.643 --> 03:32.231
In fact, 
my mother died last year. 


03:32.232 --> 03:35.027
She suffered for such a long time.


03:35.027 --> 03:35.985
Oh, sorry.


03:35.985 --> 03:37.487
So sorry to hear that.


03:37.487 --> 03:38.489
We’re very sorry. 


03:38.488 --> 03:42.158
Losing someone 
dear must be so difficult.


03:42.158 --> 03:44.536
Yeah, well, 
it kind of affected my faith. 


03:44.537 --> 03:47.080
You know, 
she was a wonderful person. 


03:47.080 --> 03:49.082
Why did she have 
to suffer like that?


03:49.082 --> 03:52.627
I can understand you 
feeling that way, Manny. 


03:52.627 --> 03:57.507
When you’ve lived a life like your mom, 
and she’s been such a good person, 


03:57.507 --> 04:01.387
and then she suffers like that, I mean, it’s—
it’s difficult to bear, isn’t it? 


04:01.387 --> 04:02.847
It’s difficult to bear. 


04:02.847 --> 04:06.934
This tract, it’s asking the question: 
“Will Suffering Ever End?” 


04:06.933 --> 04:09.686
Do you think that’s the sort of question 
you’re really asking?


04:09.687 --> 04:10.687
Yes, it is. 


04:10.687 --> 04:12.689
Well, thank you. 
Thank you very much. 


04:12.688 --> 04:16.276
You know, I can stay with you 
until your friend comes for you. That’s OK?


04:16.277 --> 04:16.819
Oh, will you?


04:16.818 --> 04:17.443
Oh, thank you!


04:17.443 --> 04:18.028
Thank you!


04:18.028 --> 04:18.945
Thank you very much!


04:18.945 --> 04:20.363
I’ve been thinking about this. 


04:20.363 --> 04:23.700
You know, 
the whole world is a mess.


04:23.700 --> 04:25.035
We agree with you. 


04:25.035 --> 04:27.037
But why is it a mess? 


04:27.037 --> 04:29.039
I can show you another tract. 


04:29.038 --> 04:31.375
It does have an interesting question. 


04:31.375 --> 04:34.418
It says, 
“Who Really Controls the World?” 


04:34.418 --> 04:37.046
And you will be surprised 
to know the answer. 


04:37.047 --> 04:39.759
Notice what the Bible says: 


04:39.758 --> 04:44.136
“The Evil One controls the whole world.” 


04:44.137 --> 04:46.640
So did you notice who is in control? 


04:46.640 --> 04:48.642
What does the Bible say?


04:48.642 --> 04:50.560
Hmm. It says the Evil One
—means the Devil?


04:50.560 --> 04:51.562
That’s right.


04:51.562 --> 04:54.482
Well, that explains why 
the world is in such a bad condition.


04:54.482 --> 04:55.524
Uh-huh. 


04:55.523 --> 05:00.028
And you know, Manny, 
the Bible says that God has set up a kingdom 


05:00.028 --> 05:02.238
that is going to overrule the Devil, 


05:02.238 --> 05:05.783
and also He is going to bring 
the suffering to an end.


05:05.783 --> 05:07.785
Oh, may I have that tract as well?


05:07.785 --> 05:09.037
Of course, yeah, this is for you. 


05:09.037 --> 05:12.124
I just wanted to point 
on the back again in this tract 


05:12.123 --> 05:14.960
is our website 
that Richard just mentioned. 


05:14.960 --> 05:16.962
If you would like, 
you can go there, 


05:16.962 --> 05:19.422
and you can ask for somebody 
to come and visit you, 


05:19.422 --> 05:21.842
and you can discuss 
all the questions you have, 


05:21.842 --> 05:24.094
and they will answer you 
from the Bible.


05:24.093 --> 05:26.095
Oh, well, thank you very much. 
Thank you.


05:26.095 --> 05:27.097
You are welcome.


05:27.097 --> 05:28.099
Excuse me, 
Brother and Sister Cook?


05:28.098 --> 05:29.098
Oh, this is our driver!


05:29.098 --> 05:30.100
Yes, pleased to meet you!


05:30.100 --> 05:31.100
Nice to meet you.


05:31.100 --> 05:32.602
Thank you for collecting us.


05:32.602 --> 05:33.604
Here are their bags.
Thank you.


05:33.603 --> 05:34.436
Thank you. 


05:34.437 --> 05:35.439
Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.


05:35.438 --> 05:36.273
Thank you.


05:36.273 --> 05:37.523
Thank you, Manny. 
We really appreciate all your help.


05:37.523 --> 05:38.525
Thank you for your help. 


05:38.525 --> 05:39.150
Bye-bye. 


05:39.150 --> 05:39.777
Goodbye.


05:39.777 --> 05:40.402
Take care.


05:40.402 --> 05:41.404
So, hope you had 
a good trip coming here.


05:41.403 --> 05:42.000
Yeah, it was really good.


05:46.533 --> 05:50.411
So, did you see how 
Brother and Sister Cook were prepared? 


05:50.412 --> 05:52.414
They had literature ready. 


05:52.413 --> 05:54.791
They didn’t know who it would be 
or what the topic would be, 


05:54.792 --> 05:56.794
but they were ready. 


05:56.793 --> 06:01.715
Another way that our first-century brothers 
and sisters obeyed Jesus’ command 


06:01.715 --> 06:05.885
is found at Acts 5:42. 


06:05.885 --> 06:10.890
At Acts 5:42, 


06:10.890 --> 06:13.018
it says there: 


06:13.018 --> 06:16.730
“And every day in the temple 
and from house to house 


06:16.730 --> 06:19.357
“they continued without letup 


06:19.357 --> 06:21.777
“teaching and declaring the good news 


06:21.777 --> 06:24.237
about the Christ, Jesus.” 


06:24.237 --> 06:27.074
So it says they went 
“from house to house.” 


06:27.073 --> 06:31.578
Now, this was shortly 
after Pentecost of 33 C.E., 


06:31.578 --> 06:35.915
and already the young congregation 
is active in the door-to-door ministry, 


06:35.915 --> 06:38.418
talking to people face-to-face. 


06:38.418 --> 06:41.838
And this work is still at the center
—it’s at the forefront—


06:41.838 --> 06:44.381
of our worldwide preaching effort. 


06:44.382 --> 06:46.510
So contacting people directly 


06:46.510 --> 06:49.847
helps us to help them individually. 


06:49.847 --> 06:53.434
Now, in the first century, 
Jesus helped people face-to-face, 


06:53.433 --> 06:55.935
very often with the resurrection hope. 


06:55.935 --> 06:57.938
He built them up; 
he gave them hope. 


06:57.938 --> 06:59.940
Now we do the same. 


06:59.940 --> 07:03.068
However, very often, 
when we talk to people from house to house, 


07:03.068 --> 07:05.236
we’re there, 
we have a scripture, we’re prepared, 


07:05.237 --> 07:07.322
we have a topic 
we want to talk about. 


07:07.322 --> 07:09.659
And all of a sudden, 
the householder wants 


07:09.658 --> 07:12.285
to talk about what’s 
on their mind and heart. 


07:12.285 --> 07:14.955
Essentially, they change the subject. 


07:14.955 --> 07:16.832
So, what do we do? 


07:16.832 --> 07:19.334
Well, an alert teacher will follow 


07:19.333 --> 07:23.630
the concern of the householder 
and address that concern. 


07:23.630 --> 07:26.173
So watch how Brother Mbanzulu 


07:26.173 --> 07:28.676
followed the householder’s concern 


07:28.677 --> 07:31.179
and comforted him 
with the resurrection hope 


07:31.178 --> 07:34.975
when he was invited into a man’s home 
for the very first time. 


07:34.975 --> 07:38.000
And see how he changed the subject, 
and Brother Mbanzulu followed it.


07:40.397 --> 07:42.984
Thank you for inviting us in.


07:42.983 --> 07:44.316
You’re welcome.


07:44.317 --> 07:47.862
How would you describe 
the situation in the world today?


07:47.862 --> 07:51.199
I lost my wife a few years ago, 


07:51.198 --> 07:54.326
and life is not easy.


07:54.327 --> 07:57.414
We are so sorry to hear 
that you lost your wife. 


07:57.413 --> 08:00.250
That must be difficult to deal with.


08:00.250 --> 08:02.877
It is difficult. 


08:02.877 --> 08:06.130
But I know you’re going to say 
that I should be— 


08:06.130 --> 08:08.383
there’s the hope of the resurrection 


08:08.383 --> 08:11.886
and that with a little bit of money, 
I’ll be able to see my wife again. 


08:11.887 --> 08:15.849
But I don’t know if I believe that.


08:15.848 --> 08:18.685
Did someone say to you 
that you need to pay something 


08:18.685 --> 08:20.853
like money to see your wife again?


08:20.853 --> 08:23.231
Yes, that’s what the church said.


08:23.232 --> 08:25.734
Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. 


08:25.733 --> 08:29.653
But really, do you believe 
that God needs our money?


08:29.653 --> 08:31.321
Of course not! 


08:31.322 --> 08:35.160
But I don’t believe 
that the resurrection is true.


08:35.160 --> 08:37.328
What is your point of view? 


08:37.328 --> 08:39.330
Where do we come from?


08:39.330 --> 08:41.332
I guess, of course, 


08:41.332 --> 08:45.170
there had to be 
some person that made us. 


08:45.170 --> 08:48.923
Life just couldn’t come about by itself. 


08:48.923 --> 08:51.676
So I would say that person is God.


08:51.677 --> 08:54.179
So let me give you an example. 


08:54.178 --> 08:58.516
Suppose that you own 
a company that makes cars. 


08:58.517 --> 09:02.270
Let’s say you make Mercedes-Benz, 


09:02.270 --> 09:05.815
and you decide to give 
a new one to your friend. 


09:05.815 --> 09:07.817
He’s very happy. 


09:07.817 --> 09:11.947
But the very first day 
he drives that car, he has a crash. 


09:11.947 --> 09:14.867
Then he calls you; 
he’s sad; he says, 


09:14.867 --> 09:17.035
“You know, I just had a crash.” 


09:17.035 --> 09:19.788
What will you say?


09:19.788 --> 09:22.000
Just bring it back. 
I’ll fix it.


09:23.292 --> 09:25.294
But what if he said to you: 


09:25.293 --> 09:28.045
“Friend, I’m not sure you will fix it. 


09:28.045 --> 09:30.215
It’s totally broken.” 


09:30.215 --> 09:32.217
What will you say to him?


09:32.217 --> 09:35.304
If I made it, I can fix it. 


09:35.303 --> 09:37.305
I could even make a new one.


09:37.305 --> 09:41.142
You know, when something 
does not work properly in our body, 


09:41.142 --> 09:44.312
or let’s say, 
when our body stops working, 


09:44.312 --> 09:46.314
we call it death. 


09:46.313 --> 09:49.066
But actually, 
from the point of view 


09:49.067 --> 09:53.405
of the One who created life, 
we can say this is just like a crash. 


09:53.405 --> 09:54.990
Would you agree with that?


09:54.990 --> 09:57.658
Yeah, I would agree with that.


09:57.658 --> 10:00.495
And when this happens, 
usually we are very sad 


10:00.495 --> 10:02.830
because that person that died 


10:02.830 --> 10:05.500
may be someone we really loved. 


10:05.500 --> 10:09.003
But could the One who created life 


10:09.003 --> 10:11.421
be able to fix the problem 


10:11.422 --> 10:14.092
or recreate that person?


10:14.092 --> 10:17.345
Yeah, He should be able to do that.


10:17.345 --> 10:19.680
But you know, we three here, 


10:19.680 --> 10:23.768
we’ve never seen someone 
raised from the dead. 


10:23.768 --> 10:26.855
So talking about the resurrection 


10:26.855 --> 10:29.357
must be something strange to us. 


10:29.357 --> 10:31.610
And God understands that. 


10:31.610 --> 10:36.113
But you know what Jesus said 
in the past when he was here on earth? 


10:36.113 --> 10:39.868
He said something very interesting, 
and I would like to share it with you. 


10:39.868 --> 10:42.286
It’s found in the book of John, 


10:42.287 --> 10:47.042
chapter 5, verses 28 and 29. 


10:47.042 --> 10:49.879
And while Sulamite 
is reading that scripture, 


10:49.878 --> 10:53.673
please try to imagine that God 
is speaking to you personally. 


10:53.673 --> 10:55.675
Please Sula, can you read it?


10:55.675 --> 10:56.510
Uh-huh. 


10:56.510 --> 10:59.137
John 5:28,29: 


10:59.137 --> 11:01.807
“Do not be amazed at this, 


11:01.807 --> 11:06.269
“for the hour is coming in which 
all those in the memorial tombs 


11:06.268 --> 11:08.688
“will hear his voice and come out, 


11:08.688 --> 11:12.358
“those who did good things 
to a resurrection of life, 


11:12.358 --> 11:16.000
and those who practiced vile things 
to a resurrection of judgment.” 


11:17.072 --> 11:20.409
God knows that may look 
impossible to you, 


11:20.408 --> 11:24.411
but he assures us 
that this will take place.


11:24.412 --> 11:25.997
It’s clear now.


11:25.997 --> 11:28.584
You know, there are 
many other good promises 


11:28.583 --> 11:30.960
in the Bible 
from God for humankind. 


11:30.960 --> 11:33.672
And if you want, 
we can help you to know them.


11:33.672 --> 11:36.000
Yeah, I would like that.


11:46.308 --> 11:48.978
Did you see 
how Brother Mbanzulu was willing 


11:48.978 --> 11:51.648
to drop the topic 
he wanted to talk about 


11:51.648 --> 11:54.358
and follow the concern 
of the man instead? 


11:54.358 --> 11:56.526
Very loving and very alert. 


11:56.527 --> 11:58.530
Now, in the first century, 


11:58.530 --> 12:01.783
there were many different ideas 
and philosophies of life. 


12:01.783 --> 12:04.868
Pontius Pilate expressed one 
when he said to Jesus: 


12:04.868 --> 12:06.871
“What is truth?” 


12:06.872 --> 12:08.874
And he said that rather scornfully. 


12:08.873 --> 12:11.041
But today some feel unsure 


12:11.042 --> 12:13.210
if it’s possible to know truth. 


12:13.210 --> 12:15.463
Well, our first-century brothers 


12:15.463 --> 12:18.048
would often find 
common ground with someone, 


12:18.048 --> 12:20.801
to reason with them 
and help them see the point. 


12:20.802 --> 12:22.804
And we do the same today. 


12:22.803 --> 12:26.891
Watch how Sister Martinez 
found common ground 


12:26.892 --> 12:29.644
to reason with a man 
who seemed unsure 


12:29.643 --> 12:32.000
if it were possible to know truth.


12:35.775 --> 12:37.277
Good morning, Sir.


12:37.277 --> 12:38.027
Good morning.


12:38.027 --> 12:39.570
I’m glad to find you here, 


12:39.570 --> 12:42.157
and we’re asking people 
in the area a question, 


12:42.157 --> 12:43.742
and I’d like your opinion.


12:43.742 --> 12:45.160
OK, sure.


12:45.160 --> 12:47.203
Do you think 
that it’s actually possible 


12:47.203 --> 12:50.040
for us to get to know 
what the truth is, 


12:50.040 --> 12:53.460
living in a world 
where more half-truths exist?


12:53.460 --> 12:56.045
No, I don’t think so. 
Nobody has the truth. 


12:56.045 --> 12:58.213
I’m sure you have 
your own religion and, in fact, 


12:58.213 --> 13:00.508
your own translation of the Bible. 


13:00.508 --> 13:02.885
And everyone’s entitled 


13:02.885 --> 13:05.097
to believe what they 
want to believe.


13:05.097 --> 13:07.265
Yeah, 
we all have the right to believe 


13:07.265 --> 13:09.392
in what we want to believe in. 


13:09.392 --> 13:11.645
But do you think that God 


13:11.645 --> 13:14.105
wants us to get to know 
what the truth is?


13:14.105 --> 13:15.773
Hmm, yeah, sure.


13:15.773 --> 13:17.858
You know, 
I noticed that you have an accent. 


13:17.858 --> 13:19.943
If you don’t mind me asking, 
where are you from?


13:19.943 --> 13:21.946
Oh, I don’t mind. 
I’m from Ecuador.


13:21.947 --> 13:22.864
Oh! 
Wow! 


13:22.863 --> 13:24.865
You know, 
I’ve been living in South America 


13:24.865 --> 13:26.868
for the past few years with my husband.


13:26.868 --> 13:28.453
Oh, really? 
What country?


13:28.453 --> 13:29.370
In Paraguay.


13:29.370 --> 13:31.455
Oh, yeah. 
OK, I know Paraguay. Nice.


13:31.455 --> 13:34.417
Yeah, you know, 
they speak Spanish there also, 


13:34.417 --> 13:36.920
and they have 
a little bit of an accent.


13:36.920 --> 13:37.545
Uh-huh.


13:37.545 --> 13:39.547
They also use certain expressions 


13:39.547 --> 13:41.884
that are unfamiliar to me. 


13:41.883 --> 13:44.551
But, generally, 
I can understand what they’re saying.


13:44.552 --> 13:46.889
True, it is slightly different. 
Mhm.


13:46.888 --> 13:50.475
This reminds me 
of when we study the Bible. 


13:50.475 --> 13:53.437
For example, 
the translation that we use, 


13:53.437 --> 13:55.439
they’re in many languages. 


13:55.438 --> 13:57.773
The Bible that we have in Spanish 


13:57.773 --> 13:59.941
wasn’t originally in Spanish. 


13:59.942 --> 14:00.860
It’s a translation.


14:00.860 --> 14:01.695
Uh-huh. 
Right.


14:01.695 --> 14:06.700
And although one Bible 
may differ slightly from another, 


14:06.700 --> 14:08.910
even within the same language, 


14:08.910 --> 14:11.328
they generally convey the same idea.


14:11.328 --> 14:13.831
Hmm. 
Yeah, that makes sense. Sure.


14:13.832 --> 14:15.917
Now, do you think that God is aware 


14:15.917 --> 14:18.462
of these apparent difficulties that exist?


14:18.462 --> 14:21.924
Hmm. Good question. 
Yeah, I think so.


14:21.923 --> 14:24.091
Yeah, he definitely has to know. 


14:24.092 --> 14:27.095
And, you know, 
he actually encourages us 


14:27.095 --> 14:30.182
through the Bible 
to get to know what these truths are.


14:30.182 --> 14:31.015
Hmm.


14:31.015 --> 14:34.018
These truths are revealed clearly here 


14:34.018 --> 14:36.270
in this Bible text 


14:36.270 --> 14:40.233
at 1 Timothy 2:3,4 
that I’d like to read to you. 


14:40.233 --> 14:43.445
It says: 
“This is fine and acceptable 


14:43.445 --> 14:46.363
“in the sight of our Savior, God, 


14:46.363 --> 14:50.660
“whose will is that all sorts of people 
should be saved and,” 


14:50.660 --> 14:52.662
notice this part, 


14:52.662 --> 14:55.915
“come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”


14:55.915 --> 14:57.000
Hmm. 
OK.


14:57.000 --> 14:58.083
Not half-truths.


14:58.083 --> 14:58.960
Right.


14:58.960 --> 15:01.587
So God is really concerned about us 


15:01.587 --> 15:04.465
coming to an accurate knowledge of truth. 


15:04.465 --> 15:07.427
Now, 
do you think that this is possible 


15:07.427 --> 15:10.347
if we dedicate time 


15:10.347 --> 15:12.974
researching the Bible 
on a superficial level?


15:12.973 --> 15:13.891
No, I don’t think so. 


15:13.892 --> 15:16.227
You can’t come 
to accurate knowledge like that. 


15:16.227 --> 15:17.312
It’s impossible.


15:17.312 --> 15:19.314
Yeah, I think the same way. 


15:19.313 --> 15:22.650
It really means 
that we have to investigate 


15:22.650 --> 15:26.070
in what God is trying to tell us 
in such a large book.


15:26.070 --> 15:26.988
Hmm.


15:26.988 --> 15:29.281
You know, 
I have this book with me 


15:29.282 --> 15:32.119
that has this very interesting theme 


15:32.118 --> 15:34.286
“What Does the Bible Really Teach?”


15:34.287 --> 15:35.872
Hmm. 
Sounds interesting.


15:35.872 --> 15:38.374
And it reveals 
what those Bible truths are. 


15:38.373 --> 15:41.085
I would like 
to get this available to you. 


15:41.085 --> 15:42.712
I only have it in English.


15:42.712 --> 15:43.337
OK.


15:43.337 --> 15:44.547
How can I do this?


15:44.547 --> 15:46.215
Well, I have to leave now. 


15:46.215 --> 15:49.135
I have to go to work, 
but I’ll give you my contact information, 


15:49.135 --> 15:51.553
and then we can make arrangements.


15:51.553 --> 15:52.555
Oh, that sounds great.


15:52.555 --> 15:53.013
Yeah.


15:53.013 --> 15:53.430
OK.


15:53.430 --> 15:55.000
OK.


16:05.402 --> 16:08.822
No doubt you saw how 
Sister Martinez was able to use 


16:08.822 --> 16:10.824
things that they had in common 


16:10.823 --> 16:13.785
to help the man reason about the point. 


16:13.785 --> 16:18.665
Now, we’ve seen so far, 
students preaching in the train station, 


16:18.665 --> 16:20.792
peoples’ homes, a parking lot. 


16:20.792 --> 16:23.294
Well, really, 
Jesus set the example 


16:23.293 --> 16:26.130
about reaching people 
wherever they may be. 


16:26.130 --> 16:30.092
Notice in Matthew 9:9, 


16:30.092 --> 16:34.180
there in Matthew 9:9, 


16:34.180 --> 16:36.182
it says there: 


16:36.182 --> 16:39.227
“Next, while moving on from there, 


16:39.227 --> 16:42.064
“Jesus caught sight 
of a man named Matthew 


16:42.063 --> 16:44.065
“sitting at the tax office, 


16:44.065 --> 16:47.027
“and he said to him: 
‘Be my follower.’ 


16:47.027 --> 16:49.945
At that he rose up 
and followed him.” 


16:49.945 --> 16:53.365
So Matthew 
was sitting at the tax office. 


16:53.365 --> 16:55.868
He was in his place of employment. 


16:55.868 --> 16:59.621
So Jesus preached in business territory. 


16:59.622 --> 17:01.624
Well, we do the same thing today. 


17:01.623 --> 17:03.208
We preach in business territory. 


17:03.208 --> 17:05.211
We try to reach people where they are. 


17:05.212 --> 17:06.670
Now, back in the first century, 


17:06.670 --> 17:09.923
we know the main theme was the Kingdom. 


17:09.923 --> 17:11.926
This was the theme of the preaching work. 


17:11.927 --> 17:13.929
This is still the case today. 


17:13.928 --> 17:15.930
This is the theme of the preaching work. 


17:15.930 --> 17:19.767
In our last reenactment, 
it takes place in a beauty salon. 


17:19.767 --> 17:23.062
Our sister is coming back 
to the woman’s place of business 


17:23.062 --> 17:27.067
in order to cultivate the interest 
shown in the very first conversation, 


17:27.067 --> 17:31.000
and notice how she 
directs attention to the Kingdom.


17:33.113 --> 17:34.031
Hi, Deanne!


17:34.032 --> 17:34.865
Hi!


17:34.865 --> 17:36.617
It’s so nice to see you again. 


17:36.617 --> 17:38.620
Today I brought a video to show you. 


17:38.620 --> 17:41.000
It’s called Does God Have a Name?


17:43.625 --> 17:46.293
Does God have a name?


17:46.293 --> 17:50.000
. . . at a time and place 
convenient for you.


17:54.010 --> 17:56.012
So as you saw in the video, 


17:56.012 --> 17:58.514
we all have names 
to identify ourselves. 


17:58.513 --> 18:01.391
Your name is Deanne, 
and my name is Claire. 


18:01.392 --> 18:05.314
So wouldn’t it make sense for God 
to have a name to identify himself with?


18:05.313 --> 18:07.315
Sure, that makes perfect sense.


18:07.315 --> 18:12.028
And did you know that the name Jehovah 
is in the Bible about 7,000 times?


18:12.028 --> 18:13.111
Wow! 


18:13.112 --> 18:15.824
If it’s in there that much, 
it must be important. 


18:15.823 --> 18:18.826
You know, Claire, 
I do read the Bible every day. 


18:18.827 --> 18:21.162
And I’ve been trying 
to get closer to God, 


18:21.162 --> 18:23.164
but it’s not easy. 


18:23.163 --> 18:25.248
You know, 
I’m so busy running the business 


18:25.248 --> 18:27.543
and looking after my children. 


18:27.543 --> 18:30.170
And that’s another thing, 
I’m constantly worried about my children. 


18:30.170 --> 18:32.173
The world is just getting so bad. 


18:32.173 --> 18:34.175
I wonder about their future.


18:34.175 --> 18:36.260
Yeah, I can imagine that it’s not easy. 


18:36.260 --> 18:38.680
But it’s good 
that you’re looking to the Bible. 


18:38.680 --> 18:40.973
In fact, today I wanted 
to show you a verse 


18:40.973 --> 18:43.643
from Daniel 2:44, 


18:43.643 --> 18:45.645
it says: 


18:45.645 --> 18:47.897
“In the days of those kings 
the God of heaven 


18:47.897 --> 18:50.900
“will set up a kingdom 
that will never be destroyed. 


18:50.900 --> 18:54.778
“And this kingdom 
will not be passed on to any other people. 


18:54.778 --> 18:58.031
“It will crush and put an end 
to all these kingdoms, 


18:58.032 --> 19:00.535
and it alone will stand forever.” 


19:00.535 --> 19:03.370
Perhaps you’ve heard of people 
pray the Our Father, 


19:03.370 --> 19:05.623
and they’re asking 
for God’s Kingdom to come. 


19:05.623 --> 19:07.833
They want to see God’s will done 


19:07.833 --> 19:09.835
on the earth as it was in heaven. 


19:09.835 --> 19:12.255
And really, that’s what 
this Kingdom is talking about. 


19:12.255 --> 19:15.967
It’s God’s government to bring 
an end to suffering in the world.


19:15.967 --> 19:18.094
I would really like to see that change.


19:18.093 --> 19:20.680
Yeah, we all want to see 
an end to suffering. 


19:20.680 --> 19:22.182
But what do you think? 


19:22.182 --> 19:26.060
Do you think God really has the power 
to bring about these changes?


19:26.060 --> 19:29.147
Of course! 
I think he has all the power.


19:29.147 --> 19:31.149
Yeah, that’s right, he does. 


19:31.148 --> 19:33.566
And, you know, he also wants 


19:33.567 --> 19:35.570
to see an end to this suffering. 


19:35.570 --> 19:37.655
In fact, 
that’s why it’s so important for us 


19:37.655 --> 19:41.908
to try and learn as much as we can 
about his purpose for the earth.


19:41.908 --> 19:43.911
I would like to learn more about God 


19:43.912 --> 19:46.247
and what he’s going to do for the future.


19:46.247 --> 19:47.582
Yeah, that’s so good. 


19:47.582 --> 19:50.000
I really enjoy speaking 
to you about this. 


19:50.000 --> 19:54.172
I was thinking, do you usually work here 
on Saturday mornings?


19:54.172 --> 19:56.090
I do. 
I work here just about every Saturday. 


19:56.090 --> 19:58.927
So if you come, we can sit down 
for a few minutes and talk.


19:58.927 --> 20:01.679
Oh, I would really appreciate 
if we can have a little bit 


20:01.678 --> 20:03.931
of time together 
to talk about that subject.


20:03.932 --> 20:04.765
Sure.


20:04.765 --> 20:06.808
Thank you so much. 
It was nice to see you today.


20:06.808 --> 20:07.476
You too.


20:07.477 --> 20:08.185
Bye-bye.


20:08.185 --> 20:10.000
Bye-bye.


20:13.775 --> 20:19.072
Our Gilead students 
have been doing a very good job 


20:19.072 --> 20:21.074
directing people to the Kingdom 


20:21.073 --> 20:24.493
as the only true hope for mankind. 


20:24.493 --> 20:27.080
Now, in the first century, 


20:27.080 --> 20:29.415
our brothers and sisters faced 


20:29.415 --> 20:32.042
many of the challenges 
that are common today. 


20:32.042 --> 20:34.504
How should they 
view higher education, 


20:34.503 --> 20:37.590
how to keep focused 
on spiritual goals, 


20:37.590 --> 20:41.010
how to avoid the dangers 
of bad association? 


20:41.010 --> 20:45.598
Well, our Gilead students have faced 
these very issues successfully. 


20:45.598 --> 20:48.100
And the decisions 
that they’ve made in the past 


20:48.100 --> 20:50.437
have helped them be here today. 


20:50.437 --> 20:53.647
Now notice how our students 
met the various challenges posed 


20:53.647 --> 20:56.025
by what to do 
with higher education, 


20:56.025 --> 20:58.693
potential distractions 
from their spiritual goals, 


20:58.693 --> 21:00.946
and avoiding bad associations. 


21:00.947 --> 21:03.032
Would you like to meet 
some of our Gilead students 


21:03.032 --> 21:06.000
and get to know them 
just a little bit better?


21:24.762 --> 21:28.349
Well, we have with us 
Brother and Sister Mbanzulu, 


21:28.348 --> 21:31.851
Fall and Sulamite Mbanzulu, 
from Congo Kinshasa. 


21:31.852 --> 21:36.857
We have Brother Elipaz 
and Nancy Rosenzvig, from Israel, 


21:36.857 --> 21:40.820
and Sister Turkijana Gasi, 
from Serbia. 


21:40.820 --> 21:42.988
And we’re glad to have 
all of you with us. 


21:42.988 --> 21:45.825
Brother Mbanzulu, 
let’s start with you. 


21:45.825 --> 21:50.000
What spiritual goal did you set 
for yourself as you were growing up?


21:51.413 --> 21:53.833
I wanted to be a special pioneer.


21:53.833 --> 21:57.170
Well, that’s an excellent spiritual goal 
for a young man. 


21:57.170 --> 22:00.422
Now as that— 
Once you set that goal, however, 


22:00.422 --> 22:03.509
a potential obstacle arose.


22:03.508 --> 22:07.263
Yes, this happened 
when I was 14 years old. 


22:07.263 --> 22:10.641
My father said to me that he 
would support me financially 


22:10.642 --> 22:12.769
and even pay for my education 


22:12.768 --> 22:17.000
if I would like to be 
a lawyer or a physician.


22:18.398 --> 22:20.901
So he offered you 
free higher education.


22:20.902 --> 22:21.777
Yeah.


22:21.777 --> 22:23.989
But you had 
this other spiritual goal in mind.


22:23.988 --> 22:24.571
Yeah.


22:24.572 --> 22:26.324
What did you do?


22:26.323 --> 22:28.741
I kindly explained to him 
that I had the goal to be 


22:28.742 --> 22:32.000
a special pioneer, 
so I declined his offer.


22:33.330 --> 22:35.332
Well, that sounds like a good thing. 


22:35.332 --> 22:38.085
You kept your focus on spiritual matters. 


22:38.085 --> 22:40.462
What did your father think about that?


22:40.462 --> 22:42.799
He was very disappointed 


22:42.798 --> 22:45.466
because he didn’t expect that answer. 


22:45.467 --> 22:49.305
He said to me 
if I did not take his offer, 


22:49.305 --> 22:51.473
I will have to support myself. 


22:51.473 --> 22:54.976
And if, in the future, 
I have to face some difficulties, 


22:54.977 --> 22:56.979
I should not go back to him. 


22:56.978 --> 23:00.000
And he even mentioned 
that I was no longer his son, 


23:01.108 --> 23:03.986
and that hurt me deeply. 


23:03.987 --> 23:06.239
But I’m happy 
that I made that decision, 


23:06.238 --> 23:09.158
because otherwise 
I would not have benefited 


23:09.158 --> 23:11.160
from the highest education


23:11.160 --> 23:13.620
—the divine education 
that I’ve enjoyed in Gilead.


23:13.620 --> 23:15.998
Well, we know 
that was not an easy situation 


23:15.998 --> 23:18.000
to face as a young man


23:18.000 --> 23:20.002
—quite a lot of faith and spiritual focus—


23:20.002 --> 23:22.004
and we’re glad that you did that. 


23:22.003 --> 23:24.423
So you went ahead with your goal 
to special pioneer. 


23:24.423 --> 23:26.425
So when did you 
become a special pioneer?


23:26.425 --> 23:27.260
I never did.


23:27.260 --> 23:30.262
What happened?


23:30.262 --> 23:33.975
I was invited to serve in Bethel, 
and I accepted that invitation.


23:33.975 --> 23:36.143
Well, we know 
that Jehovah’s blessed you there too.


23:36.143 --> 23:39.021
Yeah, I received 
many blessings in Bethel, 


23:39.022 --> 23:42.024
and one of them, 
actually, is my marriage 


23:42.023 --> 23:44.026
with Sulamite. 


23:44.027 --> 23:47.195
It’s really a gift 
coming from Jehovah. 


23:47.195 --> 23:51.408
And Sulamite loves Jehovah 
and supports me in my service.


23:51.408 --> 23:52.241
Yes. 


23:52.242 --> 23:56.164
Well, Sister Mbanzulu, 
now, your father was Muslim.


23:56.163 --> 23:56.996
Yes.


23:56.997 --> 24:00.584
And what did he think 
about the family being Jehovah’s Witnesses?


24:00.583 --> 24:02.586
My father never opposed the truth. 


24:02.587 --> 24:05.089
He saw that this was good 
and even encouraged us.


24:05.088 --> 24:07.800
All right. 
So that allowed you to set spiritual goals.


24:07.800 --> 24:08.342
Yes.


24:08.342 --> 24:10.385
What spiritual goal 
did you set for yourself?


24:10.385 --> 24:12.430
I wanted to be a special pioneer.


24:12.430 --> 24:15.683
That’s an excellent spiritual goal! 


24:15.683 --> 24:18.476
And what did your family 
think about that goal?


24:18.477 --> 24:20.604
My immediate family was supportive. 


24:20.603 --> 24:23.773
But others in the family 
pressured me to pursue 


24:23.773 --> 24:26.193
higher education and travel to Europe. 


24:26.193 --> 24:29.780
That could have been a temptation, 
but it was a trap. 


24:29.780 --> 24:33.700
Spiritual education is far more valuable. 


24:33.700 --> 24:37.455
I’m glad I made a good decision
—the right choice.


24:37.455 --> 24:38.538
Well, so we’re glad too. 


24:38.538 --> 24:41.125
So both of you 
had to stay spiritually focused there. 


24:41.125 --> 24:44.337
So you went ahead with your goal 
of being a special pioneer. 


24:44.337 --> 24:46.172
When did you become a special pioneer?


24:46.172 --> 24:49.092
I didn’t become a special pioneer. 


24:49.092 --> 24:52.762
I was invited to serve 
at Bethel for two weeks, 


24:52.762 --> 24:56.765
and then I was invited 
to stay in Bethel service.


24:56.765 --> 24:57.517
Well, that’s good. 


24:57.517 --> 24:59.602
You both remained focused on spiritual goals 


24:59.602 --> 25:01.812
but flexible to Jehovah’s direction, 


25:01.812 --> 25:03.814
and we’re glad that you did. 


25:03.813 --> 25:06.191
Brother Rosenzvig, 


25:06.192 --> 25:09.029
now, you come 
from a very spiritually active family. 


25:09.028 --> 25:12.071
What did your parents do to raise you 


25:12.072 --> 25:14.909
in such a fine spiritual environment?


25:14.908 --> 25:17.411
It’s true, 
today when I’m looking back, 


25:17.412 --> 25:20.832
I see that my parents did so much. 


25:20.832 --> 25:23.250
In addition to our family study, 


25:23.250 --> 25:27.253
my parents studied 
with all five of us separately. 


25:27.253 --> 25:30.006
They went with us to service; 


25:30.007 --> 25:32.427
we read together the daily text. 


25:32.427 --> 25:34.429
And also my father, 


25:34.428 --> 25:39.475
he prayed with each one of us every night.


25:39.475 --> 25:43.895
So, what influence did all that 
have on your spiritual routine?


25:43.895 --> 25:46.565
So I still pray every night with my wife. 


25:46.565 --> 25:49.735
And recently, 
I asked my brothers and sisters 


25:49.735 --> 25:52.655
if they have the same habit until today. 


25:52.655 --> 25:54.657
And all of them said, “Yes.” 


25:54.657 --> 25:58.244
So all of us pray every night 
like we did with our father.


25:58.243 --> 26:00.078
Excellent. 


26:00.078 --> 26:02.748
Well, I know that you 
met a spiritually-minded sister 


26:02.748 --> 26:05.000
in your congregation; 
you got married. 


26:05.000 --> 26:08.253
And then what did you do 
to make yourself more available 


26:08.253 --> 26:10.463
to pursue spiritual goals?


26:10.463 --> 26:13.300
So we began to simplify our life, 


26:13.300 --> 26:16.762
we avoided financial obligation, 


26:16.762 --> 26:19.055
and we expanded our ministry. 


26:19.055 --> 26:22.142
After a while, 
we were invited to Bethel.


26:22.142 --> 26:24.145
Well, that’s excellent
—wonderful invitation. 


26:24.145 --> 26:25.645
I’m sure you were very excited. 


26:25.645 --> 26:27.982
Now, when that happened, though, 


26:27.982 --> 26:30.000
a potential distraction arose.


26:31.152 --> 26:33.904
Yeah, my employer, 
he really wanted me to stay. 


26:33.903 --> 26:36.073
So he offered me a big raise, 


26:36.073 --> 26:38.575
stock in the company, a car. 


26:38.575 --> 26:42.455
But the real riches are found 
in the full-time service. 


26:42.455 --> 26:43.455
And look! 


26:43.455 --> 26:47.710
Here we are, getting the divine education 
that Jehovah provides.


26:47.710 --> 26:48.710
Yeah, very true. 


26:48.710 --> 26:52.548
Now Sister Rosenzvig, 
so when your husband received 


26:52.548 --> 26:55.300
the invitation to Bethel, 
obviously it’s to you too, 


26:55.300 --> 26:59.555
and you also had some potential distractions 
come at the same time.


26:59.555 --> 27:00.388
True. 


27:00.388 --> 27:03.225
The same week 
we were invited to Bethel, 


27:03.225 --> 27:07.062
I got a phone call from a company 
that offered me a well-paying job. 


27:07.062 --> 27:10.232
And just before that, 
I had said no to a full scholarship 


27:10.232 --> 27:12.234
to pursue more education. 


27:12.233 --> 27:15.070
And both of us got 
so many offers during that time, 


27:15.070 --> 27:18.073
it was very clear somebody 
was not happy about our decision.


27:18.073 --> 27:19.450
Yes. 


27:19.450 --> 27:22.703
Now your first name, 


27:22.703 --> 27:25.413
Sister Rosenzvig, 
doesn’t sound very Israeli. 


27:25.413 --> 27:28.000
How did you come to be called Nancy?


27:29.877 --> 27:32.462
So my father 
is from an Arabic background 


27:32.462 --> 27:34.424
and my mom 
from a Jewish background. 


27:34.423 --> 27:36.758
As you know, in Israel, 
it’s not so common 


27:36.758 --> 27:38.760
for a Jew to marry an Arab. 


27:38.760 --> 27:41.638
But this is what’s so beautiful 
about our organization. 


27:41.638 --> 27:43.640
And the brothers and sisters in Israel 


27:43.640 --> 27:45.977
really give a good witness in this regard. 


27:45.977 --> 27:48.645
But still my parents decided 
to make both sides 


27:48.645 --> 27:51.232
of the family happy 
and gave me an American name.


27:51.232 --> 27:54.694
That’s very diplomatic of them. 


27:54.693 --> 27:56.695
And how did your parents help you 


27:56.695 --> 27:58.863
to have a spiritual environment 


27:58.863 --> 28:01.866
in which you could set 
good spiritual goals?


28:01.867 --> 28:04.954
Both of my parents are 
really good students of the Bible. 


28:04.953 --> 28:07.288
And I would always see them 
prepare for the meeting, 


28:07.288 --> 28:09.875
and we would never miss a meeting 
without a good reason. 


28:09.875 --> 28:11.877
Additionally, my mom, 


28:11.877 --> 28:14.004
before she got married, 
she was a special pioneer. 


28:14.003 --> 28:16.798
Both her and my dad, 
they loved talking about Jehovah 


28:16.798 --> 28:18.800
and going out in the ministry.


28:18.800 --> 28:21.887
I know that your mother 
also made considerable effort 


28:21.887 --> 28:24.055
to cultivate your love for the ministry.


28:24.055 --> 28:24.848
Yes. 


28:24.848 --> 28:27.350
There is one experience I really remember. 


28:27.350 --> 28:28.768
I was very young. 


28:28.768 --> 28:30.896
She took me to preach 
in unassigned territory 


28:30.897 --> 28:34.734
in a city near Mount Hermon, 
and we preached for some hours. 


28:34.733 --> 28:37.318
And after that, 
she took me to eat my favorite food


28:37.318 --> 28:39.780
—hummus and french fries.


28:39.780 --> 28:43.000
Ah, and how has their example 
influenced you until today?


28:44.368 --> 28:47.036
Until today, I have good study habits, 


28:47.037 --> 28:49.457
I have deep appreciation for our meetings, 


28:49.457 --> 28:51.459
and I love talking about Jehovah. 


28:51.458 --> 28:54.000
And I still like hummus and french fries.


28:55.128 --> 28:57.130
Now, when you were in school, 


28:57.130 --> 28:59.258
you were different 
from all of the other children. 


28:59.258 --> 29:01.760
All of the other children were Jewish. 


29:01.760 --> 29:05.013
And we know that as a young person, 
it can be especially difficult 


29:05.013 --> 29:07.056
to be different from everyone else. 


29:07.057 --> 29:09.059
How did you handle that?


29:09.058 --> 29:13.230
For a while, I found it difficult 
to speak about my religion at school, 


29:13.230 --> 29:15.523
but then I thought to myself, 
‘I need to be proud 


29:15.523 --> 29:17.525
that I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.’ 


29:17.525 --> 29:20.028
So I just decided to speak 
with one of my classmates. 


29:20.028 --> 29:21.821
And when I told her, she said, 


29:21.822 --> 29:24.199
“Oh, now I understand 
why you are so different.” 


29:24.198 --> 29:26.368
And the conversation went so well. 


29:26.368 --> 29:30.000
I felt relief, and things were 
much easier at school after that.


29:31.040 --> 29:35.962
So, what advice would you have 
for young people who are in school today?


29:35.962 --> 29:39.130
I would say: “Just be proud that you 
are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


29:39.130 --> 29:41.133
“We are serving the best God, 


29:41.133 --> 29:44.051
“and tell your classmates 
about it as soon as possible. 


29:44.052 --> 29:46.639
“That will make you happy, 
and more important, 


29:46.638 --> 29:49.600
it will make Jehovah happy, 
and he will bless your efforts.”


29:49.600 --> 29:50.517
Yes. 


29:50.517 --> 29:52.310
Sister Gasi. 


29:52.310 --> 29:55.438
Sister Gasi, you serve in Serbia, 


29:55.438 --> 29:58.566
you live there, 
but you didn’t grow up there.


29:58.567 --> 30:00.652
No, I was born in Kosovo. 


30:00.652 --> 30:03.572
I grew up in the Roma culture 
with the Muslim background.


30:03.572 --> 30:04.615
All right. 


30:04.615 --> 30:08.368
I know that your father 
is fairly well-known in the Roma community, 


30:08.368 --> 30:11.205
and there are some deeply held traditions 


30:11.205 --> 30:15.500
that had an impact on you 
concerning your schooling.


30:15.500 --> 30:18.837
Yeah, culturally 
among the Roma people it was expected 


30:18.837 --> 30:22.675
that the oldest girl stop going 
to school when she is quite young. 


30:22.675 --> 30:26.012
So my father wanted me 
to stop going to school. 


30:26.012 --> 30:29.264
And honestly, I was very unhappy 
because of that 


30:29.263 --> 30:31.266
because I really loved going to school. 


30:31.267 --> 30:34.979
So I explained—
I told my father 


30:34.978 --> 30:37.773
that I will respect his decision, 


30:37.773 --> 30:40.316
but also I took the opportunity 
to explain to him 


30:40.317 --> 30:42.360
that I wanted to pioneer. 


30:42.360 --> 30:45.530
I explained to him what it means, 
and he agreed.


30:45.530 --> 30:46.740
Well, that was very good. 


30:46.740 --> 30:48.992
So you respected your father’s wishes 


30:48.992 --> 30:53.164
but also clearly set out 
your spiritual goals. 


30:53.163 --> 30:55.873
We’re glad he supported you in that. 


30:55.873 --> 30:57.876
But now that you’re out 
preaching in the town 


30:57.877 --> 31:00.170
that must have called attention.


31:00.170 --> 31:03.090
Yes. A neighbor approached 
my father about it, 


31:03.090 --> 31:05.092
and he said: “You’re Muslim. 


31:05.092 --> 31:08.012
Why do you allow your daughter 
to go house to house?” 


31:08.012 --> 31:10.764
And my father told him 


31:10.763 --> 31:13.183
he never had a problem with his girls 


31:13.183 --> 31:16.103
since they started to study the Bible.


31:16.103 --> 31:18.563
Well, your good conduct spoke out there. 


31:18.563 --> 31:22.150
Now, we know that, unfortunately, 
war broke out in the region 


31:22.150 --> 31:25.403
and Kosovo was affected. 


31:25.403 --> 31:27.696
And at that time, 
there were no brothers in the area, 


31:27.697 --> 31:29.992
there was no congregation, no meetings. 


31:29.992 --> 31:32.244
And even your father and brothers 


31:32.243 --> 31:34.328
were not there at that time, 


31:34.328 --> 31:37.248
leaving you, 
your sister, and your mother 


31:37.248 --> 31:39.250
to rely on Jehovah there. 


31:39.250 --> 31:42.755
And we know Jehovah can do that, 
but that can be very stressful. 


31:42.755 --> 31:45.840
But there was 
an additional situation that arose. 


31:45.840 --> 31:47.843
Tell us about that.


31:47.843 --> 31:50.845
Our neighbor 
had a basement in his house, 


31:50.845 --> 31:53.682
and many of us
—where our area was bombed—


31:53.682 --> 31:55.934
many of us took shelter there. 


31:55.933 --> 31:57.936
Physically it was safe, 


31:57.937 --> 32:00.939
but people talked 
about how we were going to die 


32:00.938 --> 32:05.693
and about the horrible things 
that could happen to us, 


32:05.693 --> 32:08.613
and it was very discouraging 
to listen to that. 


32:08.613 --> 32:11.616
I realized that it was bad association. 


32:11.617 --> 32:14.704
I had to make a change 
to keep spiritually alive.


32:14.703 --> 32:16.121
All right. 


32:16.122 --> 32:18.874
So you had the basement 
which served as a bomb shelter 


32:18.873 --> 32:22.878
giving physical security, 
but it came with bad association. 


32:22.878 --> 32:24.880
So you said you had to make a change. 


32:24.880 --> 32:25.880
What did you do?


32:25.880 --> 32:27.257
We stayed home, 


32:27.257 --> 32:30.802
we read the experiences 
from the yearbook, 


32:30.802 --> 32:33.805
we held the meetings in our kitchen, 


32:33.805 --> 32:36.057
and also we read 


32:36.057 --> 32:38.727
and studied the Bible, 
we prayed together. 


32:38.727 --> 32:42.480
This built up our faith, 
and Jehovah helped us to endure.


32:42.480 --> 32:44.858
And what has been the result?


32:44.858 --> 32:48.028
Jehovah has given me 
the best school here at Gilead 


32:48.028 --> 32:52.698
and also the best association 
with my fellow classmates.


32:52.698 --> 32:56.536
Well, we thank all of you for sharing 
some of your experiences involving decisions 


32:56.537 --> 33:00.457
that helped you be here today 
with Jehovah’s blessing. 


33:00.457 --> 33:03.794
Well, the scene of the world is changing, 


33:03.793 --> 33:07.713
but our faithfulness to Jehovah 
remains steadfast. 


33:07.713 --> 33:10.300
May Jehovah continue to bless the students 


33:10.300 --> 33:12.760
of the 141st class of Gilead 


33:12.760 --> 33:15.347
and the entire worldwide brotherhood 


33:15.347 --> 33:20.000
as we work shoulder to shoulder 
to Jehovah’s praise.


33:35.075 --> 33:36.327
Thank you very much. 


33:36.327 --> 33:40.164
We always enjoy 
the experiences in the field 


33:40.163 --> 33:42.665
as well as their personal experiences. 


33:42.665 --> 33:47.170
Next, Brother Ronald Curzan, 
a helper to the Teaching Committee, 


33:47.170 --> 33:50.465
is going to interview 
others from the class. 


33:50.465 --> 33:56.000
And the question in his theme 
is “How Will You Use Your Gift?”


33:57.222 --> 33:59.975
We all love gifts. 


33:59.975 --> 34:03.812
We love to receive gifts, 
and we like to give gifts. 


34:03.812 --> 34:05.814
And where do we get that from? 


34:05.813 --> 34:08.733
The originator of gift-giving, 
Jehovah God. 


34:08.733 --> 34:12.988
He loves to give 
‘good gifts and perfect presents.’ 


34:12.988 --> 34:16.783
And of Jehovah’s gifts, 
Insight on the Scriptures says 


34:16.783 --> 34:20.203
that ‘Assignments of service 
in God’s organization 


34:20.203 --> 34:23.123
‘are really gifts from Jehovah. 


34:23.123 --> 34:27.335
‘Those favored with assignments of service 
by God’s undeserved kindness 


34:27.335 --> 34:30.338
are also called “gifts in men”’. 


34:30.338 --> 34:32.840
And we can say gifts in women. 


34:32.840 --> 34:35.760
And what do they do with this gift? 


34:35.760 --> 34:40.015
‘They’re given to the congregation 
in order that its members individually 


34:40.015 --> 34:44.393
might be built up 
and attain maturity.’ 


34:44.393 --> 34:48.023
Gilead School is a precious gift from Jehovah 


34:48.023 --> 34:52.193
that has enabled 141 classes to do just that


34:52.193 --> 34:56.030
—build up their brothers and their sisters. 


34:56.030 --> 35:01.160
The question is, 
How will the 141st class use this gift? 


35:01.160 --> 35:03.163
Let’s find out. 


35:03.163 --> 35:06.081
We have four students 
that we would like to interview


35:06.082 --> 35:08.335
—two single students 
and a married couple. 


35:08.335 --> 35:13.007
First of all, we have Anita Schumi, 
who is originally from Austria. 


35:13.007 --> 35:15.842
We have Ben Pritchard, 
from Britain, 


35:15.842 --> 35:18.929
and a married couple 
from the United States, 


35:18.928 --> 35:22.015
Niell and Deanne Ryan. 


35:22.015 --> 35:25.352
In preparing for this interview, 
it was very heartwarming to learn 


35:25.352 --> 35:29.982
that all four of you received 
a precious gift from Jehovah 


35:29.982 --> 35:34.319
and that is being raised 
in the truth by God-fearing parents 


35:34.318 --> 35:37.696
who instilled a love 
for Jehovah in your hearts 


35:37.697 --> 35:40.075
as well as the pioneer spirit. 


35:40.075 --> 35:43.162
So eventually all four of you pioneered. 


35:43.162 --> 35:44.705
But here’s a question. 


35:44.705 --> 35:46.247
We’ll start out with Anita. 


35:46.247 --> 35:49.669
What other gifts of service 
did you receive from Jehovah 


35:49.668 --> 35:52.295
before coming to Gilead?


35:52.295 --> 35:56.383
After my schooling, 
I moved to France and started pioneering. 


35:56.383 --> 35:59.135
There were many Tamil-speaking people 
in the territory, 


35:59.135 --> 36:03.140
so I started learning that language 
and finally moved to Asia. 


36:03.140 --> 36:05.725
Then I was invited 
to serve in the Tamil field 


36:05.725 --> 36:08.395
in Germany as a special pioneer. 


36:08.395 --> 36:10.730
And after seven wonderful years there, 


36:10.730 --> 36:13.817
I was sent back to Asia, 
where I now am.


36:13.817 --> 36:15.402
Thank you. 
And, Ben.


36:15.402 --> 36:17.404
A few years after attending 


36:17.403 --> 36:19.698
the Ministerial Training School in England, 


36:19.698 --> 36:22.866
I was assigned to Burkina Faso, 
in West Africa, 


36:22.867 --> 36:26.747
serving as a missionary, which is where 
I’ve been serving up until now. 


36:26.747 --> 36:29.792
A big challenge for me was learning 


36:29.792 --> 36:32.835
the local African language called Mooré. 


36:32.835 --> 36:37.007
And after about a year or so 
of learning and struggling with the language, 


36:37.007 --> 36:40.135
I wasn’t really up to reading the paragraphs 


36:40.135 --> 36:42.178
or saying a prayer at the book study. 


36:42.178 --> 36:44.931
However, it was 
at that point that I was invited 


36:44.932 --> 36:48.769
to take up the traveling work 
on a circuit in that very language. 


36:48.768 --> 36:53.021
In fact, the first full-length talk 
that I did in the language 


36:53.022 --> 36:56.109
was the needs of the circuit 
at the circuit assembly. 


36:56.108 --> 37:00.613
But with holy spirit and a lot of patience 
on the part of the brothers, 


37:00.613 --> 37:04.000
I was able gradually to get 
to grasp with the challenge.


37:05.202 --> 37:05.952
Jehovah certainly helped you. 


37:05.952 --> 37:06.787
Deanne.


37:06.787 --> 37:08.789
Well, after Niell and I were married, 


37:08.788 --> 37:10.790
I went and joined him at Brooklyn Bethel, 


37:10.790 --> 37:13.752
and we served there together until 2004. 


37:13.752 --> 37:17.422
And then we left to assist family, 
and we pioneered together. 


37:17.422 --> 37:20.509
And then in 2009, 
our circumstances opened up 


37:20.508 --> 37:22.760
and we reapplied for Bethel service. 


37:22.760 --> 37:24.888
However, we were encouraged at that time 


37:24.888 --> 37:27.056
to pursue other theocratic goals. 


37:27.057 --> 37:31.000
So that’s when we started considering 
serving in a foreign country.


37:32.145 --> 37:34.815
And I must say, 
we were definitely nervous 


37:34.815 --> 37:36.858
about going to another country—foreign. 


37:36.858 --> 37:38.901
But we prayed about it, 
and we did research. 


37:38.902 --> 37:42.905
And then we wrote 31 letters 
to various branches 


37:42.905 --> 37:45.158
to see if we could serve in their territory, 


37:45.158 --> 37:47.576
and we got invited to serve in Ghana. 


37:47.577 --> 37:50.497
So we’ve been at the Ghana branch 
for almost six years now. 


37:50.497 --> 37:52.582
And although we 
were very hesitant at first, 


37:52.582 --> 37:56.000
we’re very glad we moved, 
and we enjoy that assignment very much.


37:57.045 --> 38:00.965
So, no doubt, serving in a foreign country 
has so many blessings, 


38:00.965 --> 38:04.468
so many rewards, 
but also it has its challenges. 


38:04.468 --> 38:06.971
So how have the local brothers and sisters 


38:06.972 --> 38:10.934
become “gifts in men” and gifts in women 
to help you to adjust? 


38:10.933 --> 38:12.935
Anita.


38:12.935 --> 38:16.438
Not only did they give me 
a lot of practical help to settle in, 


38:16.438 --> 38:19.608
they also patiently explained 
to me the meaning 


38:19.608 --> 38:22.403
and the feelings behind cultural habits. 


38:22.403 --> 38:24.823
And that’s worth so much in order to adapt. 


38:24.823 --> 38:27.991
So despite cultural differences initially, 


38:27.992 --> 38:30.495
many brothers
—they took me in like family. 


38:30.495 --> 38:34.875
I realized how much more I have in common 
with my brothers in other countries 


38:34.875 --> 38:39.628
than with people from my birth country 
or my language or my color 


38:39.628 --> 38:41.631
who don’t love Jehovah. 


38:41.632 --> 38:46.302
Listening to my brothers express their love 
for the same Father I love 


38:46.302 --> 38:49.139
and seeing how he blesses them 
and helps them 


38:49.138 --> 38:51.558
as he helps me, 
I feel very close to them. 


38:51.558 --> 38:53.476
I feel at home. 


38:53.477 --> 38:55.979
We have a family wherever we go in the world. 


38:55.978 --> 38:58.146
We don’t only call each other 


38:58.147 --> 39:00.900
brothers and sisters, 
we really are. 


39:00.900 --> 39:02.902
What a gift! 


39:02.902 --> 39:06.322
And through their marvelous example
—many in this family—


39:06.322 --> 39:09.325
they taught me 
valuable lessons in endurance, 


39:09.325 --> 39:12.870
patience, devotion, 
hospitality, and so on. 


39:12.870 --> 39:16.875
They trained me 
so that I could even come here. 


39:16.875 --> 39:19.668
They are a very precious gift to me.


39:19.668 --> 39:20.378
Thank you for sharing that. 


39:20.378 --> 39:21.671
Ben.


39:21.672 --> 39:24.465
My color means that everywhere I go 


39:24.465 --> 39:27.552
I stand out as different to everyone else. 


39:27.552 --> 39:31.640
Serving in the traveling work in rural areas, 


39:31.640 --> 39:34.392
it’s very, very rare to see white people. 


39:34.392 --> 39:37.937
So the word that I hear 
called out to me by the local people 


39:37.937 --> 39:41.609
more than anything else
—from morning to evening—


39:41.608 --> 39:44.401
is Nasara, which means “white man.” 


39:44.402 --> 39:47.947
It means that whatever efforts you make 


39:47.947 --> 39:51.702
to learn the local language and the customs, 


39:51.702 --> 39:54.537
you’re nearly always viewed as an outsider. 


39:54.537 --> 39:58.207
So in contrast, though, the friendship 


39:58.207 --> 40:01.795
and support that I enjoy 
from the local brothers 


40:01.795 --> 40:03.963
really is a gift. 


40:03.963 --> 40:08.343
Being taken in by the brothers, 
eating with them, 


40:08.343 --> 40:12.180
living with their family, 
and being treated by them as family, 


40:12.180 --> 40:14.182
whilst outsiders look on


40:14.182 --> 40:16.852
—perhaps surprised—
that really is special. 


40:16.852 --> 40:20.939
A favorite moment for me in service 
is when an African brother 


40:20.938 --> 40:24.775
working with me 
will introduce me as “my brother.” 


40:24.775 --> 40:27.278
Sometimes the reaction 
from the householder is: 


40:27.278 --> 40:30.531
“How can he be your brother? 
He’s white and you’re black.” 


40:30.532 --> 40:32.909
Then often the reaction will come 
from the brother, 


40:32.908 --> 40:36.871
“Well, he’s more my brother than anyone 
born in the same village as me.” 


40:36.872 --> 40:41.209
So when you hear that kind of statement, 
in those circumstances, it’s really a gift. 


40:41.208 --> 40:46.130
But more than that, 
I think that the support and friendship 


40:46.130 --> 40:49.050
from so many brothers 
in my assignment has helped me 


40:49.050 --> 40:51.803
to keep a positive attitude. 


40:51.803 --> 40:54.973
And I can really say it’s because of that, 
it’s because of them, 


40:54.973 --> 40:57.891
that I qualify to be here 


40:57.892 --> 41:01.689
and to enjoy 
this undeserved privilege of Gilead. 


41:01.688 --> 41:04.106
Because of that, 
I really feel the responsibility 


41:04.107 --> 41:07.735
now to go back, get to work, 
and to pass onto others 


41:07.735 --> 41:10.655
the gift that I’ve been privileged 
to receive here.


41:10.655 --> 41:11.280
Thank you. 


41:11.280 --> 41:14.742
And going to Ghana, 
what about you, Deanne? 


41:14.742 --> 41:16.745
What do you think 
about the local brothers and sisters? 


41:16.745 --> 41:18.997
How have they helped you?


41:18.997 --> 41:21.667
I really appreciate the kindness 
of the brothers and sisters in Ghana. 


41:21.667 --> 41:23.627
They go out of their way to help you. 


41:23.627 --> 41:25.504
And I remember 
when I was new to the country, 


41:25.503 --> 41:28.715
going out in the ministry, 
I met so many interested people, 


41:28.715 --> 41:31.508
but I worried how was I ever going 
to find them again 


41:31.508 --> 41:33.886
because the territory oftentimes doesn’t have 


41:33.887 --> 41:35.889
street names and house numbers. 


41:35.888 --> 41:38.766
So I would just write 
a description of where I was. 


41:38.767 --> 41:40.810
And the brothers and sisters were so kind. 


41:40.810 --> 41:43.647
They wouldn’t just tell me 
how to get back to my return visits, 


41:43.647 --> 41:45.899
they always physically took me there 


41:45.898 --> 41:48.526
even if they had to go 
out of their way to do it. 


41:48.527 --> 41:51.487
And that kindness has been repeated 
in so many different ways. 


41:51.487 --> 41:55.159
I don’t have time to relate, 
but it helped me not only to adjust 


41:55.158 --> 41:57.701
to my assignment in Ghana 
but also to stay in it, 


41:57.702 --> 42:00.705
and even to be able 
to come here to Gilead today.


42:00.705 --> 42:02.248
And, Niell.


42:02.248 --> 42:05.918
I’d say being in a new assignment 
away from family and friends, 


42:05.918 --> 42:09.921
you definitely have your ups and downs, 
especially in the beginning. 


42:09.922 --> 42:13.300
But that scripture at Colossians 4:11 


42:13.300 --> 42:16.888
helps me to see that my brothers 
can be “a source of great comfort” 


42:16.888 --> 42:19.056
or “strengthening aid” to us. 


42:19.057 --> 42:21.810
And we definitely felt 
that with the Bethelites 


42:21.810 --> 42:23.937
there in Ghana and the congregation. 


42:23.937 --> 42:26.732
They were like a second family to us. 


42:26.732 --> 42:29.650
They invited us over 
for hospitality right away. 


42:29.650 --> 42:32.862
If you looked a little down, 
you got an extra warm smile 


42:32.862 --> 42:35.030
or a hug or an arm around you. 


42:35.030 --> 42:37.283
They just accepted us 
as a part of their family. 


42:37.283 --> 42:39.868
I can definitely say 
that’s one of the main reasons 


42:39.868 --> 42:41.871
why we’re still in that assignment. 


42:41.872 --> 42:45.334
And we really appreciate this gift 
of the worldwide brotherhood. 


42:45.333 --> 42:48.126
It’s really helped us 
to be where we are today


42:48.127 --> 42:50.547
—tasting of this undeserved kindness.


42:50.547 --> 42:53.215
So a recurring theme that “gifts in men,” 


42:53.215 --> 42:56.552
gifts in women, 
really has helped you to adjust. 


42:56.552 --> 42:59.222
And I’m sure you will use that going forward. 


42:59.222 --> 43:02.767
Now, you have received 
many gifts of training at Gilead 


43:02.767 --> 43:05.187
thus far over the last couple of months. 


43:05.187 --> 43:08.857
Is there a specific gem or a gift 
that has really touched your heart 


43:08.857 --> 43:11.000
that you would like to share with us?


43:12.110 --> 43:14.612
So often I was made aware 
of how little I measure up 


43:14.612 --> 43:17.115
to Jehovah’s image in my personality. 


43:17.115 --> 43:20.368
And that awareness is good 
for developing more humility, 


43:20.368 --> 43:23.203
but it can be 
also quite discouraging at times. 


43:23.203 --> 43:26.748
It’s a struggle to come to that sound mind, 


43:26.748 --> 43:30.878
that balance between I’m not always 
an outstanding success, 


43:30.878 --> 43:33.380
but I’m not a constant failure either. 


43:33.380 --> 43:36.092
The course was a marvelous training 


43:36.092 --> 43:38.720
in how not to concentrate 
on my strong points only


43:38.720 --> 43:40.722
—that’s unrealistic—


43:40.722 --> 43:43.892
but also how not to concentrate 
on my weaknesses only 


43:43.892 --> 43:47.145
and then despair, 
because that’s unhealthy as well. 


43:47.145 --> 43:51.148
And that ignores Jehovah’s mercy 
and his patience with us. 


43:51.148 --> 43:53.485
And he showers us with his affections 


43:53.485 --> 43:55.862
and wants us to feel joy in serving him. 


43:55.862 --> 44:00.032
So I will continue to pray 
for Jehovah’s help in this regard, 


44:00.032 --> 44:02.910
because I want Jehovah to feel more joy 


44:02.910 --> 44:06.288
when he watches my thinking and my feelings 


44:06.288 --> 44:09.458
become more balanced, more pleasing to him.


44:09.458 --> 44:11.210
Very well expressed. 
We’ll remember that. 


44:11.210 --> 44:12.378
And, Ben.


44:12.378 --> 44:15.590
For me, one point was regarding Abraham 


44:15.590 --> 44:18.342
who after having as good as offered up Isaac, 


44:18.342 --> 44:20.804
never understood for the rest of his life 


44:20.803 --> 44:23.138
the reason why Jehovah asked him 


44:23.138 --> 44:26.558
to do that specific thing 
as a test of his faith. 


44:26.558 --> 44:32.065
However, he didn’t then 
go on to negotiate with Jehovah


44:32.065 --> 44:34.150
—either beforehand or after—


44:34.150 --> 44:38.195
as he had done 25 years before 
with Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah. 


44:38.195 --> 44:40.072
He didn’t obsess with the questions: 


44:40.072 --> 44:44.410
“Why? Why would Jehovah allow me 


44:44.410 --> 44:46.412
“to go through such a traumatic experience? 


44:46.412 --> 44:48.039
Why? Why? Why?” 


44:48.038 --> 44:51.333
He just got on 
with faithfully serving Jehovah. 


44:51.333 --> 44:56.255
And in the resurrection he, 
unlike us who understand the reason why, 


44:56.255 --> 44:59.092
he will come to understand 
the reason why and will feel privileged. 


44:59.092 --> 45:02.054
So the application that was made— 


45:02.053 --> 45:05.265
The question was asked of us, 
“What is your personal Isaac?” 


45:05.265 --> 45:08.433
Perhaps a situation in this system of things 


45:08.433 --> 45:10.686
that we’ll never be rid of, 


45:10.687 --> 45:15.107
or a change of assignment, a reassignment, 


45:15.107 --> 45:17.860
another difficult change in our service. 


45:17.860 --> 45:21.030
Rather than obsessing with the questions: 


45:21.030 --> 45:23.448
“Why? Why me? 
Why did this happen?” 


45:23.448 --> 45:28.328
Like Abraham, we should 
just carry on serving Jehovah loyally.


45:28.328 --> 45:29.288
Deanne.


45:29.288 --> 45:32.958
I really was affected by the lessons 
in the “Growing Spiritually” section. 


45:32.958 --> 45:38.005
In one of them, the instructor 
used a vivid illustration about— 


45:38.005 --> 45:41.050
He said we shouldn’t let 
the 20 weeks of Gilead pass by 


45:41.050 --> 45:44.095
without lancing the boil 
and cleaning out the pus. 


45:44.095 --> 45:47.390
Well, as a nurse, 
I instantly got a mental image of that 


45:47.390 --> 45:49.600
because if someone does have chronic boils 


45:49.600 --> 45:52.562
and they don’t do anything about it, 
it could make them very sick. 


45:52.562 --> 45:56.857
So I thought in a spiritual way 
if through my in-depth study of the Bible 


45:56.857 --> 45:59.360
I found negative qualities in my personality 


45:59.360 --> 46:01.403
and I did nothing about it, 


46:01.403 --> 46:05.741
that spiritually 
that could infect my whole personality 


46:05.742 --> 46:07.952
and make me spiritually sick 


46:07.952 --> 46:11.247
and then not as useful 
to Jehovah as I could be.


46:11.247 --> 46:13.249
And, Niell, a gem for you.


46:13.248 --> 46:15.835
Well, time and again, 
it was sounded down into our minds 


46:15.835 --> 46:19.713
and deep within our hearts 
that one remains useful to Jehovah 


46:19.713 --> 46:22.008
as long as one remains humble. 


46:22.008 --> 46:24.385
So I thought about that, 
that if I begin to think 


46:24.385 --> 46:27.263
that it’s all about me 
or if it’s about my wife, Deanne, 


46:27.263 --> 46:29.515
and really forget the much larger picture


46:29.515 --> 46:32.810
—it’s about Jehovah’s sovereignty, 
his name, the disciple-making work, 


46:32.810 --> 46:37.315
and loving and assisting the brothers 
we’ve been sent there to assist. 


46:37.315 --> 46:39.483
Well, then we begin to focus on ourselves, 


46:39.483 --> 46:41.610
and we damage 
our relationship with Jehovah, 


46:41.610 --> 46:44.530
and we damage those 
that we’ve been sent to help. 


46:44.530 --> 46:47.742
So throughout the course, 
Scriptural warnings were studied 


46:47.742 --> 46:50.745
on King Uzziah, King Saul, and Korah 


46:50.745 --> 46:54.040
who started out 
as humble but they went—


46:54.040 --> 46:57.293
they lost that humility 
and became very prideful. 


46:57.293 --> 47:00.253
They forgot the place 
that Jehovah had put them in. 


47:00.253 --> 47:03.340
And I won’t forget a point made 
by a Governing Body member 


47:03.340 --> 47:05.092
that was relating what Brother Knorr 


47:05.092 --> 47:07.845
used to say to the students
—to Gilead students. 


47:07.845 --> 47:12.517
He said that if you leave Gilead 
with a bigger head than a bigger heart, 


47:12.517 --> 47:14.519
then we have failed you. 


47:14.518 --> 47:16.770
And so we want to be 
very willing to be humble 


47:16.770 --> 47:19.148
and do whatever 
Jehovah has asked of us.


47:19.148 --> 47:23.861
So how do you plan on using 
this beautiful gift of Gilead training? 


47:23.862 --> 47:25.195
Anita.


47:25.195 --> 47:26.947
The whole Gilead experience 


47:26.947 --> 47:30.619
has stressed how much Jehovah 
cares for each of our brothers. 


47:30.618 --> 47:33.120
For example, at 1 Kings 10:9, 


47:33.120 --> 47:36.290
we learned that Jehovah 
put Solomon in place as king, 


47:36.290 --> 47:38.292
not for Solomon’s glory, 


47:38.292 --> 47:42.589
but he was used as a channel 
for Jehovah to show His love for Israel. 


47:42.588 --> 47:45.340
So likewise, 
Jehovah gave us this training here, 


47:45.340 --> 47:48.552
not for our glory, 
but for our brothers. 


47:48.552 --> 47:51.805
He equipped us to show 


47:51.805 --> 47:54.683
how to take care of our brothers 
in a more loving way, 


47:54.683 --> 47:58.395
to transmit the gifts 
and Jehovah’s love to them, 


47:58.395 --> 48:01.940
make them feel his care, 
and strengthen their attachment to Jehovah. 


48:01.940 --> 48:06.320
So I am eager to return 
and try my best to do just that


48:06.320 --> 48:09.698
—as a little thank you to Jehovah 
for the marvelous time here 


48:09.698 --> 48:14.245
but also as a thank you to my brothers 
back home to whom I owe so much.


48:14.245 --> 48:15.245
Very good. 


48:15.245 --> 48:16.705
And, Ben.


48:16.705 --> 48:19.125
It’s true that Gilead has given us knowledge, 


48:19.125 --> 48:22.628
but Gilead isn’t about knowing things. 


48:22.628 --> 48:26.381
So I want to keep in mind 
what Ephesians 3:19 says, 


48:26.382 --> 48:28.969
‘The love of the Christ surpasses knowledge.’ 


48:28.968 --> 48:32.388
Which means taking knowledge 
and then transforming it 


48:32.388 --> 48:35.223
into experience by imitation


48:35.223 --> 48:37.518
—imitation of Christ. 


48:37.518 --> 48:40.980
So I hope to be 
a better imitator of Christ 


48:40.980 --> 48:45.777
as I go back 
and serve with the brothers. 


48:45.777 --> 48:50.239
But that means 
not just imitating Jesus in my actions 


48:50.238 --> 48:52.991
but also coming to have 
the same feelings 


48:52.992 --> 48:57.000
that Jesus has about things 
and about people. 


48:58.998 --> 49:02.418
In addition to that, 
Jehovah really has used— 


49:02.418 --> 49:07.088
has given me 
so many “gifts in men” here at Gilead 


49:07.088 --> 49:10.425
that have helped me 
to increase my love for him 


49:10.425 --> 49:14.472
but also to have a real deep affection 


49:14.472 --> 49:16.515
for the organization that he’s using. 


49:16.515 --> 49:20.227
So as I go back, 
I want to be a factor in helping others 


49:20.227 --> 49:23.439
to come to see how much 
Jehovah loves them 


49:23.438 --> 49:28.276
and see how wonderful 
the organization that he is using really is.


49:28.277 --> 49:30.362
And last, we’ll hear from the Ryans. 


49:30.362 --> 49:31.864
Deanne.


49:31.863 --> 49:34.033
At Psalm 78:5-7, 


49:34.033 --> 49:37.035
it speaks of parents 
making known Jehovah’s reminders 


49:37.035 --> 49:40.665
to the next generation so they 
can put their confidence in Jehovah. 


49:40.665 --> 49:43.625
And I’d like to do something similar 
when I go back to Ghana, 


49:43.625 --> 49:45.377
especially with the young ones, 


49:45.377 --> 49:48.714
to share the many spiritual gems 
that I’ve been given 


49:48.713 --> 49:52.760
so that they can more fully put 
their confidence in Jehovah. 


49:52.760 --> 49:56.597
So I’d like to do that whenever 
I see them at the meetings, 


49:56.597 --> 49:59.975
or talking before and after, 
working with them in the ministry, 


49:59.975 --> 50:02.687
when they come over 
to visit me in my room at Bethel, 


50:02.687 --> 50:06.000
really, whatever opportunity 
I have to share those gems with them.


50:07.775 --> 50:10.945
And 2 Timothy 2:2 reminds me 


50:10.945 --> 50:13.697
that after we’ve received 
this beautiful training, 


50:13.697 --> 50:15.950
we have responsibility, 
and that is, in turn, 


50:15.950 --> 50:18.118
to teach or train others. 


50:18.118 --> 50:19.870
So as I go back to my assignment, 


50:19.870 --> 50:22.707
I hope to keep learning 
from the brothers and sisters there 


50:22.707 --> 50:25.585
but also to share these gems 
and gifts with them. 


50:25.585 --> 50:29.172
Not as a heavy downpour 
that drowns our brothers and sisters, 


50:29.172 --> 50:32.300
but as a gentle shower 
that encourages them. 


50:32.300 --> 50:35.010
For example, 
I’d love to work with the young ones 


50:35.010 --> 50:38.513
and share the experience of young Samuel 
when he went to the tabernacle 


50:38.513 --> 50:40.515
and how he served Jehovah faithfully 


50:40.515 --> 50:43.310
despite the wicked influence 
of Eli’s two sons, 


50:43.310 --> 50:45.437
and that they too can be faithful 


50:45.437 --> 50:48.774
despite the negative influence 
of this world around them. 


50:48.773 --> 50:51.568
If we share these gifts 
with the brothers and sisters


50:51.568 --> 50:53.195
—like a gentle shower—


50:53.195 --> 50:57.325
we’ll show that we haven’t missed 
the purpose of this Gilead training, 


50:57.325 --> 51:00.077
and that is to encourage 
and strengthen the brothers 


51:00.077 --> 51:02.372
and bring honor and glory to Jehovah.


51:02.372 --> 51:05.415
We’d like to thank all four of you 
for your heartfelt comments, 


51:05.415 --> 51:07.460
and you really expressed yourselves so well, 


51:07.460 --> 51:10.045
and you represented 
the rest of your class so well. 


51:10.045 --> 51:12.298
So with Jehovah’s help, 
we know that you will use 


51:12.298 --> 51:14.341
all the gifts 
that have been given to you 


51:14.342 --> 51:17.094
to be a gift to all those 
in your assignments. 


51:17.093 --> 51:20.000
Thank you.


51:33.568 --> 51:35.570
Thank you very much Brother Curzan. 


51:35.570 --> 51:37.823
That was very refreshing. 


51:37.823 --> 51:40.910
Appreciate them sharing those thoughts. 


51:40.910 --> 51:42.912
Now we invite you to stand 


51:42.912 --> 51:47.292
and we’ll sing this beloved song, 
number 29, 


51:47.292 --> 55:01.840
“Walking in Integrity,” 
song number 29.

00:06.402 --> 00:09.989
We’ve come 
to our principal talk


00:09.988 --> 00:15.826
for this 141st class of Gilead,


00:15.827 --> 00:18.039
the graduation.


00:18.038 --> 00:22.291
And we’re going to invite 
Brother Gerrit Lösch now. 


00:22.292 --> 00:25.545
I thought you’d find this interesting.


00:25.545 --> 00:28.840
This is the 141st class.


00:28.840 --> 00:31.968
We’ve heard that throughout 
the morning.


00:31.968 --> 00:35.000
Well, 100 classes ago,


00:39.852 --> 00:44.649
Brother Lösch was graduating 
from the 41st class.


00:44.648 --> 00:46.650
And I don’t know if heaven did it,


00:46.650 --> 00:49.570
but we had an Austrian in each one of those.


00:49.570 --> 00:52.698
So that’s very nice.


00:52.698 --> 00:55.616
And I don’t want to say anything, 
but he is getting a little older,


00:55.617 --> 00:58.954
but he still looks great, doesn’t he?


00:58.953 --> 01:01.206
Because he knew the sister in this class


01:01.207 --> 01:04.710
when she was just a tiny little girl.


01:04.710 --> 01:06.712
So very nice.


01:06.712 --> 01:11.000
And Brother Lösch gave me that information; 
so it’s bona fide.


01:12.635 --> 01:14.720
So Brother Lösch is going to speak


01:14.720 --> 01:18.000
on the theme 
“Make Good Use of Your Time.”


01:20.892 --> 01:25.647
What’s the time?
Well, anyway, it’s time to start.


01:25.647 --> 01:28.817
There are certain things
of which the richest


01:28.817 --> 01:32.570
and the poorest person on earth
have the same:


01:32.570 --> 01:37.533
number one, life;
second, two parents;


01:37.533 --> 01:40.036
third, free will;


01:40.037 --> 01:44.124
and fourth, time.


01:44.123 --> 01:48.211
Poor and rich
all have 24 hours a day.


01:48.212 --> 01:51.049
Therefore,
it’s not quite correct to say


01:51.048 --> 01:54.175
one has “no time” or “plenty of time.”


01:54.175 --> 01:57.595
All have the same—24 hours.


01:57.595 --> 02:01.975
The word “time” is 
an integral part of our vocabulary.


02:01.975 --> 02:03.977
What is time?


02:03.977 --> 02:07.564
Some say, “Time is money.”


02:07.563 --> 02:12.568
If we make decisions,
“time will tell” whether they are good ones.


02:12.568 --> 02:16.073
In the world,
some make wrong decisions and then,


02:16.073 --> 02:21.078
therefore, they have to “do time” in prison.


02:21.078 --> 02:24.998
When driving a car,
we may “make good time,” 


02:24.998 --> 02:29.628
although from “time to time,”
we may stop and have a snack.


02:29.628 --> 02:34.508
We are “taking our time”
if we do not hurry.


02:34.508 --> 02:39.430
We may still arrive “on time”
or even “ahead of time”


02:39.430 --> 02:41.890
if we “time it right.”


02:41.890 --> 02:45.018
But “at times,” we may still be late,


02:45.018 --> 02:47.938
especially if our “timing” was poor,


02:47.938 --> 02:51.000
which may not be “all the time,”
just “from time to time.”


02:54.110 --> 02:56.488
After we arrive at our destination,


02:56.488 --> 03:01.000
the “time has arrived” 
to have a “good time.”


03:02.410 --> 03:04.663
But on a more serious note,


03:04.663 --> 03:08.375
how does the Bible use the term “time”?


03:08.375 --> 03:11.170
Ecclesiastes 3:1 says:


03:11.170 --> 03:14.172
‘There is an appointed time for everything,


03:14.172 --> 03:17.719
‘a time for every activity under the heavens:


03:17.718 --> 03:20.886
‘for birth and for death;


03:20.887 --> 03:23.474
‘to plant, to uproot;


03:23.473 --> 03:26.810
‘to tear down, to build up;


03:26.810 --> 03:29.312
‘to weep and to laugh;


03:29.312 --> 03:32.190
‘to wail and to dance;


03:32.190 --> 03:36.445
a time to keep and a time to throw away,’


03:36.445 --> 03:40.698
like when we have to move 
to another complex.


03:40.698 --> 03:44.411
It is now 
the “acceptable time” to preach


03:44.412 --> 03:47.414
because “the appointed times
of the nations”


03:47.413 --> 03:52.000
are over and we are living
in “the time of the end.”


03:53.045 --> 03:55.547
Therefore, we should be zealous


03:55.547 --> 03:58.675
in line with the urgency of times.


03:58.675 --> 04:01.678
Jehovah blesses the work
and said that he


04:01.678 --> 04:05.265
“will speed it up in its own time.”


04:05.265 --> 04:08.643
The Greek adjective ai·oʹni·os can,


04:08.643 --> 04:10.978
as is evident from the context,


04:10.978 --> 04:15.000
signify both “long lasting”
and “everlasting.”


04:16.652 --> 04:18.654
From the first man, Adam,


04:18.653 --> 04:21.781
forward, time has been measured
in terms of years.


04:21.782 --> 04:25.994
Thus, Adam was 130 years old


04:25.993 --> 04:29.581
when he became father to Seth.


04:29.582 --> 04:32.500
Monthly divisions 
also came into use.


04:32.500 --> 04:35.878
By the time of the Flood,
we find time divided


04:35.878 --> 04:39.006
into months of 30 days,


04:39.007 --> 04:41.760
and a period of five months


04:41.760 --> 04:45.763
is shown in the Bible to equal 150 days.


04:45.763 --> 04:47.765
The same record


04:47.765 --> 04:51.000
also indicates that Noah
divided the year into 12 months.


04:52.938 --> 04:57.191
To track time,
a calendar is used for dividing time


04:57.192 --> 05:01.112
into years, months, weeks, and days.


05:01.112 --> 05:03.157
The world’s oldest calendar


05:03.157 --> 05:07.077
was discovered in a Scottish field


05:07.077 --> 05:09.245
at Warren Field,


05:09.245 --> 05:14.000
according to BBC News
from the year 2013


05:14.000 --> 05:19.130
and National Geographic
of July 15, 2013.


05:19.130 --> 05:24.000
It was excavated first
in the year 2004 only.


05:25.178 --> 05:29.683
To track time during the day,
also, sundials were invented.


05:29.683 --> 05:31.685
They are considered the first 


05:31.685 --> 05:34.730
time-measuring devices known to man.


05:34.730 --> 05:37.440
Dating to the 19th dynasty,


05:37.440 --> 05:41.068
or the 13th century before our Common Era,


05:41.068 --> 05:44.948
a few years ago, a sundial was found


05:44.948 --> 05:47.616
on the floor of a workman’s hut


05:47.617 --> 05:50.537
in the Valley of Kings,


05:50.537 --> 05:54.000
the burial place of rulers from Egypt.


05:55.917 --> 06:00.422
In 1675,
King Charles II of England


06:00.422 --> 06:03.134
commissioned that a small observatory


06:03.133 --> 06:05.843
be constructed in what is now


06:05.843 --> 06:08.555
the London borough
of Greenwich


06:08.555 --> 06:12.392
in order to find out 
the longitude of places


06:12.392 --> 06:17.314
for perfecting navigation
and astronomy.


06:17.313 --> 06:19.650
Two newly invented timepieces


06:19.650 --> 06:23.487
with pendulums 13 feet,
or 4 meters, long


06:23.487 --> 06:26.865
were installed
to make accurate calculations


06:26.865 --> 06:29.618
of the earth’s rotation.


06:29.618 --> 06:33.580
Noon Greenwich Mean Time
is the moment


06:33.580 --> 06:37.918
when the sun reaches
its zenith over any point


06:37.918 --> 06:41.713
on the Greenwich longitude line, 
or meridian, 


06:41.713 --> 06:46.175
from Latin meridianus, of midday.


06:46.175 --> 06:49.805
Based on this Latin word,
time before noon


06:49.805 --> 06:52.307
came to be known as ante meridiem,


06:52.307 --> 06:54.977
or before midday;


06:54.977 --> 06:56.979
and time after noon


06:56.978 --> 07:00.731
came to be known as post meridiem,


07:00.732 --> 07:04.000
or p.m., as we call it.


07:05.320 --> 07:09.617
Today, time is measured
for accuracy with atomic clocks.


07:09.617 --> 07:12.995
They are regulated
by atomic vibrations


07:12.995 --> 07:18.875
and are accurate to one second
in 80 million years


07:18.875 --> 07:21.878
—very accurate.


07:21.878 --> 07:23.880
Again, what is time?


07:23.880 --> 07:25.923
You have heard the saying


07:25.923 --> 07:28.343
“as time goes by”


07:28.343 --> 07:32.263
or “time flies,”


07:32.263 --> 07:36.351
but this is Scripturally
not quite correct.


07:36.352 --> 07:41.189
Time does not go
or walk or fly


07:41.188 --> 07:43.650
—we fly.


07:43.650 --> 07:49.488
And this is supported
at Psalm 90:10,


07:49.488 --> 07:54.076
where Moses wrote this psalm,
not David.


07:54.077 --> 07:57.497
And it says in verse 10:


07:57.497 --> 08:00.542
“The span of our life is 70 years,


08:00.542 --> 08:03.629
“or 80 if one is especially strong.


08:03.628 --> 08:06.631
“But they are filled
with trouble and sorrow;


08:06.632 --> 08:08.467
“they quickly pass by,


08:08.467 --> 08:12.637
and away we fly”


08:12.637 --> 08:14.639
—not the time.


08:14.638 --> 08:16.641
When a man dies,


08:16.642 --> 08:20.000
time is still there
and hasn’t flown anywhere.


08:21.647 --> 08:24.315
Again, what is time?


08:24.315 --> 08:26.610
Twelve o’clock noon in New York


08:26.610 --> 08:32.698
is twelve o’clock midnight
in Mongolia.


08:32.698 --> 08:35.118
When you cross
the date line westbound,


08:35.118 --> 08:37.620
suddenly you have lost
a day, seemingly.


08:37.620 --> 08:41.290
But did you really lose a day?
No.


08:41.290 --> 08:43.335
It’s just the perception.


08:43.335 --> 08:45.378
To the contrary,


08:45.378 --> 08:48.173
when you come
from Japan to the United States,


08:48.173 --> 08:50.800
you seem to gain a day


08:50.800 --> 08:53.678
crossing the date line eastbound.


08:53.678 --> 08:57.765
But does this change the reality of time?
No.


08:57.765 --> 09:02.000
You have not become a day younger.
Sorry.


09:03.605 --> 09:08.193
What’s the time on North Pole,
exactly on North Pole?


09:08.193 --> 09:13.198
If you stay on the North Pole,
does time move on?


09:13.198 --> 09:15.241
Something to think about.


09:15.242 --> 09:19.872
Really, time is an abstract concept
that humans have invented


09:19.872 --> 09:24.000
to explain, compare,
and measure what we observe.


09:25.710 --> 09:30.340
Sometimes, time seems to move
faster than at other times.


09:30.340 --> 09:34.343
There’s an old saying
that “a watched kettle never boils.”


09:34.343 --> 09:36.430
It’s true that when


09:36.430 --> 09:39.182
we are watching time,
when we are conscious of it,


09:39.182 --> 09:41.769
when we are waiting
for something to happen,


09:41.768 --> 09:45.271
then it seems to pass ever so slowly.


09:45.272 --> 09:47.274
However, if we are busy,


09:47.273 --> 09:51.528
if we are interested in and preoccupied
with what we are doing,


09:51.528 --> 09:55.573
then it really appears that time flies.


09:55.573 --> 09:58.535
Moreover, with older people,
time seems to pass


09:58.535 --> 10:02.497
much more quickly
than with young children.


10:02.497 --> 10:04.665
And why is this?


10:04.665 --> 10:07.377
One year added to the life
of a one-year-old


10:07.377 --> 10:10.505
means a 100-percent increase.


10:10.505 --> 10:13.175
One year added to the life
of a 50-year-old


10:13.175 --> 10:17.720
means just 2 percent more.


10:17.720 --> 10:21.683
The perception of time
is also subject to circumstances.


10:21.683 --> 10:23.810
When a couple in love meets,


10:23.810 --> 10:28.982
they wish time would stand still,
is it not so?


10:28.982 --> 10:33.279
But they cannot slow down
what is perceived as time.


10:33.278 --> 10:36.280
On the other hand,
when somebody is sick in a hospital bed,


10:36.280 --> 10:40.035
he might wish that time would pass
more quickly


10:40.035 --> 10:43.788
so he could recover
sooner and go home sooner.


10:43.788 --> 10:48.125
But he cannot speed up
the passing of time.


10:48.125 --> 10:52.088
Time is an observed phenomenon
by means of which


10:52.088 --> 10:54.215
we humans sense and record


10:54.215 --> 10:58.512
changes in our environment
and in the universe.


10:58.512 --> 11:00.722
In the universe,
time is measured


11:00.722 --> 11:05.435
based on the speed of light,
which is a constant.


11:05.435 --> 11:09.563
The Michelson-Morley experiment,
around the end of the 19th century,


11:09.563 --> 11:12.650
discovered that the speed of light
is the same


11:12.650 --> 11:16.487
regardless of the direction
it’s heading


11:16.487 --> 11:19.282
and regardless of the motion


11:19.282 --> 11:22.785
of the originating source.


11:22.785 --> 11:25.288
Light moves at about 


11:25.288 --> 11:30.126
300,000 kilometers per second.


11:30.127 --> 11:34.755
It takes about 100,000 years
for a beam of light


11:34.755 --> 11:39.760
to travel from just one end
of our Milky Way to the other end.


11:39.760 --> 11:41.972
And our Milky Way


11:41.972 --> 11:47.000
is said to have
200 billion stars like the sun.


11:48.603 --> 11:50.771
What you see


11:50.772 --> 11:55.152
when you look up at night
to the night sky,


11:55.152 --> 11:57.695
it’s not what is there now,


11:57.695 --> 12:00.323
but what was there in the past.


12:00.323 --> 12:04.618
When a light beam from a star
that is a million light years away


12:04.618 --> 12:06.621
hits the earth,


12:06.622 --> 12:09.082
it means that the object
that you now see


12:09.082 --> 12:13.504
was there a million years ago.


12:13.503 --> 12:16.213
To see what is there now


12:16.213 --> 12:18.966
and whether the star even still exists,


12:18.967 --> 12:21.595
you need to wait another million years


12:21.595 --> 12:24.597
until the light beam
from that place arrives at the earth.


12:24.597 --> 12:26.600
Just imagine!


12:26.600 --> 12:32.000
Looking at the universe,
we always look only into the past.


12:33.063 --> 12:35.900
It is estimated that the visible universe


12:35.900 --> 12:38.487
exists for 13 billion years.


12:38.487 --> 12:41.155
Most scientists agree that it
had a beginning, 


12:41.155 --> 12:43.533
so-called big bang.


12:43.533 --> 12:45.535
The Bible says:


12:45.535 --> 12:49.872
“In the beginning God created,”
and that includes the visible universe.


12:49.872 --> 12:53.627
The universe expands in all directions.


12:53.627 --> 12:57.880
Scientists have not found an end
of the visible universe


12:57.880 --> 13:00.967
with optical telescopes
or radio telescopes.


13:00.967 --> 13:05.972
But if one would continue
to travel through space long enough,


13:05.972 --> 13:10.977
logically one should come
to an area where there are no more


13:10.977 --> 13:14.689
stars or galaxies, just empty space.


13:14.688 --> 13:19.068
Some known galaxies
are moving into that empty space,


13:19.068 --> 13:23.238
or toward that empty space,
with about the speed of light.


13:23.238 --> 13:25.700
It’s very impressive.


13:25.700 --> 13:29.745
Some scientists say,
“Time does not exist.”


13:29.745 --> 13:33.833
It exists, however,
definitely in our perception.


13:33.833 --> 13:36.251
Man invented
the concept of time


13:36.252 --> 13:40.257
to be able to
measure changes.


13:40.257 --> 13:43.217
Did time always exist?


13:43.217 --> 13:48.097
Well, in Jude 25,


13:48.097 --> 13:52.019
we can read what
it says there


13:52.018 --> 13:54.436
from our own Bible.


13:54.437 --> 13:56.439
It says:


13:56.438 --> 14:00.026
“To the only God our Savior
through Jesus Christ our Lord,


14:00.027 --> 14:03.112
“be glory, majesty,
might, and authority


14:03.112 --> 14:06.032
“for all past eternity


14:06.032 --> 14:10.120
“and now and into all eternity.


14:10.120 --> 14:12.747
Amen.”


14:12.747 --> 14:15.209
Well, we know Jehovah
had no beginning.


14:15.208 --> 14:19.086
We have a hard time
grasping that.


14:19.087 --> 14:23.340
When Jehovah was alone
before he created the Logos,


14:23.340 --> 14:27.762
there was no change,
because Jehovah does not change.


14:27.762 --> 14:32.767
This helps us to understand
in what way Jehovah always existed.


14:32.767 --> 14:35.354
Jehovah is not subject to time.


14:35.353 --> 14:37.771
He exists independently
and outside


14:37.772 --> 14:41.192
from what we
perceive as time.


14:41.192 --> 14:43.654
Where the New World Translation


14:43.653 --> 14:47.740
translates “past eternity,”
in Jude 25, 


14:47.740 --> 14:49.825
the Greek original text


14:49.825 --> 14:54.080
says “before all time.”


14:54.080 --> 14:57.375
Surprise, surprise—before time.


14:57.375 --> 15:02.297
The conclusion is
that time had a beginning. 


15:02.297 --> 15:05.342
Is this a new understanding?
No.


15:05.342 --> 15:07.927
If you want to put down
a reference,


15:07.927 --> 15:12.057
Watchtower, 1982, September 1—


15:12.057 --> 15:16.685
September 1, page 22,
and paragraph 17.


15:16.685 --> 15:19.563
It says about this verse
in Jude 25:


15:19.563 --> 15:22.691
“Jude appropriately
ascribed glory, majesty,


15:22.692 --> 15:24.944
“might and authority
to Jehovah


15:24.943 --> 15:27.113
‘for all past eternity,’”


15:27.113 --> 15:29.573
or to quote The Watchtower,


15:29.573 --> 15:33.410
“‘before all time,’


15:33.410 --> 15:37.832
as men might know it.”


15:37.832 --> 15:40.210
We seem safe to say


15:40.210 --> 15:42.670
that time as we know it,
as humans,


15:42.670 --> 15:44.672
came into being when Jehovah


15:44.672 --> 15:48.092
started to create first the Logos.


15:48.092 --> 15:50.262
But what we perceive
as time now


15:50.262 --> 15:54.000
will continue forever
and ever in the future.


15:55.475 --> 15:58.812
At 1 Corinthians 7:29,
it says:


15:58.812 --> 16:03.817
“Moreover, this I say, brothers,
the time left is reduced.”


16:03.817 --> 16:06.694
Christ had given his disciples


16:06.693 --> 16:09.030
the sign of his presence
and had warned them:


16:09.030 --> 16:11.782
“Keep on the watch, therefore,
because you do not know


16:11.782 --> 16:14.119
on what day
your Lord is coming.”


16:14.118 --> 16:18.665
—Matthew 24:3, 42.


16:18.665 --> 16:21.877
The time left was “reduced”


16:21.877 --> 16:25.839
in the sense that those
first-century Christians


16:25.838 --> 16:30.676
had to live constantly
in expectation of Christ’s coming.


16:30.677 --> 16:32.679
Furthermore, they did not know


16:32.678 --> 16:35.806
how much time remained
for them individually


16:35.807 --> 16:39.060
before “time and unforeseen occurrence”


16:39.060 --> 16:42.397
brought their life to a close.


16:42.397 --> 16:47.402
As an important event nears,
there’s an increased sense of urgency.


16:47.402 --> 16:50.364
How can we illustrate that?


16:50.363 --> 16:52.990
Well, suppose there’s a wedding.


16:52.990 --> 16:57.453
The days before are very busy
in order to prepare well for the event.


16:57.453 --> 17:01.415
Even on the wedding day,
the bride will be urgently preparing herself


17:01.415 --> 17:05.043
so the wedding party
does not have to wait,


17:05.043 --> 17:08.380
which would be very impolite.


17:08.380 --> 17:11.968
If you have to catch a flight,


17:11.968 --> 17:15.430
you are perhaps urgently and nervously
preparing your luggage,


17:15.430 --> 17:19.183
making sure that you
are at the airport on time


17:19.183 --> 17:23.311
because you do not want
to miss the flight.


17:23.312 --> 17:27.109
Suppose a farmer has
a mature crop ready to be harvested.


17:27.108 --> 17:30.026
Suddenly, there is a storm warning.


17:30.027 --> 17:34.157
Dark clouds
loom at the horizon.


17:34.157 --> 17:37.577
The storm could destroy the crop.


17:37.577 --> 17:40.289
Don’t you think
that he’ll urgently organize


17:40.288 --> 17:42.540
his whole household
to go out to the field


17:42.540 --> 17:45.502
and begin to bring in the crop


17:45.502 --> 17:48.504
before the storm hits?


17:48.503 --> 17:51.173
Christians are involved
in a harvesting work.


17:51.173 --> 17:54.343
John 4:35 quotes Jesus, saying:


17:54.343 --> 17:57.638
‘View the fields,
that they are ripe for harvesting.’


17:57.638 --> 18:00.808
The harvest time
will soon be over.


18:00.808 --> 18:04.270
So are we making good use
of our time


18:04.270 --> 18:07.315
to help bring in the harvest?


18:07.315 --> 18:10.735
“The harvest is great,
but the workers are few,”


18:10.735 --> 18:13.738
said Jesus.—Matthew 9:37.


18:13.738 --> 18:16.781
And that shows the urgency.


18:16.782 --> 18:21.787
The hurricane
of the great tribulation is close!


18:21.787 --> 18:26.792
It’s a hurricane in the illustration,
so we need to hurry.


18:26.792 --> 18:30.672
When a woman
is close to giving birth


18:30.672 --> 18:34.634
and the birth pangs started
—the water broke, let’s say—


18:34.633 --> 18:37.095
then it is urgent
to rush her to the hospital


18:37.095 --> 18:41.098
or call a midwife
to come to the home.


18:41.098 --> 18:43.685
Jesus’ death was 
a much more important event


18:43.685 --> 18:47.230
than a wedding, a birth,
a flight, or a crop.


18:47.230 --> 18:50.983
As the appointed time
for Jesus’ sacrificial death


18:50.983 --> 18:54.945
drew near,
his sense of urgency increased.


18:54.945 --> 18:58.240
Jesus stepped up his activity
and his preaching


18:58.240 --> 19:03.245
as the time for him
to be on earth ran out.


19:03.245 --> 19:07.917
True Christians have always lived
with a sense of urgency.


19:07.917 --> 19:12.380
In the first century,
Christians in Judea and Jerusalem


19:12.380 --> 19:14.632
needed to “keep on the watch,”


19:14.632 --> 19:18.260
and that was imperative
because Jesus warned


19:18.260 --> 19:22.140
that the Roman armies
would come and would attack the city.


19:22.140 --> 19:23.640
And he said:


19:23.640 --> 19:26.310
“Let those in Judea
begin fleeing to the mountains.”


19:26.310 --> 19:27.728
It was urgent!


19:27.728 --> 19:30.230
Now more than ever,
the time that remains


19:30.230 --> 19:32.983
before Jehovah
destroys false religion


19:32.983 --> 19:37.113
through political elements is reduced.


19:37.113 --> 19:39.365
It is vital, then,
that we make


19:39.365 --> 19:43.618
wise use of our time
—the time that remains.


19:43.618 --> 19:44.620
How?


19:44.620 --> 19:47.873
As the apostle Paul explains
in Ephesians 5:16,


19:47.873 --> 19:52.836
we must ‘buy out the opportune time’
for “the more important things”


19:52.837 --> 19:57.425
at the expense of what is nonessential.


19:57.425 --> 20:00.302
We need to make every day count.


20:00.302 --> 20:03.472
Do we live as though the end 
could come at any time,


20:03.472 --> 20:06.059
or do we live
as though it is far off?


20:06.058 --> 20:07.851
Jesus warned:


20:07.852 --> 20:10.397
“The Son of man
is coming at an hour that you


20:10.397 --> 20:16.277
do not think to be it.”
—Matthew 24:44.


20:16.277 --> 20:21.115
Our pattern of life reflects
how much we trust in Jehovah


20:21.115 --> 20:23.785
by putting faith
in his prophetic Word,


20:23.785 --> 20:27.747
keeping the urgency
of the times in mind.


20:27.747 --> 20:31.584
Avoid a complacent attitude,


20:31.583 --> 20:35.045
like the people
of Sodom and Gomorrah had.


20:35.045 --> 20:40.050
‘They were eating, drinking, buying,
selling, planting, building,’ said Jesus.


20:40.050 --> 20:42.637
‘But on the day that Lot came out of Sodom,


20:42.637 --> 20:46.640
‘it rained fire and sulfur from heaven 
and destroyed them all.’


20:46.640 --> 20:50.352
—Luke 17:28, 29.


20:50.352 --> 20:52.564
It was urgent for Lot
and his family to flee,


20:52.563 --> 20:55.065
and it’s urgent for us too.


20:55.065 --> 20:58.000
We need to be prepared.


20:59.112 --> 21:03.992
We can prepare, for instance,
if we live in an earthquake zone


21:03.992 --> 21:08.245
by having our houses
built earthquake-proof.


21:08.245 --> 21:10.247
It costs more


21:10.247 --> 21:13.709
—more effort, more time
involved preparing the house—


21:13.708 --> 21:15.711
but when an earthquake hits,


21:15.712 --> 21:19.000
then we are
better prepared to survive.


21:20.925 --> 21:23.177
Revelation refers
to “the four angels who”


21:23.177 --> 21:26.180
have prepared the hour,


21:26.180 --> 21:30.685
or “have been prepared for the hour
and day and month and year,”


21:30.685 --> 21:35.648
units of time that we can understand.
—Revelation 9:14, 15.


21:35.648 --> 21:40.276
Seeing how prophecies
were fulfilled at specific times


21:40.277 --> 21:45.115
should inspire faith
in the God of “times and seasons”


21:45.115 --> 21:47.117
and in his Word.


21:47.117 --> 21:51.497
Soon the angels will let loose
the four winds of destruction.


21:51.497 --> 21:53.707
Are we ready?


21:53.707 --> 21:58.129
Jehovah is a perfect Timekeeper.


21:58.128 --> 22:00.631
Do we make good use
of what we perceive as time


22:00.632 --> 22:04.135
by attending meetings,
reading the Bible daily


22:04.135 --> 22:08.055
—even after Gilead graduation—


22:08.055 --> 22:10.808
going out in field ministry?


22:10.808 --> 22:15.605
Whereas, it is appropriate to take time
for leisure and other activities,


22:15.605 --> 22:19.150
it is good
not to waste time


22:19.150 --> 22:21.443
but keep the balance.


22:21.443 --> 22:23.445
If we use time wisely


22:23.445 --> 22:27.408
—buying it out
by giving priority to spiritual things


22:27.408 --> 22:31.745
and sacrifice less important time
as a payment, so to say—


22:31.745 --> 22:33.830
then we will see
the promise fulfilled


22:33.830 --> 22:37.460
to live forever
and ever and ever.


22:37.460 --> 22:40.503
No more need, then,
to worry about time.


22:40.503 --> 22:43.756
But now is the time to conclude my talk,


22:43.757 --> 22:46.000
so I would not go overtime.


23:10.200 --> 23:12.995
Thank you very much, Brother Lösch.


23:12.995 --> 23:15.288
We thoroughly enjoyed that,


23:15.288 --> 23:19.793
and we appreciate your hard work
and meditation.


23:19.793 --> 23:22.170
Now, we’ll share some greetings


23:22.170 --> 23:25.592
from various branches


23:25.592 --> 23:28.844
and highlight some of the things


23:28.843 --> 23:31.930
that they wanted to pass on.


23:31.930 --> 23:36.935
Angola: “With their faith strengthened
by means of a thorough study of God’s Word


23:36.935 --> 23:41.940
“and refined spiritual qualities,
the graduates will give a fine contribution


23:41.940 --> 23:46.070
to further stabilize
and strengthen Jehovah’s organization.”


23:46.070 --> 23:48.072
Then Argentina:


23:48.072 --> 23:50.074
“Although the school of Gilead


23:50.073 --> 23:52.158
“will soon become a memory


23:52.158 --> 23:54.161
[they didn’t know 
about Brother Herd’s talk]


23:54.162 --> 23:57.874
you will treasure it
for the rest of your lives.”


23:57.873 --> 24:02.126
Armenia: “We rejoice with you graduates
on this special day.


24:02.127 --> 24:04.464
“We’re delighted
to see how Jehovah is training


24:04.463 --> 24:09.843
more brothers and sisters
to take on additional responsibility.”


24:09.843 --> 24:12.596
Benin: You’ll find
this one quite interesting.


24:12.597 --> 24:14.890
This part I’ll pass on.


24:14.890 --> 24:18.978
“To all of you
[and this is to the students, or graduates]


24:18.978 --> 24:20.980
“Please, hurry up!


24:20.980 --> 24:25.818
We are waiting for you
out here in the worldwide field.”


24:25.818 --> 24:30.238
Bolivia: “Our hearts rejoice along with you,
dear Gilead graduates,


24:30.238 --> 24:34.160
on this day that brings so much praise
to our heavenly Father.”


24:34.160 --> 24:36.537
And then Britain:
“What a wonderful blessing


24:36.537 --> 24:39.374
“and unique privilege
it is for each student to have


24:39.373 --> 24:43.918
his or her faith strengthened through
an intensive study of God’s Word.”


24:43.918 --> 24:47.340
Burundi: “The five months of Bible training
that you have received


24:47.340 --> 24:50.677
“will give added impetus
to the all-important work


24:50.677 --> 24:55.682
of helping all who are
‘rightly disposed for everlasting life.’”


24:55.682 --> 25:00.477
And then Congo (Kinshasa):
“We ‘rejoice with those who rejoice.’


25:00.477 --> 25:03.439
This is, indeed,
a special day for all the graduates.”


25:03.438 --> 25:06.691
Georgia, the country: “Congratulations


25:06.692 --> 25:11.489
on successfully completing
the spiritually enriching course of study.”


25:11.488 --> 25:14.241
Germany:
“Please accept warm love and greetings


25:14.242 --> 25:17.579
“from Selters Bethel in Germany!


25:17.578 --> 25:20.038
“Jehovah, as our Grand Instructor,


25:20.038 --> 25:23.208
continues to educate his servants
in a wonderful way.”


25:23.208 --> 25:27.003
Haiti: “This graduation
is another proof that Jehovah


25:27.003 --> 25:31.050
does treat his loyal servants
in a ‘special way.’”


25:31.050 --> 25:33.593
And then France:
“We wish to send you


25:33.593 --> 25:36.346
“the very warm love
from the France Bethel family


25:36.347 --> 25:40.935
as you are about to receive your diplomas
along with your service assignments.”


25:40.935 --> 25:44.730
And Japan sends their
“warm Christian love and greetings.


25:44.730 --> 25:49.735
All graduates must have
experienced firsthand Jehovah’s loving care.”


25:49.735 --> 25:52.738
Kenya: “As you now
take the benefit


25:52.738 --> 25:55.198
“of this training with you 
to your assignments,


25:55.198 --> 25:59.411
we are confident that ‘Jehovah
will be with you wherever you go.’”


25:59.412 --> 26:02.624
The Netherlands: “Please accept
our warm love and greetings,


26:02.623 --> 26:05.960
“and may Jehovah continue to bless you
in your assignment,


26:05.960 --> 26:08.753
whether a new one
or one you are familiar with.”


26:08.753 --> 26:12.048
Nigeria sends their
“warmest greetings to all.”


26:12.048 --> 26:15.803
Paraguay passes on
their wish to have


26:15.803 --> 26:18.555
‘Jehovah bless all your
efforts in training.’


26:18.555 --> 26:21.600
Solomon Islands,
known as the Happy Isles,


26:21.600 --> 26:25.645
wishes to send their
“warmest Christian love and greetings.”


26:25.645 --> 26:27.982
Suriname: This is quite interesting.


26:27.982 --> 26:30.234
They share this point:


26:30.233 --> 26:33.111
“In 1959, two brothers
from Suriname


26:33.112 --> 26:35.949
“attended the 32nd class of Gilead.


26:35.948 --> 26:40.535
“Since then, many in Suriname
nurtured the dream of going to Gilead.


26:40.535 --> 26:42.788
“Now, 57 years later,


26:42.788 --> 26:47.333
we rejoice with the privilege of having
one more student attending a class.”


26:47.333 --> 26:49.420
And then Thailand:


26:49.420 --> 26:53.632
“From the Land of Smiles,
we add our happy smiles


26:53.632 --> 26:57.929
to yours and send our warm love
and greetings to all on this special day.”


26:57.928 --> 27:00.305
And finally, Ukraine:


27:00.305 --> 27:03.350
“During the past five months,
the Great Potter, Jehovah God,


27:03.350 --> 27:06.770
“was intensely molding you
so that you can now say:


27:06.770 --> 27:10.523
“‘We are all the clay,
and you are our Potter;


27:10.523 --> 27:13.110
we are all the work of your hand.’”


27:13.110 --> 27:16.613
So we appreciate
those sincere greetings


27:16.613 --> 27:21.076
from our brothers throughout the earth.


27:21.077 --> 27:24.414
Now, before we share


27:24.413 --> 27:26.831
the diplomas with you,


27:26.832 --> 27:29.627
we want to just pass on these statistics.


27:29.627 --> 27:31.629
The brothers like to receive these.


27:31.628 --> 27:34.046
For this particular 141st class:


27:34.047 --> 27:36.717
number of single brothers, 12;


27:36.717 --> 27:39.429
number of single sisters, 4;


27:39.428 --> 27:42.640
number of married couples, 16;


27:42.640 --> 27:45.100
total number of students, 48;


27:45.100 --> 27:49.980
their average age, 40.8;


27:49.980 --> 27:52.733
average years in the truth, 25.1;


27:52.733 --> 27:57.738
average years in full-time ministry, 19.0.


27:57.738 --> 28:02.283
So for those that love statistics,


28:02.283 --> 28:05.745
you now have them.


28:05.745 --> 28:09.917
Now, we’re going to have
the presentation


28:09.917 --> 28:13.545
of the diplomas
to the 141st class of Gilead.


28:13.545 --> 28:16.090
Brother David Schafer
is going to help me.


28:16.090 --> 28:18.092
He’s a helper to the Teaching Committee,


28:18.092 --> 28:20.177
and he’ll be helping as we


28:20.177 --> 28:23.389
pass on the diplomas


28:23.388 --> 28:26.975
to these graduates
of the 141st class of Gilead.


28:26.975 --> 28:29.000
So let’s take a look at them.

So at this point,
as we customarily do,


33:48.172 --> 33:51.174
we’re going to have
the class resolution letter read,


33:51.173 --> 33:54.000
and Brother Richard Cook
will do that for the class.


34:02.102 --> 34:04.939
“To the Governing Body
and the Bethel family.


34:04.938 --> 34:07.231
“Dear Brothers:


34:07.232 --> 34:10.527
“From the moment
we received our invitations to Gilead


34:10.527 --> 34:13.114
“down to this day of graduation,


34:13.113 --> 34:18.118
“we feel we have received a gift
of undeserved kindness


34:18.118 --> 34:20.995
“from Jehovah and his organization.


34:20.995 --> 34:25.375
“There is nothing that we have done
or could ever do


34:25.375 --> 34:30.380
“to deserve the instruction,
training, molding,


34:30.380 --> 34:35.385
“and loving attention that we have
received over the past five months.


34:35.385 --> 34:40.140
“Just as Isaiah 26:12 says:


34:40.140 --> 34:42.392
“‘O Jehovah, . . .


34:42.392 --> 34:48.899
“everything we have done
you have accomplished for us.’


34:48.898 --> 34:51.443
“Jehovah has given us the privilege


34:51.443 --> 34:54.988
“of experiencing close association


34:54.988 --> 34:58.908
“with you dear brothers
of the Governing Body.


34:58.908 --> 35:03.538
“Your humility,
your love for the brotherhood,


35:03.538 --> 35:05.998
“and your absolute determination


35:05.998 --> 35:11.003
“to follow Jehovah’s direction
have deeply impressed us.


35:11.003 --> 35:16.008
“We saw this clearly
during your faith-strengthening lectures


35:16.008 --> 35:18.261
“but also in the lighter moments


35:18.262 --> 35:21.139
“that you shared with us
outside of the classroom,


35:21.138 --> 35:25.435
“all the while preparing
for your move to Warwick.


35:25.435 --> 35:30.357
“Seeing your examples firsthand
has only made us more convinced


35:30.357 --> 35:32.400
“that this is the organization


35:32.400 --> 35:37.030
“Jehovah is blessing
and directing today.


35:37.030 --> 35:40.575
“What a true joy
it has been for us


35:40.575 --> 35:45.205
“to be part of this
delightful Bethel family!


35:45.205 --> 35:49.167
“You’ve been an example
in hospitality,


35:49.167 --> 35:53.672
“making us feel at home
away from home.


35:53.672 --> 35:58.677
“The excellent work of so many departments
has created an environment


35:58.677 --> 36:01.597
“where studying day and night
and night and day


36:01.597 --> 36:05.475
“was both possible and enjoyable.


36:05.475 --> 36:09.062
“An essential part of our learning experience


36:09.062 --> 36:11.064
“has been seeing the faith


36:11.063 --> 36:15.776
“of so many of you
long-time members of the family.


36:15.777 --> 36:18.239
“We have also learned
from the faith of you,


36:18.238 --> 36:21.825
“the many commuters
and temporary volunteers,


36:21.825 --> 36:24.493
“who willingly make yourselves available


36:24.493 --> 36:27.000
“to serve here at Bethel.


36:28.540 --> 36:33.545
“We are truly grateful to you,
our dear instructors,


36:33.545 --> 36:37.090
“for generously giving of your very selves,


36:37.090 --> 36:39.508
“both mind and heart,


36:39.508 --> 36:42.053
“in the way that you have taught us.


36:42.053 --> 36:45.098
“During our training,
your love for the Bible truth


36:45.098 --> 36:47.683
“that you were teaching
touched us deeply.


36:47.683 --> 36:51.270
“Your accuracy
and yet your warmth,


36:51.270 --> 36:55.150
“your seriousness
and yet your humor


36:55.150 --> 36:59.362
“showed us a balance
worthy of imitation.


36:59.362 --> 37:03.742
“Your obvious determination
to hold fast to the direction


37:03.742 --> 37:05.869
“of ‘the faithful and discreet slave’


37:05.868 --> 37:09.371
“has made 
a lasting impression on us.


37:09.372 --> 37:13.919
“As we go to our assignments,
we are resolved to do


37:13.918 --> 37:17.838
“as 1 Peter 4:10 states:


37:17.838 --> 37:22.843
“‘To the extent that each one
has received a gift,


37:22.843 --> 37:26.681
“‘use it in ministering to one another


37:26.682 --> 37:30.185
“as fine stewards
of God’s undeserved kindness.’


37:30.185 --> 37:33.605
“Gilead has been a priceless gift


37:33.605 --> 37:36.817
“from Jehovah through all of you.


37:36.817 --> 37:40.154
“Having been shown
such undeserved kindness,


37:40.153 --> 37:46.158
“we desire to use it to demonstrate
our love for Jehovah.


37:46.158 --> 37:50.038
“More than ever before,
we are determined to continue


37:50.038 --> 37:54.876
“to advance the preaching of the good news
and to strengthen our brothers.


37:54.877 --> 38:00.715
“It is our earnest prayer
that this be our life’s work,


38:00.715 --> 38:05.553
“all to the honor and glory
of our heavenly Father, Jehovah.


38:05.553 --> 38:10.000
Your brothers and sisters
of the 141st class of Gilead.”


38:36.250 --> 38:40.297
Before we have a brief moment


38:40.297 --> 38:44.467
for some concluding comments,
I have some more statistics.


38:44.467 --> 38:49.472
But this is of interest to us
with the attendance figures:


38:49.472 --> 38:52.975
Canada, 679;


38:52.975 --> 38:56.353
the United States, that’s 9,814.


38:56.353 --> 38:58.856
But this is who that includes:


38:58.857 --> 39:01.735
Patterson, 3,519;


39:01.735 --> 39:04.612
Brooklyn, 1,405;


39:04.612 --> 39:07.699
Fishkill, 763;


39:07.698 --> 39:10.826
Wallkill, 2,540;


39:10.827 --> 39:14.039
Warwick, 1,219;


39:14.038 --> 39:16.123
Curaçao, 61;


39:16.123 --> 39:19.293
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 134;


39:19.293 --> 39:24.131
Jamaica, 37;
and Puerto Rico, 136.


39:24.132 --> 39:29.000
So that makes
a grand total of 10,493.


39:40.940 --> 39:42.942
I don’t know what the delay was for,


39:42.942 --> 39:46.404
but they all know hundreds of thousands


39:46.403 --> 39:48.406
are going to see it pretty soon.


39:48.407 --> 39:52.785
And that’s really what I wanted
to just pass on to you.


39:52.785 --> 39:56.372
Just a brief review of some
of the key thoughts,


39:56.372 --> 39:58.542
and we certainly can’t touch
on all of it.


39:58.542 --> 40:00.544
But “See—The Cloud!”


40:00.543 --> 40:05.340
Follow the cloud, not men—
nice reminder.


40:05.340 --> 40:08.677
And of course,
you’ll always remember Brother Herd’s talk,


40:08.677 --> 40:13.222
and nice thought, “Smells ring bells.”


40:13.222 --> 40:17.019
Again, the translators
will have fun with that.


40:17.018 --> 40:21.438
And then the warning about ego;
it’s a good caution, counsel.


40:21.438 --> 40:25.776
And nice thoughts
about testing Jehovah and being tested.


40:25.777 --> 40:29.614
And, of course, all the good experiences
and interviews


40:29.613 --> 40:34.118
and Brother Lösch reminding us
to make good use of our time.


40:34.118 --> 40:36.120
So it’s been a wonderful program.


40:36.120 --> 40:40.417
What’s nice, too,
because you get into your assignment


40:40.417 --> 40:45.380
and because Jehovah has blessed us
with the broadcasting of the program


40:45.380 --> 40:47.840
—so that will be up there in due course—


40:47.840 --> 40:50.843
and now this has been permeating


40:50.843 --> 40:54.346
with excitement
with your family and close friends.


40:54.347 --> 40:56.850
And see now,


40:56.850 --> 40:59.352
with Jehovah’s blessing
on this project,


40:59.352 --> 41:02.855
you can go
and play it months from now.


41:02.855 --> 41:05.900
You might face some
discouraging circumstance.


41:05.900 --> 41:09.320
Well, go back,
and you can stop it


41:09.320 --> 41:11.322
—think about it.


41:11.322 --> 41:14.617
I mean, what a blessing,
especially for you graduates


41:14.617 --> 41:17.954
to be able to go back
and then just absorb more.


41:17.953 --> 41:22.958
So keep that in mind,
and Jehovah will bless you


41:22.958 --> 41:27.880
with good, good reminders
in the days ahead.


41:27.880 --> 41:31.300
So at this point,
we’re going to invite all—


41:31.300 --> 41:36.263
Now, we were supposed
to all be ready to sing this new song,


41:36.263 --> 41:39.516
and I know
my wife and I practiced.


41:39.517 --> 41:41.519
We hope you practiced.


41:41.518 --> 41:44.480
Those that know
how to read music,


41:44.480 --> 41:48.693
please sing out
and help those around you.


41:48.693 --> 41:52.613
It’s a beautiful song,
and I love the lyrics now.


41:52.613 --> 41:54.365
See, because we’ve had—


41:54.365 --> 41:59.162
One of my favorites is song 135
in the songbook we have at this point.


41:59.162 --> 42:01.749
But see,
this has a message here,


42:01.748 --> 42:05.168
and you sing and you keep
this in mind in your assignment:


42:05.168 --> 42:08.463
“We Will,” not might,


42:08.463 --> 42:10.881
“We Will Keep Enduring.”


42:10.882 --> 42:14.802
So take these lyrics to heart
as you go to your assignments.


42:14.802 --> 42:17.555
So let’s stand
and sing song number 154.


42:17.555 --> 42:19.390
And then Brother Leon Weaver,


42:19.390 --> 42:21.683
a helper to the Service Committee
of the Governing Body,


42:21.683 --> 46:06.305
will conclude with prayer.

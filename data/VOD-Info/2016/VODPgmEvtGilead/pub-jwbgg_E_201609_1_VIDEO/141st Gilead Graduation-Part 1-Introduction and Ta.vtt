WEBVTT

00:04.442 --> 00:07.110
So we welcome you to the graduation 


00:07.110 --> 00:10.948
of the 141st class of Gilead. 


00:10.948 --> 00:13.366
And as a reminder, 


00:13.367 --> 00:16.579
it’s requested that no flash cameras 


00:16.578 --> 00:18.746
be used during the program. 


00:18.747 --> 00:21.667
Any picture taken without flash 


00:21.667 --> 00:24.795
must be taken from your seat location. 


00:24.795 --> 00:27.882
No recordings of any kind are permitted. 


00:27.882 --> 00:31.802
Cellular telephones, electronic tablets, 


00:31.802 --> 00:34.889
or similar devices should not be used 


00:34.888 --> 00:38.183
to transmit any part of the program. 


00:38.183 --> 00:42.311
Program notes, 
whether hard copy or electronic, 


00:42.312 --> 00:46.359
should not be distributed to others.


00:46.358 --> 00:49.945
Now to begin our program, 


00:49.945 --> 00:54.198
we’ll open and sing song number 107, 


00:54.198 --> 00:56.285
“Come to Jehovah’s Mountain.” 


00:56.285 --> 01:00.372
And then, Brother Troy Snyder, a member 
of the United States Branch Committee, 


01:00.372 --> 01:02.709
will offer our opening prayer. 


01:02.708 --> 01:07.000
So we invite you to stand. 
It’s song 107.


03:51.543 --> 03:55.296
So the special day has finally arrived. 


03:55.297 --> 03:58.467
And we know your family and close friends 


03:58.467 --> 04:02.512
are pleased to be here 
to share this special occasion. 


04:02.512 --> 04:06.309
Of course, all the rest are enjoying 


04:06.308 --> 04:10.603
the moment with you 
because it’s a spiritual program. 


04:10.603 --> 04:13.356
And, of course, now we broadcast it later. 


04:13.357 --> 04:16.777
And the whole brotherhood, 
for the most part,


04:16.777 --> 04:20.572
is able to benefit 
from this special activity


04:20.572 --> 04:24.577
that for many years 
was only at Bethel itself.


04:24.577 --> 04:27.704
Now, 


04:27.703 --> 04:32.000
your class enjoyed 
the spring here at Patterson 


04:32.000 --> 04:36.172
and enjoyed the summer at Patterson


04:36.172 --> 04:38.465
—beautiful surroundings. 


04:38.465 --> 04:43.387
And Jehovah sure did bless 
his earthly part of his organization


04:43.387 --> 04:46.807
to have such a place to be educated. 


04:46.807 --> 04:51.312
However, now you’ll be leaving 
for your assignments, 


04:51.312 --> 04:55.000
and we’re going to be entering 
into the fall season. 


04:56.107 --> 04:59.779
So . . . 


04:59.778 --> 05:03.948
Most years that can be spectacular 
in upstate New York. 


05:03.948 --> 05:05.450
Of course, New England is renowned 


05:05.450 --> 05:08.162
for the beauty of the leaves changing


05:08.162 --> 05:10.247
—these radiant colors. 


05:10.247 --> 05:13.167
It’s just—
Jehovah just amazes us 


05:13.167 --> 05:16.712
with what can happen each fall season. 


05:16.712 --> 05:18.922
And it put me in mind 


05:18.922 --> 05:21.509
(because we’re soon to experience it, 


05:21.508 --> 05:24.093
and hopefully it’ll be 
a good season this year)


05:24.093 --> 05:29.015
of a picture I had in the past, 
and I appreciated it. 


05:29.015 --> 05:32.310
It was a beautiful picture of a lake 


05:32.310 --> 05:34.395
with trees surrounding the lake, 


05:34.395 --> 05:37.983
very nice, 
and it was a fall scene. 


05:37.983 --> 05:40.193
And so all of these beautiful trees, 


05:40.193 --> 05:42.195
the radiant colors around the water


05:42.195 --> 05:47.158
—it just kind of makes you think about 
the site there at Warwick 


05:47.158 --> 05:49.870
and what’s coming this fall. 


05:49.870 --> 05:52.915
And the reason I bring it up 


05:52.915 --> 05:56.793
is because 
the caption for the picture was,


05:56.793 --> 06:02.000
“Change—The only thing 
permanent is change.” 


06:03.550 --> 06:05.635
Is that true? 


06:05.635 --> 06:08.263
I see some heads going like that. 


06:08.263 --> 06:10.098
No, not all the time. 


06:10.098 --> 06:14.728
But we can understand why imperfect humans 
would come to that conclusion. 


06:14.728 --> 06:19.000
But Jehovah is permanently the true God. 


06:20.900 --> 06:23.653
Thankfully that will never change!


06:23.653 --> 06:27.365
And there are other things 
that don’t change. 


06:27.365 --> 06:32.037
Integrity-keepers that are 
already experiencing Jehovah’s favor


06:32.037 --> 06:35.832
—those holy angels—
they didn’t change, see. 


06:35.832 --> 06:40.587
But I bring it up because 
we’ve entered such a time 


06:40.587 --> 06:42.839
where all these changes are going on, 


06:42.838 --> 06:46.216
and your class has been held 


06:46.217 --> 06:50.472
during some historic changes


06:50.472 --> 06:52.474
—can’t minimize that. 


06:52.473 --> 06:54.475
It’s been quite phenomenal. 


06:54.475 --> 06:58.522
Now, when you think about 
the class you’re in 


06:58.522 --> 07:01.359
and the historic things 
that are going on, 


07:01.358 --> 07:05.486
yours is the last class to be held 


07:05.487 --> 07:08.000
when headquarters was in Brooklyn. 


07:09.323 --> 07:12.660
Yep. 
Had you thought about that? 


07:12.660 --> 07:15.000
Last one. 


07:16.707 --> 07:19.627
Now, many of us have 
already moved to Warwick. 


07:19.627 --> 07:22.629
So the headquarters staff 
that’ll be living there 


07:22.628 --> 07:25.423
is just moving in on it. 


07:25.423 --> 07:27.466
We’ve been moving for months


07:27.467 --> 07:29.510
—all these three different sites—


07:29.510 --> 07:31.930
and there’s more moving to come. 


07:31.930 --> 07:35.267
And we rejoice that it worked out 


07:35.267 --> 07:37.727
(as the Construction Project Committee 


07:37.727 --> 07:41.899
and the thousands that supported them, 
brothers and sisters), 


07:41.898 --> 07:44.651
things speeded up, 
and we got in there 


07:44.652 --> 07:47.445
or are going in there a few months early. 


07:47.445 --> 07:50.407
So that’s a rejoicing moment. 


07:50.407 --> 07:53.660
Tours, as was mentioned 
in the broadcast this September, 


07:53.660 --> 07:57.788
don’t begin till next year, 
but Jehovah was kind to you 


07:57.788 --> 08:00.791
and brought you over this week 
to see some of Warwick. 


08:00.792 --> 08:02.710
And I see your big smiles. 


08:02.710 --> 08:05.505
You enjoyed that, 
even though there are things 


08:05.505 --> 08:08.133
you might want 
to come back in the future 


08:08.133 --> 08:11.970
to see when the tours 
really do begin to function.


08:11.970 --> 08:14.138
So we know you’re enjoying 


08:14.138 --> 08:16.683
the experience here of being educated. 


08:16.683 --> 08:19.185
But if you think about it, 


08:19.185 --> 08:21.688
what does this tell us about Jehovah? 


08:21.688 --> 08:25.191
With moving—
 And I’ve been telling folks for some months, 


08:25.192 --> 08:28.445
“Years back we made the statement that 


08:28.445 --> 08:31.490
“(and this was according to 
some studies that were done) 


08:31.490 --> 08:35.368
“the death of a loved one, 
divorce, and moving


08:35.368 --> 08:38.246
—three top stressors in life!” 


08:38.247 --> 08:43.460
Ugh! And those that are moving 
can tell you, “Oh yeah!” 


08:43.460 --> 08:48.132
But it’s right up there 
with the death of a loved one and divorce. 


08:48.132 --> 08:50.134
So that’s stress! 


08:50.133 --> 08:53.636
So you might wonder, well, 
why, in the middle of all of this 


08:53.637 --> 08:56.055
and these changes 
we knew were going to happen, 


08:56.055 --> 08:59.433
we still had the class of Gilead. 


08:59.433 --> 09:01.436
You still were invited. 


09:01.437 --> 09:04.857
Why did we not say, 
“Well, let’s, you know, let’s be reasonable 


09:04.857 --> 09:09.862
and hold off and have one 
after this stressful period is over?” 


09:09.862 --> 09:12.530
The U.S. Branch Committee gives 
such beautiful support 


09:12.530 --> 09:14.742
to headquarters as well. 


09:14.742 --> 09:16.827
Let’s . . . 
Unh-unh. 


09:16.827 --> 09:18.870
And it just shows you 


09:18.870 --> 09:22.540
Jehovah directs this organization, period! 


09:22.540 --> 09:27.670
He’s governing it, 
and he just loves you


09:27.670 --> 09:31.007
—because this is addressed, 
these comments, primarily to you—


09:31.007 --> 09:33.050
and wants you educated. 


09:33.050 --> 09:37.847
And it’s just his warm embrace 
for you that you’re invited. 


09:37.847 --> 09:39.892
And you did enjoy it. 


09:39.892 --> 09:43.937
You had all the deep study and all of that, 


09:43.937 --> 09:47.315
but all that was going on around you, 
I think you’d agree, 


09:47.315 --> 09:50.818
didn’t affect how you 
were instructed and what was done.


09:50.818 --> 09:53.280
So it tells us that Jehovah—


09:53.280 --> 09:56.742
And you can see it, 
especially in recent years


09:56.742 --> 09:59.660
—so much emphasis 
on education. 


09:59.660 --> 10:03.457
And I am reminded 
of what Elihu said here, 


10:03.457 --> 10:06.877
and a beautiful thought here 


10:06.877 --> 10:10.422
in Job chapter 36, 


10:10.422 --> 10:13.967
Job chapter 36. 


10:13.967 --> 10:18.889
And we’re going to see where 
he makes this statement 


10:18.888 --> 10:21.348
in verse 22:


10:21.348 --> 10:25.770
“Look! 
God is exalted in his power.” 


10:25.770 --> 10:30.358
And then notice: 
“What instructor is like him?” 


10:30.358 --> 10:34.905
Well, you’re not supposed to try 
to come up with an answer. 


10:34.905 --> 10:38.825
That’s a question that answers itself. 


10:38.825 --> 10:42.245
“What instructor is like him?” 


10:42.245 --> 10:45.873
There is none
—no instructor like Jehovah God. 


10:45.873 --> 10:48.293
Unh-unh. 
No. 


10:48.293 --> 10:51.921
In fact, when we think about 
our heavenly Father, 


10:51.922 --> 10:54.132
the Grand Instructor, 


10:54.132 --> 10:58.554
we’re reminded 
of Romans here, chapter 11. 


10:58.553 --> 11:02.000
So if you would, 
please find Romans chapter 11. 


11:03.350 --> 11:06.603
And this reveals to us 


11:06.603 --> 11:09.230
why the only one 


11:09.230 --> 11:13.150
that never needed 
education or instruction 


11:13.150 --> 11:15.737
is our heavenly Father, 
Jehovah God. 


11:15.737 --> 11:19.992
And Jesus 
would tell you that as well. 


11:19.992 --> 11:23.119
He was instructed 
by his Father personally, 


11:23.118 --> 11:25.246
“firstborn of all creation.” 


11:25.247 --> 11:29.167
And when you think about 
the warm embrace and his love for you here—


11:29.167 --> 11:33.630
Because I know you’re closer to Jehovah 
than when you first arrived


11:33.630 --> 11:37.092
—has to happen with this course, 


11:37.092 --> 11:39.552
with the fine instructors we have. 


11:39.552 --> 11:44.000
But Romans 11:33, 34: 


11:46.058 --> 11:50.855
“O the depth of God’s riches 
and wisdom and knowledge! 


11:50.855 --> 11:54.692
“How unsearchable his judgments are 


11:54.692 --> 11:57.570
“and beyond tracing out his ways are! 


11:57.570 --> 12:00.615
“For ‘who has come 
to know Jehovah’s mind, 


12:00.615 --> 12:03.410
or who has become his adviser?’” 


12:03.410 --> 12:06.747
So you have to think about that 
and let that sink in: 


12:06.747 --> 12:10.417
The riches of his wisdom and knowledge


12:10.417 --> 12:12.544
—it’s just unfathomable! 


12:12.543 --> 12:15.713
You just have to let that sink in


12:15.713 --> 12:19.216
—‘the depth of God’s riches, 
wisdom, and knowledge!’ 


12:19.217 --> 12:22.220
There’s no way to search out his judgments


12:22.220 --> 12:24.513
—can’t trace out his ways. 


12:24.513 --> 12:28.601
That’s why we adore 
and worship Jehovah God. 


12:28.602 --> 12:32.105
And you can’t know his mind 
(none of us can) 


12:32.105 --> 12:34.898
until he reveals it. 


12:34.898 --> 12:38.151
That’s why sometimes 
you’ll hear brothers and sisters 


12:38.152 --> 12:40.614
(sincerely so, I’m sure) 


12:40.613 --> 12:44.700
kind of speculating, 
and I go: 


12:44.700 --> 12:48.288
‘Um-huh, OK. 


12:48.288 --> 12:51.000
‘Somebody thinks 
they know Jehovah’s mind 


12:52.458 --> 12:55.211
beyond what 
He gave us here. OK.’ 


12:55.212 --> 12:58.255
But we don’t follow creatures; 


12:58.255 --> 13:03.260
we follow Jehovah God 
because he’s our Grand Instructor. 


13:03.260 --> 13:06.305
And you’re a lot closer to him, 


13:06.305 --> 13:10.060
assuring yourself 
of being taught by him 


13:10.060 --> 13:12.062
when you get into your assignment 


13:12.062 --> 13:16.357
as well as on into eternity.


13:16.357 --> 13:20.529
Now, there are some fine thoughts 
prepared for you 


13:20.528 --> 13:22.738
from brothers to follow. 


13:22.738 --> 13:24.823
I thought I’d just give you 
a brief preview


13:24.823 --> 13:26.826
—just to get you to focus. 


13:26.827 --> 13:29.162
And the rest in attendance 
will be able to do that. 


13:29.162 --> 13:32.374
But this is for your benefit. 


13:32.373 --> 13:36.000
You’re going find out 
about a cloud. 


13:38.253 --> 13:40.756
OK, that’s all I’m telling you. 


13:40.757 --> 13:44.135
You’re going to find out 
about an enemy, 


13:44.135 --> 13:48.473
and it’s not Satan 
in this particular theme. 


13:48.473 --> 13:52.000
You’re going to find out 
about testing Jehovah out. 


13:53.562 --> 13:57.149
And then, 
we always enjoy your experiences. 


13:57.148 --> 14:00.610
So we look forward to that, 
and I know the pressure is on you. 


14:00.610 --> 14:05.573
You look forward to being finished 
and successfully so. 


14:05.573 --> 14:08.075
And then, 
nice interviews with some of you 


14:08.075 --> 14:10.995
about how are you going 
to use your gift. 


14:10.995 --> 14:15.833
And then, the principal talk 
about making good use of your time. 


14:15.833 --> 14:17.960
So it’s some nice thoughts, 


14:17.960 --> 14:22.590
and we look forward 
to the presentations by these brothers. 


14:22.590 --> 14:25.843
First, we have Brother Ralph Walls, 


14:25.843 --> 14:27.928
who is a helper 
to the Personnel Committee 


14:27.928 --> 14:31.473
and a member 
of the United States Branch Committee. 


14:31.473 --> 14:33.893
And Brother Walls has the theme 


14:33.893 --> 14:36.000
“See—the Cloud!”


14:47.948 --> 14:49.991
First of all, I’d like to say: 


14:49.992 --> 14:53.414
On behalf 
of the United States Branch Committee, 


14:53.413 --> 14:55.498
we really do rejoice with you. 


14:55.498 --> 14:58.751
And it’s been a real pleasure 
to get to know some of you


14:58.752 --> 15:01.000
—hopefully, most of you.


15:02.838 --> 15:06.216
But your example of love 
and appreciation for Jehovah 


15:06.217 --> 15:10.180
and the earthly part of his organization 


15:10.180 --> 15:12.848
is really motivating. 


15:12.848 --> 15:17.895
One couple in this class experienced 
what was a very emotional time 


15:17.895 --> 15:21.315
just after learning of their invitation. 


15:21.315 --> 15:26.278
The sister’s father fell ill, 
and then he died. 


15:26.278 --> 15:28.990
It was a real challenge for them, 


15:28.990 --> 15:32.000
but they accepted 
the invitation to come to Gilead. 


15:33.662 --> 15:36.874
A brother was special pioneering 
in his branch territory, 


15:36.873 --> 15:40.293
and then he was invited 
to the branch temporarily. 


15:40.293 --> 15:45.215
Another change came: 
He was reassigned as a special pioneer. 


15:45.215 --> 15:47.342
And then there were adjustments 


15:47.342 --> 15:50.304
for some of the special pioneers 
to regular pioneer, 


15:50.303 --> 15:53.598
and he thought, 
‘Well, I’ll go back to regular pioneering.’ 


15:53.598 --> 15:57.101
He was invited to Gilead, 


15:57.102 --> 15:59.562
but his father died. 


15:59.562 --> 16:03.399
He came; he’s here. 


16:03.398 --> 16:06.526
We could go on with other examples. 


16:06.527 --> 16:10.657
Now, what does 
this have to do with the cloud? 


16:10.657 --> 16:12.659
Well, let’s see.


16:12.658 --> 16:15.828
Please turn with me 
to Numbers chapter 9. 


16:15.828 --> 16:19.000
And we’ll read together 
beginning in verse 17, 


16:22.043 --> 16:25.000
Numbers 9:17: 


16:27.173 --> 16:32.095
“Whenever the cloud 
lifted from the tent, 


16:32.095 --> 16:35.890
“the Israelites would promptly depart, 


16:35.890 --> 16:39.227
“and in the place 
where the cloud would remain, 


16:39.227 --> 16:42.397
“there is where 
the Israelites would encamp. 


16:42.397 --> 16:46.775
“At the order of Jehovah 
the Israelites would depart, 


16:46.775 --> 16:51.197
“and at the order of Jehovah 
they would encamp. 


16:51.197 --> 16:54.909
“As long as the cloud 
remained over the tabernacle, 


16:54.908 --> 16:56.953
“they would remain encamped. 


16:56.953 --> 17:00.665
“When the cloud would stay over 
the tabernacle for many days, 


17:00.665 --> 17:05.043
“the Israelites would obey 
Jehovah and not depart. 


17:05.043 --> 17:09.423
“Sometimes the cloud would remain 
for a few days over the tabernacle. 


17:09.423 --> 17:13.093
“At the order of Jehovah 
they would remain encamped, 


17:13.093 --> 17:17.765
“and at the order of Jehovah 
they would depart. 


17:17.765 --> 17:22.187
“Sometimes the cloud would remain 
only from evening until morning, 


17:22.187 --> 17:26.857
“and when the cloud lifted in the morning, 
they would depart. 


17:26.857 --> 17:30.612
“Whether it was day or night 


17:30.612 --> 17:34.740
“when the cloud lifted, 
they would depart. 


17:34.740 --> 17:37.910
“Whether it was two days, 
a month, or longer, 


17:37.910 --> 17:40.497
“as long as the cloud 
stayed over the tabernacle, 


17:40.497 --> 17:43.540
“the Israelites remained encamped 
and would not depart. 


17:43.540 --> 17:47.962
“But when it lifted, 
they would depart. 


17:47.962 --> 17:52.800
“At the order of Jehovah 
they would encamp, 


17:52.800 --> 17:57.263
“and at the order of Jehovah 
they would depart. 


17:57.263 --> 18:01.516
“They kept their obligation to Jehovah 


18:01.517 --> 18:06.397
at the order of Jehovah through Moses.”


18:06.397 --> 18:08.609
Interesting. 


18:08.608 --> 18:13.111
That phrase “at the order of Jehovah” 
appears seven times. 


18:13.112 --> 18:18.034
You see, 
Jehovah was in total control. 


18:18.033 --> 18:21.620
When that cloud moved, 
the nation moved. 


18:21.620 --> 18:24.582
And did you notice 
how they would do so? 


18:24.582 --> 18:26.667
“Promptly.” 


18:26.667 --> 18:30.129
Now, whether it was ‘a few days, 
a month, or longer,’ 


18:30.128 --> 18:34.966
if the commandment was to leave 
in the middle of the night 


18:34.967 --> 18:38.680
or during the morning or day, 
it made no difference. 


18:38.680 --> 18:40.932
They would move. 


18:40.932 --> 18:42.559
Why? 


18:42.558 --> 18:44.560
They saw the cloud.


18:44.560 --> 18:48.940
Now imagine a camp 
of about three million people. 


18:48.940 --> 18:52.818
The watchmen have seen 
the fiery cloud at night. 


18:52.818 --> 18:56.571
It’s lifted up 
from the tabernacle, 


18:56.572 --> 18:59.000
and it’s pointing to the north. 


19:00.952 --> 19:05.415
Suddenly, after a year 
of camping in one spot, 


19:05.415 --> 19:08.500
the shrill notes of a silver trumpet 
cleave the air. 


19:08.500 --> 19:11.128
And after a brief interval 


19:11.128 --> 19:15.633
in which the camp waits to see 
if there would be fluctuating blasts, 


19:15.633 --> 19:19.886
which signaled the breaking up 
of the camp, they move. 


19:19.887 --> 19:23.599
Now, that means 
the whole camp of Israel 


19:23.598 --> 19:26.518
changed its position promptly. 


19:26.518 --> 19:28.561
Three million people


19:28.562 --> 19:31.315
—mothers shaking 
their children out of sleep; 


19:31.315 --> 19:33.943
daughters 
packing up belongings; 


19:33.943 --> 19:37.113
sons rounding up 
the family livestock; 


19:37.113 --> 19:42.118
fathers putting all 
of the items on the animals. 


19:42.118 --> 19:44.328
And in a little time, 


19:44.328 --> 19:48.875
the whole camp would be 
on the march to who knows where. 


19:48.875 --> 19:51.210
They certainly didn’t


19:51.210 --> 19:53.963
—until they made 
their next encampment. 


19:53.963 --> 19:58.050
They saw the cloud, 
and they knew 


19:58.050 --> 20:01.428
that it was Jehovah 
who was directing them.


20:01.428 --> 20:06.266
Now, you folks are examples 
of those who “see the cloud.” 


20:06.267 --> 20:08.602
You know that Jehovah


20:08.602 --> 20:11.230
—not the imperfect men 
that he’s using—


20:11.230 --> 20:13.273
is in total control. 


20:13.273 --> 20:16.526
And we humans find it 
generally difficult to change, 


20:16.527 --> 20:21.074
as you heard 
in our dear Brother Morris’ comments. 


20:21.073 --> 20:23.658
But Jehovah’s people, 


20:23.658 --> 20:26.995
from the days of Abraham 
down to our day, 


20:26.995 --> 20:31.750
have seen that we’ve had to be 
humble, flexible, and obedient. 


20:31.750 --> 20:36.005
We must maintain spiritual vision. 


20:36.005 --> 20:39.508
We have to “see the cloud.” 


20:39.508 --> 20:43.553
Psalm 78:14 reminds us 


20:43.553 --> 20:46.000
that it was Jehovah 
who used that cloud.


20:47.808 --> 20:50.185
There was a 39-year-old sister 
(single sister) 


20:50.185 --> 20:52.563
serving at Bethel for eight years, 


20:52.563 --> 20:56.483
and she made herself available 
for wherever she could best serve. 


20:56.483 --> 20:59.445
Well, she was asked to attend SKE, 


20:59.445 --> 21:01.572
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. 


21:01.572 --> 21:04.742
And she received an assignment 
that was shocking to her: 


21:04.742 --> 21:07.495
to a country 
where the work is restricted


21:07.495 --> 21:09.538
—single sister. 


21:09.538 --> 21:11.998
She said this, 


21:11.998 --> 21:16.378
“I am extremely grateful to Jehovah 
for this undeserved blessing 


21:16.378 --> 21:20.466
and also for the trust and support 
that I’ve been given.”


21:20.467 --> 21:24.929
A married couple who served together 
at Bethel for 25 years


21:24.928 --> 21:29.266
—he served before that totaling 32 years—


21:29.267 --> 21:31.977
they were recently assigned 
as special pioneers


21:31.977 --> 21:34.022
after all those years at Bethel. 


21:34.022 --> 21:36.024
You know what they said? 


21:36.023 --> 21:38.025
I’ll quote them: 


21:38.025 --> 21:40.193
“We have feelings, 
of course. 


21:40.193 --> 21:42.863
“Why would anyone 
want to leave Bethel? 


21:42.863 --> 21:45.575
“It’s easy to forget 
that when we came to Bethel, 


21:45.575 --> 21:49.662
“we had a preference 
but we agreed to be assigned anywhere. 


21:49.662 --> 21:52.832
“Lovingly, 
Jehovah watches how we display 


21:52.832 --> 21:56.000
submission and loyalty 
to his organization.”


21:57.878 --> 22:00.715
Now, in the United States branch territory, 


22:00.715 --> 22:05.177
there’s an ongoing effort 
to better utilize Kingdom Halls, 


22:05.177 --> 22:07.847
and this has resulted 
in many publishers 


22:07.847 --> 22:11.000
being assigned to different congregations
—more to come. 


22:12.810 --> 22:14.812
Now, commenting on the general benefits, 


22:14.812 --> 22:17.000
here’s what one circuit overseer said: 


22:18.607 --> 22:22.612
“This lets the friends know 
how to rely on Jehovah. 


22:22.612 --> 22:25.197
“This woke a lot of people up. 


22:25.197 --> 22:27.867
“Learn obedience, submissiveness, 


22:27.867 --> 22:30.160
“and how to follow direction. 


22:30.160 --> 22:32.497
“The elders 
and ministerial servants 


22:32.497 --> 22:34.832
did an excellent job 
at demonstrating this. 


22:34.832 --> 22:39.337
“The friends will even more learn 
to a greater degree 


22:39.337 --> 22:42.715
as they assimilate 
into their new congregations.” 


22:42.715 --> 22:45.175
Interesting. 


22:45.175 --> 22:47.345
Think about it. 


22:47.345 --> 22:49.388
During the wilderness trek, 


22:49.388 --> 22:53.183
Jehovah might have moved the cloud 
in the middle of the night, 


22:53.183 --> 22:56.061
and their locations 
may not have seemed logical 


22:56.062 --> 22:58.147
from a human standpoint. 


22:58.147 --> 23:00.232
Why would Jehovah do such a thing? 


23:00.232 --> 23:01.817
We don’t know. 


23:01.817 --> 23:06.239
Maybe he could see the movement 
of enemy camps toward Israel. 


23:06.238 --> 23:11.000
Whatever the case, it was vital 
that they would have responded promptly. 


23:12.995 --> 23:17.792
All of us today need to “see the cloud” 


23:17.792 --> 23:20.754
as we get closer to the great tribulation. 


23:20.753 --> 23:24.340
The time is now 
when we have to obey and not ask, 


23:24.340 --> 23:26.758
“Why did they make that decision?” 


23:26.758 --> 23:29.595
As one traveling overseer said, 


23:29.595 --> 23:33.000
“Don’t put a question mark 
where Jehovah puts a period.”


23:35.852 --> 23:40.522
You dear students 
have already shown prompt response 


23:40.522 --> 23:44.569
to direction 
that Jehovah’s organization has provided. 


23:44.568 --> 23:47.571
Please do it more fully. 


23:47.572 --> 23:50.032
And to the extent that you do,


23:50.032 --> 23:52.494
Jehovah will continue to bless you. 


23:52.493 --> 23:56.413
Don’t see the men 
that Jehovah is using


23:56.413 --> 23:59.041
—see the cloud. 


23:59.042 --> 24:03.000
And may all of us do the same.


24:12.472 --> 24:14.557
Thank you very much,
 Brother Walls. 


24:14.557 --> 24:17.225
That was 
very faith strengthening. 


24:17.225 --> 24:19.728
And I already have 
to ask for forgiveness. 


24:19.728 --> 24:23.440
I forgot to mention 
my good friend’s theme 


24:23.440 --> 24:27.820
(but he forgave me in the back) 
in the preview. 


24:27.820 --> 24:31.948
Intriguing theme 
from Brother Samuel Herd, 


24:31.948 --> 24:34.035
a member of the Governing Body, 


24:34.035 --> 24:37.000
“Let the Memories Sustain You.”


24:41.625 --> 24:45.462
Earlier, when Brother Morris 
didn’t introduce my talk, 


24:45.462 --> 24:48.000
I started to go home. 


24:51.802 --> 24:56.000
And then I remembered 
he’s imperfect.


25:02.228 --> 25:05.648
Thank God for the gift of memory! 


25:05.648 --> 25:10.570
If we couldn’t recall the who, the what, 
the where of our everyday lives, 


25:10.570 --> 25:14.700
our lives would be unmanageable. 


25:14.700 --> 25:17.620
We have a short-term memory. 


25:17.620 --> 25:22.000
We have a long-term 
(episodic memory, or semantic) memory. 


25:23.667 --> 25:27.589
Sometimes we look at our picture album 
on a rainy afternoon, 


25:27.588 --> 25:31.425
and what we see ignites memories. 


25:31.425 --> 25:33.427
The school is over, 


25:33.427 --> 25:38.224
but your memory bank 
is very much alive. 


25:38.223 --> 25:40.976
Now, whether we like it or not, 


25:40.977 --> 25:44.730
sometimes different memories 
of past events 


25:44.730 --> 25:49.000
pop into our heads 
for no apparent reason. 


25:50.277 --> 25:54.782
Smells ring bells. 


25:54.782 --> 25:59.412
A sister spoke to me when we were 
in an elevator, and she said, 


25:59.412 --> 26:04.000
“You make me think 
of my father, my dad.” 


26:05.835 --> 26:09.000
I thought: ‘It couldn’t be my looks 
since she’s white and I am black. 


26:13.133 --> 26:17.971
It couldn’t be my voice 
because I haven’t said anything yet.’ 


26:17.972 --> 26:22.000
I found out it was 
the Old Spice cologne that I had on. 


26:24.978 --> 26:28.273
Smells ring bells. 


26:28.273 --> 26:30.400
One happy thought can spark 


26:30.400 --> 26:34.155
an unending chain of things 
you experienced in school. 


26:34.155 --> 26:38.200
It’s like being in school 
all over again.


26:38.200 --> 26:41.120
Now, one or two of us may have heard 


26:41.120 --> 26:44.498
of Solomon Shereshevsky. 


26:44.498 --> 26:48.543
He was born in Russia about 1886. 


26:48.543 --> 26:50.628
He had a memory so perfect 


26:50.628 --> 26:53.673
that he could recall 
every minute of his life


26:53.673 --> 26:56.551
—and that in graphic detail. 


26:56.552 --> 26:59.680
His talent for remembering 
was discovered 


26:59.680 --> 27:04.643
when he was 
just a young lad of 19 years. 


27:04.643 --> 27:07.771
Now, correct me if I’m wrong; 


27:07.772 --> 27:11.000
I don’t think there is a solitary soul 


27:13.277 --> 27:18.574
in this class, male or female, 


27:18.573 --> 27:23.000
with the recall ability 
of Solomon Shereshevsky.


27:24.955 --> 27:27.415
Nevertheless, 
you do have memories, 


27:27.415 --> 27:31.962
and these memories
 will sustain you in the days ahead 


27:31.962 --> 27:36.675
as you work for Jehovah in his service. 


27:36.675 --> 27:39.303
Now, you’re not going 
to remember everything 


27:39.303 --> 27:43.140
you’ve seen and heard in class 
during the last five months. 


27:43.140 --> 27:45.142
Why? 


27:45.142 --> 27:47.645
There’s just no need.


27:47.645 --> 27:52.608
One authority by the name 
of Ashish Ranpura 


27:52.608 --> 27:55.986
made this comment, 
see what you think about it: 


27:55.987 --> 27:58.280
“The human brain 
is not good at remembering 


27:58.280 --> 28:00.992
“long lists of unrelated numbers, 


28:00.992 --> 28:03.785
“dozens of nonsense words, 


28:03.785 --> 28:06.538
or lengthy grocery lists.” 


28:06.538 --> 28:10.125
For these tasks, 
little more is required 


28:10.125 --> 28:13.670
than pen and paper. 


28:13.670 --> 28:18.383
Now, some in the medical profession 
have said: 


28:18.383 --> 28:23.263
“We all carry in our personal memory banks 
pictures and memories 


28:23.263 --> 28:28.935
of everything we have seen, 
done, and heard since birth.” 


28:28.935 --> 28:33.773
Others think that some things 
are so ordinary, so non-essential, 


28:33.773 --> 28:36.985
that they are not locked 
in our memory banks 


28:36.985 --> 28:39.405
but are cast off.


28:39.405 --> 28:43.000
What do you think, 
you students? 


28:44.493 --> 28:47.746
Think what you want. 


28:47.747 --> 28:50.000
There is no way for us to know. 


28:51.625 --> 28:54.503
Not now, 


28:54.503 --> 28:57.000
maybe later. 


28:59.090 --> 29:01.718
Here’s something you 
no doubt will agree with: 


29:01.718 --> 29:04.721
Jehovah can remember 
whatever he chooses to remember, 


29:04.722 --> 29:08.934
and he can forget 
whatever he wants to forget. 


29:08.933 --> 29:13.938
Now there’s a mind 
that tops Solomon Shereshevsky. 


29:13.938 --> 29:18.526
Jehovah’s memory, 
or mind, is unfathomable! 


29:18.527 --> 29:22.000
And here’s an interesting comment 
from the Bible. 


29:23.573 --> 29:29.000
It’s found here 
at 1 Corinthians 2:16. 


29:31.123 --> 29:36.000
It says: “For ‘who has come 
to know the mind of Jehovah, 


29:38.005 --> 29:40.465
“so that he may instruct him?’ 


29:40.465 --> 29:43.093
But we do have the mind of Christ.”


29:43.093 --> 29:46.513
No, we can’t know 


29:46.513 --> 29:49.850
in detail God’s mind. 


29:49.850 --> 29:54.730
He permits us to know 
just a little bit of it, 


29:54.730 --> 29:56.815
and we’re happy for that. 


29:56.815 --> 29:58.942
But here’s 
an interesting thought too: 


29:58.942 --> 30:01.904
He values us 
so much that he remembers 


30:01.903 --> 30:05.698
every detail 
of our faithful service. 


30:05.698 --> 30:08.660
Our genetic code
—he remembers that. 


30:08.660 --> 30:13.290
And all our years 
of memories and experiences


30:13.290 --> 30:16.043
—God can recall. 


30:16.043 --> 30:18.253
Should you die, 


30:18.253 --> 30:20.505
he will restore all this back 


30:20.505 --> 30:23.383
in your new brain 
and body that he gives you. 


30:23.383 --> 30:24.760
How do we know that? 


30:24.760 --> 30:28.930
Well, Malachi 3:16 
makes a comment. 


30:28.930 --> 30:31.142
This is what it says:  


30:31.142 --> 30:34.562
“At that time those who 
feared Jehovah spoke with one another, 


30:34.562 --> 30:36.605
“each one with his companion,


30:36.605 --> 30:39.525
“and Jehovah 
kept paying attention and listening.


30:39.525 --> 30:43.695
“And,” now note, “a book of remembrance 


30:43.695 --> 30:47.115
“was written before him
for those fearing Jehovah 


30:47.115 --> 30:51.870
and for those 
meditating on his name.”


30:51.870 --> 30:55.000
God’s thoughts are 
so much higher than ours. 


30:56.625 --> 31:00.670
In the Bible book of Isaiah 
as stated in the 55th chapter: 


31:00.670 --> 31:04.767
“‘For my thoughts are not your thoughts, 


31:04.767 --> 31:09.805
“and your ways are not my ways,’ 
declares Jehovah. 


31:09.805 --> 31:12.307
“‘For as the heavens 
are higher than the earth, 


31:12.307 --> 31:14.602
“‘so my ways are 
higher than your ways 


31:14.602 --> 31:18.000
and my thoughts 
than your thoughts.’” 


31:19.815 --> 31:24.000
So we can never fully understand 
all of Jehovah’s thoughts. 


31:25.445 --> 31:28.657
He gives us the ability, 
with the help of the holy spirit, 


31:28.657 --> 31:32.870
to recall the thoughts 
we need to apply in our lives 


31:32.870 --> 31:35.497
in order to gain his pleasure.


31:35.497 --> 31:37.624
So we need to do what? 


31:37.623 --> 31:41.000
We need to pray for holy spirit! 


31:42.170 --> 31:45.507
Now, each of our brothers 


31:45.507 --> 31:47.550
who will speak to you today 


31:47.550 --> 31:50.845
and those who have already 
had something to say 


31:50.845 --> 31:54.933
prayed for holy spirit 
before they ever stepped out here. 


31:54.933 --> 31:59.383
I prayed at length 
back there for holy spirit 


31:59.383 --> 32:04.108
so that what comes out of my mouth 
will build you up and not tear you down, 


32:04.108 --> 32:08.988
so that what comes out of my mouth 
will honor Jehovah and please him 


32:08.988 --> 32:13.451
and be a source of encouragement 
to all of my brothers and sisters 


32:13.452 --> 32:16.664
who are able to hear 
what I have to say. 


32:16.663 --> 32:19.458
So all of our brothers pray 
to that degree 


32:19.458 --> 32:22.668
before they step out 
on this stage before an audience 


32:22.668 --> 32:25.963
of your caliber, especially. 


32:25.963 --> 32:30.000
We want to make sure 
that what is said will be good for you.


32:32.012 --> 32:34.765
So God gives us the ability 


32:34.765 --> 32:38.227
to understand a few things 
because of holy spirit. 


32:38.227 --> 32:41.855
So we say to you, 
“Pray, please, for holy spirit.” 


32:41.855 --> 32:44.775
The spirit 
will refresh your memories 


32:44.775 --> 32:47.610
and stimulate 
your mental powers. 


32:47.610 --> 32:49.988
It’s the holy spirit 
that will help you remember 


32:49.988 --> 32:52.031
what you need to remember 


32:52.032 --> 32:55.035
when you need 
to remember something. 


32:55.035 --> 32:57.203
Now, note 
this promise of Jesus 


32:57.203 --> 33:01.416
at John 14:25, 26. 


33:01.417 --> 33:05.754
That’s John 14:25, 26: 


33:05.753 --> 33:09.340
“I have spoken these things to you 
while I am still with you. 


33:09.340 --> 33:11.635
“But the helper, 
the holy spirit, 


33:11.635 --> 33:16.932
“which the Father 
will send in my name,


33:16.932 --> 33:19.935
“that one 
will teach you all things 


33:19.935 --> 33:24.000
and bring back to your minds 
all the things I told you.”


33:25.732 --> 33:28.152
In the weeks ahead, 


33:28.152 --> 33:32.322
let the warm, 
beautiful memories 


33:32.322 --> 33:35.117
of Gilead sustain you, 


33:35.117 --> 33:39.622
and thank Jehovah for them!


33:39.622 --> 33:41.624
They gave me 9:00 minutes. 


33:41.623 --> 33:44.000
I used 8:42.


33:57.305 --> 34:01.000
I just had to delete about four things 
I was considering saying. 


34:05.480 --> 34:09.693
But, anyway, the translators 
will have fun with the Old Spice. 


34:09.693 --> 34:12.000
It brought back 
memories for me too. 


34:14.155 --> 34:17.617
I used to love Old Spice, 
by the way. 


34:17.617 --> 34:20.000
Used it a long time and then— 


34:25.083 --> 34:27.210
So Brother James Cauthon, 


34:27.210 --> 34:30.463
one of the instructors 
with Theocratic Schools, 


34:30.463 --> 34:34.000
has the theme 
“Ego Is Your Enemy.”


34:36.470 --> 34:41.392
There are a number of definitions 
for the expression “ego.” 


34:41.392 --> 34:44.560
But for our brief discussion 
this morning, 


34:44.560 --> 34:47.688
we want to focus 
on the definition of “ego” 


34:47.688 --> 34:50.441
as it’s used in “egotist”: 


34:50.442 --> 34:53.237
An unhealthy belief  in our own importance; 


34:53.237 --> 34:57.907
the notion of ourselves 
that distorts reality.


34:57.907 --> 35:00.494
Now, we’re not picking 
that subject 


35:00.493 --> 35:03.246
because we’ve noticed 
any particular problem 


35:03.247 --> 35:05.582
and, believe me, 
it’s just been the opposite. 


35:05.582 --> 35:08.960
But there is a tendency, 
or leaning, 


35:08.960 --> 35:11.253
that we have 
as imperfect people 


35:11.253 --> 35:14.090
to become just a little bit 
too self-assured


35:14.090 --> 35:16.718
—maybe a little bit 
too full of ourselves. 


35:16.718 --> 35:19.261
And that’s why the apostle Paul, 


35:19.262 --> 35:22.515
when he was talking about 
putting on the new personality, 


35:22.515 --> 35:24.977
in Romans chapter 12 


35:24.977 --> 35:28.480
he gave this reminder in verse 3. 


35:28.480 --> 35:32.817
He said: “For through 
the undeserved kindness given to me, 


35:32.817 --> 35:35.279
“I tell everyone there among you 


35:35.278 --> 35:38.781
“not to think more of himself 
than it is necessary to think, 


35:38.782 --> 35:42.995
but to think so as 
to have a sound mind.”


35:42.995 --> 35:47.623
Now, without going further, 
we can see the balance. 


35:47.623 --> 35:50.168
If we have 
the right view of ourselves, 


35:50.168 --> 35:52.170
well, we have “a sound mind.” 


35:52.170 --> 35:55.590
But as soon as we have 
an unbalanced view, 


35:55.590 --> 35:59.552
then we have an unsound mind. 


35:59.552 --> 36:03.099
We have a tendency 
to become unbalanced. 


36:03.098 --> 36:05.225
But the culture we live in today 


36:05.225 --> 36:08.437
also fans the flames of ego. 


36:08.437 --> 36:10.439
For example, 


36:10.438 --> 36:13.066
it’s never been easier 
than today to talk oneself up, 


36:13.067 --> 36:16.445
to puff oneself up, 
to brag oneself up 


36:16.445 --> 36:20.607
to thousands, if not millions, 


36:20.607 --> 36:23.744
of so-called followers 


36:23.743 --> 36:26.371
on social media. 


36:26.372 --> 36:31.377
But humility 
will help us to see 


36:31.377 --> 36:35.130
that perhaps others 
are not quite as interested 


36:35.130 --> 36:39.107
in our accomplishments 
as we are. 


36:39.107 --> 36:42.887
So self-worth 


36:42.887 --> 36:45.140
is realizing 
that you have value; 


36:45.140 --> 36:47.142
self-importance 


36:47.142 --> 36:50.000
is wanting everyone else 
to know it.


36:51.187 --> 36:53.232
Open your Bibles, 
if you would, 


36:53.232 --> 36:56.444
to 1 Corinthians chapter 8. 


36:56.443 --> 36:58.903
First Corinthians chapter 8, 


36:58.903 --> 37:03.000
and we want to give 
just four brief reminders. 


37:05.202 --> 37:08.000
First Corinthians 8:1, 


37:13.460 --> 37:16.045
it says:
“Knowledge puffs up, 


37:16.045 --> 37:18.632
but love builds up.”


37:18.632 --> 37:21.927
It’s not enough to be 
a student at the beginning. 


37:21.927 --> 37:25.597
It’s a position 
that you must assume for life. 


37:25.597 --> 37:27.724
It’s impossible to learn 


37:27.723 --> 37:31.390
what one thinks he already knows. 


37:31.390 --> 37:35.940
The second we tell ourself 
that we have graduated, 


37:35.940 --> 37:38.818
learning grinds to a halt. 


37:38.818 --> 37:42.113
A good mind 
is certainly a fine asset, 


37:42.113 --> 37:44.281
and still it could become a weakness 


37:44.282 --> 37:48.204
if overconfidence 
causes us to develop 


37:48.203 --> 37:50.705
an inflated opinion of ourselves. 


37:50.705 --> 37:53.542
Now, 
you haven’t had that happen, 


37:53.542 --> 37:55.585
and likely it won’t happen. 


37:55.585 --> 37:59.713
But after you graduate 
as a Gilead graduate, 


37:59.713 --> 38:04.635
you will find that people 
will complement you; 


38:04.635 --> 38:08.348
perhaps they will even 
flatter you excessively. 


38:08.348 --> 38:12.351
And when that happens, 
try to remember this: 


38:12.352 --> 38:17.024
A smart man believes only half 
of what people say about him. 


38:17.023 --> 38:21.331
A wise man knows 
which half to believe. 


38:21.332 --> 38:26.365
So continue to let the Word of God 
and the spirit of God 


38:26.365 --> 38:28.785
make you more like 
the Son of God. 


38:28.785 --> 38:30.995
Proverbs 10:14: 


38:30.995 --> 38:34.875
“Those who are wise 
treasure up knowledge.” 


38:34.875 --> 38:38.712
But don’t let the knowledge 
go to your head


38:38.712 --> 38:42.000
—just to your head; 
let it go to your heart.


38:43.675 --> 38:48.707
Second area, 
turn to Matthew chapter 20, 


38:48.707 --> 38:52.850
and you can leave your Bible 
open here if you’d like. 


38:52.850 --> 38:55.437
Matthew 20:28, 


38:55.437 --> 38:59.732
and this goes right to the heart 
of your Gilead assignment, all right. 


38:59.732 --> 39:01.777
Jesus said this, 


39:01.777 --> 39:03.987
he said: 
“Just as the Son of man came, 


39:03.987 --> 39:07.657
not to be ministered to, 
but to minister.” 


39:07.657 --> 39:10.702
And so Jesus 
measured greatness 


39:10.702 --> 39:14.789
in terms of service, 
not status. 


39:14.788 --> 39:18.293
He willingly took up menial tasks 
that everyone else tried to avoid. 


39:18.293 --> 39:20.920
He would wash feet. 
He would take care of children. 


39:20.920 --> 39:24.673
Jesus, the Bible says, 
“emptied himself.” 


39:24.673 --> 39:26.760
But you know what? 


39:26.760 --> 39:31.598
You can’t empty yourself 
if you’re full of yourself.


39:31.598 --> 39:35.601
Now, imagine 
that for every person you met, 


39:35.602 --> 39:37.687
you found 
some way to help them


39:37.687 --> 39:40.649
—a way 
that entirely benefited them 


39:40.648 --> 39:43.568
and left you entirely 
out of the picture. 


39:43.568 --> 39:47.530
The cumulative effect 
that this would have on the brotherhood 


39:47.530 --> 39:50.450
over a period of time 
would be profound,


39:50.450 --> 39:52.535
and it’s not an original idea. 


39:52.535 --> 39:54.537
You see, 
Jehovah God and Jesus Christ 


39:54.537 --> 39:57.499
look for opportunities 
to do for others. 


39:57.498 --> 40:02.378
And it’s not about 
making someone look good


40:02.378 --> 40:07.000
—it’s about providing the support 
so that others can be good. 


40:08.593 --> 40:13.623
Strive to be selfless, 
not selfish. 


40:13.623 --> 40:16.601
Philippians 2:3 says: 


40:16.602 --> 40:19.980
“Do nothing out of contentiousness 
or out of egotism, 


40:19.980 --> 40:24.733
but with humility 
consider others superior to you.”


40:24.733 --> 40:26.820
Now back to Matthew, 


40:26.820 --> 40:30.823
this time chapter 20 
beginning in verse 25. 


40:30.823 --> 40:34.856
This is the third area. 


40:34.857 --> 40:38.247
Jesus, talking to his disciples, said: 


40:38.247 --> 40:41.542
“You know that the rulers 
of the nations lord it over them 


40:41.542 --> 40:44.795
“and the great men 
wield authority over them. 


40:44.795 --> 40:47.507
“This must not be 
the way among you; 


40:47.507 --> 40:51.344
“but whoever wants to become 
great among you must be your minister, 


40:51.343 --> 40:55.931
and whoever wants to be 
first among you must be your slave.” 


40:55.932 --> 40:59.185
Now, 
you’re going to leave here. 


40:59.185 --> 41:03.147
Some of you are going 
to be put in positions of oversight. 


41:03.147 --> 41:05.692
But all of you, 
brothers and sisters, 


41:05.692 --> 41:07.860
are expected to work as a team. 


41:07.860 --> 41:10.738
So try to remember these things: 


41:10.738 --> 41:14.993
Having authority is not necessarily 


41:14.993 --> 41:18.621
the same as being an authority. 


41:18.622 --> 41:21.207
Having the right is not necessarily


41:21.207 --> 41:23.544
the same as being right. 


41:23.543 --> 41:25.711
Impressing people is different 


41:25.712 --> 41:27.922
from being truly impressive. 


41:27.922 --> 41:30.050
And learn the difference 


41:30.050 --> 41:33.512
between prominence 
and significance. 


41:33.512 --> 41:37.765
See, some of the most significant people 
in our organization 


41:37.765 --> 41:40.643
are the ones 
that have almost no prominence. 


41:40.643 --> 41:43.270
They’re the ones 
that are showing integrity; 


41:43.270 --> 41:47.275
standing firm for the Kingdom; 
setting an example in the ministry; 


41:47.275 --> 41:49.735
and making sacrifices 


41:49.735 --> 41:53.698
that maybe only Jehovah, Jesus, 
and the holy angels know. 


41:53.698 --> 41:55.700
They’re significant. 


41:55.700 --> 41:59.162
So don’t get caught up 
into the trap 


41:59.162 --> 42:03.875
of jockeying for position 
or prominence in the organization. 


42:03.875 --> 42:08.505
Because if you do, 
that ego that is developing 


42:08.505 --> 42:12.092
will cause you to become a menace 
to the brothers and sisters 


42:12.092 --> 42:14.260
that have to work 
under your direction.


42:14.260 --> 42:17.222
The Watchtower put it like this, 
it said: 


42:17.222 --> 42:21.852
‘Ego always beclouds the issue 
and obscures the vision.’ 


42:21.852 --> 42:24.229
And remember this too: 


42:24.228 --> 42:27.398
A team player does not obsess 
about his own image; 


42:27.398 --> 42:30.901
he doesn’t treat people with contempt, 
doesn’t need star treatment, 


42:30.902 --> 42:33.864
doesn’t fight, doesn’t lord it over, 
isn’t condescending, 


42:33.863 --> 42:38.000
and doesn’t marvel 
at his own awesomeness. 


42:41.078 --> 42:43.623
Colossians 3:23: 
‘Whatever you are doing, 


42:43.623 --> 42:47.876
work at it whole-souled 
for Jehovah, and not to men.’


42:47.877 --> 42:50.755
And, finally, 
one last point. 


42:50.755 --> 42:53.717
And this is found 
at 1 Corinthians 10:12. 


42:53.717 --> 42:56.719
We’re not going to look it up 
because there’s simply not time. 


42:56.718 --> 42:58.805
But it says this, it says: 


42:58.805 --> 43:02.308
“Let him that thinks he is standing 
beware that he does not fall.” 


43:02.308 --> 43:07.105
Humble people are meek; 
they’re not weak. 


43:07.105 --> 43:10.275
Spiritual maturity 
is becoming like Jesus 


43:10.275 --> 43:12.402
in the way 
we think, feel, and act. 


43:12.402 --> 43:15.322
But self-deception is easy. 


43:15.322 --> 43:19.534
Beware of “the disease of me.” 


43:19.533 --> 43:24.080
Even the best qualities 
will have a short shelf life 


43:24.080 --> 43:26.540
if the subscription 
is not renewed. 


43:26.540 --> 43:29.752
It’s not enough 
to do the right thing; 


43:29.752 --> 43:33.422
you must do the right thing 
for the right reason. 


43:33.422 --> 43:35.717
James 4:10 says: 


43:35.717 --> 43:38.094
“Humble yourselves 
in the eyes of Jehovah, 


43:38.093 --> 43:40.513
and he will exalt you.”


43:40.513 --> 43:42.765
So in conclusion, 


43:42.765 --> 43:46.143
it’s admirable to reach out 
in Jehovah’s organization, 


43:46.143 --> 43:50.690
to take on additional responsibilities, 
to make sacrifices. 


43:50.690 --> 43:54.568
But it is no less impressive 
an accomplishment 


43:54.568 --> 43:56.653
to become a better person, 


43:56.653 --> 44:00.616
happier, balanced, 
content, humble, and selfless. 


44:00.617 --> 44:03.202
But to do so, 
we must remember: 


44:03.202 --> 44:06.000
Ego is your enemy!


44:16.423 --> 44:18.466
Thank you very much, 
Brother Cauthon. 


44:18.467 --> 44:20.470
We appreciated that. 


44:20.470 --> 44:23.097
Next, 
Brother William Malenfant, 


44:23.097 --> 44:25.934
who’s a helper 
to the Teaching Committee, 


44:25.933 --> 44:30.000
has the theme 
“Test Jehovah Out and Be Tested!”


44:33.482 --> 44:38.522
You students 
of the 141st class of Gilead 


44:38.522 --> 44:44.535
have been putting Jehovah 
to the test for years. 


44:44.535 --> 44:46.913
It sounds scary, 


44:46.913 --> 44:50.040
but you’ve been doing it 
in a good way, 


44:50.040 --> 44:53.043
a way that honors 
Jehovah God. 


44:53.043 --> 44:55.213
On the other hand, 


44:55.213 --> 45:00.050
the Israelites 
often tested Jehovah in a bad way. 


45:00.050 --> 45:05.013
Psalm 106:14 declares:


45:05.013 --> 45:09.685
“They gave way to their selfish desires 
in the wilderness; 


45:09.685 --> 45:13.480
they tested God in the desert.” 


45:13.480 --> 45:17.985
Yes, they tested Jehovah 
by their lack of faith 


45:17.985 --> 45:22.782
and by their disobedience to what they 
had agreed to do in the Law covenant. 


45:22.782 --> 45:26.202
And it was all to their own detriment.


45:26.202 --> 45:31.124
And Jesus commented on this point 
of not testing Jehovah God 


45:31.123 --> 45:34.168
when he replied 
to Satan at Matthew 4:7. 


45:34.168 --> 45:36.253
You recall the words: 


45:36.253 --> 45:41.263
“You must not put 
Jehovah your God to the test.” 


45:41.263 --> 45:46.263
Jesus refused to do anything 


45:46.263 --> 45:50.893
that would put his life in jeopardy 
or do something reckless 


45:50.893 --> 45:54.271
just to please 
a challenge from the Devil. 


45:54.272 --> 45:56.899
That would be a wrong way 


45:56.898 --> 46:00.278
to put Jehovah God to the test. 


46:00.278 --> 46:05.198
However, as students of this class, 
you know about Malachi. 


46:05.198 --> 46:08.035
And you know 
that there is an invitation 


46:08.035 --> 46:10.872
in the Scriptures 
to test Jehovah out. 


46:10.872 --> 46:13.625
Let’s look up 
the scripture together, 


46:13.625 --> 46:18.000
Malachi 3:10. 


46:20.507 --> 46:24.177
It had to do 
with the Israelites and tithing, 


46:24.177 --> 46:27.014
obeying Jehovah’s command. 


46:27.013 --> 46:29.515
Malachi 3:10 says: 


46:29.515 --> 46:33.060
“‘Bring the entire tithe 
into the storehouse, 


46:33.060 --> 46:35.688
“‘so that there may be 
food in my house; 


46:35.688 --> 46:39.650
“‘and test me out, please, 
in this regard,’ 


46:39.650 --> 46:41.818
“Jehovah of armies says, 


46:41.818 --> 46:44.196
“‘to see whether 
I will not open to you 


46:44.197 --> 46:46.407
“‘the floodgates of the heavens 


46:46.407 --> 46:48.910
“‘and pour out on you a blessing 


46:48.910 --> 46:52.122
until there is nothing lacking.’”


46:52.122 --> 46:54.124
That’s quite a statement. 


46:54.123 --> 46:59.836
Jehovah said: 
“Test me out, please, in this regard”


46:59.837 --> 47:04.675
—in regard to being obedient, 
to accept Jehovah’s invitation, 


47:04.675 --> 47:08.053
to trust Jehovah 
and his promise to bless them, 


47:08.053 --> 47:12.516
in regard to not being 
tightfisted and greedy. 


47:12.517 --> 47:16.062
After all, 
everything the Israelites had 


47:16.062 --> 47:18.480
came from Jehovah. 


47:18.480 --> 47:22.693
They were merely asked 
to give back a small portion 


47:22.693 --> 47:27.031
of the things that Jehovah God 
had provided for them. 


47:27.032 --> 47:31.119
You know, there was 
no penalty for not tithing. 


47:31.118 --> 47:34.038
The arrangement actually, 
when you study it, 


47:34.038 --> 47:37.375
had a lot to do 
with the heart condition of the people 


47:37.375 --> 47:40.378
and their appreciation 
for all of the good things 


47:40.378 --> 47:42.921
that Jehovah did for them. 


47:42.922 --> 47:46.717
Obedience would result 
in blessings


47:46.717 --> 47:49.762
—an abundance of good things, 
bumper crops, 


47:49.762 --> 47:52.807
no one in the land 
would be lacking. 


47:52.807 --> 47:57.395
Jehovah’s blessing would be on them 
and all of their undertakings. 


47:57.395 --> 47:59.647
But think about the word picture 


47:59.647 --> 48:03.609
that Malachi paints 
in the last part of verse 10. 


48:03.608 --> 48:06.028
The power of that word picture


48:06.028 --> 48:08.613
—the floodgates 
of the heavens being opened 


48:08.613 --> 48:11.200
and pouring out blessings.


48:11.200 --> 48:13.702
What comes to your mind 
when you hear that expression, 


48:13.702 --> 48:17.915
“the floodgates 
of the heavens being opened”? 


48:17.915 --> 48:22.920
For me, Genesis 7:11. 


48:22.920 --> 48:26.840
And it says: 
“In the 600th year of Noah’s life, 


48:26.840 --> 48:31.137
“in the second month, 
on the 17th day of the month, 


48:31.137 --> 48:36.100
“on that day all the springs 
of the vast watery deep burst open 


48:36.100 --> 48:40.062
and the floodgates 
of the heavens were opened.” 


48:40.062 --> 48:42.149
Just imagine, 


48:42.148 --> 48:45.901
the entire planet being submerged 


48:45.902 --> 48:48.695
in blessings from Jehovah. 


48:48.695 --> 48:53.408
No one anywhere in want or in need. 


48:53.408 --> 48:55.410
That’s the promise from Jehovah. 


48:55.410 --> 48:58.372
It’s coming
—and soon!


48:58.372 --> 49:02.835
The invitation 
to test Jehovah out as set forth 


49:02.835 --> 49:06.963
in Malachi 3:10 was given 
to the Israelites, as we know. 


49:06.963 --> 49:11.843
It was not given to Christians, 
as far as tithing is concerned. 


49:11.843 --> 49:15.598
But there is a principle 
connected to tithing 


49:15.598 --> 49:18.141
that has special meaning 
for us today. 


49:18.142 --> 49:21.937
Consider this quote about testing God. 


49:21.937 --> 49:25.357
It says: “You can humbly 
test him in a proper sense. 


49:25.357 --> 49:27.360
“How? 


49:27.360 --> 49:29.362
He promised a blessing.” 


49:29.362 --> 49:31.405
Well, such as in Malachi 3:10: 


49:31.405 --> 49:34.533
‘Bring the whole tithe in, 
and I will bless you abundantly.’ 


49:34.533 --> 49:37.035
For us, 
it could be Matthew 6:33: 


49:37.035 --> 49:40.330
‘Seek first the Kingdom 
and all these other things 


49:40.330 --> 49:42.375
will be added to you.’ 


49:42.375 --> 49:45.670
But the quote goes on: 
“When you obey him, 


49:45.670 --> 49:49.257
“you make a test of God, 
as if asking, 


49:49.257 --> 49:51.300
“‘Will he bless me?’ 


49:51.300 --> 49:55.303
“In response, he puts himself 
under obligation to do so, 


49:55.303 --> 49:57.348
“keeping his promise. 


49:57.348 --> 50:00.685
“Thus, God’s allowing you to ‘test him out’ 


50:00.685 --> 50:05.565
“underscores your conviction 
that he will bless you abundantly.” 


50:05.565 --> 50:07.608
And that’s taken from the book 


50:07.608 --> 50:12.061
Live With Jehovah’s Day in Mind, 
on page 183.


50:12.062 --> 50:17.285
The fact is that when we put Jehovah 
to the test regarding his promises, 


50:17.285 --> 50:20.538
we are also putting our own faith 


50:20.538 --> 50:23.831
in his promises to the test. 


50:23.832 --> 50:25.835
This has been
—and still is—


50:25.835 --> 50:27.837
your experience. 


50:27.837 --> 50:30.255
By seeking first the Kingdom, 
you Gilead students, 


50:30.255 --> 50:32.800
haven’t you been blessed abundantly? 


50:32.800 --> 50:35.385
Materially
—you have what you need. 


50:35.385 --> 50:38.722
Spiritually
—a superabundance of blessings 


50:38.722 --> 50:41.017
have been poured out on you. 


50:41.017 --> 50:43.979
Have you not received 
blessings beyond measure 


50:43.978 --> 50:47.398
in acquaintances, 
fellowship, happiness and joy


50:47.398 --> 50:50.610
—the people now 
that you’re close to in your class 


50:50.610 --> 50:53.320
and also here at Patterson? 


50:53.320 --> 50:55.530
You know what life is all about. 


50:55.530 --> 50:59.452
You know what the purpose of life is
—why we’re here. 


50:59.452 --> 51:02.372
To serve God, to know Jehovah, 


51:02.372 --> 51:04.999
and to learn about our great Creator 


51:04.998 --> 51:07.000
and the way we should worship him. 


51:07.000 --> 51:09.128
And, what— 
The blessings that we’re receiving


51:09.128 --> 51:11.130
—all of the good things we have—


51:11.130 --> 51:14.883
are just a foretaste of things to come, 


51:14.883 --> 51:17.303
things in the near future.


51:17.303 --> 51:19.763
And, I might add, 
you students are not 


51:19.763 --> 51:23.350
the only ones 
who are testing Jehovah out. 


51:23.350 --> 51:28.063
I found this quote interesting 
from The Watchtower about another group. 


51:28.063 --> 51:30.065
The Watchtower stated: 


51:30.065 --> 51:34.070
“Most of those who have assisted 
with the construction work in New York 


51:34.070 --> 51:37.238
“could have found reasons 
not to volunteer. 


51:37.238 --> 51:40.366
“However, 
they put Jehovah to the test


51:40.367 --> 51:42.829
—just as he invites all of us to do.” 


51:42.828 --> 51:46.915
And, have they not received 
rich blessings from Jehovah in return? 


51:46.915 --> 51:49.668
Just ask them. 
They’ll tell you. 


51:49.668 --> 51:52.128
And the last part, I like very much. 


51:52.128 --> 51:55.841
And, do we not love them 
for their faith? 


51:55.842 --> 51:58.010
Absolutely! 


51:58.010 --> 52:00.303
Another group
—the anointed—


52:00.303 --> 52:02.306
test Jehovah, 


52:02.307 --> 52:04.725
and they are being tested. 


52:04.725 --> 52:07.978
Revelation 2:10: 


52:07.978 --> 52:11.773
“Prove yourself faithful even to death”


52:11.773 --> 52:14.776
—the test, but the reward—


52:14.777 --> 52:18.822
“and I will give you the crown of life.” 


52:18.822 --> 52:22.159
Isn’t that remarkable
—the promises that God makes? 


52:22.158 --> 52:25.663
That principle applies to all of us.


52:25.663 --> 52:29.416
When we make our dedication 
and are baptized, 


52:29.417 --> 52:32.002
we vow to serve Jehovah God forever. 


52:32.002 --> 52:34.422
You know that; we know that. 


52:34.422 --> 52:37.550
But there is an interesting point 
connected to that. 


52:37.550 --> 52:41.303
There is more involved 
than just our person. 


52:41.303 --> 52:44.390
Consider this comment 
from The Watchtower: 


52:44.390 --> 52:48.352
“From that time on,” 
dedication and baptism, 


52:48.352 --> 52:52.899
“everything we have belongs to Jehovah.” 


52:52.898 --> 52:56.610
Now some may separate 
their person from their possessions, 


52:56.610 --> 53:00.363
not realizing that, really, 
when you give yourself to God, 


53:00.363 --> 53:03.408
it’s all you are and all that you have. 


53:03.408 --> 53:07.871
And yet, here is where the tithe, 
or the principle of the tithe, comes in. 


53:07.872 --> 53:10.875
“Still,” and this is part of that quote 


53:10.875 --> 53:14.712
from The Watchtower of 2007, 
December 15: 


53:14.712 --> 53:17.715
“Still, he allows us to choose 


53:17.715 --> 53:20.342
“a portion of what we have


53:20.342 --> 53:22.344
“—a symbolic tithe—


53:22.343 --> 53:24.846
“to use in his service. 


53:24.847 --> 53:28.767
It is whatever our circumstances allow,” 


53:28.767 --> 53:31.604
and this second part is touching, 


53:31.603 --> 53:35.690
“and our heart impels us to use.” 


53:35.690 --> 53:38.110
Isn’t that wonderful on Jehovah’s part? 


53:38.110 --> 53:41.238
He doesn’t set forth a specific requirement. 


53:41.238 --> 53:46.243
He allows us to display 
our heartfelt appreciation for him 


53:46.243 --> 53:49.496
and for all the good things 
that he does for us.


53:49.497 --> 53:52.124
The heart is truly involved. 


53:52.123 --> 53:57.128
We test Jehovah God out 
by doing what Proverbs 23:26 says: 


53:57.128 --> 54:01.716
“My son, 
do give your heart to me, 


54:01.717 --> 54:05.554
and may your eyes 
take pleasure in my ways.” 


54:05.553 --> 54:07.890
We give Jehovah God our heart,


54:07.890 --> 54:09.975
and we give him everything else 


54:09.975 --> 54:12.812
that we have as the needs arise. 


54:12.812 --> 54:15.272
What a wonderful opportunity we have! 


54:15.272 --> 54:17.357
It gives us this opportunity of showing 


54:17.357 --> 54:19.610
how much we appreciate our great God 


54:19.610 --> 54:21.778
and how much we trust him. 


54:21.778 --> 54:24.823
And this interesting statement was made: 


54:24.823 --> 54:28.868
“To fail to give Jehovah our best 


54:28.868 --> 54:33.415
is to deprive ourselves of his blessing[s].” 


54:33.415 --> 54:35.918
Isn’t that true?


54:35.918 --> 54:40.255
You brothers and sisters 
of the 141st class of Gilead, 


54:40.255 --> 54:43.300
you are not depriving 
yourselves of anything. 


54:43.300 --> 54:45.677
You have the spiritual blessings, 


54:45.677 --> 54:49.599
and you have what you need materially
—no doubt about it. 


54:49.598 --> 54:52.308
And as you 
continue testing Jehovah out 


54:52.308 --> 54:54.936
by responding to his promises, 


54:54.937 --> 54:57.397
the quality of your faith 


54:57.397 --> 55:01.402
will continue 
to be tested and refined. 


55:01.402 --> 55:06.157
And so, 
keep on testing Jehovah out; 


55:06.157 --> 55:10.369
keep on doing 
the best you can to obey him, 


55:10.368 --> 55:14.121
to comply, 
to show your faith in his promises. 


55:14.122 --> 55:18.127
And then you will also be tested 


55:18.127 --> 55:23.000
to your eternal joy and happiness!


55:33.100 --> 55:36.853
Thank you, Brother Malenfant, 
for that fine counsel. 


55:36.853 --> 55:40.023
We invite you all to stand now. 


55:40.023 --> 55:43.276
We’ll sing song number 43, 


55:43.277 --> 55:47.657
“Stay Awake, Stand Firm, Grow Mighty,” 


55:47.657 --> 58:09.945
song number 43.

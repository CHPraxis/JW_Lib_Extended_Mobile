00:17.567 --> 00:29.612
How can we endure
When trials come, as Jesus said?


00:29.612 --> 00:40.424
Through his pain he saw
The joy of better things ahead.


00:40.423 --> 00:51.735
God’s promise, God’s justice,
Were thoughts on which he fed.


00:51.735 --> 01:02.978
We need to have endurance.
Our faith we must defend.


01:02.978 --> 01:19.000
His love is our assurance.
So we will keep enduring to the end.


01:21.463 --> 01:32.608
Though the passing years
May bring us sorrow, bring us pain;


01:32.608 --> 01:44.086
There beyond the tears,
We see the life that we can gain.


01:44.087 --> 01:55.465
To be there, feel free there,
Determined we remain.


01:55.465 --> 02:07.477
We need to have endurance.
Our faith we must defend.


02:07.477 --> 02:23.000
His love is our assurance.
So we will keep enduring to the end.


02:25.127 --> 02:36.739
We will not give up
Nor see the need for doubt or fear.


02:36.738 --> 02:47.683
Faithfully we’ll serve
Until Jehovah’s day is here.


02:47.683 --> 02:58.928
Let’s keep on enduring.
That time is very near.


02:58.928 --> 03:10.973
We need to have endurance.
Our faith we must defend.


03:10.973 --> 03:39.051
His love is our assurance.
So we will keep enduring to the end.

00:14 How does it make you feel when you preach and teach with zeal,
00:23 When you know you’ve done your part to reach an honest heart?
00:33 Knowing you’ve done your best; then our God will do the rest.
00:42 Honest hearts he surely knows— all those to him disposed.
00:50 It makes us glad, and we rejoice to give our heart and mind and voice.
01:00 So may our sacrifice of praise continue all our days.
01:15 How does it make you feel when the words you speak appeal
01:24 To the ones whose heart is right for everlasting life?
01:34 Some people turn away, others might be led astray.
01:42 Still we’re glad to bear his name and witness just the same.
01:51 It makes us glad, and we rejoice to give our heart and mind and voice.
02:01 So may our sacrifice of praise continue all our days.
02:16 How does it make you feel, knowing God’s support is real,
02:24 And that he’s entrusted you to do the work we do?
02:34 Proudly we preach and teach, using bold but gracious speech,
02:43 Searching out deserving ones; this work will soon be done.
02:52 It makes us glad, and we rejoice to give our heart and mind and voice.
03:02 So may our sacrifice of praise continue all our days.

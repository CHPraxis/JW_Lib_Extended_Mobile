WEBVTT

00:13.963 --> 00:28.411
O Jehovah, you have given us
a hope that we hold dear.


00:28.412 --> 00:42.425
It’s a hope we find so thrilling
we want the world to hear.


00:42.425 --> 00:56.438
But at times this life’s anxieties
are the cause of fears within,


00:56.438 --> 01:10.720
And the hope that burned so brightly
has suddenly grown dim.


01:10.720 --> 01:17.860
You’re our strength, you’re our hope,
you’re our confidence.


01:17.860 --> 01:24.498
Whatever we lack, you supply.


01:24.498 --> 01:28.403
When we preach, when we teach,


01:28.403 --> 01:42.000
we have confidence
because it’s on you we rely.


01:43.787 --> 01:58.134
So Jehovah, please instill in us
a heart that won’t forget,


01:58.133 --> 02:12.481
For you’ve always been our comfort
when troubled times we’ve met.


02:12.482 --> 02:19.555
And these thoughts 
that lift and strengthen us


02:19.555 --> 02:26.462
can revive that dying flame,


02:26.462 --> 02:40.577
For they fill our hearts with courage
to speak about your name.


02:40.577 --> 02:47.950
You’re our strength, you’re our hope,
you’re our confidence.


02:47.950 --> 02:54.348
Whatever we lack, you supply.


02:54.348 --> 02:58.628
When we preach, when we teach,


02:58.628 --> 03:34.046
we have confidence
because it’s on you we rely.

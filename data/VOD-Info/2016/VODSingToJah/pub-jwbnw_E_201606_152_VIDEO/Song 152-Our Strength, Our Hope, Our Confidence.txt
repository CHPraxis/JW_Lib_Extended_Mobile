00:13 O Jehovah, you have given us a hope that we hold dear.
00:28 It’s a hope we find so thrilling we want the world to hear.
00:42 But at times this life’s anxieties are the cause of fears within,
00:56 And the hope that burned so brightly has suddenly grown dim.
01:10 You’re our strength, you’re our hope, you’re our confidence.
01:17 Whatever we lack, you supply.
01:24 When we preach, when we teach,
01:28 we have confidence because it’s on you we rely.
01:43 So Jehovah, please instill in us a heart that won’t forget,
01:58 For you’ve always been our comfort when troubled times we’ve met.
02:12 And these thoughts  that lift and strengthen us
02:19 can revive that dying flame,
02:26 For they fill our hearts with courage to speak about your name.
02:40 You’re our strength, you’re our hope, you’re our confidence.
02:47 Whatever we lack, you supply.
02:54 When we preach, when we teach,
02:58 we have confidence because it’s on you we rely.

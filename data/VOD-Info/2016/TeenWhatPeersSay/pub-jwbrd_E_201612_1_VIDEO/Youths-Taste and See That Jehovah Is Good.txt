00:02 Our relationship with Jehovah  can start when we’re young.
00:06 For me, it was the example  that others set
00:08 of putting Jehovah first
00:11 and the happiness  that came as a result,
00:13 as well as being  in that sort of environment
00:16 that really helped me to want to reach out
00:19 as well as be available  for those opportunities.
00:23 And once we do give our life to Jehovah,
00:25 it’s amazing to see the blessings  that he has in store for us.
00:28 But in order to build that relationship,
00:31 we need to read God’s Word;
00:33 we also need to pray to him.
00:34 The more you get to know him,
00:36 the more appealing things  you learn about him.
00:39 That makes you not want to lose him as your friend.
00:42 I always knew it was the truth
00:44 and that I wanted  to serve Jehovah forever.
00:47 But I needed to reassure myself  of certain aspects,
00:51 so I did some research projects  with my parents,
00:54 using the Creator book and some items  from the Bible Teach book.
00:57 After that,  it only became more obvious.
01:00 And I was certain that I wanted it
01:02 and that I was ready to get baptized.
01:05 To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,
01:08 I read the Bible daily and I pray.
01:10 Especially when  there is no one around or it’s quiet,
01:14 I talk to Jehovah  with all my heart at that time.
01:16 Making myself available  for spiritual opportunities
01:20 was a little bit difficult for me at first,
01:22 but I didn’t give up.
01:24 After my baptism,
01:26 I became a ministerial servant,
01:27 and I also served  almost two years in Bethel.
01:30 And now I’m a regular pioneer
01:32 in Hpado  in a Karen-speaking congregation.
01:37 I didn’t know or speak  the Karen S’gaw language,
01:40 so the local brothers helped me  to learn not only how to speak
01:43 but also how to read.
01:48 Prayers  are important to strengthen
01:51 my relationship with Jehovah.
01:53 For me, it’s like talking
01:55 to a friend,  and that’s always helpful.
01:57 He’s someone real to me,
01:59 and I fully trust  that he listens to me.
02:02 I support the elders by helping  with the cleaning of the hall,
02:05 serving as an attendant,
02:07 handling microphones,
02:09 as well as helping  the congregation spiritually.
02:13 When I share Jehovah’s promises of eternal life with others,
02:16 I too am encouraged.
02:19 I’m constantly remembering  what Jehovah promises,
02:22 and that motivates me  to keep preaching.
02:25 There’s a family  in our congregation
02:28 who took me into their home
02:30 and served  as my spiritual parents.
02:38 Through our family worship,
02:40 they helped me  to progress spiritually.
02:48 The elderly ones in our congregation  have been helping me a lot.
02:52 First, they’re good examples.
02:55 They also remind me  to keep my eye simple.
02:58 Despite their limited circumstances  because of age,
03:01 they are determined  to serve Jehovah God.
03:05 And that made me  reflect on my situation.
03:07 I’m very young.
03:09 What prevents me from doing  the things that they do?
03:13 Before I began pioneering,
03:15 I used to sell fish seven days a week,
03:17 but now I sell fish four days a week,
03:19 so three days are available for pioneering.
03:24 To be able to be available  for spiritual opportunities,
03:27 I closely associate  with my congregation.
03:32 I offer some older ones  a ride to the meetings
03:35 or in the preaching work.
03:39 The reason I’m doing this  is because I want to give
03:42 my youth and energy to Jehovah God.
03:47 When I was at school,
03:48 I would conduct Bible studies
03:50 with some of my classmates.
03:53 In time, they joined me  in serving Jehovah.
03:57 When I think about being with them  in the future Paradise,
04:00 it gives me deep joy.
04:03 I have the privilege of studying with a deaf girl
04:06 who lives two hours from where I live.
04:08 We have to walk all the way.
04:10 She is very happy  with what she’s learning,
04:13 and her family is very supportive.
04:15 So knowing that Jehovah is helping her
04:17 and I have a part in it,  it’s just priceless.
04:22 Auxiliary pioneering  definitely helped me
04:24 because it was like a stepping stone  to regular pioneering.
04:26 The ministry definitely gives you  the opportunity
04:30 to be able  to work closely with Jehovah.
04:33 And then it—  By doing that, you’re reaffirming
04:35 your faith in what  you already believe in,
04:37 and then you’re drawing closer  to Jehovah in friendship.
04:40 Having jw.org and the broadcast
04:44 has definitely drawn me  closer to our brothers
04:47 and sisters but also to Jehovah as well.
04:49 Just by nature,  I feel like I’m more of a timid person,
04:53 so going door to door  can be a little scary.
04:56 But seeing other young ones  in different parts of the world
04:58 that are enduring  very difficult circumstances
05:01 and living conditions
05:02 and yet are still giving  their best to Jehovah
05:04 is so encouraging for me.
05:06 And it helps me to keep going on  and give Jehovah my best as well.
05:11 When I think personally  about all the avenues of service
05:16 that we can have a hand in today,
05:18 there are so many that are exciting
05:22 —whether it be pioneering  in a foreign country,
05:25 serving where the need is great,
05:28 even serving at Bethel.
05:30 Unless we “taste and see  that Jehovah is good,”
05:33 unless we put ourself out there
05:35 and are available  to try that at least once,
05:38 we’ll never know  what it would be like
05:41 to really serve Jehovah.
05:42 And in doing that,  you will see how Jehovah
05:45 does want the best life for us.

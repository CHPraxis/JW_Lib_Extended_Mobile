00:02.815 --> 00:06.402
Our relationship with Jehovah 
can start when we’re young. 


00:06.402 --> 00:08.654
For me, it was the example 
that others set 


00:08.653 --> 00:11.073
of putting Jehovah first 


00:11.073 --> 00:13.575
and the happiness 
that came as a result, 


00:13.575 --> 00:16.495
as well as being 
in that sort of environment


00:16.495 --> 00:19.832
that really helped me
to want to reach out 


00:19.832 --> 00:22.000
as well as be available 
for those opportunities. 


00:23.418 --> 00:25.420
And once we do
give our life to Jehovah, 


00:25.420 --> 00:28.590
it’s amazing to see the blessings 
that he has in store for us. 


00:28.590 --> 00:31.177
But in order to build that relationship, 


00:31.177 --> 00:33.095
we need to read God’s Word; 


00:33.095 --> 00:34.972
we also need to pray to him.


00:34.972 --> 00:36.557
The more you
get to know him, 


00:36.557 --> 00:39.142
the more appealing things 
you learn about him. 


00:39.142 --> 00:42.437
That makes you not want to lose him
as your friend. 


00:42.437 --> 00:44.607
I always knew it was the truth 


00:44.607 --> 00:47.359
and that I wanted 
to serve Jehovah forever. 


00:47.358 --> 00:51.155
But I needed to reassure myself 
of certain aspects, 


00:51.155 --> 00:54.367
so I did some research projects 
with my parents, 


00:54.367 --> 00:57.954
using the Creator book and some items 
from the Bible Teach book. 


00:57.953 --> 01:00.705
After that, 
it only became more obvious. 


01:00.705 --> 01:02.708
And I was certain that I wanted it 


01:02.708 --> 01:05.835
and that I was ready to get baptized.


01:05.835 --> 01:08.005
To strengthen
my relationship with Jehovah, 


01:08.005 --> 01:10.757
I read the Bible daily
and I pray. 


01:10.757 --> 01:14.262
Especially when 
there is no one around or it’s quiet, 


01:14.262 --> 01:16.889
I talk to Jehovah 
with all my heart at that time. 


01:16.888 --> 01:20.725
Making myself available 
for spiritual opportunities 


01:20.725 --> 01:22.687
was a little bit difficult
for me at first, 


01:22.687 --> 01:24.439
but I didn’t give up. 


01:24.438 --> 01:26.315
After my baptism, 


01:26.315 --> 01:27.942
I became a ministerial servant, 


01:27.942 --> 01:30.569
and I also served 
almost two years in Bethel. 


01:30.568 --> 01:32.821
And now I’m a regular pioneer 


01:32.822 --> 01:35.000
in Hpado 
in a Karen-speaking congregation. 


01:37.827 --> 01:40.704
I didn’t know or speak 
the Karen S’gaw language, 


01:40.703 --> 01:43.956
so the local brothers helped me 
to learn not only how to speak 


01:43.957 --> 01:46.000
but also how to read.


01:48.920 --> 01:51.007
Prayers 
are important to strengthen 


01:51.007 --> 01:53.009
my relationship with Jehovah. 


01:53.008 --> 01:55.010
For me, it’s like talking 


01:55.010 --> 01:57.303
to a friend, 
and that’s always helpful. 


01:57.303 --> 01:59.681
He’s someone real to me, 


01:59.682 --> 02:01.000
and I fully trust 
that he listens to me. 


02:02.935 --> 02:05.478
I support the elders by helping 
with the cleaning of the hall, 


02:05.478 --> 02:07.648
serving as an attendant, 


02:07.648 --> 02:09.231
handling microphones, 


02:09.232 --> 02:12.000
as well as helping 
the congregation spiritually. 


02:13.195 --> 02:16.782
When I share Jehovah’s promises
of eternal life with others, 


02:16.782 --> 02:19.117
I too am encouraged. 


02:19.117 --> 02:22.579
I’m constantly remembering 
what Jehovah promises, 


02:22.578 --> 02:25.873
and that motivates me 
to keep preaching.


02:25.873 --> 02:28.293
There’s a family 
in our congregation 


02:28.293 --> 02:30.003
who took me into their home 


02:30.003 --> 02:34.000
and served 
as my spiritual parents. 


02:38.720 --> 02:40.722
Through our family worship, 


02:40.722 --> 02:43.000
they helped me 
to progress spiritually.


02:48.480 --> 02:52.735
The elderly ones in our congregation 
have been helping me a lot. 


02:52.735 --> 02:55.237
First, they’re good examples. 


02:55.237 --> 02:58.240
They also remind me 
to keep my eye simple. 


02:58.240 --> 03:01.452
Despite their limited circumstances 
because of age, 


03:01.452 --> 03:05.414
they are determined 
to serve Jehovah God. 


03:05.413 --> 03:07.623
And that made me 
reflect on my situation. 


03:07.623 --> 03:09.626
I’m very young. 


03:09.627 --> 03:12.000
What prevents me from doing 
the things that they do?


03:13.255 --> 03:15.257
Before I
began pioneering, 


03:15.257 --> 03:17.927
I used to sell fish
seven days a week, 


03:17.927 --> 03:19.887
but now I sell fish four days a week, 


03:19.887 --> 03:23.000
so three days are available for pioneering. 


03:24.392 --> 03:27.685
To be able to be available 
for spiritual opportunities, 


03:27.685 --> 03:30.000
I closely associate 
with my congregation. 


03:32.523 --> 03:35.110
I offer some older ones 
a ride to the meetings


03:35.110 --> 03:37.000
or in the preaching work. 


03:39.363 --> 03:42.241
The reason I’m doing this 
is because I want to give 


03:42.242 --> 03:46.000
my youth and energy
to Jehovah God.


03:47.288 --> 03:48.790
When I was at school, 


03:48.790 --> 03:50.250
I would conduct Bible studies 


03:50.250 --> 03:53.003
with some of my classmates. 


03:53.003 --> 03:57.590
In time, they joined me 
in serving Jehovah. 


03:57.590 --> 04:00.760
When I think about being with them 
in the future Paradise, 


04:00.760 --> 04:03.930
it gives me deep joy.


04:03.930 --> 04:06.308
I have the privilege
of studying with a deaf girl


04:06.308 --> 04:08.726
who lives two hours
from where I live. 


04:08.727 --> 04:10.479
We have to walk all the way. 


04:10.478 --> 04:13.315
She is very happy 
with what she’s learning, 


04:13.315 --> 04:15.317
and her family is very supportive. 


04:15.317 --> 04:17.569
So knowing that Jehovah
is helping her 


04:17.568 --> 04:21.000
and I have a part in it, 
it’s just priceless.


04:22.407 --> 04:24.034
Auxiliary pioneering 
definitely helped me


04:24.033 --> 04:26.953
because it was like a stepping stone 
to regular pioneering. 


04:26.953 --> 04:30.331
The ministry definitely gives you 
the opportunity 


04:30.332 --> 04:33.085
to be able 
to work closely with Jehovah. 


04:33.085 --> 04:35.128
And then it— 
By doing that, you’re reaffirming 


04:35.128 --> 04:37.130
your faith in what 
you already believe in, 


04:37.130 --> 04:40.883
and then you’re drawing closer 
to Jehovah in friendship.


04:40.883 --> 04:44.513
Having jw.org and the broadcast 


04:44.513 --> 04:47.265
has definitely drawn me 
closer to our brothers 


04:47.265 --> 04:49.433
and sisters but also to Jehovah as well.


04:49.433 --> 04:53.105
Just by nature, 
I feel like I’m more of a timid person, 


04:53.105 --> 04:56.023
so going door to door 
can be a little scary. 


04:56.023 --> 04:58.110
But seeing other young ones 
in different parts of the world 


04:58.110 --> 05:01.238
that are enduring 
very difficult circumstances


05:01.238 --> 05:02.321
and living conditions 


05:02.322 --> 05:04.742
and yet are still giving 
their best to Jehovah 


05:04.742 --> 05:06.744
is so encouraging for me. 


05:06.743 --> 05:10.000
And it helps me to keep going on 
and give Jehovah my best as well.


05:11.540 --> 05:16.043
When I think personally 
about all the avenues of service 


05:16.043 --> 05:18.713
that we can have a hand in today, 


05:18.713 --> 05:22.383
there are so many that are exciting


05:22.383 --> 05:25.636
—whether it be pioneering 
in a foreign country, 


05:25.637 --> 05:28.182
serving where the need is great, 


05:28.182 --> 05:30.642
even serving at Bethel. 


05:30.642 --> 05:33.604
Unless we “taste and see 
that Jehovah is good,” 


05:33.603 --> 05:35.271
unless we put ourself out there 


05:35.272 --> 05:38.275
and are available 
to try that at least once, 


05:38.275 --> 05:41.068
we’ll never know 
what it would be like 


05:41.068 --> 05:42.736
to really serve Jehovah. 


05:42.737 --> 05:45.949
And in doing that, 
you will see how Jehovah 


05:45.948 --> 06:04.321
does want the best life for us.

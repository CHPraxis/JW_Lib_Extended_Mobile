00:05.775 --> 00:09.197
A visual aid often makes 
a clearer 


00:09.197 --> 00:14.000
or more lasting impression 
on the mind than does the spoken word.


00:17.037 --> 00:19.999
Under the direction 
of the Writing Committee, 


00:19.998 --> 00:22.083
the Art Department 
has enjoyed 


00:22.083 --> 00:25.753
the privilege of designing 
and illustrating Bible literature 


00:25.753 --> 00:27.756
for almost 40 years.


00:27.757 --> 00:32.469
The department was established 
sometime before 1976.


00:32.468 --> 00:34.680
But a small team of artists 


00:34.680 --> 00:38.850
had been working 
on illustrations and typography 


00:38.850 --> 00:42.000
from as far back 
as the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”


00:44.648 --> 00:49.570
The work of publishing Bible literature 
has seen many changes. 


00:49.570 --> 00:53.740
Now there are EPUBs, interactive PDFs, 


00:53.740 --> 00:57.410
Web design, and HTML content, 


00:57.410 --> 01:01.457
all of which require new skills


01:01.457 --> 01:03.625
as well as close collaboration 


01:03.625 --> 01:06.000
with many other Bethel departments.


01:07.582 --> 01:11.300
The Art Department 
is structured into teams. 


01:11.300 --> 01:15.095
Each team is made up 
of designers, photographers, 


01:15.095 --> 01:18.432
illustrators, prop and set makers, 


01:18.432 --> 01:21.269
costume and makeup artists, 


01:21.268 --> 01:24.000
as well as production workers.


01:25.438 --> 01:27.858
The team lead and the scheduler 
work directly 


01:27.858 --> 01:31.000
with the Writing Department contact 
known as a compiler.


01:32.070 --> 01:34.948
After receiving 
an early version of the text, 


01:34.948 --> 01:36.950
the three brothers discuss 


01:36.950 --> 01:40.162
the purpose 
and possible look of the design. 


01:40.162 --> 01:42.915
All on the team 
are invited to collaborate 


01:42.915 --> 01:45.333
as concepts are developed. 


01:45.333 --> 01:49.000
Each member contributes 
to the overall design of a project.


01:51.382 --> 01:53.592
Before any production work is started, 


01:53.592 --> 01:57.000
concepts are sketched and developed.


01:59.180 --> 02:01.808
These sketches become a blueprint 


02:01.808 --> 02:05.478
that helps the team 
understand the concept, 


02:05.478 --> 02:08.481
plan the resources, 


02:08.482 --> 02:12.000
and ensure 
that the project stays on track.


02:15.947 --> 02:18.409
Who is the target audience? 


02:18.408 --> 02:22.078
How will this publication be used?


02:22.078 --> 02:26.000
The design should be clear and simple. 


02:28.543 --> 02:31.000
And it needs to work in all languages. 


02:32.213 --> 02:35.000
This is no small task.


02:37.010 --> 02:39.347
When the design is ready, 


02:39.347 --> 02:42.599
the compiler presents a mock-up 
of the publication 


02:42.598 --> 02:44.601
to the Writing Committee. 


02:44.602 --> 02:48.000
The committee reviews the design 
and makes any needed adjustments. 


02:50.065 --> 02:55.945
After the concept is approved, 
production begins.


02:55.945 --> 02:59.032
Around the world, 
there are many photographers 


02:59.032 --> 03:03.000
who work part-time to assist 
in providing images. 


03:04.497 --> 03:07.624
Photographs are also taken in our studio 


03:07.623 --> 03:10.793
and other locations. 


03:10.793 --> 03:15.000
These images help give our publications 
an international look.


03:19.762 --> 03:22.849
Accuracy is vital. 


03:22.848 --> 03:26.000
A researcher provides 
historical references and inspiration.


03:28.312 --> 03:32.565
Hair, makeup, and costumes 


03:32.565 --> 03:36.000
are designed to depict 
the time period and region.


03:37.367 --> 03:40.949
Props, set design, and lighting 


03:40.948 --> 03:43.000
provide the right look and setting.


03:44.077 --> 03:46.080
When combined, 


03:46.080 --> 03:48.415
each element helps tell the story  


03:48.415 --> 03:51.000
and capture the imagination of the viewer.


03:52.460 --> 03:55.588
Sets are also built in 3D programs. 


03:55.588 --> 03:59.133
They can be used as art source 


03:59.133 --> 04:02.000
or as final illustrations.


04:10.645 --> 04:15.108
Whether painted digitally 
or with traditional materials, 


04:15.108 --> 04:17.651
the artist renders the illustration 


04:17.652 --> 04:21.000
in a style suited for its final use.


04:24.452 --> 04:27.662
When design meets illustration, 


04:27.662 --> 04:30.000
infographics are born.


04:34.878 --> 04:37.713
After final approval 
by the Writing Committee, 


04:37.713 --> 04:39.966
files are sent to the printeries 


04:39.967 --> 04:44.000
and to the website 
or used to create other digital versions.


04:46.265 --> 04:51.270
In order to reach the hearts of those 
who read a Bible-based publication, 


04:51.270 --> 04:55.000
hands and hearts 
have to be involved in its creation.


04:56.900 --> 04:59.612
Those of us in the Art Department 


04:59.612 --> 05:04.000
consider it a privilege to give support 
to the most urgent of all work


05:05.575 --> 05:32.875
—preaching the good news.

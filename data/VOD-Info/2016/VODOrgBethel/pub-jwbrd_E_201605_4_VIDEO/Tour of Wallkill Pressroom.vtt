00:10.493 --> 00:13.430
Here at Wallkill, 
we have two rotary presses. 


00:13.430 --> 00:15.898
Each prints 
something called a signature, 


00:15.898 --> 00:18.968
which is virtually the same 
as a 32-page brochure. 


00:18.968 --> 00:23.773
The press can print 
up to 94,000 signatures per hour. 


00:23.773 --> 00:25.975
If these were stacked 
on top of each other, 


00:25.975 --> 00:30.000
they would reach the height 
of a 30-story building every hour!


00:31.782 --> 00:36.119
The process begins 
with a 3,000- to 4,000-pound roll of paper. 


00:36.118 --> 00:39.488
It’s loaded along the press, 
rolled into place, 


00:39.488 --> 00:43.693
trimmed, and lined 
with double-sided tape. 


00:43.693 --> 00:48.000
Before the previous roll is finished, 
the new roll is loaded onto the splicer. 


00:50.200 --> 00:52.202
By means of double-sided tape, 


00:52.202 --> 00:57.000
this roll is attached 
to the expiring roll.


00:58.432 --> 01:01.635
Next, the paper advances 
to the four print units, 


01:01.635 --> 01:05.582
which apply ink on both sides 
of the paper at the same time. 


01:05.582 --> 01:09.852
The presses use a technique 
called offset printing. 


01:09.852 --> 01:14.257
This process uses printing plates 
designed to allow water 


01:14.257 --> 01:17.060
to repel ink from the nonimage areas 


01:17.060 --> 01:20.130
and attract ink to the image areas. 


01:20.130 --> 01:24.133
The plate then transfers the ink 
to a rubber blanket, 


01:24.133 --> 01:29.000
which then transfers 
the ink to the paper. 


01:31.340 --> 01:34.743
Four colors of ink 
are used to create the images.


01:34.743 --> 01:39.615
They are black, 
cyan, magenta, and yellow. 


01:39.615 --> 01:42.952
The ink on the paper 
is applied in tiny dots. 


01:42.952 --> 01:47.000
By using this technique, 
a wide range of colors can be achieved.


01:50.260 --> 01:52.462
Now the paper 
goes through the dryer, 


01:52.462 --> 01:55.932
which maintains a temperature 
of around 400 degrees Fahrenheit 


01:55.932 --> 01:57.965
(200°C). 


01:57.965 --> 02:02.172
Solvents from the ink 
are evaporated inside the dryer. 


02:02.172 --> 02:05.842
Next, in order to set the ink 
so that it will not smear, 


02:05.842 --> 02:09.979
the paper travels through a series 
of rollers filled with chilled water.


02:09.978 --> 02:12.048
Now that the ink is dry, 


02:12.048 --> 02:16.651
the paper is folded and cut.


02:16.652 --> 02:19.122
Finally, the conveyer 
brings the cut signatures 


02:19.122 --> 02:22.000
out of the press, 
and they are checked for quality. 


02:24.127 --> 02:43.530
They are then processed 
and distributed to the congregations.

00:04 I was in the military  for 13 years.
00:07 Women didn’t used to belong  to combat regiments.
00:12 I was the first to obtain  the rank of sergeant in my regiment.
00:18 I lived the army 24/7.
00:21 The clothes I wore,
00:23 the people I associated with
00:26 —everything was military.
00:32 Being in a man’s field  is very intimidating.
00:36 I felt I had to work twice as hard,  be twice as fast, and be twice as good.
00:41 So I became more and more aggressive
00:45 in order to accomplish the missions  that were given to me.
00:49 I let the pressure to perform
00:52 affect me in negative ways.
00:56 I did not feel anything.
01:00 I used more profanity.
01:02 I drank more heavily.
01:05 I smoked more.
01:10 It wasn’t the quality  of the life that I wanted.
01:16 I felt that my life  wasn’t going anywhere.
01:24 And there was a knock  on the front door.
01:27 It was very surprising  to learn from the Scriptures
01:30 that I could draw close to God.
01:33 But the Witnesses,  they explained things in a way
01:37 that it made sense,
01:39 and I could verify all of it myself.
01:43 I didn’t understand what they meant
01:47 by ‘God could love you.’
01:49 The Witnesses showed me  how to look in the Bible
01:52 and find out what the Bible  said about it all.
01:56 It gave me a desire  to keep going,
02:01 and things started  to get a lot better.
02:05 When I put down my rifle
02:07 and I picked up a Bible,  those around me,
02:11 they didn’t understand it at all.
02:15 It’s worth everything just to show someone  that they can be loved.
02:19 Just to watch that change is fabulous.
02:23 It’s only with a lot of prayer and meditation
02:28 that I was able to change my personality.
02:32 Jehovah guides me.
02:34 If you put your anxiety on him,
02:38 he will give you that peace.
02:43 My husband is my joy.
02:46 He’s showing me the patience
02:48 and the loving-kindness
02:51 that Jehovah wants families
02:53 to experience.
02:56 The members of my congregation  are my family.
03:01 They are my brothers and sisters.
03:04 I now have a huge worldwide family.
03:07 We have a lovely, lovely congregation.
03:11 And to be able to laugh and joke
03:15 and to talk about Jehovah, it’s wonderful.
03:19 When I was in the military,
03:22 I became a very dark and uncaring person.
03:26 Jehovah has taught me how to beat my sword
03:30 into a plowshare.
03:32 He taught me that I didn’t need
03:35 to “learn war anymore.”

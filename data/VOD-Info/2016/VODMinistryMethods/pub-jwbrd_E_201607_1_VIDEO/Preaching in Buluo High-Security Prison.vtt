00:05.088 --> 00:10.760
I could say that my past 
was really an unhappy past. 


00:10.760 --> 00:13.000
I went through very difficult times 
during my childhood. 


00:15.232 --> 00:17.234
I lost hope 


00:17.233 --> 00:20.970
that I could ever have 
a better life. 


00:20.970 --> 00:22.972
Because of that, 


00:22.972 --> 00:26.000
I started to associate with 
the wrong people in my life. 


00:28.645 --> 00:32.915
One night, I was arrested 
and sent to Buluo Prison. 


00:32.915 --> 00:36.000
It is a high-security prison 
in Congo.


00:41.858 --> 00:44.693
Prison is a very dangerous place. 


00:44.693 --> 00:48.130
But I was surprised how they 
accepted the truth so easily. 


00:48.130 --> 00:50.833
Really, I was amazed.


00:50.833 --> 00:53.636
We needed to obtain permission 


00:53.637 --> 00:55.939
to be able to continue 
to preach in the prison. 


00:55.938 --> 00:59.000
We had so enjoyed 
the preaching work there. 


01:02.845 --> 01:06.348
I went to see the authorities in the city 
to find out what was required 


01:06.348 --> 01:10.000
so that we could have permission 
to preach in the prison. 


01:11.888 --> 01:15.691
To my great amazement, 
they simply handed me a paper 


01:15.692 --> 01:18.662
and told me to put 
my request in writing. 


01:18.662 --> 01:20.664
They asked me to wait. 


01:20.663 --> 01:23.633
Within minutes, 
I had the authorization 


01:23.633 --> 01:26.668
in my hands without 
paying anything at all. 


01:26.668 --> 01:28.838
Every time the situation 


01:28.838 --> 01:31.140
seemed insurmountable to us, 


01:31.140 --> 01:33.208
impossible to us, 


01:33.208 --> 01:35.211
we saw the hand of Jehovah 


01:35.212 --> 01:38.000
providing us 
with the suitable solution.


01:40.817 --> 01:43.654
The authorization gave a great boost 


01:43.653 --> 01:46.255
to this special witnessing initiative. 


01:46.255 --> 01:50.127
In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23, 


01:50.127 --> 01:54.397
the brothers could then 
‘become all things to people of all sorts, 


01:54.397 --> 01:58.602
so that they might 
by all possible means save some.’


01:58.602 --> 02:02.672
Some religious leaders 
who were also prisoners 


02:02.672 --> 02:05.909
were extremely opposed 
to our presence. 


02:05.908 --> 02:09.000
They conspired and had us 
thrown out of our meeting place.


02:11.882 --> 02:15.985
The prisoners themselves 
were concerned about this. 


02:15.985 --> 02:20.000
They found another meeting place 
even more spacious than the former.


02:26.595 --> 02:30.667
Since Buluo is eight kilometers 
away from our congregation, 


02:30.667 --> 02:33.837
to transport the group who support 
the preaching work and meetings, 


02:33.837 --> 02:36.239
the body of elders organized two minibuses 


02:36.238 --> 02:39.000
to go out every Saturday to Buluo. 


02:41.043 --> 02:44.613
Once they arrive, 
they begin the preaching work at 8:30, 


02:44.613 --> 02:47.283
and at 10 o’clock 
the meetings start. 


02:47.283 --> 02:51.000
All the meetings of the week 
are held on the Saturday.


02:54.557 --> 02:58.729
Concerning Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
personally, I am very impressed. 


02:58.728 --> 03:02.531
It’s more than three years they’ve been 
more active in helping the detainees. 


03:02.532 --> 03:06.535
The reeducation of the prisoners 
is assured by Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


03:06.535 --> 03:10.207
This is a good collaboration 
on the part of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


03:10.207 --> 03:14.000
With this I’m very happy.


03:21.217 --> 03:23.385
One hundred 
and seventy-five attended 


03:23.385 --> 03:25.788
the circuit assembly 
in December 2014, 


03:25.788 --> 03:29.758
which was held in the prison, 
and seven were baptized. 


03:29.758 --> 03:33.000
Local media covered the event.


03:35.832 --> 03:39.069
This is the first time I have seen 
Jehovah’s Witnesses 


03:39.068 --> 03:41.503
baptized here 
in the Buluo Prison. 


03:41.503 --> 03:43.505
This is a good thing. 


03:43.505 --> 03:46.575
I encourage you 
to continue with this assistance.


03:46.575 --> 03:49.945
Every week there are 
more than 80 in attendance 


03:49.945 --> 03:53.850
and sometimes 
more than that, even 140. 


03:53.850 --> 03:55.885
In the attendance 
there are the 36 publishers


03:55.885 --> 03:59.688
—the brothers who learned 
the truth in Buluo Prison—


03:59.688 --> 04:03.000
30 are baptized 
and 6 unbaptized.


04:07.630 --> 04:11.333
I visited many churches 
because I had a lot of questions, 


04:11.333 --> 04:15.000
but I never got 
any exact answers. 


04:16.238 --> 04:20.075
When I went to see 
Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


04:20.075 --> 04:22.978
they gave me accurate answers 
from the Bible. 


04:22.978 --> 04:26.048
To know that 
Jehovah is compassionate 


04:26.048 --> 04:28.050
and ready to forgive, 


04:28.050 --> 04:31.000
these are the qualities 
that touched me.


04:33.122 --> 04:35.459
I used to be a soldier. 


04:35.458 --> 04:37.460
I was in the military. 


04:37.460 --> 04:39.795
I attended various churches 


04:39.795 --> 04:42.298
because I had a question 
that bothered me a lot. 


04:42.298 --> 04:45.468
I wondered why God allows 
bad things to happen 


04:45.468 --> 04:48.270
to people all the time. 


04:48.270 --> 04:52.142
While I was in prison, 


04:52.142 --> 04:57.000
Jehovah’s Witnesses came to visit 
and talk to us. 


04:58.848 --> 05:01.383
I asked them 
the same question, 


05:01.383 --> 05:05.855
“Why does God allow sickness 
and suffering to continue?” 


05:05.855 --> 05:09.000
They replied by using 
three Bible verses. 


05:11.193 --> 05:15.000
I was very happy because I received 
the answer to my question.


05:20.268 --> 05:23.238
Papy Okito is a brother 


05:23.238 --> 05:25.273
who learned 
the truth in prison. 


05:25.273 --> 05:27.976
He made 
such remarkable progress 


05:27.977 --> 05:30.000
that those in charge 
now have confidence in him. 


05:33.717 --> 05:35.852
Like Joseph in the Bible, 


05:35.852 --> 05:40.322
he has been placed in a position 
of supervision over the other prisoners. 


05:40.322 --> 05:43.659
He also made further progress, 
and thus, the management has requested 


05:43.658 --> 05:47.000
that his prison sentence 
be reduced.


05:48.263 --> 05:51.000
When I arrived in the prison, 
I had lost hope. 


05:52.135 --> 05:54.170
I thought for me 
it was the end. 


05:54.170 --> 05:56.172
By means of the Bible, 


05:56.172 --> 05:59.442
I have found joy 
and hope in my life. 


05:59.442 --> 06:04.314
That is why today I am happy 
even though I am still here. 


06:04.313 --> 06:08.000
But I know that 
the Paradise is for me.


06:22.998 --> 06:25.835
It’s been five years 
since the brothers 


06:25.835 --> 06:28.137
started preaching 
in the Buluo Prison. 


06:28.137 --> 06:32.809
At times, the publishers place 
up to 500 magazines in one weekend. 


06:32.808 --> 06:36.811
Although our success is not 
measured by the number of placements, 


06:36.812 --> 06:39.315
this response does paint 
a clear picture 


06:39.315 --> 06:42.285
of the spiritual thirst 
among these prisoners. 


06:42.285 --> 06:45.755
In the last few months, 
inside these prison walls, 


06:45.755 --> 06:49.525
11 more unbaptized publishers 
have been approved. 


06:49.525 --> 06:53.830
What a loving act by Jehovah 
and his organization 


06:53.830 --> 07:08.662
to help such individuals satisfy 
their spiritual needs!

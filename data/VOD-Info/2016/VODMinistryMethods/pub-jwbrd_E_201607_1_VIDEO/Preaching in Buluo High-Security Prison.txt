00:05 I could say that my past  was really an unhappy past.
00:10 I went through very difficult times  during my childhood.
00:15 I lost hope
00:17 that I could ever have  a better life.
00:20 Because of that,
00:22 I started to associate with  the wrong people in my life.
00:28 One night, I was arrested  and sent to Buluo Prison.
00:32 It is a high-security prison  in Congo.
00:41 Prison is a very dangerous place.
00:44 But I was surprised how they  accepted the truth so easily.
00:48 Really, I was amazed.
00:50 We needed to obtain permission
00:53 to be able to continue  to preach in the prison.
00:55 We had so enjoyed  the preaching work there.
01:02 I went to see the authorities in the city  to find out what was required
01:06 so that we could have permission  to preach in the prison.
01:11 To my great amazement,  they simply handed me a paper
01:15 and told me to put  my request in writing.
01:18 They asked me to wait.
01:20 Within minutes,  I had the authorization
01:23 in my hands without  paying anything at all.
01:26 Every time the situation
01:28 seemed insurmountable to us,
01:31 impossible to us,
01:33 we saw the hand of Jehovah
01:35 providing us  with the suitable solution.
01:40 The authorization gave a great boost
01:43 to this special witnessing initiative.
01:46 In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23,
01:50 the brothers could then  ‘become all things to people of all sorts,
01:54 so that they might  by all possible means save some.’
01:58 Some religious leaders  who were also prisoners
02:02 were extremely opposed  to our presence.
02:05 They conspired and had us  thrown out of our meeting place.
02:11 The prisoners themselves  were concerned about this.
02:15 They found another meeting place  even more spacious than the former.
02:26 Since Buluo is eight kilometers  away from our congregation,
02:30 to transport the group who support  the preaching work and meetings,
02:33 the body of elders organized two minibuses
02:36 to go out every Saturday to Buluo.
02:41 Once they arrive,  they begin the preaching work at 8:30,
02:44 and at 10 o’clock  the meetings start.
02:47 All the meetings of the week  are held on the Saturday.
02:54 Concerning Jehovah’s Witnesses,  personally, I am very impressed.
02:58 It’s more than three years they’ve been  more active in helping the detainees.
03:02 The reeducation of the prisoners  is assured by Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:06 This is a good collaboration  on the part of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:10 With this I’m very happy.
03:21 One hundred  and seventy-five attended
03:23 the circuit assembly  in December 2014,
03:25 which was held in the prison,  and seven were baptized.
03:29 Local media covered the event.
03:35 This is the first time I have seen  Jehovah’s Witnesses
03:39 baptized here  in the Buluo Prison.
03:41 This is a good thing.
03:43 I encourage you  to continue with this assistance.
03:46 Every week there are  more than 80 in attendance
03:49 and sometimes  more than that, even 140.
03:53 In the attendance  there are the 36 publishers
03:55 —the brothers who learned  the truth in Buluo Prison—
03:59 30 are baptized  and 6 unbaptized.
04:07 I visited many churches  because I had a lot of questions,
04:11 but I never got  any exact answers.
04:16 When I went to see  Jehovah’s Witnesses,
04:20 they gave me accurate answers  from the Bible.
04:22 To know that  Jehovah is compassionate
04:26 and ready to forgive,
04:28 these are the qualities  that touched me.
04:33 I used to be a soldier.
04:35 I was in the military.
04:37 I attended various churches
04:39 because I had a question  that bothered me a lot.
04:42 I wondered why God allows  bad things to happen
04:45 to people all the time.
04:48 While I was in prison,
04:52 Jehovah’s Witnesses came to visit  and talk to us.
04:58 I asked them  the same question,
05:01 “Why does God allow sickness  and suffering to continue?”
05:05 They replied by using  three Bible verses.
05:11 I was very happy because I received  the answer to my question.
05:20 Papy Okito is a brother
05:23 who learned  the truth in prison.
05:25 He made  such remarkable progress
05:27 that those in charge  now have confidence in him.
05:33 Like Joseph in the Bible,
05:35 he has been placed in a position  of supervision over the other prisoners.
05:40 He also made further progress,  and thus, the management has requested
05:43 that his prison sentence  be reduced.
05:48 When I arrived in the prison,  I had lost hope.
05:52 I thought for me  it was the end.
05:54 By means of the Bible,
05:56 I have found joy  and hope in my life.
05:59 That is why today I am happy  even though I am still here.
06:04 But I know that  the Paradise is for me.
06:22 It’s been five years  since the brothers
06:25 started preaching  in the Buluo Prison.
06:28 At times, the publishers place  up to 500 magazines in one weekend.
06:32 Although our success is not  measured by the number of placements,
06:36 this response does paint  a clear picture
06:39 of the spiritual thirst  among these prisoners.
06:42 In the last few months,  inside these prison walls,
06:45 11 more unbaptized publishers  have been approved.
06:49 What a loving act by Jehovah  and his organization
06:53 to help such individuals satisfy  their spiritual needs!

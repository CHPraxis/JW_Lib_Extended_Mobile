00:09 Every year, thousands of truck drivers  from all over the world
00:14 crisscross the European continent.
00:18 They work hard to make ends meet  for their families
00:21 but often have to spend  weeks away from home.
00:26 Jesus and his apostles  approached people wherever they were.
00:30 It is this same spirit  that must motivate us.
00:34 By trying to reach truck drivers  wherever they can be found,
00:37 we can make sure  that everyone receives a witness,
00:41 even those who would  otherwise be missed.
00:43 We live in the Rotterdam area  which has a lot of truck traffic.
00:47 We cover our regular territory  once every three months,
00:50 while these truck drivers  are hardly ever reached.
00:55 We noticed that 300,000 trucks  crossed France every year.
01:00 Thus, it was necessary to explore
01:02 this formidable potential for the ministry.
01:07 Many truck drivers use truck stops
01:09 to take a short break or even spend the night there.
01:12 That’s ideal for preaching.
01:19 While we are parked here, resting,
01:22 we are cleaning the trucks;
01:26 we are washing our clothes  because there is no laundry here;
01:30 and also we do our cooking.
01:37 One day on my way to France,
01:40 I had to stop in Austria
01:43 to swap drivers.
01:45 My colleague went to the bathroom,  and I was alone.
01:49 At that moment, a Witness came  and offered me a magazine.
01:56 Much effort is being put into reaching  truck drivers in an organized way.
02:02 We made sure all truck stops  were mapped
02:04 and organized schedules so that pioneers
02:07 can preach in this territory  at least once a day.
02:12 Publishers will encounter  many different nationalities and languages.
02:18 The language barrier  is one of the biggest challenges.
02:21 On any given morning,  you can encounter
02:23 up to ten different languages:  Romanian, Russian, Polish.
02:29 When I looked at the magazine,  I saw that it was a Watchtower,
02:33 but I thought it was in German.
02:35 I told this brother  that I did not speak German.
02:39 Then he had a look at my license plate  and saw that it was Romanian.
02:43 He again offered me  the magazine and told me:
02:46 “It is Romanian.  It is for you.”
02:49 When I saw it,  I was very happy.
02:52 I took the magazine  and was very glad.
02:58 Of course, we don’t speak in tongues  like the first-century Christians did.
03:02 But jw.org makes us feel like  we can preach in any language.
03:10 We need to go further  than just distributing publications.
03:14 We need to be real teachers,  and to do that,
03:17 we can make use of the videos.
03:24 A driver had his Bible  wide open on his dashboard
03:27 and literally cried when he watched  the video Why Study the Bible?
03:34 Since truck drivers spend  most of their time on the road,
03:38 it is a real challenge to follow up  on those who have shown any interest.
03:45 It’s very difficult to do return visits  or to start Bible studies.
03:49 You just don’t know when you will meet  a truck driver again.
03:52 So we try to get their e-mail addresses  as soon as possible.
04:00 The results were remarkable.
04:02 For example, in the last service year,
04:05 about 100,000 magazines were placed,
04:07 100 Bible studies were started,
04:10 and 4,000 videos were shown.
04:16 Experience shows  that even if it’s not possible
04:20 to obtain an e-mail address,
04:22 the slightest witness given  can have a great impact.
04:27 In time, I returned to Romania.
04:30 I started a Bible study,  progressed spiritually, got married,
04:34 and now I am  an unbaptized publisher.
04:36 The brother that first  contacted me has no idea.
04:42 Hebrews 6:11 invites us all
04:45 ‘to show industriousness’ in our ministry.
04:50 The more you invest in  this form of ministry,
04:52 the more fulfillment you get  from the positive response of the drivers.
05:00 It is a good thing  to preach the good news at truck stops
05:04 because all drivers need to feel God’s love,
05:07 to see that God really cares for us.
05:11 And like me,  they can make changes in their lives.
05:19 And they need to see that Jehovah   has promised a future paradise
05:22 and how this will affect them
05:24 and their families.

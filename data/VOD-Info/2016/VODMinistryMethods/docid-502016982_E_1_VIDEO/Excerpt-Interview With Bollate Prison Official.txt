00:03 The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:05 is now a reality in this prison, the prison of Bollate.
00:09 It has been up and running  for around a year and a half.
00:12 And a truly notable  number of inmates attend,
00:15 who every Thursday and every Sunday
00:17 freely choose to take part in the meetings.
00:21 All Bible topics are discussed
00:23 and also the relationship
00:24 with the authorities, relationships with,
00:27 that is the relationship with the outside world,
00:30 respect for the rules.
00:32 The knowledge  that so many people
00:34 attend the meetings of the Kingdom Hall
00:36 —that are held in the Kingdom Hall—
00:38 has convinced us that it was an excellent choice, worthwhile.
00:42 A Kingdom Hall in other detention centers,
00:44 well, that would be a great idea.

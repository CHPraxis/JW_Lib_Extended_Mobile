00:01 Tim, thanks for reading  all the Appendix
00:04 “1914—A Significant Year in Bible Prophecy.”
00:08 You understood it, right?
00:10 Well, it’s not completely clear.
00:13 OK, well, let’s go through it again.
00:16 If you remember,  Luke 21:24,
00:20 said that Jersusalem  would “be trampled on by the nations
00:24 until the appointed times  of the nations are fulfilled.”
00:27 Now, we know that began in 607 B.C.E.,
00:31 and at Daniel 4:16,
00:33 it said that seven times  would have to pass over it,
00:37 and at Revelation 12: 6, 14,
00:40 it indicates  that three and a half times
00:42 equals 1,260 days;
00:46 so seven times  would be 2,520 days,
00:50 but of course,  we got the Bible principle
00:52 at Numbers 14:34,
00:54 “a day for a year, a day for a year.”
00:57 So that 2,520 days would be
00:59 2,520 years.
01:02 So counting 2,520 years
01:05 from 607 B.C.E.
01:07 brings us to 1914
01:10 when Jesus began to rule  as king in the heavens.
01:13 You got it now.
01:17 Um, it’s still not clear.
01:19 That’s OK,
01:22 I didn’t understand it  the first time I went through it.
01:24 Just read the Appendix
01:26 a few more times,
01:28 and it will make sense.
01:30 Come on,  let’s finish our study of chapter 8.
01:35 So based on what we’ve been learning  in chapter 8,
01:39 can you think of a good reason  why it’s so important
01:43 that we know  when God’s Kingdom began to rule?
01:46 Well, I think that if you knew  when God’s Kingdom began to rule,
01:51 then you would know
01:53 that the blessings of the Kingdom  are soon to follow.
01:56 That’s an excellent answer.
01:58 Of course, the Appendix here  contains the scriptural proof
02:01 of when God’s Kingdom  began to rule in 1914.
02:04 Would you like to read
02:06 just the first two paragraphs  in the Appendix there,
02:09 under the heading on page 215,
02:12 “1914-A Significant Year in Bible Prophecy.”
02:15 Sure.  “Decades in advance, Bible students . . .”
02:20 Thank you.
02:22 So notice there that Jesus  said that the city of Jerusalem
02:26 would be “trampled on by the nations
02:29 until the appointed times  of the nations are fulfilled.”
02:32 Now for us  to understand Jesus’ words,
02:36 we have to know,  Why was Jerusalem special?
02:40 What did Jersusalem symbolize?
02:43 So, what did we learn about Jerusalem  there in paragraph 2?
02:47 Um, well, Jerusalem was  where the Jewish kings ruled, right?
02:51 So they would have ruled for Jehovah,
02:54 which meant that Jerusalem  was a symbol of Jehovah’s rulership.
02:57 Very good.
02:59 Now you have the key
03:01 to understanding  when Jesus began to rule as king.
03:04 Wow, this is really interesting.
03:06 It’s like solving a mystery.
03:08 Isn’t it?  Let’s read the next paragraph.

00:00.550 --> 00:04.920
Jehovah’s people have always considered 
the studying of his Word 


00:04.920 --> 00:07.590
to be an essential part of life. 


00:07.590 --> 00:11.795
God’s Law to Israel commanded 
that the king “must read from [the Law] 


00:11.795 --> 00:16.733
all the days of his life, so that he 
may learn to fear Jehovah his God.” 


00:16.733 --> 00:20.536
In the Mayan territories 
of Yucatán, Mexico, 


00:20.537 --> 00:25.475
our brothers are helping people 
learn to read God’s Word for themselves. 


00:25.475 --> 00:30.080
People’s lives change when they 
can finally read the Bible on their own 


00:30.080 --> 00:35.000
and more readily ‘learn 
to fear Jehovah their God.’


00:44.693 --> 00:49.098
One out of every six people on earth 
doesn’t know how to read. 


00:49.098 --> 00:51.100
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
around the world 


00:51.100 --> 00:55.000
have organized literacy classes 
to help such ones.


00:59.375 --> 01:02.078
I don’t like to read. 


01:02.078 --> 01:07.000
I used to sleep at the meetings.


01:11.587 --> 01:13.590
In our territory, 


01:13.590 --> 01:18.093
most people speak the Mayan language, 
but very few can read it. 


01:18.093 --> 01:21.263
On occasion I would give a talk, 
and when I would 


01:21.263 --> 01:24.266
cite a scripture, 
most of the audience would look it up. 


01:24.267 --> 01:27.604
But then I would see 
a blank stare on their faces 


01:27.603 --> 01:30.000
because they 
couldn’t read the text.


01:31.640 --> 01:34.443
I was moved 
to learn how to read 


01:34.443 --> 01:39.000
because I wanted to learn about Jehovah 
and study his Word, the Bible. 


01:40.283 --> 01:45.588
So a sister came 
to my house to teach me.


01:45.588 --> 01:49.591
Literacy classes are often conducted 
on an individual level. 


01:49.592 --> 01:53.129
After a person has had their Bible study, 
they can spend some time 


01:53.128 --> 01:56.165
to practice reading skills. 


01:56.165 --> 02:00.503
But when 
the local elders notice 


02:00.503 --> 02:03.105
that there are many 
that can benefit from this training, 


02:03.105 --> 02:05.708
they can schedule 
a larger class 


02:05.708 --> 02:07.710
at the Kingdom Hall. 


02:07.710 --> 02:11.313
The study material used 
for this purpose is the brochure 


02:11.313 --> 02:13.783
Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing. 


02:13.783 --> 02:18.000
It’s available in 30 languages 
in the Central America branch territory. 


02:20.590 --> 02:23.893
Other study materials can be used 
as well, as long as they help 


02:23.893 --> 02:27.000
the development of the students 
enrolled in the class.


02:28.998 --> 02:31.000
And we use a board 
on which we write, 


02:31.000 --> 02:34.137
for instance, words 
that are difficult to pronounce. 


02:34.137 --> 02:38.642
This helps in the reading 
of complicated words. 


02:38.642 --> 02:43.345
There are some who are, 
well, very quick learners. 


02:43.345 --> 02:46.482
On the other hand, 
others go word by word. 


02:46.482 --> 02:51.154
But as they practice, 
they start getting the hang of it.


02:51.153 --> 02:54.590
I’m good at masonry work, 


02:54.590 --> 02:58.060
but learning to read 


02:58.060 --> 03:00.062
is not easy.


03:00.062 --> 03:04.200
Reading at his age 
is a big challenge.


03:04.200 --> 03:08.403
You need to understand 
that each student learns differently. 


03:08.403 --> 03:11.000
With some, 
you need to be very patient.


03:13.108 --> 03:17.113
The first word 
I learned to write was Jehovah.


03:17.113 --> 03:19.615
“It’s like this,” I tell him. 


03:19.615 --> 03:22.752
He says, “It’s ‘cause 
you’re not being patient with me!”


03:22.752 --> 03:27.024
Having a sense of humor 
is a big help in the learning process, 


03:27.023 --> 03:30.000
so as not to focus 
on errors and mistakes.


03:31.127 --> 03:35.197
Since 1946, when records 
began being taken in Mexico, 


03:35.197 --> 03:39.635
more than 152,000 people 
have learned to read and write, 


03:39.635 --> 03:41.503
thanks to these training efforts. 


03:41.503 --> 03:43.438
The Secretary of Public Education 


03:43.438 --> 03:47.076
in the State of Mexico 
has recognized the work and the great help 


03:47.077 --> 03:51.214
these literacy classes 
have been to the local citizens. 


03:51.213 --> 03:53.816
The skills they learn 
help in their day-to-day life, 


03:53.817 --> 03:56.285
but also it helps them 
to learn more about Jehovah 


03:56.285 --> 03:59.988
and to be able to teach others.


03:59.988 --> 04:04.093
I used to have to memorize 
everything I was going to say, 


04:04.093 --> 04:06.095
but now I can read 


04:06.095 --> 04:10.000
short scriptures to people 
directly from the Bible.


04:12.002 --> 04:15.439
As the students progress 
in the class, they demonstrate 


04:15.438 --> 04:18.373
the words found 
at 1 Timothy 4:15, 


04:18.373 --> 04:21.310
which says in part 


04:21.310 --> 04:24.980
“so that your advancement 
may be plainly seen by all people.” 


04:24.980 --> 04:28.000
And these benefits 
are plainly seen in the students.


04:29.985 --> 04:31.988
My husband was an alcoholic, 


04:31.988 --> 04:35.391
he smoked, 
and he used bad language. 


04:35.392 --> 04:38.394
But he made big changes 
in his life, 


04:38.393 --> 04:42.031
and we see that this training 
has been a big help. 


04:42.032 --> 04:45.869
We really see 
these great blessings.


04:45.868 --> 04:50.673
Reading helped me 
to get baptized.


04:50.673 --> 04:55.043
Helping other people 
to improve their reading skills 


04:55.043 --> 04:57.246
makes me feel very happy. 


04:57.247 --> 05:01.017
I feel great because I see 
on their face the joy they get 


05:01.017 --> 05:05.020
from reading and understanding 
the information.


05:05.020 --> 05:08.423
Well, I’ve benefited so much. 


05:08.423 --> 05:09.858
For instance, 


05:09.858 --> 05:14.130
now we read the Bible 
together as a family. 


05:14.130 --> 05:16.398
It makes me very happy.


05:16.398 --> 05:19.001
We’re more united as a family. 


05:19.002 --> 05:22.172
Our children 
respect my husband more, 


05:22.172 --> 05:25.000
like the father he is.


05:27.143 --> 05:29.545
Now I’m a ministerial servant.


05:29.545 --> 05:33.482
When I go preaching 
door to door, 


05:33.482 --> 05:36.819
some people say, 
“I don’t know how to read.” 


05:36.818 --> 05:40.021
But then I tell them, 


05:40.022 --> 05:43.659
“I didn’t know either, 
but I learned about Jehovah. 


05:43.658 --> 05:46.000
And you can too!”


05:48.397 --> 06:22.415
If I learned to read, 
anybody can.

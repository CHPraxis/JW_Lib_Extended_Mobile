00:00 Welcome to our program!
00:04 What are the benefits  of making the effort
00:06 to serve  in an unassigned territory?
00:08 Join this family as they travel
00:11 to a distant area to support  the Kingdom preaching work.
00:16 We will see how such a decision  builds their faith.
00:20 And our young ones,  have you started noticing the opposite sex?
00:25 And yet, you know  you’re not old enough to get married.
00:29 What can help you to take control  of such natural feelings?
00:32 We will find out  later in the program.
00:36 We’ll also hear the fascinating story  of Erich Frost—a brother
00:41 who was sent to a Nazi concentration camp during World War II because of his faith.
00:47 How did he and his fellow brothers  help each other to remain faithful?
00:52 You will find this story  very encouraging.
00:56 That, and much more,  is coming your way
00:58 on this May program  of JW Broadcasting!
01:21 I would first like to read to you  some passages from the Bible
01:26 found at Ephesians chapter 3,
01:29 verses 14 through 19.
01:32 This will also establish the theme  for my comments this month.
01:37 Ephesians 3,  starting with verse 14, Paul said:
01:42 “For this reason  I bend my knees to the Father,
01:46 “to whom every family in heaven  and on earth owes its name.
01:51 “I pray that he may grant you  through the abundance of his glory
01:55 “to be made mighty  in the man you are inside,
01:58 “with power through his spirit,
02:01 “and that through your faith you may have  the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.
02:05 “May you be rooted  and established on the foundation,
02:09 “in order that with all the holy ones  you may be thoroughly able
02:13 “to comprehend fully  what is the breadth
02:16 “and length  and height and depth,
02:19 “and to know the love of the Christ,  which surpasses knowledge,
02:23 “so that you may be filled  with all the fullness
02:27 that God gives.”
02:29 Now, verse 15
02:31 is the inspiration  for my theme, namely,
02:34 “Glorify Jehovah—The One  to Whom Every Family Owes Its Name.”
02:41 The family unit is under a vicious attack  in these last days.
02:46 The Insight book  lived up to its name
02:49 under the heading “Family.”
02:51 The very insightful comment  reads this way:
02:56 “The inspired Scriptures  have foretold a vicious attack
03:00 “on the family institution  with a consequent breaking down of morality
03:05 and of human society  outside the . . . congregation.”
03:10 The article pointed out  that in “‘the last days’
03:15 “a condition in which  disobedience to parents,
03:19 “disloyalty, and absence  of ‘natural affection’ would be rife,
03:24 even among those  ‘having a form of godly devotion.’”
03:28 How can married couples,  parents, and children
03:33 counteract  such a diabolical attack?
03:37 Do you remember those verses  we read in Ephesians chapter 3?
03:42 Verse 16 said that the One  to whom every family owes its name,
03:47 Jehovah, would ‘grant us to be made mighty
03:50 in the person we are inside.’
03:52 Yes, Jehovah can give us
03:55 the internal  spiritual strength to fight back
03:59 against Satan’s efforts  to destroy the family.
04:03 How?
04:05 By being immersed in God’s Word.
04:08 In particular,  by imitating the loving way
04:12 that Jesus treated his disciples.
04:15 Did you note  that Ephesians 3:17 said
04:19 we are to “have the Christ  dwell in [our] hearts with love”?
04:23 Yes, if each of us cherishes  the Christ in our hearts
04:28 to the point that he dwells,  or resides, there constantly,
04:32 our family  will not only survive
04:35 but it will truly thrive.
04:38 This will be so evident  that verse 17 further states
04:42 that we will “be rooted  and established on the foundation.”
04:46 We will be solid!
04:49 And keep in mind  that 1 Corinthians 3:11 says
04:53 that the “foundation”  on which we build
04:56 “is Jesus Christ.”
04:58 Then verse 18  of Ephesians chapter 3 indicates that
05:03 our spiritual peripheral vision  will be enhanced.
05:07 We will not  have spiritual blind spots
05:09 that could allow the spirit of the world  to creep into the family.
05:14 That verse says  that we will “be thoroughly able
05:17 “to comprehend fully  what is the breadth
05:20 and length  and height and depth.”
05:23 All aspects of Jesus’ personality  will come into play
05:27 as we interact  with family members.
05:30 Finally, verse 19  sums up the result when it says
05:34 that we would then  have come “to know the love of the Christ,
05:39 which surpasses knowledge.”
05:41 Granted,  knowledge is important,
05:45 but it is the application
05:48 of Christlike love  that will preserve our family,
05:52 keeping it vibrantly intact.
05:55 Family life  in these critical last days
05:59 could be likened to those  who suffer from diabetes.
06:02 It is believed  that diabetes is caused
06:04 by both genetic  and environmental factors.
06:08 Similarly, all in the family  have inherited sin
06:12 and imperfection  from our first human parents,
06:14 Adam and Eve,  as if genetically.
06:17 However, we are also exposed  to the ever more toxic
06:22 environmental factors  of Satan’s evil world.
06:26 Most who suffer  from a serious case of diabetes
06:29 need to use two methods
06:32 to successfully relieve the symptoms  and lead a normal life.
06:36 They have to watch their diet  and, in many cases,
06:39 take an injection  of insulin daily.
06:44 Spiritually,  we need to avoid the sickly,
06:47 sweet junk food  that the world promotes in movies,
06:51 talk shows,  the Internet, and in print.
06:56 Just as with the person  who has diabetes,
06:58 this requires  a permanent lifestyle change
07:01 from what we might have  exposed ourselves to in the past.
07:05 In addition to avoiding
07:07 unwholesome junk food  from Satan’s system,
07:10 we also need  to take daily “injections”
07:12 of God’s Word  and other wholesome provisions.
07:16 This has become more  and more important
07:19 the deeper we get  into these last days.
07:24 How has our organization provided this  when it comes to family life?
07:29 Well, in the early 1900’s,
07:33 the focus was on preaching  the good news.
07:35 Little attention was given
07:37 to building strong  Christian marriages and families.
07:41 For a time,  marriage was even discouraged
07:44 well beyond  the intent of the Scriptures.
07:47 I did some checking,  and commendably
07:50 between 1919 and 1921
07:54 there was a feature  in the Golden Age magazine
07:57 once or twice a month  called the “Juvenile Bible Study.”
08:01 In 1920,  a brochure was released
08:04 called The Golden Age ABC.
08:07 Then it wasn’t until 1941  that the now famous book
08:11 entitled Children was handed out
08:13 to all young ones  at the convention that year.
08:17 But as the last days progressed,
08:21 more and more information for families was produced.
08:25 For example, in the 1970’s,
08:28 the book Making Your Family Life Happy  was released.
08:31 About the same time,  the books Listening to the Great Teacher
08:35 and Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It  were published.
08:39 In 1982, Awake!  began a regular series
08:43 that has run for decades  entitled “Young People Ask.”
08:47 We now have two up-to-date books  with the same title,
08:51 and the series of articles  continues on the jw.org website.
08:56 We have the book  Learn From the Great Teacher
08:59 and so many features  and activities for young ones
09:03 on the website that I would be out of time  if I tried to enumerate them all.
09:08 There are also regular articles  in our magazines
09:11 about marriage  and family life.
09:14 And I will certainly never forget  the privilege I had in 2012
09:19 to introduce the animated series  Become Jehovah’s Friend.
09:24 That has proved  to be a blessing
09:26 for both young ones  and their parents.
09:30 What a teaching tool for both!
09:34 In 2014, I attended  the international convention
09:39 in Atlanta, Georgia,  here in the United States.
09:43 After a little two-year-old girl  saw my face
09:46 on the big jumbo screen  giving a talk,
09:49 she eagerly started searching  all around her for someone.
09:53 When her parents asked her  who she was looking for, she said, “Caleb.
09:57 He must be here because I saw  his grandfather giving a talk.”
10:02 Many children ask
10:04 to meet Caleb in person  when they visit Bethel.
10:08 Two postings  of an item every month
10:10 is making quite an impression  on little hearts.
10:14 With Bible principles  being impressed on the minds and hearts
10:18 of children so early,  we prayerfully anticipate
10:22 many spiritually-minded teenagers  in the years to come.
10:27 We have so much  healthy spiritual food
10:31 for counteracting  family “diabetes.”
10:34 For this,  we give all glory to Jehovah,
10:38 the one “to whom  every family . . . owes its name.”
10:43 One of the favorite passages  of Scripture that anyone
10:47 professing to be Christian  loves is the 23rd Psalm.
10:52 Family heads, can we benefit
10:55 from imitating not only  the Fine Shepherd, Jesus,
10:58 but also the Great Shepherd,  Jehovah God?
11:03 I am going to borrow  the text of the 23rd Psalm
11:06 and adjust the words so that we  can sense a family’s tranquillity
11:11 when headship  is exercised properly.
11:14 In fact, you husbands,
11:17 as the script is read,  imagine it is your wife’s voice
11:22 describing the effect  your headship has on your family.
11:29 ‘[My husband]  is [our] shepherd.
11:33 ‘[We] will lack nothing.
11:35 ‘In grassy pastures  [refreshing recreation]
11:39 ‘he makes [us] lie down;  he leads [us]
11:42 ‘to well-watered resting-places  [meetings and conventions].
11:47 ‘He refreshes [us].
11:50 ‘He leads [us in the ministry]
11:52 ‘in the paths of righteousness  for the sake of [Jehovah’s] name.
11:57 ‘Though [we] walk in the valley  of deep [economic] shadow,
12:01 ‘[we] fear no harm,  for [Dad is] with [us];
12:06 ‘your rod and your staff  [loving discipline] reassure [us].
12:10 ‘You prepare a table [of family worship,  helping the children]
12:14 ‘for [us] before [our] enemies.
12:16 ‘You refresh  [our] head[s] with oil;
12:19 ‘[Our] cup  [of family well-being] is well-filled.
12:24 ‘Surely goodness and loyal love  will pursue [our family]
12:28 ‘all the days of [our] life,  and [our family]
12:32 will dwell in the house  of Jehovah for all [our] days.’
12:38 No further application called for.
12:42 We feel the sense of security  that envelops
12:45 the interior rooms  of such a home, don’t we?
12:50 Do you remember  the point made
12:52 in Ephesians chapter 3,  which we read earlier?
12:56 We are to treasure  Jesus’ personality
12:59 and let it “dwell”  in our hearts.
13:02 If all in the family  make a determined effort
13:05 to treat each other  like Jesus would,
13:07 we can conquer the world!
13:10 Yes, we—His spiritual family  in heaven
13:13 and all humans on earth  who dedicate their lives to Him
13:17 —give glory to Jehovah!
13:19 Indeed, we thank Jehovah
13:22 for all the spiritual provisions  he has made through his Word
13:26 and organization to protect every family  who takes up his name.
13:31 May Jehovah bless  all of you families
13:34 as you strive to win  the war that Satan wages
13:37 against you  in these last days.
13:42 An important aspect
13:45 of keeping  the family’s spiritual health intact
13:48 is by making full use  of the Family Worship arrangement.
13:53 In this dramatization,  pay attention
13:56 to how the family head  is aware of the needs of the family
13:59 and how he plans accordingly.
14:02 Hi, my name is Joe.
14:06 A few weeks ago,  we all sat together for supper.
14:09 I was so tired, and my wife,  Jenny, felt the same way.
14:14 She always does it all,  taking care of the children so well,
14:18 but it was not easy  for her in recent weeks.
14:21 Sarah felt that we are too restrictive  on how she dresses.
14:25 She just does not understand.
14:27 It was hard to convince her.
14:29 And to motivate her  to share in the field service
14:32 is becoming a challenge.
14:34 It was not always like this.
14:36 She used to enjoy  going out in field service.
14:38 And Tom,  he is such a good boy,
14:41 but all of a sudden,  he was raving about the games
14:45 his classmates  have on their phones.
14:47 It’s always  about having supernatural powers,
14:51 and it fascinated him,  even though he is small.
14:54 But when I asked him  to take out the garbage,
14:57 suddenly  his superpowers left him.
15:00 And Mike,
15:02 our smallest,
15:05 it was hard  to get him to go to bed
15:07 or clean up his room.
15:10 I realized there are a few things  we need to speak about.
15:16 Joe came to me, and we talked  a lot about our children that same evening.
15:21 We wondered,  ‘What would be the best for them?’
15:23 We prayed together.
15:26 Then we had an idea!
15:30 The following day  we asked our children
15:33 if we could consider Noah  as the theme for our next family worship.
15:37 All of us liked the idea.
15:39 Each one of us  should prepare something.
15:44 Mike, Tom, and I  wanted to build the ark.
15:54 And, of course,  we need the animals.
16:00 And Sarah  should collect pictures
16:03 for the story  from our publications.
16:07 I also had to take time  to think again about the story of Noah
16:11 and how it  can help our family.
16:14 Jenny and Sarah were responsible  for the wardrobe and food.
16:18 While preparing,  I got the chance
16:20 to speak with Sarah about her dress  in a more relaxed setting.
16:24 She understood that,  like Noah,
16:27 when it comes to Jehovah’s commands,  we need to do “just so.”
16:32 Then the evening arrived.
16:36 We talked about  how it was before the Flood
16:39 and what kind of world  Noah and his family lived in.
16:43 Noah’s family needed  real courage to preach.
16:46 They had to explain about the rain  and how the ark would be needed
16:51 to survive the Flood —something that had never happened before.
16:55 All the people  thought they were crazy!
17:00 And while we were talking  about this, it came out
17:03 that Sarah felt embarrassed when she met  a schoolmate in the field service recently.
17:07 I realized Noah must have felt  the same as me,
17:12 and yet,  he was so courageous.
17:15 Dad read Genesis 6:9:
17:18 “Noah walked with the true God.”
17:21 So he could have every confidence  in his Friend, Jehovah.
17:25 I want to be just like that!
17:28 For Tom,  I found a great picture.
17:31 Dad told us that the world  at this time was very bad.
17:35 People were fighting  and many were afraid,
17:38 and that is why  Jehovah brought the Flood.
17:41 It made me think  about the games from my schoolmates.
17:44 I like to play those games,  but I know that Jehovah does not like that.
17:48 So why do I?
17:50 And the best part  was when we got inside the ark!
17:56 Then I read Genesis 6:19:
17:59 “And bring into the ark
18:01 two of every sort  of living creature.”
18:05 Dad showed us  how the animals went into the ark.
18:08 Each one had its own place,
18:10 and they went inside  two at a time without any chaos.
18:15 I explained that we also need  to keep our rooms clean like the ark.
18:20 I saw that Mike got the point.
18:24 We wanted  to keep in mind Genesis 6:22:
18:28 “And Noah did according to all  that God had commanded him.
18:32 He did just so.”
18:36 And then the rain came,  but we survived!
18:39 That was great!
18:41 We all realized
18:43 Noah also must have been  tired sometimes,
18:47 but he never gave up.
18:49 This was a good lesson for us.
18:53 We must take care  of our family as Noah did,
18:56 also by having  a regular family worship
18:59 like this.
19:03 That example really showed
19:05 many of the great benefits  of family worship.
19:09 In addition to the obvious
19:11 —coming together to learn  more about our heavenly Father
19:15 —we saw how family worship  gave the daughter
19:18 an opportunity  to open up about matters
19:20 that had been bothering her.
19:22 And thanks to the good work  of the parents,
19:24 all of the children  learned something
19:26 they could apply  in their daily lives.
19:29 We’ve now invited
19:31 Brother and Sister Ortiz  from New Britain, Connecticut,
19:35 to visit our studio.
19:37 Brother Ortiz serves as an elder  and as a regular pioneer.
19:41 He’s had many additional privileges  of service over the years.
19:44 And Linnette has been regular pioneering  for over six years.
19:49 However, the reason we wanted  to talk with them is that thus far
19:54 they have successfully countered  Satan’s attacks on their family.
19:58 We’d like to hear  how they accomplished this.
20:01 First of all, Freddie,
20:03 tell us a little bit  about your family.
20:05 Neither Linnette nor I  were raised in the truth.
20:08 However, we met,  and we fell in love.
20:11 At that time,  marriage was not for me.
20:14 So we started  a romantic relationship for two years
20:17 before we started attending  the first meeting at the Kingdom Hall.
20:21 Soon thereafter,  we started studying the Bible;
20:23 and we took two studies per week;  we knew this was the truth.
20:27 But also we learned
20:29 how Jehovah sees immorality,  so we needed to do some changes.
20:32 Linnette’s parents  wanted her to continue
20:36 with her education,  so we needed to change our behavior.
20:40 So two years after,
20:43 we did the changes.
20:46 Number one  because we did love Jehovah.
20:48 Number two because we loved  what we were learning.
20:51 It was worth it  to follow Bible principles.
20:54 So two years later,  we got married
20:57 and we got baptized —and we got married.
21:00 Very good.
21:01 So, Linnette, you were raised  without a knowledge of Jehovah God.
21:05 What changes did you both  have to make to ensure
21:08 your own family  would have a fine foundation
21:11 and be successful?
21:13 Well, prior to our baptism,  Freddie had a serious drinking problem.
21:18 And based on the way we were raised,  there was a lot of jealousy going on
21:21 and, I would say, a lack of confidence  and trust in each other.
21:27 My Bible teacher,  thankfully, suggested to us
21:30 to study the book  Making Your Family Life Happy.
21:34 And we ended up studying  that book twice.
21:37 That publication and the Bible principles  in it became the foundation
21:41 of our wonderful marriage  and the happy family we enjoy today.
21:46 Very nice.
21:47 So, Freddie, maybe you  can tell us about your children
21:50 and what they are doing  with their lives now.
21:52 We have two sons.
21:54 Gabriel, he’s the oldest one.
21:56 He started regular pioneering  when he was 14 years old.
21:59 At 18, he was appointed  as a ministerial servant.
22:03 At 22 years old, he has been working  in the Plumbing Department
22:07 at the Warwick construction  for more than two years.
22:09 Adrian is now 18 years old.
22:12 And he also started  regular pioneering when he was 14.
22:16 Currently, he handles  the accounts for the congregation
22:19 and other privileges as well.
22:21 Well, they both have had  an early start in their theocratic careers.
22:26 That’s commendable.
22:28 I’m sure you’re both  proud of them.
22:30 And we’re confident  that Jehovah,
22:32 the One “to whom  every family . . . owes its name,”
22:35 is pleased that they are giving  an answer to his taunter.
22:39 In addition  to the Family Life book,
22:42 what else contributed  to the success your family
22:45 has experienced, Linnette?
22:47 The Governing Body has provided us  with so many publications
22:51 with direction for families,  of course, all based on Jehovah’s Word.
22:55 So we decided early on that whenever  a question or an issue came up,
23:00 we would not make  any decision based on impulse.
23:04 Instead, we would research it  in the publications.
23:07 We pray to Jehovah  for him to give us wisdom.
23:11 And we even pray  for him to guide us
23:14 to find the right time to talk  to each other or to counsel the boys.
23:18 I have always heard  that there are stages
23:22 in the child’s life  and personality development.
23:25 So I researched in advance  as to what to expect.
23:28 In that way,  we were not surprised
23:31 when we saw changes  in attitudes or ideas.
23:36 And that helped us  realize what needed
23:39 to be addressed or corrected  as opposed to what was normal
23:44 for that stage  in the boys’ lives.
23:47 Very practical.
23:48 Freddie,  what can you add?
23:50 Over the years, I have learned  how essential it is to become a good listener
23:54 —also understanding.
23:56 I tell my family  how much I love them every day
23:58 because we never know  when circumstances might change.
24:01 Family worship  is very important for us.
24:04 I know it is easy to put off,  but the benefits are hard to beat.
24:08 Well,  before this arrangement started,
24:11 we as a family, we valued  the Bible study with the family.
24:17 I learned that a fetus  that is six months,
24:22 he can recognize  the family’s voice.
24:24 So I started a Bible study with my sons  when they were still in the womb . . .
24:28 Isn’t that nice.
24:30 . . . and continued  to do so after that.
24:33 I know that secular work  and other activities
24:37 can block  a regular program,
24:41 but we need to fight that tendency  if we want to succeed in family worship.
24:45 Very good.
24:47 Well, it seems your efforts  paid off when we consider
24:49 how well your family  has done spiritually
24:52 and the close relationship  you have with each other.
24:56 Now Linnette,  it sounds as if the family is perfect
25:00 —no challenges.
25:02 Is that the case?
25:04 No, not at all.
25:06 First Corinthians 10:13 says  that Christians will face
25:10 challenges  that are “common to [all] men.”
25:12 And we have faced the normal challenges  that come with raising a family.
25:17 The same verse indicates
25:20 that if we do things  Jehovah’s way,
25:24 we may increase the opportunity  for him to “make the way out” for us.
25:29 One unexpected challenge
25:31 that has changed  our family dynamics
25:35 over the years now,  was when Freddie
25:37 was diagnosed  with cancer in 2012.
25:40 The treatment was aggressive  and took its toll on his health.
25:45 Our whole lifestyle changed.
25:48 We had to move out  from our house . . .
25:50 Oh, boy.
25:52 . . . to an apartment,
25:54 we gave away our dog, Spike,
25:56 and we have to watch our expenses  really closely to keep going.
26:03 This could have put a lot  of strain in our family,
26:07 in our marriage,  and in our spirituality.
26:10 But, again, by praying to Jehovah constantly and applying Bible principles,
26:15 I can say my marriage
26:18 and my family  have never been better.
26:20 Wow.
26:21 Spiritually, we kept our routine,  and we all stayed
26:26 in full-time service  throughout the ordeal.
26:28 The boys  have cooperated very well.
26:32 They have offered  to work to give us money.
26:35 But we prefer for them  to keep focused on the Kingdom
26:38 because we are confident  that Jehovah
26:42 will add on  to the things we need.
26:45 Freddie has been  a great example for all of us
26:48 because he pushes himself
26:50 to keep his spiritual routine.
26:53 You never see him  complaining or in a bad mood.
26:56 And that has been very inspiring  for the rest of the family.
27:00 Boy, that is quite a story.
27:03 You folks will certainly relate  to the convention drama video
27:07 that was advertised  on our April program.
27:10 Freddie, we’re very sorry to hear  about your physical condition.
27:14 Are there any  favorite scriptures that you use
27:18 to help keep you going spiritually  and to stay strong?
27:21 There are many of them.
27:24 Just to mention a few,  Philippians 4:6,7
27:29 has been my life since 2012,
27:32 where I have to pray  to Jehovah constantly
27:34 so that he can give me  the strength that I need
27:37 to overcome my health.
27:40 And also,  Philippians says
27:43 that he will give us  peace of mind.
27:47 In addition,  he will safeguard our heart.
27:50 And that’s something  I’ve been seeing from Jehovah.
27:54 Also, Isaiah 41:10 states:
27:58 “Do not be anxious,  for I am your God.”
28:03 Those words give me comfort  that he will keep on helping us
28:06 in these different circumstances  in our life.
28:10 I do understand that my wife has a lot  of responsibilities in the household,
28:14 so I had to reread  Proverbs 31
28:17 verses 10 to 31,
28:20 where it describes  all of the responsibility a good wife
28:23 might have to shoulder  for the family.
28:26 So Brother Morris,  she is my Proverbs 31 wife!
28:29 A good wife for sure.
28:32 You’ve obviously shown how much  you love and respect each other.
28:36 That’s commendable.
28:38 And your focus on being the best parents  you could be is a good example
28:41 for parents viewing  the program at this time.
28:45 This will come  as a surprise to you,
28:48 but we would like to invite your two sons  out to see what they remember
28:51 from growing up  in the family.
28:55 We have Gabriel  and Adrian with us.
29:04 Mom’s getting a little teary-eyed.
29:07 That’s understandable.  It was a surprise, see.
29:10 So Gabriel,  since you’re the oldest,
29:14 we will start with you.
29:17 What do you remember  about your family life,
29:19 first in Puerto Rico  and later here in the United States?
29:23 I remember faithfully going  to all the meetings and going out in service
29:28 every Saturday —that was just the routine.
29:31 In Puerto Rico,  my dad had to work a lot though,
29:34 and like he said before,  that’s easy to get in the way
29:37 of a good family worship routine.
29:40 But I can honestly say that once we made  that transition of moving over here,
29:45 that helped us to have  a good family worship routine,
29:48 and it has helped us  to get closer and closer each day.
29:51 Now, isn’t that nice?
29:53 Now, Adrian, anything you can add  about the homelife?
29:56 Yeah, my mom  and dad have always
29:58 shown a great love for Jehovah  but also for each other.
30:02 So as kids,  you could just sense that.
30:05 So love and respect  is what we’ve always known.
30:08 Even now that my brother and I are older,  we have a great bond with each other.
30:12 We love each other and we can tell  each other everything about our lives.
30:16 And it’s due to that love  and respect that they have shown.
30:19 And even if there are disagreements,
30:21 which there are always going  to be disagreements
30:23 because it’s an imperfect family,
30:25 but that love is always there  to bridge those differences.
30:29 I also would like to add,  something that helped me a lot
30:32 was a routine  that my dad and I had
30:35 right before going to school;  we would always read the daily text.
30:39 And he would always say, “Behave,  and remember that Jehovah loves you.”
30:44 I don’t think he knows  how much that really helped me
30:48 go through  everyday challenges at school.
30:50 That’s priceless.
30:52 Now, very nice observations.
30:55 Gabriel, I’m interested  in understanding what prompted you
31:00 to regular pioneer  when you were only 14 years old?
31:04 It was at a point  where my dad lost his job.
31:06 Rather than stressing about it —worrying about it
31:09 —he looked at things  with a spiritual perspective.
31:13 So he started to pioneer.
31:15 And since our schedules  matched perfectly,
31:18 I was his little pioneer buddy.
31:20 I would go out in service  with him whenever he needed it.
31:22 And I feel like if spiritual families,  you know, focus on spiritual matters,
31:26 it helps them  to become closer.
31:29 And I can’t imagine  how our relationship
31:32 and respect for one another  can be any better than what it is now.
31:35 Very nice.
31:37 Now, Adrian,  you began pioneering
31:40 when you were 14 as well.
31:42 How do you think  that affected you as a person?
31:45 Well, first of all,  the reason why I started pioneering
31:48 was because I was going out in service  with the rest of my family,
31:51 and since they were already pioneering,  I was getting the time in.
31:55 But I do think  that taking on the responsibility
31:58 of getting  at least 70 hours a month
32:00 in the service  does make you think differently
32:05 at 14 than it would have otherwise.
32:07 I think it has helped me  mature spiritually,
32:10 and it has contributed to me being used  to my full potential in the congregation.
32:14 And honestly, I wouldn’t trade it  for anything, well, maybe going to Bethel.
32:19 Gabriel, back to you.
32:22 Tell us what was it like  when you learned
32:25 that your dad  had a serious health problem
32:28 and would not be able to provide  for the family like he used to?
32:32 That was probably one  of the biggest challenges I have ever faced.
32:36 When my dad got diagnosed with cancer,  it was about the same time
32:39 that I got my call to Bethel.
32:43 And I was torn; I was divided.
32:45 I felt like if I was to go  to Bethel now,
32:48 it would be selfish of me  to leave my family at a time like that.
32:52 But my family  always had a spiritual view
32:55 on things and cited scriptures  like Matthew 6:33 constantly.
32:59 It helped me to see as a whole—as a family —we put Kingdom interests first;
33:04 that Jehovah  was going to provide
33:06 because he’s a loving father  and friend.
33:08 And then my dad lost his job,  and again all these feelings came up.
33:12 But my family was adamant.
33:16 They let me know that the congregation  had been taking care of them
33:20 for months now,  and then doing some simplifying
33:23 on their own  helped them as well.
33:25 And I didn’t have to worry  about anything.
33:27 I do know that there’s a scripture that says that we’ve got to take care of our own.
33:31 So I do anything I can  to help my family back home.
33:35 The only thing I hope  is that I can have a good faith
33:40 like they’ve shown  through these difficult times.
33:44 Well, thank all of you  for joining us.
33:48 I think all of us  are feeling that emotion
33:51 and feel very close  to you for sharing that.
33:53 Now, as a father, I can appreciate  all that Freddie is trying to do
33:57 as head of the family.
34:00 And, Linnette, your support  beyond normal
34:03 is very much  to be commended.
34:05 We can tell your family  is thriving spiritually,
34:09 and we pray Jehovah  will continue to bless your efforts,
34:12 come what may.
34:14 And we thank you,  Gabriel and Adrian,
34:16 for your surprise  to the studio.
34:20 Thank you very much  for taking the time to be interviewed.
34:24 Thank you for the privilege.
34:25 Thank you for the privilege.
34:25 Thank you.
34:26 As we just learned,
34:28 an excellent way of maintaining  the spirituality of the family
34:33 is by spending quality time  together in the ministry.
34:37 We would now like to introduce you  to a family from Russia.
34:42 They traveled far away  to work together
34:45 in unassigned territory  in Siberia.
34:48 Their experience confirms  how spiritual activities
34:52 not only build up our faith  but can also bring our family
34:57 closer to each other.
35:05 We are traveling  to a very interesting territory.
35:08 It is on the shores  of Lake Baikal.
35:12 From where we live,  it is 600 kilometers.
35:16 We have so many memories  to take home.
35:20 The scenery is always stunning  in all types of weather.
35:24 Here there are beautiful cliffs  and valleys.
35:29 We cross  several mountain passes.
35:31 Then we go by ferry.
35:35 It felt very strange  being in the car while crossing the river.
35:39 When we have the opportunity,  we witness
35:43 to people  we meet on the way.
35:44 Why do sincere people  trust the Holy Scriptures?
35:48 Please have a look  at what it says here:
35:51 “All scripture is inspired of God.”
35:56 We usually serve  in isolated territory for a week or more.
36:00 We have come to the same place  where we were last year,
36:04 so we already know  a lot about it.
36:06 Living in a tent
36:08 is very different  from living in the city.
36:11 Here we don’t have
36:13 any conveniences,  like a toilet or a shower.
36:16 The only place to wash  is in Lake Baikal, which is freezing.
36:20 This simple life  is like an adventure.
36:25 As we have quite a big group
36:28 —there are 12 of us —we have also organized
36:32 our spiritual routine.
36:34 We consider  the daily text together and take part
36:37 in discussing our publications  using the questions.
36:41 We have a friendly,  relaxed atmosphere.
36:44 Everybody enjoys it.
36:47 Our isolated territory,  where we are preaching,
36:51 is a rural area.
36:53 Here we don’t have  any prepared maps.
36:55 So when we have our meetings  for field service,
36:58 we divide up,  all taking different streets.
37:03 We also think  about what clothes to wear.
37:06 Experience has shown  that our clothes
37:09 can help us  to win over these people.
37:12 So we try to dress simply.  We don’t wear ties.
37:18 The people there are kind.
37:21 Sometimes they even invite us in.
37:24 We can have discussions  with some of them—sometimes long ones.
37:29 There you meet  more receptive people
37:31 than unresponsive ones,
37:34 and that really is encouraging.
37:36 It makes you just want  to keep on preaching
37:40 without stopping.
37:42 The trips have helped  our son make spiritual progress.
37:45 For us as his parents,  that is the greatest blessing.
37:49 For example,
37:51 after one of these trips,  he became an unbaptized publisher.
37:55 This territory is different
37:58 from what I am used to,  so I was worried.
38:00 I didn’t know  what sort of people lived there
38:03 or what their attitude  was toward Witnesses.
38:06 But after praying when knocking  on the first door, my fear disappeared.
38:11 I was able to place 270 tracts.
38:15 While we were witnessing,
38:18 we showed the people  the addresses in our publications
38:20 so that they could write
38:22 if they found what they had read interesting.
38:26 We usually start witnessing  about 12 noon, and we finish
38:30 around 5:00 p.m.
38:31 Then the relaxation part  of our day begins.
38:39 We have a campfire,
38:41 some games,  some music, and fun.
38:45 Early in the day,  we used our energy in the ministry,
38:49 and afterward we were able  to relax and enjoy each other’s company.
38:53 So we combine  both our ministry and relaxation.
38:57 One of the delights  of these trips is the fish
39:01 —the famous Baikal omul.
39:05 These trips really strengthen  the unity in our family.
39:10 We really have  drawn closer together.
39:14 It is invigorating  and enriches us spiritually.
39:17 We experience  pure joy from knowing
39:20 that Jehovah  has blessed our efforts.
39:23 We feel like we have our batteries  charged for the entire year.
39:34 It is very encouraging to see
39:37 such a spiritually focused family.
39:40 And did you notice  that it was after one such trip
39:43 that their son  became an unbaptized publisher?
39:47 I’m sure that brought  much joy to his parents.
39:51 Are you interested  in a preaching assignment
39:54 in territory seldom worked?
39:56 If so, form a group  of no more than 20 publishers
40:01 and ask the elders  in your congregation for further instructions
40:04 and an Application  for Territory Seldom Worked.
40:08 Once you have filled out the form,  the Congregation Service Committee
40:12 will review it and submit it  to your local branch.
40:17 Theocratic activities,  such as family worship,
40:20 spending time in the ministry together,  along with balanced amounts of recreation,
40:25 can truly fortify our family.
40:29 As we saw in the interview  with the Ortiz family,
40:32 such spiritual preparation  helps us when we face challenges.
40:37 In this dramatization,  a family followed Scriptural counsel
40:42 when they faced the challenge  of having to relocate
40:46 to another city.
40:51 For 23 years,  we’ve called this place home.
40:55 We’ve raised a family here
40:57 —two beautiful girls.
41:01 Six months ago,  my boss called me into his office.
41:06 The company was restructuring.
41:08 They valued my work,  but if I wanted to keep my job,
41:12 I would need to move.
41:13 It was a difficult decision.
41:15 My job allowed me to support my family well, and it had never interfered
41:20 with our spiritual routine.
41:22 We said many prayers about it.
41:24 We discussed it as a family,  and we decided to move.
41:29 But we were anxious.
41:32 My family has only ever known  one home, one congregation.
41:37 My girls have many friends  in the congregation,
41:39 good examples who are helping them  to serve Jehovah.
41:42 This is going  to be hard on all of us.
41:46 A brother in our hall had moved  into the congregation a few years ago.
41:50 I asked him how his family  coped with the challenge.
41:55 He said that the key to staying grounded  is maintaining the one thing
42:00 that should never change  —our spiritual routine.
42:03 But that requires  work and planning
42:06 to make sure our move doesn’t stop us  from getting to the meetings,
42:10 sharing in the ministry,  spending time
42:13 with our brothers and sisters,  and looking after our family.
42:17 His advice was spot-on.
42:19 After some research, I found a scripture  that illustrated our situation.
42:24 “And the rain poured down  and the floods came
42:28 “and the winds blew and lashed  against that house, but it did not cave in,
42:33 for it had been founded on the rock.”
42:37 The discreet man  built his house on good foundations.
42:41 It took a plan,  and he worked hard.
42:44 When the storm came,  his house survived.
42:47 As a family,
42:50 we needed a plan that would help us  stay spiritually grounded through our move.
42:54 So we wrote our own plan.
42:57 Just like the discreet man,
43:00 we wanted to build our move  on a strong spiritual foundation.
43:05 So we made a visit  to our new congregation ahead of our move.
43:09 Over the years,  it becomes a comfort
43:12 to walk into a Kingdom Hall  and see familiar faces.
43:15 Walking into our new congregation  reminded me
43:20 how much we are going  to miss everyone.
43:23 But the Bible tells us  that ‘with the measure we measure out,
43:28 others will measure  to us in return.’
43:31 So we resolved  to show love first.
43:37 Hello, I’m Jessica.
43:38 Hi, I’m Samantha.  Nice to meet you.
43:40 The best way to get to know  our new congregation is to work
43:44 with the brothers  and sisters in the ministry.
43:47 No matter where we go,  we’ll find people
43:50 that love Jehovah  and each other.
43:53 Moving day finally arrived.
43:57 The last boxes were packed.
43:59 We locked the door one final time  and began our journey to our new home.
44:13 It took effort,
44:16 but visiting the congregation  ahead of time
44:20 was well worth it.
44:22 Look!  We already have friends here.
44:25 Unpacking seemed to never end,
44:28 but the one thing  that we all promised ourselves
44:33 at family worship  was that we would not let
44:35 our move affect  our spiritual routine.
44:41 Has anyone seen my ties?
44:46 Found them!
44:48 We planned that we  wouldn’t let anything stop us
44:52 from going to the meetings.
44:54 The ministry is very different.
44:57 We’ve had to adapt  and learn new techniques.
45:02 The brothers and sisters  are different too.
45:04 It’s important not to focus
45:07 on negative comparisons.
45:10 Instead, be positive.
45:15 During this transition,  it is especially important to be sensitive
45:19 to our spiritual needs.
45:21 Family worship is vital.
45:26 Keeping spiritually grounded  through such a big transition isn’t easy,
45:30 especially with a family.
45:33 It took a lot of time  and energy to care for our needs,
45:37 not just spiritually,  but emotionally too.
45:41 Planning ahead,  like the discreet man,
45:44 helped our family  to stay spiritually grounded.
45:50 Having a spiritually strong family
45:54 prepares us also  for other changes in life.
45:57 Perhaps you are in your teens  and you’re starting to notice
46:01 those of the opposite sex.
46:03 Such emotions are natural  and are part of growing up.
46:07 But if you’re not old enough  to get married,
46:10 what do you need  to keep in mind?
46:12 This young sister  made wise decisions
46:16 with the loving help  of her parents.
46:30 Uhh, yours?
46:32 Yeah.  Thanks.
46:34 You’re Lily, right?
46:35 Yeah.  And you’re Sean.
46:37 Yeah.  I’ve seen you around.
46:39 You play good basketball.
46:41 Thanks.  So do you.
46:43 So you want  to hang out sometime?
46:45 Sure.
46:50 My name is Lily,  and I sorta had this problem.
46:57 There’s a boy named Sean  that recently moved to our school.
47:01 I know I’m not supposed  to like anyone who is not a Witness.
47:05 The trouble was,
47:07 he is a Witness.
47:10 Sean and his family  moved into our congregation.
47:13 And the more I saw of him,
47:16 the more I liked him.
47:18 “My strength is exhausted  because of my sighing.
47:21 “If only I knew  where to find God!
47:23 “I would go  to his place of dwelling.
47:25 I would present my . . .”
47:46 Like I said,
47:48 “I had a problem.”
47:55 Every day I see  couples my age at school.
48:00 To me, they look happy.
48:05 Honestly, I wanted  that happiness too.
48:13 My parents noticed my problem too  and talked about it that night.
48:23 And pretty soon  I didn’t feel alone anymore.
48:28 The next day, my mom invited me  to go with her to run an errand.
48:33 Afterward,  we went to a little café.
48:36 She asked me  how things were going.
48:38 At first,  I didn’t want to tell her,
48:42 but she made me  feel really comfortable.
48:45 So I told her  my feelings for Sean,
48:47 expecting her  to think bad of me.
48:50 But she didn’t.
48:52 Everything you’re feeling  is natural, Lily.
48:55 I remember having these same feelings  when I was your age too.
48:59 Really?
49:01 It’s true.
49:02 That’s just how Jehovah  created us, Honey.
49:05 And because he created us,  he knows
49:08 the best way  for us to be happy.
49:11 And that’s all he wants for us.
49:14 And that’s all Daddy  and I want for you too.
49:17 She didn’t scold me;
49:19 she didn’t make me  feel embarrassed.
49:22 And most importantly,
49:24 she didn’t seem to be in a rush.
49:27 My mom wasn’t the only one  helping me.
49:30 My dad was preparing  to help me with my problem too.
49:34 That evening,  we had family worship.
49:37 And once again, they just let me talk.
49:42 They told me I didn’t have  to hold back, so I didn’t.
49:45 I just don’t know what to do.
49:47 Lily, thank you  for telling us how you feel.
49:50 Let me ask you something:  Why do you think Jehovah created us
49:55 with these natural feelings  toward the opposite sex?
49:59 So that one day a man  and woman could marry.
50:02 That’s right!
50:03 In fact, a good marriage  is like two skaters on the ice.
50:08 A beautiful performance
50:10 can seem effortless,  but is it really?
50:13 No.
50:14 No one would even  attempt that without practice,
50:18 a capable partner,  or the right kind of guidance, right?
50:21 Yeah.
50:23 Well, it’s the same  with a good marriage, Sweetie.
50:26 It doesn’t just happen.
50:28 It too depends  on a good partner,
50:32 coordinated effort,  but most importantly,
50:36 wise counsel from Jehovah.
50:39 In fact,
50:41 could you please turn with me
50:43 to Psalm 32:8  and read that for us.
50:48 Sure.
50:50 It says:  “I will give you insight
50:53 “and instruct you  in the way you should go.
50:56 I will give you advice  with my eye upon you.”
50:59 Lily, Jehovah loves us very much.
51:02 And if we listen to him,
51:04 we’ll make good decisions in our life
51:06 with absolutely no regrets.
51:10 We talked some more,  and then I got some homework.
51:14 My dad gave me some articles  he printed out for me to read,
51:18 so I did.
51:21 And as I read the words
51:23 and started meditating on them,
51:25 I realized something.
51:28 By holding off dating a little longer,
51:31 I wasn’t missing out.
51:35 Rather, I was preparing myself.
51:39 I could use the time now
51:42 to focus on something  much more important
51:44 —my relationship with Jehovah.
51:48 I could also gain Christian qualities  and experience that will help me later
51:52 if I ever do get married.
52:01 A strong spiritual upbringing  can truly be a protection for us
52:06 when young  but also strengthens us as adults.
52:13 Brother Erich Frost  was a young man in Germany
52:16 who set a good example  in making wise decisions early in life.
52:21 He was born in 1900,  baptized 23 years later,
52:26 and entered  the full-time ministry in 1928.
52:29 Not long after, he was put in charge  of the underground work
52:33 of the persecuted  Witnesses of Jehovah in Germany,
52:37 caring well for that assignment  for eight months
52:40 until he was incarcerated.
52:43 In this archived audio recording,
52:46 you will hear the fascinating experience  of how Brother Frost
52:50 composed a Kingdom melody  in the middle of Sachsenhausen
52:54 —a Nazi concentration camp.
53:01 I always had the desire  to compose music.
53:08 As everybody knows,  we had the hardest work
53:10 and suffered the hardest  in the concentration camps.
53:14 We were starved,  the labor
53:17 exceeded our strength,  and the harassment was often unbearable.
53:30 So, as usual, I wanted to find  a way to build up the brothers.
53:35 We had such a fine unity  there in the Sachsenhausen camp.
53:41 I felt moved  to compose a song
53:43 that we could sing together  for our mutual encouragement.
53:52 Every morning we marched  to the construction site
53:55 of a sewage plant  in Oranienburg.
54:00 Our labor group  consisted of about 40 brothers
54:04 under the strict watch of the SS.
54:14 While marching,  my mind went back and forth
54:18 and “Bum Bam Badam  Bam Tarambambamba.”
54:24 And gradually,  a melody formed.
54:28 That’s how the music  was developed.
54:31 But how could the verses  enter the camp
54:34 without being able  to write them down?
54:36 I found a few brothers  who helped me.
54:39 I repeated the first verse  to one of them until he knew it by heart,
54:43 either while marching or while driving  the wheelbarrow at work.
54:47 I told the second verse  to another brother,
54:50 still to others the third  and the fourth.
54:54 In the evening, I asked  each of the brothers to recite his verse.
54:59 That’s how the song came to life.
55:02 In the mornings,  when the 40 of us were marching
55:05 through the streets of Oranienburg,  we already felt worn out.
55:10 When one started humming  that melody,
55:13 the entire labor group  trembled with excitement.
55:16 We had to control ourselves  to not break out in loud singing.
55:20 That would have been dangerous,  of course.
55:23 They would have brought us  back to the camp
55:25 and severely punished us.
56:30 As we sat together in the evenings  and someone started humming that melody,
56:35 quite a number of us  sang along, and we rejoiced.
56:40 Our eyes were shining.
56:42 This gave us  new courage and hope.
56:50 We also had evenings of worship.
56:53 Talks were given, and we had copies  of The Watchtower that we studied together.
56:57 So we were able to have  some real times of peace
57:01 and special encouragement  and felt uplifted by that song.
58:01 Brother Frost,  who was one of the anointed,
58:05 finished  his earthly course in 1987.
58:09 After World War II  and nine years of imprisonment,
58:13 he served as the overseer  of our branch office
58:16 in Germany for ten years.
58:18 This was before  the arrangement was instituted
58:20 of having a Branch Committee  oversee the work.
58:25 The very descriptive paintings  that you saw in this segment
58:29 were painted by a brother  who was imprisoned
58:31 in a concentration camp  similar to the one Brother Frost was in.
58:36 And I’m sure  you recognized the song.
58:39 You can find it in our songbook,  though the tune is a little different.
58:43 When Brother Frost found out  that his song had been included in it,
58:47 he was overjoyed  and said, “My clumsy lyrics
58:51 were transformed  into three wonderful verses.”
58:56 If you turn to song 17  in your songbook,
58:59 you’ll find the song  originally composed by Brother Frost
59:03 —“Forward, You Witnesses!”
59:06 Like Brother Frost,  we want to do our best
59:10 to expand our ministry  for Jehovah.
59:12 One way of doing that  is by learning a language.
59:16 In this music video,  pay close attention
59:20 to the blessings that resulted  from this couple’s heartfelt desire
59:24 to serve  in the foreign-language field.
59:50 You may be contemplating, ‘Should I make the move?’
59:58 Prayerfully meditating, ‘Jehovah, what should I do?’
1:00:07 So let’s just take a moment And try to help you decide.
1:00:16 ‘Cause if you step on over, You’ll be so happy you tried!
1:00:23 You gotta step on over And leave your worries behind.
1:00:32 ‘Cause when you step on over, You will be blessed if you try, oh.
1:00:41 Step on over. Step on over that Macedonia line!
1:00:57 The preaching work is amazing, With overwhelming success.
1:01:05 You’ll be appreciating How strangers give you their best.
1:01:14 And you will draw even closer To Jehovah each day.
1:01:22 ‘Cause he will always be there To help you learn every step of the way.
1:01:31 You gotta step on over And leave your worries behind.
1:01:39 ‘Cause when you step on over, Oh, the treasures you’ll find.
1:01:46 Maybe you’re thinking it over And wondering if it’s right, oh.
1:01:56 You gotta step on over. You will be blessed if you try, oh.
1:02:05 Step on over. Step on over.
1:02:13 You gotta step on over that Macedonia line!
1:02:25 Did you notice  some of the blessings
1:02:28 this couple enjoyed as the result  of learning a new language?
1:02:33 Not only were they able  to expand their ministry
1:02:35 and show their love for neighbor  but they also spent a lot of time together
1:02:40 as a couple, reaching the goal  of learning a language as a family.
1:02:45 By working hard to build up  and protect our family spiritually,
1:02:50 we can all take part  in glorifying Jehovah
1:02:53 —the One “to whom every family  . . . owes its name.”
1:02:57 You’ll also enjoy a Bethel morning worship  that is now available
1:03:01 on Video on Demand.
1:03:03 It ties very well into the theme  of this month’s program.
1:03:07 The video is entitled
1:03:09 ‘Practice Godly Devotion in Our Own Household’
1:03:13 and is presented  by Brother David Schafer,
1:03:15 a helper  to the Teaching Committee.
1:03:19 But we have more  in store for you.
1:03:22 We’re also pleased to announce  the release of a new brochure
1:03:27 entitled  Answers to 10 Questions Young People Ask.
1:03:31 The content of this 32-page,  full-color brochure
1:03:36 is based on articles  in Awake! and the two volumes
1:03:40 of Questions Young People Ask —Answers That Work, as well as
1:03:45 the “Young People Ask” articles  on the jw.org website.
1:03:49 This new brochure  will be particularly helpful
1:03:53 to those who speak a language  in which that material is not available.
1:03:58 However, all young people  can benefit from this new brochure
1:04:02 because the original articles  have been updated and rewritten.
1:04:07 Each section of the brochure  addresses one question.
1:04:12 After stating the question,  the section begins with a pointed statement
1:04:16 under the feature  “Why It Matters,”
1:04:19 letting the reader know  why that question is relevant.
1:04:23 Then, a “What Would You Do?”  scenario is presented,
1:04:28 putting the reader  in a hypothetical situation
1:04:31 related to the topic.
1:04:33 After discussing various principles,
1:04:36 Scriptural advice  directs the reader to the best answers
1:04:40 for that particular question.
1:04:42 The 10 Questions brochure  is interactive,
1:04:45 allowing the reader  to write responses
1:04:48 to the various questions presented.
1:04:50 The final topic,  “How Can the Bible Help Me?,”
1:04:55 is designed to invite readers  who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses
1:04:59 to accept a Bible study.
1:05:01 The brochure  makes numerous references
1:05:04 to the jw.org website
1:05:06 and directs readers to more information  that can be found there.
1:05:11 Also, the brochure  is designed in such a way
1:05:14 that young people can be comfortable  sharing it with their peers
1:05:19 and with others in the ministry.
1:05:21 This brochure  is already approved for translation
1:05:26 into 324 languages.
1:05:30 Of these languages,
223 do not produce Awake!
1:05:35 and 262 have not produced
1:05:38 the Young People Ask books.
1:05:40 So we expect that Answers  to 10 Questions Young People Ask
1:05:44 will help  many more youths benefit
1:05:47 from the Bible’s practical wisdom.
1:05:50 Following this program,  digital formats of the brochure
1:05:54 will become available  on the jw.org website,
1:05:57 the JW Library app,  and on Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY
1:06:02 as they are produced  in each language.
1:06:05 Additionally, printed copies  of the brochure can be requested
1:06:10 through your congregation  at the conclusion of this program.
1:06:14 Before we finish,  we’d like to share
1:06:17 this postcard from the city  of L’viv, in Ukraine.
1:06:22 The city has approximately
800,000 inhabitants and is surrounded
1:06:27 by beautiful forests.
1:06:29 But L’viv is also the home of 5,000  of our dear brothers and sisters.
1:06:34 One of the 49 congregations
1:06:36 in L’viv  is the Topolna Tsentralnyi Congregation.
1:06:40 This congregation  has 107 publishers,
1:06:44 including 42 regular pioneers.
1:06:47 Last year, during the month of August,
70 percent of them took part
1:06:52 in some form of pioneer service,  despite the fact that this congregation
1:06:55 has [one of] the smallest  territories in the city.
1:07:00 Public witnessing using carts  has proven very effective,
1:07:03 and the publishers also cover
1:07:05 remote territories  in small villages outside the city.
1:07:10 The publishers  of the Topolna Tsentralnyi Congregation
1:07:14 send their warm Christian love
1:07:16 to all of us worldwide.
1:07:20 This is JW Broadcasting
1:07:22 from Brooklyn, New York.

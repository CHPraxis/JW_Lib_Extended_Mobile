00:01 Welcome to our program!
00:03 Here are just a few of the things we can look forward to:
00:07 Can the lure of fame  draw us away from Jehovah?
00:11 How does this brother feel about the decisions
00:14 he made as a young person?
00:16 What does his story teach us
00:19 about how to use our God-given abilities and talents?
00:22 Throughout the organization, young brothers and sisters are reaching out
00:27 to do more in Jehovah’s service.
00:29 Their spirituality and youthful energy
00:33 are helping to advance  the Kingdom work.
00:35 But how is showing respect for experienced brothers
00:38 an important part of any theocratic assignment?
00:42 We’ll also hear from young brothers and sisters
00:45 from around the world.
00:47 Why is their relationship with Jehovah so important to them?
00:52 What do they do to build and maintain their spirituality?
00:57 And we’ll consider even more ways Christian youths
01:00 are setting a beautiful example for our worldwide brotherhood.
01:05 This is JW Broadcasting for December 2016!
01:30 During the past five years,
01:32 over 1.3 million faithful ones
01:35 have symbolized their dedication
01:37 to Jehovah by water baptism.
01:40 That’s an average  of over 700 each day.
01:44 And among those courageously taking their stand
01:47 for true worship are thousands of children,
01:50 teenagers, and young adults.
01:53 Young brothers and sisters,
01:55 we know it is not always easy
01:58 to serve Jehovah and live up to your dedication.
02:01 Like older ones,
02:02 you need to be encouraged and strengthened spiritually.
02:07 With that in mind, our theme this month is
02:10 “Young Ones, ‘Become an Example to the Faithful Ones.’”
02:15 It is based on the inspiring true-life story
02:18 of a young Christian named Timothy.
02:21 Before we discuss Timothy’s example,
02:24 did you know that the Bible specifically foretold
02:28 that many young people would take  sides with Jehovah in our time?
02:33 Let’s look at this at Psalm 110:3.
02:36 And as we read it together,
02:38 note how young ones are having a share  in fulfilling this prophecy.
02:43 Notice the first part of verse 3,
02:47 David sang:
02:49 “Your people will offer themselves willingly
02:52 on the day of your military force.”
02:55 According to this prophecy, Jesus, the Messianic King,
02:59 would have a large army of willing supporters.
03:03 Since 1914, millions have carefully investigated the facts
03:07 and chosen to side  with Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.
03:12 But where do young ones come into this picture?
03:15 The rest of the verse continues:
03:17 “In splendid holiness,  from the womb of the dawn,
03:22 “you have your company of young men
03:25 just like dewdrops.”
03:28 Here, the prophecy refers to a “company,” or group, of young ones.
03:33 They also would study the evidence and support God’s Kingdom.
03:38 How many young people did Jehovah foresee
03:41 supporting true worship?
03:43 We get an idea by the comparison  made to dewdrops.
03:47 Have you have ever gone outside early in the morning
03:50 and noticed a light, sparkling coating of water on the ground?
03:55 That may have been dew.
03:57 Jehovah designed our atmosphere so that, under certain conditions,
04:01 when the temperature cools during the night,
04:04 a blanket of moisture forms on the ground.
04:07 That coating is made up of a multitude of little drops.
04:12 Young ones, what does dew have to do with you?
04:17 In the Bible, dew is connected with blessing and abundance.
04:21 Dewdrops are also refreshing,
04:24 life-sustaining, and numerous.
04:27 Now, remember in Psalm 110:3,
04:30 Jehovah was looking ahead to our time.
04:33 And what did he see?
04:36 The September 15, 2002, Watchtower on page 8
04:40 explained it this way:
04:42 “Just like refreshing dewdrops,
04:45 “many young men and women cheerfully serve God
04:49 and assist their fellow worshipers.”
04:51 Today, there are so many mature,
04:56 bright, happy young ones in the Christian congregation
04:59 that they are like countless dewdrops that sparkle in the morning sun.
05:04 You faithful children, teenagers,
05:07 and young adults who have dedicated your life to Jehovah
05:11 or who are working toward that goal
05:14 are living proof that Jehovah’s confidence
05:16 in young people was never misplaced.
05:19 He cherishes you very much and so do we.
05:25 Of course, knowing that Jehovah has confidence in us
05:29 can be very encouraging.
05:31 But what if doubts or negative thoughts
05:35 tend to bring us down?
05:37 On occasion, a young Witness might wonder,
05:40 ‘Does anyone other than Jehovah notice me?
05:44 Does my example really matter to others?’
05:49 To address these questions,
05:51 let’s now consider Timothy’s example.
05:55 Open your Bible, please,
05:57 to our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12.
06:02 When you find it,  you might want to bookmark the verse
06:05 because we want to first understand the setting.
06:09 How old was Timothy at this time?
06:13 Often, when thinking of Timothy,
06:15 I picture a teenager or a young man in his early twenties.
06:19 And when he first started traveling with Paul,
06:21 he was about that age.
06:23 But several years passed  before Paul wrote letters to Timothy.
06:28 So by the time First Timothy was written,
06:31 Timothy was likely in his early thirties.
06:34 Now, what do you think?
06:37 Was Timothy young or old?
06:42 Some of you younger ones may be thinking to yourselves,
06:45 ‘If he was over 30, then he was old!’
06:48 But remember, a much older man like Paul
06:51 would say that Timothy was quite young.
06:54 In fact, notice the expression he uses when writing to Timothy.
06:58 First Timothy 4:12, Paul says:
07:02 “Never let anyone look down on your youth.
07:07 “Instead, become an example  to the faithful ones
07:12 “in speaking, in conduct, in love,
07:15 in faith, in chasteness.”
07:19 Paul called Timothy a youth and urged him to be a good example.
07:24 While Timothy may have been in his early thirties at this time,
07:28 remember that he  was taught about Jehovah
07:31 from the time he was a baby,
07:33 and he did well in the truth as a young person.
07:37 In fact, when he was still a teenager or in his early twenties,
07:40 the elders recommended him to serve as a missionary with Paul.
07:44 So, in effect,  Paul here is urging Timothy
07:48 to continue to be  a good example for others.
07:53 What else do we know about Timothy?
07:57 He was not proud, or haughty.
08:00 He likely did not view himself as some amazing example.
08:05 I’m sure he never dreamed that one day Christians all over the world
08:10 would study his life in detail so as to imitate his faith.
08:15 Timothy was modest —and this despite his privileges.
08:20 Paul’s words may indicate that Timothy was somewhat shy.
08:24 Like many of us,
08:26 he may have battled with feelings of self-doubt on occasion.
08:30 Based on this information, let’s do something interesting now.
08:34 Let’s use our imagination to visualize Timothy,
08:39 an elder in his early thirties,
08:41 coming to give a Scriptural talk in the congregation.
08:44 Got the picture?
08:46 In your mind, please look at Timothy
08:49 and then look at the audience.
08:51 Who do we see?
08:54 Many in attendance are old enough
08:56 to be Timothy’s parents or grandparents.
09:00 How do you think Timothy felt?
09:02 Super confident?
09:04 Are you visualizing him proudly walking into the meeting place, saying:
09:09 “I sure wish my friends back in Lystra could see me now.
09:13 Look at the crowds that come to hear me speak!”
09:17 No, that’s not the Timothy we know.
09:22 It’s much more likely that Timothy,  like most of us,
09:25 rehearsed his presentation over and over again.
09:29 He probably prayed constantly,
09:32 and he probably still got nervous, like all of us.
09:36 And remember, Timothy did not have the benefit
09:39 of theocratic schools like we do today.
09:42 In summary,
09:44 what can we say about Timothy?
09:47 Like so many of you,
09:50 he was an example of faith and obedience.
09:54 He was exceptional in displaying Christian qualities,
09:57 such as modesty and humility.
10:00 But Timothy was a person with normal human feelings,
10:04 like all of us.
10:06 Though he had a rich, happy life in Jehovah’s service,
10:09 life in the old world brought real tests and challenges.
10:13 Timothy also dealt  with frequent cases of sickness,
10:16 and he was imprisoned for a time.
10:19 Some of you in various countries
10:22 can relate to those bitter experiences.
10:25 But Timothy endured.
10:28 Was he some “super Christian” with superpowers?
10:33 No, but he did prove to be a super example!
10:38 How does all of this help you Christian youths
10:41 who have taken the commendable step
10:44 to dedicate your lives to Jehovah?
10:47 We just read how Paul told Timothy to let no one look down on his youth.
10:52 A few of you may be thinking,
10:55 ‘I wish someone would tell my parents
10:58 ‘or my elders not to look down on me.
11:02 They still treat me like a little kid.’
11:05 If that’s the case,  we feel for you.
11:08 No progressive young one wants to be treated as if he were a child.
11:14 But let’s look again at 1 Timothy 4:12.
11:18 Is the apostle Paul speaking to the congregation,
11:22 to parents, or to the elders?
11:25 “Never let anyone look down
11:28 “on your youth.
11:31 “Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking,
11:35 in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.”
11:40 It’s clear, isn’t it?
11:42 Paul said your youth.
11:45 He was speaking only to Timothy.
11:49 Young ones, by extension, what is Jehovah saying to each of you?
11:54 It’s this: To gain and maintain the respect of faithful ones,
11:59 you have to work at proving yourself as a Christian.
12:04 The key is not wanting or hoping that others will respect you.
12:08 Rather, it’s earning such respect by setting a good example
12:12 in all areas of life.
12:14 If you do that,
12:15 then no one will have any legitimate reason to look down on your youth.
12:20 Doesn’t it make sense that we gain respect by earning it?
12:26 We are confident that you young ones are trying hard
12:29 to live by Christian principles at school and in the neighborhood.
12:33 But in verse 12, did you notice who Timothy was to be an example to?
12:39 To “the faithful ones.”
12:41 Are you an example to Christians, both younger and older,
12:45 in your congregation  and in your circuit?
12:48 If you work on Kingdom Hall construction projects or at Bethel,
12:52 are you an example to your fellow workers?
12:56 Well, what are some specific ways you can become an example
13:01 to all of these “faithful ones”?
13:03 In our theme text,  Timothy was first directed
13:07 to become an example in speaking.
13:10 On this topic, I’ll never forget an illustration
13:13 used in the “Young People Ask” article from the January 2012 Awake!
13:18 It quoted a young man, James, who said:
13:22 “Once you squeeze toothpaste out, you can’t put it back in the tube.
13:27 “The same is true with our words.
13:29 Once we say something hurtful,  we can’t take it back.”
13:34 God’s Word agrees with James.
13:37 Note what it says at Ephesians 4:29.
13:42 It tells us:
13:44 “Let a rotten word not come out of your mouth,
13:48 “but only what is good for building up as the need may be,
13:52 to impart what is beneficial to the hearers.”
13:56 For some years now, those getting baptized
13:59 have been encouraged  to complete a study of the book,
14:01 “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.”
14:04 Chapter 12 is entitled “Speak What ‘Is Good for Building Up.’”
14:09 On page 140,  there is a box with five questions
14:13 that can help us evaluate our speech.
14:16 For example:
14:18 “When was the last time I offered someone specific commendation?
14:22 “Do I express my respect for others by saying please and thank you?
14:27 “In conversation, do I speak mainly about myself,
14:31 or am I also interested in the thoughts and feelings of others?”
14:36 Young ones,  over the next few days,
14:39 why not review that box on page 140,  look up the scriptures,
14:43 and think about what Jehovah is saying?
14:47 Then apply what you learn to your speech.
14:50 Doing this will draw you closer to Jehovah
14:54 and help you to become an even better example
14:57 to the faithful ones.
15:00 The second area mentioned in our theme text
15:03 is becoming an example in conduct.
15:06 Of course, upbuilding speech would be empty
15:10 or hypocritical if our conduct was questionable.
15:14 Think again about Timothy.
15:16 It wasn’t enough for him to give comments and talks at the meetings
15:20 or preach from door to door.
15:23 Later in the same letter, Paul reminded Timothy
15:26 that he needed to treat older men and women as fathers and mothers;
15:29 younger men and women were to be treated as brothers and sisters.
15:35 Second Peter 3:11
15:38 provides a similar urgent reminder about our conduct.
15:42 Let’s read that together.
15:44 Again, that’s 2 Peter 3:11.
15:48 There it tells us:
15:50 “Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,
15:54 “consider what sort of people you ought to be
15:57 in holy acts of conduct.”
16:01 Let’s think about that.
16:03 For a person’s conduct to be holy from Jehovah’s perspective,
16:08 he or she must be morally clean.
16:10 While physical cleanness is on the outside,
16:13 moral cleanness is on the inside —in our thoughts and desires.
16:19 Is being morally clean really important?
16:22 Think about it this way.
16:24 When eating a meal,  would you be content to eat from a bowl
16:28 that had been washed only on the outside?
16:31 Of course not!
16:32 We want to eat from clean dishes
16:35 —dishes that are thoroughly clean inside and out.
16:38 So when we wash dishes, we wash the outside and the inside.
16:43 Similarly,  Jehovah expects his servants
16:46 to be clean through and through.
16:49 And because Jehovah —the perfect reader of hearts—
16:53 will soon dissolve, yes, eliminate this dirty system of things,
16:57 it’s urgent that we do so.
17:01 This means that we have to work very hard
17:03 so that nothing unclean enters our mind.
17:07 That means firmly rejecting
17:09 so-called fun and exciting entertainment,
17:12 which features sex, violence, or spiritism.
17:16 At 1 Corinthians 14:20,  the Bible tells us
17:20 that we should become like “young children as to badness.”
17:25 No matter our age,
17:27 we don’t need and we don’t want
17:30 any experience  with the wickedness of this world.
17:33 Rather,  we keep the inside of the dish,
17:37 our mind and heart, clean at all times.
17:40 And when we do so, our exemplary conduct
17:44 pleases Jehovah and it strengthens our faithful brothers and sisters.
17:48 Really, it’s the only way to respect ourselves
17:51 and to gain the respect of others.
17:54 Our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12
17:58 goes on to mention other areas
18:00 where we can make steady progress in becoming an example,
18:04 such as in love, in faith, and in chasteness.
18:08 During your personal study,
18:10 that is, your personal time with your best Friend, Jehovah,
18:14 why not examine these areas in more detail?
18:17 The treasures you gain from such a study project
18:20 can last a lifetime —an everlasting lifetime.
18:26 So, what have we learned?
18:28 In fulfillment of Bible prophecy,
18:30 a large company of young people  from around the world
18:34 are taking a stand with Jehovah and Jesus.
18:38 That includes all of you.
18:41 Like dewdrops, you’re not only abundant in number
18:45 but you sparkle in our congregations.
18:48 Your presence is very refreshing.
18:51 So please, don’t look down on your youth.
18:56 Rather, rejoice in your youth!
18:58 Yes, “become an example  to the faithful ones”!
19:04 In the following dramatization,
19:06 a young brother is doing just what we’ve discussed.
19:09 He’s becoming an example to faithful ones
19:11 and working hard at the assignments he is given.
19:15 But there’s something he lacks
19:18 —a quality that would make him
19:20 even more valuable to Jehovah
19:22 and to the congregation.
19:46 Before the meeting starts,  I need to get things ready.
19:53 I’m Ben.
19:55 And as a ministerial servant,
19:58 I can do a lot  to help the congregation.
20:06 And that night  I was given another assignment.
20:11 Brother Richards asked if I could help him  update the territory maps
20:15 and organize our schedules  for public witnessing.
20:20 I think the brothers know  I can modernize all of this.
20:25 Brother Richards said to talk  to Brother Bello, first.
20:29 He was the service overseer for years.
20:34 Great idea!
20:35 But I can already imagine  the possibilities.
20:42 By that weekend,  I had almost finished.
20:50 I couldn’t believe the outdated ways our records were kept.
20:56 This is going to be way better  for the congregation.
21:00 And who knows  what else could be improved?
21:09 I thought I had everything ready  to show Brother Richards.
21:13 He liked the new ideas,  but then he asked me,
21:17 “What did Brother Bello think?”
21:22 Oh, Brother Bello!  I forgot.
21:25 I should have asked him,
21:27 but at this point,  did it really matter?
21:33 Brother Richards suggested  we read about Elisha.
21:37 When the older Elijah’s work was ending,
21:40 Elisha stuck close to his teacher.
21:43 Urged to stay behind,  Elisha repeatedly said:
21:47 “As surely as Jehovah is living  and as you are living,
21:52 I will not leave you.”
21:58 Until the moment Elijah left,
22:01 Elisha wanted to learn from him.
22:15 Like a son asking his father,
22:18 he wanted a double portion  of Elijah’s spirit
22:21 to continue the work he started.
22:26 And Elisha’s first miracle
22:29 was the same as Elijah’s last:
22:34 dividing the Jordan  with Elijah’s official garment.
22:39 Everything Elisha did  revealed his respect
22:43 for the experienced man Elijah.
22:48 I wasn’t finished  with my new assignment after all.
22:54 There was a lot I needed to learn  from Brother Bello.
22:59 He really understood our preaching territory
23:01 and the people who live here.
23:06 He liked my ideas,
23:08 but everything he showed me  made them even better.
23:28 I can do a lot  to help the congregation.
23:34 And I pray that Jehovah  lets me do even more
23:37 with the gifts he gave me
23:40 and with the wisdom  of experienced men.
23:54 Ben had good ideas to improve the work he’d been assigned,
23:58 but he also learned to respect the experience of older brothers.
24:03 You too may have ideas to benefit your assignment,
24:06 whether in the congregation, at Bethel, or on a construction project.
24:11 Like Ben, seek the wisdom of experienced brothers and sisters
24:16 who did the assignment before you.
24:18 Find out why they did things a certain way.
24:21 What were the challenges they faced?
24:24 What direction and resources influenced their efforts?
24:28 How can their experience help you succeed?
24:31 You’ll see the wisdom in what may at first
24:34 look like outdated methods.
24:37 Speak respectfully of their past work,
24:40 and you’ll reflect how Jehovah treasures what they did for Him.
24:45 Jehovah will, in turn, bless the work of your hands.
24:49 What else will bring Jehovah’s blessing?
24:53 He draws close to spiritually-minded people.
24:57 Young Christians all over the world are experiencing
25:01 the benefits of maintaining a close relationship with God.
25:05 Each of you faces a unique set of circumstances
25:09 that make it difficult  to be a spiritually-minded youth.
25:12 So we interviewed young Witnesses from different lands
25:16 to find out what they do to keep growing spiritually.
25:21 Our relationship with Jehovah  can start when we’re young.
25:25 For me, it was the example  that others set
25:27 of putting Jehovah first
25:30 and the happiness  that came as a result,
25:32 as well as being  in that sort of environment
25:35 that really helped me to want to reach out
25:38 as well as be available  for those opportunities.
25:42 And once we do give our life to Jehovah,
25:44 it’s amazing to see the blessings  that he has in store for us.
25:47 But in order to build that relationship,
25:50 we need to read God’s Word;
25:52 we also need to pray to him.
25:53 The more you get to know him,
25:55 the more appealing things  you learn about him.
25:58 That makes you not want to lose him as your friend.
26:01 I always knew it was the truth
26:03 and that I wanted  to serve Jehovah forever.
26:06 But I needed to reassure myself  of certain aspects,
26:10 so I did some research projects  with my parents,
26:13 using the Creator book and some items  from the Bible Teach book.
26:16 After that,  it only became more obvious.
26:19 And I was certain that I wanted it
26:21 and that I was ready to get baptized.
26:24 To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,
26:26 I read the Bible daily and I pray.
26:29 Especially when  there is no one around or it’s quiet,
26:33 I talk to Jehovah  with all my heart at that time.
26:35 Making myself available  for spiritual opportunities
26:39 was a little bit difficult for me at first,  but I didn’t give up.
26:43 After my baptism,  I became a ministerial servant,
26:46 and I also served  almost two years in Bethel.
26:49 And now I’m a regular pioneer
26:51 in Hpado  in a Karen-speaking congregation.
26:56 I didn’t know or speak  the Karen S’gaw language,
26:59 so the local brothers helped me  to learn not only how to speak
27:02 but also how to read.
27:07 Prayers  are important to strengthen
27:09 my relationship with Jehovah.
27:11 For me, it’s like talking
27:13 to a friend,  and that’s always helpful.
27:16 He’s someone real to me,
27:18 and I fully trust  that he listens to me.
27:21 I support the elders by helping  with the cleaning of the hall,
27:24 serving as an attendant,  handling microphones,
27:28 as well as helping  the congregation spiritually.
27:32 When I share Jehovah’s promises of eternal life with others,
27:35 I too am encouraged.
27:38 I’m constantly remembering  what Jehovah promises,
27:41 and that motivates me  to keep preaching.
27:44 There’s a family  in our congregation
27:47 who took me into their home
27:48 and served  as my spiritual parents.
27:57 Through our family worship,
27:59 they helped me  to progress spiritually.
28:07 The elderly ones in our congregation  have been helping me a lot.
28:11 First, they’re good examples.
28:14 They also remind me  to keep my eye simple.
28:17 Despite their limited circumstances  because of age,
28:20 they are determined  to serve Jehovah God.
28:24 And that made me  reflect on my situation.
28:26 I’m very young.
28:28 What prevents me from doing  the things that they do?
28:32 Before I began pioneering,
28:34 I used to sell fish seven days a week,
28:36 but now I sell fish four days a week,
28:38 so three days are available for pioneering.
28:43 To be able to be available  for spiritual opportunities,
28:46 I closely associate  with my congregation.
28:51 I offer some older ones  a ride to the meetings
28:54 or in the preaching work.
28:58 The reason I’m doing this  is because I want to give
29:01 my youth and energy to Jehovah God.
29:06 When I was at school,  I would conduct Bible studies
29:09 with some of my classmates.
29:11 In time, they joined me  in serving Jehovah.
29:16 When I think about being with them  in the future Paradise,
29:19 it gives me deep joy.
29:22 I have the privilege of studying with a deaf girl
29:25 who lives two hours from where I live.
29:27 We have to walk all the way.
29:29 She is very happy  with what she’s learning,
29:32 and her family is very supportive.
29:34 So knowing that Jehovah is helping her
29:36 and I have a part in it,  it’s just priceless.
29:41 Auxiliary pioneering  definitely helped me
29:42 because it was like a stepping stone  to regular pioneering.
29:45 The ministry definitely gives you  the opportunity
29:49 to be able  to work closely with Jehovah.
29:52 And then it—  By doing that, you’re reaffirming
29:54 your faith in what  you already believe in,
29:56 and then you’re drawing closer  to Jehovah in friendship.
29:59 Having jw.org and the broadcast
30:03 has definitely drawn me  closer to our brothers
30:06 and sisters but also to Jehovah as well.
30:08 Just by nature,  I feel like I’m more of a timid person,
30:12 so going door to door  can be a little scary.
30:14 But seeing other young ones  in different parts of the world
30:17 that are enduring  very difficult circumstances
30:20 and living conditions
30:21 and yet are still giving  their best to Jehovah
30:23 is so encouraging for me.
30:25 And it helps me to keep going on  and give Jehovah my best as well.
30:30 When I think personally  about all the avenues of service
30:34 that we can have a hand in today,
30:37 there are so many that are exciting
30:41 —whether it be pioneering  in a foreign country,
30:44 serving where the need is great,
30:47 even serving at Bethel.
30:49 Unless we “taste and see  that Jehovah is good,”
30:52 unless we put ourself out there
30:54 and are available  to try that at least once,
30:57 we’ll never know  what it would be like
31:00 to really serve Jehovah.
31:01 And in doing that,  you will see how Jehovah
31:04 does want the best life for us.
31:13 Those young ones and others like them
31:15 are developing the same spiritual qualities
31:18 that Paul saw in Timothy.
31:21 Read along with me and see how Paul described Timothy
31:25 at Philippians chapter 2 starting at verse 20:
31:28 “For I have no one else of a disposition like his
31:33 “who will genuinely care for your concerns.
31:36 “For all the others are seeking their own interests,
31:39 “not those of Jesus Christ.
31:41 “But you know the proof he gave of himself,
31:44 “that like a child with a father
31:46 he slaved with me to advance the good news.”
31:49 What is it that Paul  saw in Timothy?
31:53 He saw his spiritual disposition, or attitude.
31:57 He observed his genuine interest in his brothers and sisters.
32:01 Timothy really desired to do God’s will
32:05 even though others were seeking their personal interests.
32:09 And Timothy earned his fellow worshippers’ respect
32:12 by working with older and more experienced Christians,
32:14 like Paul, in the ministry.
32:16 When you spiritually-minded young ones
32:20 cultivate that beautiful Timothy-like disposition,
32:24 you make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
32:27 Of course, putting Kingdom interests first
32:30 and the needs of others  ahead of our own is not always easy.
32:35 We know there are real temptations
32:38 that can lead a young person away from Jehovah.
32:41 When others outside the congregation
32:43 recognize our abilities and talents,
32:46 we could begin to seek “great things” for ourselves,
32:49 perhaps fame and recognition.
32:52 In this interview,  Brother Edgardo Franco
32:55 relates how this desire  caused him
32:58 to turn his back on Jehovah.
33:01 So, if the Devil tempted Jesus,
33:06 don’t you think  he will try to tempt us
33:08 in order to jeopardize  our relationship with God?
33:13 This is the best contract  we’ve ever offered you.
33:15 Listen, I’ll get you a plan
33:17 so you can attend  your religious meetings during the week.
33:19 Just do the concert  for us on the weekend!
33:25 People always ask me,
33:27 “Why did you leave  the music world?”
33:31 When I was still a boy,
33:33 I had dreams  about becoming a famous singer.
33:38 Then I learned the truth,
33:40 but I never fully removed  those dreams from my heart.
33:44 And then I started listening  to some bad influences from my past,
33:48 and they got me hooked.
33:51 Then they reeled me  into the recording studio.
33:56 The lyrics in the songs
33:58 —they really bothered  my conscience.
34:02 So they offered me  some liquor to loosen me up,
34:05 and then I started  to feel more comfortable.
34:08 I started singing,  and they liked what they were hearing.
34:12 And those songs ended up  all over the radio stations.
34:15 It was as if Satan  gave me a trophy
34:18 for abandoning Jehovah.
34:21 I became addicted to the applause.
34:27 Everything looks so beautiful,
34:29 but when you’re on top
34:31 —when you’re really at the top  of Satan’s world—
34:34 there’s nothing beautiful there.
34:36 I was an actor,
34:37 and when the cameras  turned on,
34:39 my face and my smile  turned on too.
34:42 But when I would get back to the hotel,
34:44 it was a huge letdown.
34:46 There was no applause
34:48 —just that silence  that tormented my conscience.
34:55 So basically, you had to find
34:58 other distractions, and one of those for me
35:00 was the slot machine.
35:03 And, of course, casinos  don’t just come with slot machines.
35:06 They also expose you  to prostitution and alcohol.
35:10 My conscience would ask,
35:13 ‘What are you doing here?’
35:15 I remember those times on tour,
35:18 from my limousine,  I’d see the brothers preaching,
35:21 and that would always touch my heart.
35:23 I would say to myself, ‘Wow!
35:26 ‘Jehovah trained you  to be doing that,
35:28 and look at what you’re doing!’
35:30 That really cut deep into my heart.
35:32 The road back to the truth was,  really, very hard.
35:37 Every time I was going to retire,  I’d say, “This is it!”
35:41 But then there would always be  a bigger contract.
35:45 I had to make drastic decisions.
35:47 But finally I said:
35:49 “I don’t care what they offer me.
35:52 “I have to return to Jehovah.
35:54 “I have to fulfill the vow
35:56 “I made to him  when I was a young man,
35:58 when I dedicated my life to him.”
36:01 So I prayed to Jehovah  very earnestly and said:
36:04 “Jehovah,  I need to return to you.
36:07 “I need to return  to your loving arms.
36:09 “Satan has ripped me  away from you.
36:12 Please help me.”
36:16 I remember that before I went  in to that first meeting,
36:20 I told Jehovah, “Please give me a sign  that you will take me back.”
36:23 And there was  an elderly sister there.
36:26 She gave me a great big hug
36:29 and said, “Welcome back, son!”
36:32 And she took my hand
36:34 and sat by me  during the entire meeting.
36:37 I had betrayed Jehovah,  but I thank—
36:43 I thank the brothers
36:46 because Jehovah  put brothers at every turn.
36:50 They showed me with the Bible
36:52 how far I had strayed
36:54 from the paths of the true God,
36:57 and everything you do  has consequences.
37:00 I have asked Jehovah many times  to forgive me for all the things
37:04 I have done —and the brothers too—
37:06 all the people  I offended by my actions.
37:09 All those trophies I won
37:11 —every last one of them—
37:13 are there collecting dust.
37:15 But Jehovah has given me
37:18 a different kind of trophy  in his organization
37:20 —helping others to dedicate  their lives to him.
37:24 That’s something no one  can take away from you.
37:28 We don’t all  have to learn the hard way.
37:30 We have to keep enduring
37:32 and never turn  our backs on Jehovah.
37:35 That’s the worst mistake  anyone could make.
37:39 We know that it’s Jehovah  who gives us our talents,
37:42 so we should use them  all in his service.
37:46 I have found happiness,  and that gives me
37:50 a glow that’s not just  for the cameras.
37:52 Everyone who knows me  can see it.
38:02 Brother Franco enjoys serving
38:04 as both a regular pioneer and congregation elder.
38:08 He feels privileged to shepherd young people
38:10 facing some of the same temptations he experienced.
38:14 He often relates a favorite scripture from Proverbs 8:35.
38:19 Referring to wisdom, that scripture says:
38:21 “For the one finding me will find life,
38:25 and he receives approval from Jehovah.”
38:28 Brothers and sisters,
38:30 Jehovah does want us to find life,
38:33 and he wants us to be successful in our spiritual pursuits.
38:37 In this Bethel morning worship,
38:39 Brother Robert Luccioni discusses how we can reach
38:42 the potential that Jehovah knows we have.
38:46 Our text today is very encouraging  as it reminds us,
38:49 through this example of Amos,
38:51 that Jehovah notices the potential
38:54 of each one of his servants.
38:56 In fact, one of the comments  from today’s text states:
38:59 “Even though we may  lack self-confidence,
39:02 “Jehovah can help us  go beyond our perceived limits
39:06 and reach goals that we  would not have imagined.”
39:09 See, Jehovah knows our potential.
39:12 But you note from that statement,
39:14 this is also a reminder  that we have to put forth effort
39:18 to reach our potential.
39:20 You see, if we’re not careful,  we can sabotage our own efforts
39:24 to reach the potential  that Jehovah sees in us.
39:27 How’s that possible?  Well, let’s look at three examples.
39:31 Number one:  We can limit potential
39:34 by not throwing ourselves  into what we are asked to do.
39:38 Now, we may remember  the account of Jehoash
39:40 the king of Israel  there in 2 Kings chapter 13,
39:44 when he visited  the prophet Elisha who was dying.
39:47 And you notice there  at 2 Kings 13:17
39:52 that Elisha  notes Jehoash’s potential.
39:56 You notice he says there  that: “You will
39:58 strike down Syria . . .  until you finish it off.”
40:02 See, he noted the potential
40:04 that he had to finish off Syria.
40:06 But then what happens?
40:08 Well, you remember that’s where  Elisha tells the king
40:12 to beat the arrows  on the ground three times or—
40:15 beat it on the ground,  and he only does it three times.
40:17 Notice what happens in verse 19:
40:20 “At that the man of the true God
40:22 “grew indignant at him and said:
40:24 “‘You should have struck the ground  five or six times!
40:28 “‘Then you  would have struck down Syria
40:30 “‘until you finished it off,
40:32 “‘but now  you will strike down Syria
40:35 only three times.’”
40:37 What happened?
40:38 Well, you see, by not throwing himself  into what he was asked to do
40:42 —showing zeal for his assignment—
40:44 he would only  have limited success.
40:46 Jehoash limited his own potential.
40:50 Number two:  We can limit our potential
40:52 by focusing on our inadequacies  or our insecurities.
40:57 The account that drives that home  for me is that of Moses.
41:00 If you look in Exodus chapter 3,
41:03 and in this account we know  it’s not due to lack of zeal,
41:06 but, rather,  Moses’ own insecurities
41:09 that nearly caused him to limit  how he was used by Jehovah.
41:13 So we know in Exodus chapter 3,
41:15 he received a very weighty assignment —going to Pharaoh.
41:18 And notice what happens  in verse 11,
41:21 Exodus 3:11.
41:23 It says: “However,  Moses said to the true God:
41:26 “‘Who am I that I  should go to Pharaoh
41:28 and bring the Israelites  out of Egypt?’”
41:31 Now, that’s a normal reaction.
41:32 We probably would have felt  the same way.
41:33 ‘Jehovah, are you sure  you have the right person here?’
41:36 And Jehovah says, ‘No.  I do.
41:38 I will be with you.’
41:40 You look on in verse 13, it says:
41:43 “But Moses said to the true God:  ‘Suppose I
41:45 “‘go to [Israel] and say to them,
41:47 “‘“The God of your forefathers  has sent me to you,”
41:49 “‘and they say to me,  “What is his name?”
41:51 What should I say to them?’”
41:53 Jehovah says, ‘No problem,’  and He explains His name
41:55 —even tells him  what His name means
41:57 and how that power  will be behind him.
42:00 Chapter 4, verse 1:
42:03 “However, Moses answered:  ‘But suppose they do not believe me
42:06 “‘and do not listen to my voice,  for they will say,
42:09 “Jehovah did not appear to you.”’”
42:11 ‘No problem, Moses.  What’s in your hand?’
42:13 It’s where he has the staff.
42:14 He shows him miracles  that he can perform to show
42:16 that Jehovah is behind him.
42:18 Look at verse 10:
42:20 “Moses now said to Jehovah:  ‘Pardon me, Jehovah,
42:23 “‘but I have never been a fluent speaker,  neither in the past
42:25 “‘nor since you have spoken  to your servant,
42:27 for I am slow of speech  and slow of tongue.’”
42:31 ‘OK, Moses,  who created the mouth?
42:33 I’ll speak for you.  Don’t worry about it.’
42:36 Look at verse 13:
42:38 “But he said: ‘Pardon me,  Jehovah, please send
42:40 anyone whom you  want to send.’”
42:42 And notice what it says  in verse 14:
42:45 “Then Jehovah’s anger  blazed against Moses.”
42:49 ‘Fine, you know, I’m going  to just send somebody else.’
42:52 But, you see, thankfully,  Moses got the point
42:54 and he jumped into the assignment  and was used further by Jehovah.
42:57 But what happened here?
42:59 You notice, Moses got caught up  worrying about his inadequacies,
43:03 worrying about all the things  that could go wrong.
43:05 Jehovah was saying,  ‘Just get moving,
43:07 and I will take care  of the rest.’
43:10 Jehovah saw that Moses had the potential
43:12 to carry out this assignment;
43:14 however,  Moses was limiting himself.
43:17 Number three:  We can limit our own potential
43:20 by becoming paralyzed by fear —fear of failure.
43:24 If you turn to the account  in Numbers chapter 13,
43:27 we notice that this  is what happened to the ten spies.
43:30 And it’s very interesting,
43:32 a phrase they used when they  came back from spying out the land.
43:35 Numbers chapter 13,  and look at verse 33.
43:41 It says:  “And there we saw the Nephilim,
43:44 “the sons of Anak,  who [were] from the Nephilim,
43:47 and in comparison  we seemed like grasshoppers,”
43:51 and notice, “both to us  and to them.”
43:55 You see, they ran into these  sons of Anak who were giants,
43:58 men of extraordinary size  who inhabited
44:01 the mountainous region of Canaan,
44:02 and it was understandable  that these enemies of Jehovah
44:05 viewed the Israelites  as puny grasshoppers.
44:07 ‘You can just squash them —no competition.’
44:11 But, you know, the ten spies
44:13 saw themselves the same way.
44:16 And, see, their view  of themselves in this situation
44:19 paralyzed them with fear  and caused them
44:21 to demoralize the entire nation.
44:24 But now, in contrast,  we think of the account of David,
44:26 who as a young man  also encountered a giant, Goliath.
44:30 And remember, Goliath also saw David  as a defenseless little boy
44:34 and as a grasshopper,  if you will.
44:37 But did David see himself  the same way?
44:39 No, he said: ‘You are coming to me  with sword and spear.
44:42 I am coming to you  with the name of Jehovah.’
44:45 You see, David did not allow himself  to be paralyzed by fear.
44:49 He trusted in Jehovah,  and David lived up to the potential
44:53 that Jehovah saw in him.
44:55 So, what’s the lesson for us?
44:57 Well, the lesson is that this illustrates
44:59 —these accounts illustrate— that sometimes we can be
45:02 our own worst enemy at times.
45:04 See, lack of zeal —not throwing ourself into the work,
45:07 as in the case of Jehoash;
45:09 or our own insecurities,  as in the case of Moses;
45:13 or fear of failure,  as in the case of the ten spies
45:16 —can cause us to limit the potential that Jehovah sees in us.
45:21 So, what do we do?
45:23 Well, Jehovah’s words to Gideon  remind us of what we could do,
45:27 and we invite you  to turn to Judges chapter 6.
45:30 And you remember  that for seven years
45:33 the Midianites  oppressed the nation of Israel,
45:37 and Jehovah’s angel appears to Gideon and says that He is going
45:40 to deliver Israel out of this wicked nation.
45:43 How could he possibly succeed?
45:45 We read the account,  and Gideon saw himself
45:47 as the least significant  one of his father’s house.
45:49 And he said his father’s house  was the least significant family
45:52 of the tribe of Manasseh.
45:54 But yet Jehovah saw  the potential that Gideon had.
45:58 And what did Jehovah  tell him to do?
46:01 Look at Judges 6:14.
46:06 It says:  “Jehovah faced him and said:
46:09 “‘Go with the strength you have,
46:12 “‘and you will save Israel  out of Midian’s hand.
46:16 Is it not I who [sent] you?’”
46:18 Interesting.
46:20 ‘Go with the strength  you have.
46:24 ‘I know you cannot do it  on your own strength.
46:26 ‘Just get moving;  throw everything you can into it;
46:30 and I, Jehovah,  will make up the difference.’
46:33 You see,  that’s what Jehovah is saying,
46:35 and that’s exactly what happened.
46:38 So may we be determined  to do the same.
46:41 We know that none of us  accomplish Jehovah’s work
46:43 on our own strength,  on our own wisdom,
46:46 on our own abilities.
46:47 But when we receive an assignment,
46:49 we need to just start moving.
46:51 Do not let our inadequacies  paralyze us.
46:55 Do not let fear of failure  paralyze us.
46:58 Throw ourselves into the work.  Have a zeal for the work.
47:01 Go with the strength  that you have.
47:04 Trust in Jehovah  to make up the difference,
47:08 and you will live up to the potential  that Jehovah sees in you.
47:13 What excellent counsel for all of us,  and especially for young ones
47:18 with a life of service to God ahead of them.
47:21 That life with Jehovah can be everlasting!
47:25 That is our firm hope.
47:27 Until then, will you remain loyal,
47:30 resist what the world offers you,  and reach your potential?
47:34 Imagine your life
100 years from now.
47:38 Will you regret the decades you gave to Jehovah?
47:42 Will anything you endured in Satan’s system
47:45 slow you down from gaining life’s prize?
47:48 Some of our brothers and sisters can already look back
47:51 that far and answer those questions.
47:54 Sister Alma Miller’s family learned the truth
47:57 when she was ten years old.
47:59 She was baptized in 1937
48:01 and is now 107 years old.
48:06 To her, just about everyone is a young person.
48:10 See the encouraging effect her loving and faithful example
48:14 has on young ones  in her congregation.
48:22 People often tell me,
48:25 “Why, I never talked to a person
48:27 that was 107 years old.”
48:30 And I tell them,  “You know what?
48:32 I never did either.”
48:36 I would describe Alma
48:38 as probably the most energetic
48:41 100-plus-year-old lady  that I’ve ever met.
48:44 She has, pretty much,
48:46 the whole theocratic history  in her mind that she carries with her.
48:49 So you can ask her anything  about the organization,
48:51 and she can be able to tell you about it
48:53 because she’s even met a lot of those people.
48:56 We read about it, but she lived it.  She’s amazing.
48:59 Even though she’s 107,  she has an incredible memory.
49:04 I go back quite a ways.
49:07 When I was very young,  ten years old,
49:10 we saw the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
49:16 And it was just packed with people.
49:19 They were even standing in the back.
49:23 We were so thrilled.  We never forgot it.
49:27 And we realized  that we found the truth.
49:32 My father left the church
49:34 and he became  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
49:38 and they were called Bible Students  at that time.
49:42 In the early days,  we went to special conventions,
49:46 and some places,  they had a big field
49:49 where they put the cars  and they set up their tents.
49:52 They even named different streets.
49:56 It was just like a little city.
50:00 I was really thrilled  to see Brother Rutherford speak
50:04 at the conventions I attended.
50:08 I got married to Harold Miller in 1931.
50:12 That was when the depression  was going on,
50:15 and times were very difficult.
50:18 Everything was scarce.
50:21 There were no jobs to be had.
50:24 Food was rationed.
50:26 People were really hungry.
50:29 And they moved in any little shack
50:32 that they could just to get by.
50:38 We didn’t have anything.
50:40 And we couldn’t drive the car,
50:44 so we used to have a little white horse
50:48 —the name was Lou.
50:51 And we went out witnessing  with the horse and buggy.
50:56 She took us all over the place,  far distances.
51:02 They would take this buggy,  and they would go
51:05 20-30 miles in one direction;
51:07 20-30 miles the other direction.
51:09 All the hard work that they put forth
51:11 has resulted  in several congregations in the area.
51:17 We used to carry that magazine bag
51:21 when we were witnessing for awhile there.
51:24 And so we put it around the horse’s neck,
51:27 so the horse was taking part  in our witnessing.
51:31 People knew  who was coming when they saw
51:34 the little white horse come into their yard.
51:38 Sometimes it was cold,
51:41 and I remember wearing two coats.
51:44 Yeah, it was tiresome,
51:46 but we were young.
51:49 They would just go out  regardless of rain or shine
51:53 or whatever was going on at the time,  and they didn’t have a car.
51:55 And to me, that’s amazing  because we get so used to
51:57 the conveniences —I guess you could call it—
51:59 the coffee breaks,  the cars, and everything.
52:01 It’s like, well,  if Alma can do it, surely I can do it.
52:06 One time, Harold went out witnessing,
52:09 and 50 years later,  he talked to the same man.
52:12 He said, “50 years ago,
52:15 “there was a young guy  that came through here
52:19 “riding on horseback
52:21 and telling people that,”  he said,
52:24 “I think it’s ‘Armaggigon,’
52:27 he said was coming soon.”
52:29 And he remembered  Harold riding horseback
52:32 50 years ago in that territory,
52:34 and he got there again.
52:38 And that happened  a couple times more.
52:41 So it was a long life of witnessing.
52:49 Alma is so zealous for the ministry.
52:52 She does not like not-at-homes.
52:55 She wants to talk to people.
52:58 Yeah, I enjoy the ministry.
53:00 I go out as much as I can  in my old age.
53:06 We want to help the people  to see the truth.
53:09 There’s no greater joy.
53:16 I try to read the publications,
53:19 so I have a reading machine.
53:24 The letters come right out of the screen,
53:27 and I can study all my lessons.
53:30 I would be lost without it.
53:34 It helps me to keep up  in present truth.
53:38 What does dedication mean?
53:43 Sister Miller, please.
53:45 Dedication means that. . .
53:47 Some young ones might be concerned  about what they should do
53:50 with their life,  what choices they should make.
53:52 Well, here we see an example  of somebody who has served Jehovah
53:54 for over 100 years.
53:56 And we see that she’s happy  and has no regrets with her life.
53:59 And that’s an example  that we want to imitate.
54:03 Well, giving my life to Jehovah,
54:06 that’s the best thing  I could do for myself.
54:11 If I have any advice  for young ones today,
54:14 I would say  to keep on in the truth.
54:19 They have a whole world before them
54:23 to serve Jehovah
54:25 —something that endures forever.
54:31 Wasn’t that encouraging?
54:33 With all the videos we use in our worship today,
54:36 it’s also interesting that  Sister Miller’s introduction to the truth
54:40 was the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
54:43 That was a photographic slide  and motion picture production,
54:47 complete with color and sound, which first showed in 1914.
54:52 You might enjoy learning more about that historic presentation
54:56 as a personal study project.
54:58 Sister Miller has experienced much in her 107 years.
55:03 She’s endured economic depression, health problems,
55:07 and the loss of family and friends, including her dear husband.
55:11 But as we saw,  Jehovah has blessed her
55:15 with a spiritual family in the congregation.
55:18 At the same time, those interviewed with Sister Miller
55:21 are enjoying a close friendship with someone older.
55:24 Even very young ones are finding friends
55:28 among older brothers and sisters.
55:30 David, age nine, wrote this in his letter to the Governing Body:
55:35 “I like to listen to older ones.
55:38 “I just used to have a circle of friends,
55:41 but now I feel more comfortable going and talking to older ones.”
55:46 It’s no surprise, then,
55:48 that in the latest Become Jehovah’s Friend video,
55:51 Sophia learns that you’re never  too young
55:54 or too old  to be someone’s friend.
56:20 Sister Elsa,
56:22 did you paint these?
56:24 I did.
56:26 They’re amazing!
56:27 How long have you been drawing?
56:29 As long as I can remember.
56:32 It’s my way of being able to share
56:34 all the stories of my life.
56:36 Could you show me?
56:39 Yes, of course!
56:41 I remember a time when I was young and in East Germany.
56:44 We weren’t allowed to do our work as Jehovah’s Witnesses;
56:48 we were under ban.
56:50 I helped in copying our Watchtower magazines by hand
56:54 and then hiding them in food.
56:56 You did?
56:57 Yes!
56:58 We’d then send the food to our brothers who were in prison.
57:03 I was also asked to help in distributing Bible literature
57:06 to our congregations  as an underground messenger.
57:10 Wow!
57:11 Time passed and then things  started getting better in Berlin.
57:16 Shortly after,  I immigrated to New York.
57:19 And I met my darling husband.
57:25 Wow, that was a great story!
57:27 Thank you.
57:29 But I’m sure you have stories.
57:31 What do you like to draw?
57:33 Well, actually, here!
57:36 This was the time when Caleb and I went to the park,
57:39 and we met a little girl there.
57:41 I’m glad I reached out that day.
57:43 Lasting friends can be of any age when they love Jehovah.
57:52 Elsa and Sophia already share much in common
57:56 and are likely  to become good friends.
57:59 We’re pleased to announce that
58:01 this new Become Jehovah’s Friend lesson is available
58:06 on Video on Demand under the “Children” category.
58:11 You parents and family heads
58:13 are doing all you can  to teach your children from infancy
58:18 to love Jehovah and to become his friend.
58:21 As they grow, you also teach them
58:23 how to study and pray on their own.
58:26 You know they need these spiritual skills.
58:30 Young ones, remember that your personal study time
58:34 is when you  can ask Jehovah for help
58:37 with what you  are personally experiencing,
58:39 and that study time  has other good effects.
58:43 As this music video tells us,
58:46 “Study Makes You Strong”!
58:55 Since we could crawl,  our family studied it all.
59:01 Even though small,  we understood what we were learning.
59:07 Father would read to me  before I would sleep.
59:13 Now I am taller;  I still keep up with that routine.
59:19 And when I’m by myself,  I take that book down off the shelf.
59:25 I remember what the scripture said  that I would need so I could stand firm.
59:30 Study makes you strong,
59:32 Just like a tree that’s planted  by a river stream.
59:36 Study makes you strong.
59:38 Your leaves just won’t dry out  and everything succeeds.
59:42 Study makes you strong,
59:43 Just like a tree that’s planted  its roots down deep.
59:48 Study makes you strong.
59:49 You’ll grow so big and tall  there’s nothing you won’t see.
59:59 What will I say when a big chance  comes my way?
1:00:05 What will my classmates say  if I don’t follow with them?
1:00:11 All of the information’s  here on display.
1:00:17 I’m not afraid,  because I learned this as an infant.
1:00:24 ʹCause when I’m by myself,  I take that book down off the shelf.
1:00:29 I remember what the scripture said  that I would need so I could stand firm.
1:00:34 Study makes you strong,
1:00:36 Just like a tree that’s planted  by a river stream.
1:00:41 Study makes you strong.
1:00:42 Your leaves just won’t dry out  and everything succeeds.
1:00:47 Study makes you strong,
1:00:48 Just like a tree that’s planted  its roots down deep.
1:00:53 Study makes you strong.
1:00:54 You’ll grow so big and tall  there’s nothing you won’t see.
1:01:04 Every word that’s helping me Could contain the very key
1:01:16 To offer just the help  and encouragement somebody needs.
1:01:26 Study makes you strong. Study makes you strong.
1:01:39 Study makes you strong. Study makes you strong.
1:01:51 Study makes you strong,
1:01:53 Just like a tree that’s planted  by a river stream.
1:01:57 Study makes you strong.
1:01:59 Your leaves just won’t dry out  and everything succeeds.
1:02:03 Study makes you strong,
1:02:05 Just like a tree that’s planted  its roots down deep.
1:02:09 Study makes you strong.
1:02:11 You’ll grow so big and tall  there’s nothing you won’t see.
1:02:22 Study does make us strong!
1:02:25 As depicted in the music video, the Bible reading and study habits
1:02:29 that the young sister  started with her family
1:02:32 became her own personal habits.
1:02:35 When a challenging situation or opportunity to give a witness came along,
1:02:39 she already knew how to research  what she needed from the Scriptures.
1:02:44 Our prayer is that all of you  young brothers and sisters
1:02:47 grow spiritually strong in the same way
1:02:51 and become examples to faithful ones everywhere.
1:02:55 That brings us  to our video postcard
1:02:58 from faithful brothers and sisters.
1:03:01 This month we visit beautiful Austria, in Central Europe.
1:03:14 Brother C.T. Russell first visited Austria in 1891.
1:03:18 He returned in 1911 to plant
1:03:21 further seeds of Kingdom truth  in the capital city, Vienna.
1:03:25 Today, there are more than 21,000 active publishers
1:03:29 among the eight million who live in Austria.
1:03:33 One of the 301 congregations
1:03:35 is the German-language congregation in Uderns.
1:03:39 They preach in a territory  of alpine mountains and valleys.
1:03:44 Some farms are as high in elevation as 1,700 meters,
1:03:48 or more than 5,500 feet.
1:03:51 But difficult terrain does not slow the Kingdom message.
1:03:55 The 48 publishers there
1:03:57 recently reported conducting
51 Bible studies.
1:04:02 We thank them for showing us another encouraging example
1:04:05 of the brotherly love that unites
1:04:08 God’s people worldwide.
1:04:15 They send us their Christian love and greetings,
1:04:18 and we send our love in return, along with prayers for Jehovah’s favor.
1:04:26 We thank you for joining us,
1:04:29 and we look forward  to an encouraging program next month.
1:04:32 From Brooklyn, New York,
1:04:34 this is JW Broadcasting!

00:01.017 --> 00:05.155
Greetings! 
We’re so happy you could join us. 


00:05.155 --> 00:09.158
It’s a new service year 
and a new monthly program. 


00:09.158 --> 00:11.160
And look, we have a new cohost, 


00:11.160 --> 00:14.230
Brother Seth Hyatt, 
affectionately known as Rocky. 


00:14.230 --> 00:17.233
Now, Rocky, what can the friends 
have to look forward to?


00:17.233 --> 00:20.170
You can look forward 
to this dramatization 


00:20.170 --> 00:22.172
where we meet a sister who is 


00:22.172 --> 00:25.242
on the brink of losing 
her joy in the ministry. 


00:25.242 --> 00:27.244
What does she need to do? 


00:27.243 --> 00:31.380
We will all benefit 
from the very practical application.


00:31.380 --> 00:34.050
And we’re also going to see 
an amazing video 


00:34.050 --> 00:36.318
from the Art Department 
at world headquarters. 


00:36.318 --> 00:39.388
What do they do? 
And how do we benefit from their work? 


00:39.388 --> 00:42.258
This segment is going 
to answer those questions.


00:42.258 --> 00:45.628
In some countries in Europe, 
congregations are involved 


00:45.628 --> 00:47.696
in witnessing at truck stops. 


00:47.697 --> 00:51.902
This has proved to be a very productive way
of reaching individuals 


00:51.902 --> 00:55.037
who spend most of their time 
away from home.


00:55.037 --> 00:58.240
So if you’re a first-time viewer, welcome. 


00:58.240 --> 01:00.977
If you’re a regular viewer, welcome back. 


01:00.977 --> 01:05.000
This is the September program 
of JW Broadcasting!


01:23.433 --> 01:25.935
Have you enjoyed studying the book 


01:25.935 --> 01:28.772
Imitate Their Faith as much as I have? 


01:28.772 --> 01:31.074
It’s a wonderful book, 
isn’t it? 


01:31.073 --> 01:35.010
And I was particularly captivated 
by the introduction. 


01:35.010 --> 01:37.447
There was a point in the introduction 


01:37.447 --> 01:40.150
that encouraged us 
to use our imagination 


01:40.150 --> 01:42.185
when we’re reading the Bible: 


01:42.185 --> 01:44.820
to see the sights, 
to hear the sounds, 


01:44.820 --> 01:48.792
to smell the aromas, 
to try to capture the feelings 


01:48.792 --> 01:52.095
of the individuals 
that we are reading about. 


01:52.095 --> 01:55.465
Now, of course, we don’t want 
our imagination to run away with us, 


01:55.465 --> 01:57.767
but at the same time, 
we do want to get 


01:57.767 --> 02:01.337
a solid mental picture 
of what we’re reading. 


02:01.337 --> 02:04.140
And that’s what I’d like 
to talk to you about today. 


02:04.140 --> 02:09.012
When you’re reading the Bible, 
try to get the whole picture.


02:09.012 --> 02:14.000
Now we’ll use a couple 
of well-known Bible accounts to illustrate. 


02:15.252 --> 02:20.224
Have you been raised 
in a stepfamily or a blended family? 


02:20.223 --> 02:23.325
If you have, 
did you know that you have 


02:23.325 --> 02:26.795
something in common with Joseph, 
the son of Jacob? 


02:26.795 --> 02:30.900
Joseph was raised 
with ten half brothers 


02:30.900 --> 02:34.437
in a large blended family. 


02:34.437 --> 02:38.007
So now you want to try to view 


02:38.007 --> 02:40.075
this family as a composite. 


02:40.075 --> 02:43.212
You want to try to figure out 
how did people mesh 


02:43.212 --> 02:46.249
or how did they clash 
within this family. 


02:46.248 --> 02:48.250
What would you do? 


02:48.250 --> 02:51.653
Well, you might start by writing down 
some of the characteristics 


02:51.653 --> 02:54.090
of the individual members 
of the family. 


02:54.090 --> 02:57.227
What about Joseph’s half brothers 
and Joseph himself? 


02:57.227 --> 02:59.229
What do you know about them? 


02:59.228 --> 03:03.098
What about Judah, 
Simeon, Levi, 


03:03.098 --> 03:06.903
Dan, Naphtali
—what do you know? 


03:06.903 --> 03:08.905
So write down 
their characteristics, 


03:08.905 --> 03:11.942
and try to figure out 
how they might get along. 


03:11.942 --> 03:15.845
Sometimes there is 
one individual incident 


03:15.845 --> 03:17.847
that’s recorded in the Bible,


03:17.847 --> 03:20.082
but we mustn’t forget:


03:20.082 --> 03:24.320
People’s actions 
have a way of affecting other people. 


03:24.320 --> 03:27.390
So when you read 
about a certain incident in the Bible,


03:27.390 --> 03:31.860
try to imagine who 
might have been affected by that incident.


03:31.860 --> 03:33.563
Take an example. 


03:33.563 --> 03:38.366
In the book of Genesis, 
we read that Jacob’s son Reuben 


03:38.367 --> 03:43.574
committed sexual immorality 
with Bilhah. 


03:43.573 --> 03:46.741
Well, that had an effect 
on other people without doubt. 


03:46.742 --> 03:48.745
Who was Reuben? 


03:48.745 --> 03:51.480
He was Leah’s oldest son. 


03:51.480 --> 03:53.482
Who was Bilhah? 


03:53.482 --> 03:55.485
Rachel’s handmaiden. 


03:55.485 --> 03:59.022
Do you think that there might have been 
a little animosity or tension 


03:59.022 --> 04:02.692
between Leah and Rachel sometimes, 


04:02.692 --> 04:07.397
especially when you consider 
how their marriages started out? 


04:07.397 --> 04:08.999
There may have been. 


04:08.998 --> 04:12.168
And it may be 
that the attitudes of the women 


04:12.168 --> 04:15.938
had some bearing on the attitudes
of their sons as well. 


04:15.938 --> 04:19.008
So you take all of these things 
into consideration. 


04:19.008 --> 04:23.411
Now, Bilhah had two sons, 
Dan and Naphtali. 


04:23.412 --> 04:25.715
How do you think 
they felt when they learned 


04:25.715 --> 04:28.818
that their oldest brother, 
or half brother, 


04:28.818 --> 04:31.786
had committed fornication 
with their mother? 


04:31.787 --> 04:34.057
So there could have been 
tension there. 


04:34.057 --> 04:36.259
And this all goes into the mix 


04:36.258 --> 04:40.430
when we’re considering 
the family as a composite.


04:40.430 --> 04:44.767
Now, do you picture 
Joseph at age 17 


04:44.767 --> 04:49.705
with ten much older half brothers, 
maybe in their 30’s, 


04:49.705 --> 04:52.575
some old enough to be his father? 


04:52.575 --> 04:54.577
Not true. 


04:54.577 --> 04:58.715
The truth is that there was only 
a seven-year age difference 


04:58.715 --> 05:03.518
between Joseph’s oldest brother, 
Reuben, and Joseph himself. 


05:03.518 --> 05:06.221
In fact, 11 of Jacob’s sons 


05:06.222 --> 05:08.992
were born 
during the seven-year period 


05:08.992 --> 05:12.295
when Jacob 
was working for Laban. 


05:12.295 --> 05:15.465
Eleven sons in seven years, 


05:15.465 --> 05:17.467
how is that possible? 


05:17.467 --> 05:21.137
It’s easy, when you remember 
that Jacob had two wives


05:21.137 --> 05:25.074
and two concubines, 
or secondary wives. 


05:25.073 --> 05:27.976
So there didn’t have to be 
a nine-month interval 


05:27.977 --> 05:30.347
between the birth 
of the children. 


05:30.347 --> 05:33.884
In fact, some could have been born 
just about at the same time; 


05:33.883 --> 05:36.451
they could have been 
the same age. 


05:36.452 --> 05:40.924
So when Joseph 
was sold into slavery at age 17, 


05:40.923 --> 05:44.793
his oldest brother 
was no more than 24. 


05:44.793 --> 05:49.665
Some of his brothers were only 
a year or two older than Joseph himself. 


05:49.665 --> 05:52.302
So we’re talking 
about a group of young men 


05:52.302 --> 05:54.937
in their late teens 
and early 20’s, 


05:54.937 --> 05:58.674
and this might explain 
some of the hotheaded reactions 


05:58.673 --> 06:01.000
that some 
of those young men had.


06:02.145 --> 06:04.147
Well, so much for the boys. 


06:04.147 --> 06:06.249
What about their father, Jacob? 


06:06.248 --> 06:08.250
What can we learn about him? 


06:08.250 --> 06:10.252
A lot. 


06:10.252 --> 06:13.055
For one thing, 
he was a spiritual man. 


06:13.055 --> 06:15.858
Now, this is something 
for you young brothers and sisters 


06:15.858 --> 06:18.660
who are contemplating 
marriage to think about. 


06:18.660 --> 06:21.363
Jacob was willing 
to go to any length 


06:21.363 --> 06:25.133
to keep his relationship 
with Jehovah intact. 


06:25.133 --> 06:27.136
Let’s take an example: 


06:27.137 --> 06:31.140
Genesis 29:18. 


06:31.140 --> 06:34.877
You can follow along 
on the screen as I read this. 


06:34.877 --> 06:38.280
And we’re talking 
about marriage here. 


06:38.280 --> 06:40.382
Genesis 29:18.


06:40.382 --> 06:44.220
It says: 
“Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, 


06:44.220 --> 06:49.258
“so he said: 
‘I am willing to serve you seven years 


06:49.258 --> 06:52.661
for your younger daughter Rachel.’” 


06:52.662 --> 06:54.864
Now what’s the takeaway? 


06:54.863 --> 06:58.200
Jacob didn’t marry 
the first person who came along, 


06:58.200 --> 07:00.202
maybe some pagan woman. 


07:00.202 --> 07:03.005
He didn’t say, 
‘Well, seven years is too long to wait. 


07:03.005 --> 07:06.275
I’m going to find some Philistine woman, 
and I’ll marry her.’ 


07:06.275 --> 07:09.812
He was willing to wait 
so that he could marry someone 


07:09.812 --> 07:13.282
who would join him 
in the worship of Jehovah. 


07:13.282 --> 07:16.419
And you young folks, 
if you are willing to wait, 


07:16.418 --> 07:20.255
you can be sure that you will have 
Jehovah’s blessing as well.


07:20.255 --> 07:24.160
Now Jacob was apparently also 
a bit of a romantic. 


07:24.160 --> 07:26.595
Notice verse 20.


07:26.595 --> 07:30.098
It says: 
“And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,” 


07:30.098 --> 07:32.100
but notice this, 


07:32.100 --> 07:35.972
“but in his eyes 
they were like just a few days


07:35.972 --> 07:38.440
because of his love for her.”


07:38.440 --> 07:40.000
Now, isn’t that poetic? 


07:41.577 --> 07:44.547
Jacob may have learned 
to treasure his wife 


07:44.547 --> 07:47.850
by observing his parents, 
Isaac and Rebekah. 


07:47.850 --> 07:50.018
It appears that they 
had a strong marriage. 


07:50.018 --> 07:52.053
Just notice what we read 


07:52.053 --> 07:57.860
at Genesis 26:8, 


07:57.860 --> 08:01.000
Genesis 26:8.


08:02.732 --> 08:05.034
It says: 
“After some time had passed, 


08:05.033 --> 08:09.471
“Abimelech king of the Philistines 
was looking out of the window, 


08:09.472 --> 08:12.942
and he saw Isaac,” 
that’s Jacob’s father, 


08:12.942 --> 08:17.914
“displaying affection 
for Rebekah his wife.” 


08:17.913 --> 08:21.283
So it appears 
that Isaac and Rebekah 


08:21.283 --> 08:25.000
had a warm relationship, 
a good marriage.


08:26.488 --> 08:29.158
Now, what else 
can we learn about Jacob? 


08:29.158 --> 08:31.260
There’s an interesting detail recorded 


08:31.260 --> 08:35.330
in chapter 25 and verse 27.


08:35.330 --> 08:39.568
It says: 
“As the boys got bigger, Esau,” 


08:39.568 --> 08:41.236
Jacob’s brother, 


08:41.237 --> 08:44.440
“became a skilled hunter, 
a man of the field, 


08:44.440 --> 08:47.410
“but Jacob was a blameless man, 


08:47.410 --> 08:50.512
dwelling in tents.” 


08:50.512 --> 08:54.717
So Jacob liked to dwell in tents. 


08:54.717 --> 08:58.720
That might explain 
the strong bond that developed 


08:58.720 --> 09:03.000
between Jacob and Joseph, 
who was his youngest for many years.


09:04.427 --> 09:07.530
Now although Jacob 
liked to dwell in tents, 


09:07.530 --> 09:09.898
he was by no means a sissy. 


09:09.898 --> 09:14.870
He was a strong man, 
but he was a spiritual man. 


09:14.870 --> 09:18.140
That’s something 
for you young brothers to take away. 


09:18.140 --> 09:20.610
You want to be strong, 
we know you do, 


09:20.610 --> 09:23.000
but spirituality 
should come first.


09:25.213 --> 09:30.185
One time, spiritual Jacob 
gave his sons a beautiful lesson 


09:30.185 --> 09:33.755
on how to settle 
a difference with a family member. 


09:33.755 --> 09:37.192
We read about it 
at Genesis chapter 32. 


09:37.192 --> 09:41.564
And I think all of us can learn 
from his example. 


09:41.563 --> 09:43.565
We learn at Genesis 32 


09:43.565 --> 09:47.537
that Jacob’s brother, Esau, 
was coming to see him. 


09:47.537 --> 09:50.740
Now, they hadn’t seen 
each other for 20 years, 


09:50.740 --> 09:55.177
and to say that their parting 
had been difficult is an understatement. 


09:55.177 --> 09:59.782
The fact is that when they separated 
more than 20 years earlier, 


09:59.782 --> 10:04.220
Esau had vowed that one day 
he was going to kill his brother; 


10:04.220 --> 10:06.722
now he was coming to see him. 


10:06.722 --> 10:10.425
Now, why was he 
so angry with Jacob? 


10:10.425 --> 10:15.130
It’s because Jacob had received 
a blessing from their father, 


10:15.130 --> 10:18.567
and Esau was not happy. 


10:18.567 --> 10:20.737
So Esau arrives, 


10:20.737 --> 10:23.605
and 400 men are with him. 


10:23.605 --> 10:25.842
Why 400 men? 


10:25.842 --> 10:27.844
Well, the Bible doesn’t say. 


10:27.843 --> 10:29.845
But it could be 
that he was trying to show 


10:29.845 --> 10:33.000
how important and prominent 
he had become. 


10:34.250 --> 10:36.418
How did Jacob react? 


10:36.418 --> 10:39.021
Did he try to go tit for tat? 


10:39.022 --> 10:43.159
Did he try to show how important 
and prominent he had become 


10:43.158 --> 10:45.795
with all of the blessings 
he’d received? 


10:45.795 --> 10:49.498
Did he reopen old wounds? 


10:49.498 --> 10:52.133
Did he argue with his brother? 


10:52.133 --> 10:55.103
Did he say, 
‘You know I was right all along, 


10:55.103 --> 10:57.740
and you, Esau, 
you have been wrong’? 


10:57.740 --> 11:00.777
Did he demand an apology? 


11:00.777 --> 11:02.779
No. 


11:02.778 --> 11:05.413
There was a lot that Jacob 
could have bragged about. 


11:05.413 --> 11:07.350
No question about that. 


11:07.350 --> 11:09.918
There was no doubt that Jacob 
had Jehovah’s blessing. 


11:09.918 --> 11:13.488
Early on, 
we read that an angel of Jehovah 


11:13.488 --> 11:15.556
had appeared to him 
and said: 


11:15.557 --> 11:17.594
“I am Jehovah 


11:17.593 --> 11:21.196
“the God of Abraham your father 
and the God of Isaac. 


11:21.197 --> 11:23.599
“The land on which you are lying, 


11:23.598 --> 11:27.436
“to you I am going to give it 
and to your offspring. 


11:27.437 --> 11:29.905
“I am with you, 


11:29.905 --> 11:32.875
“and I will safeguard you 
wherever you go . . . 


11:32.875 --> 11:36.178
I will not leave you.” 


11:36.178 --> 11:38.246
Well, that’s quite a blessing, 
isn’t it? 


11:38.247 --> 11:40.249
But there’s more. 


11:40.248 --> 11:42.350
For a portion 
of the previous night


11:42.350 --> 11:46.155
—that is, the night before Esau 
and Jacob met up—


11:46.155 --> 11:49.258
Jacob had wrestled with an angel, 


11:49.258 --> 11:50.993
and as a result, 


11:50.993 --> 11:54.000
he had managed 
to receive another blessing. 


11:55.330 --> 11:58.700
But Jacob didn’t flaunt 
his blessings. 


11:58.700 --> 12:01.703
Instead, he humbled himself. 


12:01.703 --> 12:05.841
In fact, he even bowed down 
seven times before his brother 


12:05.842 --> 12:10.000
in front of his wives 
and his 11 sons. 


12:11.047 --> 12:14.884
So Jacob settled 
any lingering difference with Esau 


12:14.883 --> 12:16.951
not with his fists, 


12:16.952 --> 12:20.622
not with a bragging tongue, 
not with a weapon, 


12:20.622 --> 12:23.592
but humbly, 
like a real man


12:23.592 --> 12:26.000
—like a real, spiritual man.


12:28.397 --> 12:32.469
In contrast, 
how did Jacob’s ten sons 


12:32.468 --> 12:35.470
settle their difference 
with Joseph? 


12:35.470 --> 12:37.507
Like a bunch of cowards. 


12:37.507 --> 12:40.742
It was 10 to 1 
against Joseph. 


12:40.742 --> 12:44.347
First, they decided 
to kill their brother, 


12:44.347 --> 12:47.550
and then they delivered him 
up into slavery. 


12:47.550 --> 12:51.020
Those jealous young men 
didn’t learn a thing 


12:51.020 --> 12:54.890
from their father’s 
excellent spiritual example. 


12:54.890 --> 12:58.927
Well, if you’re on the outs 
with a member of your family, 


12:58.927 --> 13:02.364
if you had 
a serious difficulty with someone, 


13:02.363 --> 13:07.068
could you try to settle the matter 
peacefully as Jacob did? 


13:07.068 --> 13:11.406
If the person tries to apologize, 
be gracious about it. 


13:11.407 --> 13:13.809
Don’t make it difficult 
for him to apologize. 


13:13.808 --> 13:15.811
Don’t dredge up 


13:15.812 --> 13:18.980
all of the unnecessary details 
about the past.


13:18.980 --> 13:21.950
You may be in the right, 
as Jacob was, 


13:21.950 --> 13:25.053
but isn’t the important thing 
to make peace? 


13:25.053 --> 13:29.458
Jehovah loves the peacemakers.


13:29.458 --> 13:32.160
Well, what else 
do we learn about Jacob? 


13:32.160 --> 13:35.663
We learn that he wasn’t 
his father’s favorite. 


13:35.663 --> 13:39.000
Let’s look 
at Genesis chapter 25,


13:41.403 --> 13:43.871
verse 28.


13:43.872 --> 13:48.277
“And Isaac loved Esau 


13:48.277 --> 13:51.180
“because it meant game in his mouth, 


13:51.180 --> 13:55.683
whereas Rebekah loved Jacob.” 


13:55.683 --> 13:59.621
Now, this story may resonate 
with many of you out there, 


13:59.622 --> 14:02.224
especially if you’ve grown up 
in a large family


14:02.223 --> 14:05.060
or perhaps you’ve had 
a number of brothers and sisters. 


14:05.060 --> 14:07.328
Now, we know 
your parents claim 


14:07.328 --> 14:09.898
that they always treated 
all of you the same, 


14:09.898 --> 14:12.233
that they never ever 
had a preference. 


14:12.233 --> 14:14.236
But ask the kids, 


14:14.237 --> 14:17.072
Was there anyone in the family 
who was the favorite? 


14:17.072 --> 14:19.107
They all know. 
‘She was!’ 


14:19.107 --> 14:20.642
They know this. 


14:20.642 --> 14:25.380
The parents don’t realize it, 
but they are giving preferential treatment. 


14:25.380 --> 14:29.585
And so this happens, 
and it can be disconcerting at times.


14:29.585 --> 14:31.387
Imagine this scenario: 


14:31.387 --> 14:35.357
Imagine that you have a couple 
who have two children, two sons. 


14:35.357 --> 14:37.359
One is a pioneer. 


14:37.358 --> 14:40.896
He has never given his parents 
a moment’s grief. 


14:40.897 --> 14:44.032
The other 
never accepted the truth, 


14:44.032 --> 14:46.702
but he has done well 
in business, 


14:46.702 --> 14:51.007
and as a result, 
he has been generous to his parents, 


14:51.007 --> 14:55.410
and the parents are grateful, 
very grateful. 


14:55.410 --> 14:58.847
And the pioneer 
often hears the parents bragging 


14:58.847 --> 15:03.085
about the successes 
that his brother has had in business. 


15:03.085 --> 15:06.988
Well, the pioneer can’t help 
the parents materially very much, 


15:06.988 --> 15:10.225
and so he feels that there’s 
a bit of partiality there. 


15:10.225 --> 15:12.227
Is it hurtful? 


15:12.227 --> 15:14.397
Yes. 
That is life. 


15:14.397 --> 15:17.867
It’s chemistry. 
It’s just chemistry. 


15:17.867 --> 15:20.302
But the pioneer needs to realize 


15:20.302 --> 15:22.939
that Jehovah God 
appreciates his work. 


15:22.938 --> 15:25.975
His heavenly Father 
loves him very much 


15:25.975 --> 15:28.710
for the work 
that he is doing for His name.


15:28.710 --> 15:31.513
Now, Jacob must have known 


15:31.513 --> 15:34.883
that Isaac loved his brother 
more than he loved him. 


15:34.883 --> 15:37.451
And perhaps he vowed 
that when he had children, 


15:37.452 --> 15:39.455
he would treat them all the same. 


15:39.455 --> 15:43.158
Well, if he did, 
he didn’t keep that promise, did he? 


15:43.158 --> 15:47.000
Everyone knew 
that Joseph was the favorite.


15:48.930 --> 15:53.102
Well, have you noticed what we had to do 
to make a composite of this family? 


15:53.102 --> 15:56.905
We had to read 
from several different chapters of the Bible


15:56.905 --> 16:02.000
—Genesis 25, 26, 28, 29, 32. 


16:03.612 --> 16:06.215
You can’t always get 
a complete picture of an incident 


16:06.215 --> 16:09.618
by reading just one chapter, 
just by reading the chapter you are reading. 


16:09.618 --> 16:14.000
Sometimes you have to extract details 
from other chapters of the Bible.


16:16.358 --> 16:18.860
Now let’s consider 
one more example 


16:18.860 --> 16:22.397
where getting the complete picture 
can enrich our understanding. 


16:22.397 --> 16:24.400
This is going to be 
a shorter one. 


16:24.400 --> 16:27.368
We’re going to consider  
the story of Naaman. 


16:27.368 --> 16:29.538
Now, you remember the story. 


16:29.538 --> 16:32.506
At 2 Kings 5:1, 


16:32.507 --> 16:36.312
we learn that Naaman 
was the chief of the army 


16:36.312 --> 16:40.049
of Ben-hadad II, 
the king of Syria. 


16:40.048 --> 16:42.083
But he was a leper. 


16:42.083 --> 16:45.853
Now Ben-hadad learned 
that there was a prophet in Israel 


16:45.853 --> 16:49.691
Elisha who could heal him 
of his leprosy. 


16:49.692 --> 16:52.795
And so he told Naaman 
that he should go to Israel 


16:52.795 --> 16:55.430
and go to the prophet 
and get healed. 


16:55.430 --> 16:59.402
And so word was sent 
to the king of Israel by letter, 


16:59.402 --> 17:04.339
and the king of Israel was asked 
to send Naaman to Elisha. 


17:04.338 --> 17:07.175
Now, when you think of it, 
this was a strange request 


17:07.175 --> 17:11.012
because Israel and Syria 
were often at odds. 


17:11.012 --> 17:13.482
Sometimes there were 
wars between them, 


17:13.482 --> 17:17.185
and now, here you have 
the king of Syria sending his general, 


17:17.185 --> 17:20.088
the one who is going to head 
the army against Israel, 


17:20.088 --> 17:23.091
and saying: ‘Well, I’d like my general 
to be a more effective general. 


17:23.092 --> 17:25.627
Could you please make sure 
that he gets healed?’ 


17:25.627 --> 17:28.730
Well, somehow, 
he’s sent to Elisha 


17:28.730 --> 17:32.067
and Elisha kindly heals Naaman 


17:32.067 --> 17:36.205
and Naaman becomes 
a worshipper of Jehovah. 


17:36.205 --> 17:38.207
Well, we can imagine, 


17:38.207 --> 17:40.842
remember we’re talking 
about using our imagination, 


17:40.842 --> 17:44.379
we can imagine 
that when Naaman returned to Syria, 


17:44.378 --> 17:49.383
Ben-hadad had lots of nice things 
to say about Elisha. 


17:49.383 --> 17:53.821
So then, everyone lived 
happily ever after, right? 


17:53.822 --> 17:57.359
If we didn’t read on, 
we might think so. 


17:57.358 --> 17:59.861
But that’s not 
the end of the story. 


17:59.862 --> 18:03.432
In the next chapter, 
chapter 6, 


18:03.432 --> 18:08.337
we learn that Ben-hadad 
declared war against Israel. 


18:08.337 --> 18:11.907
Now, if Naaman 
was still the chief of the army, 


18:11.907 --> 18:14.075
he’d be in an awkward position. 


18:14.075 --> 18:16.845
Was he going 
to lead the armies of Syria 


18:16.845 --> 18:19.615
against fellow worshippers 
of Jehovah? 


18:19.615 --> 18:21.917
But it gets worse. 


18:21.917 --> 18:25.820
Ben-hadad learns that Elisha 


18:25.820 --> 18:30.125
is revealing the Syrians’ war strategies 
to the king of Israel, 


18:30.125 --> 18:33.795
so he sends a large army 
to capture Elisha


18:33.795 --> 18:37.665
—the very man who 
had healed his general. 


18:37.665 --> 18:40.035
So much for gratitude. 


18:40.035 --> 18:43.805
Now, it’s interesting 
that Naaman is not mentioned 


18:43.805 --> 18:46.542
as being at the head 
of those armies. 


18:46.542 --> 18:48.644
Did he get out of it somehow? 


18:48.643 --> 18:50.645
Don’t ask me. 


18:50.645 --> 18:53.000
If he’s resurrected, 
you’ll have to ask him.


18:54.348 --> 18:56.585
What lesson can we learn? 


18:56.585 --> 19:00.222
That the gratitude of the world 
is fleeting. 


19:00.222 --> 19:03.859
Some of us may get excited 
if there’s a favorable article 


19:03.858 --> 19:06.361
about Jehovah’s Witnesses 
in a newspaper 


19:06.362 --> 19:10.065
or if some TV personality 
makes a kind statement about us. 


19:10.065 --> 19:12.167
But what did Jehovah God say? 


19:12.167 --> 19:14.202
Genesis 3:15:


19:14.202 --> 19:18.240
“I will put enmity 
between you and the woman.” 


19:18.240 --> 19:21.743
So Jehovah’s organization 
and Satan’s organization 


19:21.743 --> 19:24.000
are always going to be at odds.


19:25.713 --> 19:27.748
Bible reading isn’t a chore. 


19:27.748 --> 19:29.751
It’s a joy. 


19:29.752 --> 19:32.087
Get the whole picture 
of what you’re reading, 


19:32.087 --> 19:34.355
and you’ll enjoy it even more.


19:34.355 --> 19:37.158
We wish you all 
Jehovah’s rich blessing 


19:37.158 --> 19:41.161
as you continue 
to enhance your appreciation 


19:41.162 --> 19:43.532
for this sacred volume.


19:43.532 --> 19:46.067
And now, let’s turn to Rocky. 


19:46.067 --> 19:49.605
I think Rocky 
has some practical application to share.


19:49.605 --> 19:52.942
Thank you, and as David mentioned, 


19:52.942 --> 19:56.279
there is a close connection between joy 


19:56.278 --> 19:58.613
and how we handle our Bible reading. 


19:58.613 --> 20:01.683
In this dramatization, 
we meet a pioneer sister 


20:01.683 --> 20:04.753
who did everything just right 


20:04.753 --> 20:08.623
but still felt 
that her motivation was declining. 


20:08.623 --> 20:10.991
Whether you pioneer or not, 


20:10.992 --> 20:14.129
notice the importance 
of properly digesting 


20:14.128 --> 20:18.000
our vital spiritual food.


20:30.712 --> 20:34.449
That’s my roommate, Camille.


20:34.448 --> 20:37.885
And, well, 


20:37.885 --> 20:40.722
that’s me.


20:40.722 --> 20:44.125
I haven’t felt like myself recently. 


20:44.125 --> 20:48.297
I started regular pioneering 
a couple of years ago.


20:48.297 --> 20:52.000
At first, I was really zealous. 


20:54.302 --> 20:56.839
But somewhere down the line, 


20:56.838 --> 20:59.000
I lost that good feeling. 


21:02.777 --> 21:07.000
Soon, I was losing my joy 
for almost everything.


21:14.857 --> 21:17.000
I honestly didn’t know 
what was wrong. 


21:20.195 --> 21:23.465
It wasn’t like I was doing 
anything bad.


21:23.465 --> 21:25.467
I thought, 


21:25.467 --> 21:28.000
‘Maybe I’m just tired.’


21:31.138 --> 21:34.000
But it wasn’t getting better. 


21:36.010 --> 21:39.982
I tried to assess
what was going on with myself. 


21:39.982 --> 21:43.119
I felt love for Jehovah. 


21:43.118 --> 21:45.720
I felt love for the congregation, 


21:45.720 --> 21:49.623
but I felt unmotivated in my service. 


21:49.623 --> 21:53.000
I felt like something was missing.


22:03.972 --> 22:06.675
As my enthusiasm waned, 


22:06.675 --> 22:10.000
my meeting attendance suffered too. 


22:14.850 --> 22:19.000
Thankfully, the loving elders 
in my congregation noticed, 


22:21.857 --> 22:24.000
and help was on the way.


22:28.397 --> 22:32.000
The brothers visited 
to see how I was doing. 


22:35.170 --> 22:39.673
They really listened to me, 


22:39.673 --> 22:43.911
and they asked about 
my spiritual routine.


22:43.912 --> 22:45.847
Well, I read the Bible every day, 


22:45.847 --> 22:50.252
but, I admitted, 
I’m not a natural study person. 


22:50.252 --> 22:54.122
They reminded me 
about the example of Mary, 


22:54.122 --> 22:56.124
Jesus’ mother.


22:56.123 --> 22:58.460
At first, I didn’t see the link, 


22:58.460 --> 23:02.000
but as we read from the Bible, 
it became more clear.


23:12.040 --> 23:16.945
Mary was known  
for being a faithful woman. 


23:16.945 --> 23:20.000
But what kept her faith strong?


23:27.755 --> 23:31.793
The Bible account said 
that Mary paid careful attention 


23:31.793 --> 23:34.996
to words that had 
deep spiritual meaning 


23:34.997 --> 23:37.799
and later took time to meditate, 


23:37.798 --> 23:41.000
“drawing conclusions in her heart.”


23:48.243 --> 23:51.580
By meditating on spiritual things, 


23:51.580 --> 23:55.000
Mary strengthened her faith 
and zeal for serving Jehovah.


24:00.955 --> 24:02.890
I understand now. 


24:02.890 --> 24:07.162
I was reading spiritual food, 
but I wasn’t taking time to digest it, 


24:07.162 --> 24:09.799
so it wasn’t sinking 
down into my heart.


24:09.798 --> 24:13.601
As a result, 
I was on a direct path 


24:13.602 --> 24:17.339
to spiritual burnout 
if I didn’t change something quick!


24:17.338 --> 24:21.275
I began by taking control 
of my busy schedule. 


24:21.275 --> 24:25.980
I made it a priority 
to start my day with Bible reading. 


24:25.980 --> 24:28.983
I sought out quiet places 


24:28.983 --> 24:32.153
where I could meditate on what I read.


24:32.153 --> 24:35.223
Meaningful Bible study reinvigorated 


24:35.223 --> 24:38.000
my passion for serving Jehovah, 


24:39.727 --> 24:41.797
and prayerful meditation 


24:41.797 --> 24:44.000
helped me to refocus.


24:48.670 --> 24:51.907
Over time, 
making these changes 


24:51.907 --> 24:55.000
helped me to find joy 
in my service to Jehovah again.


25:03.718 --> 25:06.921
The Bible says when we make time 


25:06.922 --> 25:10.592
to read and meditate on spiritual things, 


25:10.592 --> 25:15.530
we will become 
“like a tree planted by streams of water,” 


25:15.530 --> 25:18.733
with foliage that never withers. 


25:18.733 --> 25:23.000
And everything we do will succeed.


25:28.175 --> 25:32.447
Did you notice that our sister 
read the Bible every day? 


25:32.447 --> 25:37.852
But that alone did not give her 
the spiritual sustenance she needed. 


25:37.852 --> 25:41.924
We don’t want our Bible reading 
to become an automatic process. 


25:41.923 --> 25:45.926
What does that mean
—automatic process? 


25:45.927 --> 25:50.465
Well, breathing, walking, 
or perhaps, riding a bicycle 


25:50.465 --> 25:53.935
are things many can do 
without even thinking. 


25:53.935 --> 25:57.072
They become automatic processes. 


25:57.072 --> 26:00.609
To some extent, 
this is also true of reading.


26:00.608 --> 26:04.811
So, what can help us 
develop the art of meditation? 


26:04.812 --> 26:07.182
When you finish reading a passage, 


26:07.182 --> 26:10.619
you might pause 
and ponder over what you have just read 


26:10.618 --> 26:13.755
to be sure 
that you understand it correctly. 


26:13.755 --> 26:15.757
Ask yourself: 


26:15.757 --> 26:18.960
‘What does this 
teach me about Jehovah? 


26:18.960 --> 26:21.228
‘How can I apply this in my life? 


26:21.228 --> 26:25.166
Or how can I use this 
in my field ministry?’ 


26:25.167 --> 26:29.972
You should always make sure 
to apply what you read. 


26:29.972 --> 26:33.575
And remember, 
reading in a stress-free environment 


26:33.575 --> 26:37.378
with few distractions 
helps our concentration.


26:37.378 --> 26:40.448
But what if our attention span is short 


26:40.448 --> 26:43.518
and our mind starts to wander quickly? 


26:43.518 --> 26:46.186
Starting out with shorter study sessions 


26:46.187 --> 26:50.125
and gradually lengthening them 
have helped some. 


26:50.125 --> 26:53.595
Our goal should be to linger in study, 


26:53.595 --> 26:55.797
not to rush through it. 


26:55.797 --> 27:00.000
That’s when our spiritual food 
becomes the refreshment we need.


27:01.703 --> 27:05.306
Some excellent tools 
when meditating are the illustrations 


27:05.307 --> 27:09.710
and photographs 
we find in our publications. 


27:09.710 --> 27:14.182
Take the Bible account 
found in Daniel chapter 5 as an example. 


27:14.182 --> 27:18.119
It reads: “That very night 


27:18.118 --> 27:21.555
“Belshazzar 
the Chaldean king was killed. 


27:21.555 --> 27:25.027
“And Darius the Mede 
received the kingdom; 


27:25.027 --> 27:28.564
he was about 62 years old.”


27:28.563 --> 27:33.066
Using other scriptures 
that provide additional details, 


27:33.067 --> 27:36.070
including prophecies about the event, 


27:36.070 --> 27:39.007
the Art Department 
at world headquarters 


27:39.007 --> 27:43.945
was able to paint a vivid picture 
of what it may have been like that night, 


27:43.945 --> 27:47.948
when the Medo-Persian soldiers 
waded through the Euphrates River 


27:47.948 --> 27:52.986
and entered the city of Babylon 
through its open gates. 


27:52.987 --> 27:57.259
Now, we know that looking up 
illustrations in our literature 


27:57.258 --> 28:00.328
can be a helpful tool when meditating. 


28:00.328 --> 28:03.063
But why is that the case? 


28:03.063 --> 28:08.000
Let’s go behind the scenes 
of the Art Department and find out.


28:13.608 --> 28:16.610
A visual aid often makes 
a clearer 


28:16.610 --> 28:21.000
or more lasting impression 
on the mind than does the spoken word.


28:24.852 --> 28:27.822
Under the direction 
of the Writing Committee, 


28:27.822 --> 28:29.890
the Art Department 
has enjoyed 


28:29.890 --> 28:33.093
the privilege of designing 
and illustrating Bible literature 


28:33.093 --> 28:35.563
for almost 40 years.


28:35.563 --> 28:40.301
The department was established 
sometime before 1976.


28:40.302 --> 28:42.504
But a small team of artists 


28:42.503 --> 28:46.673
had been working 
on illustrations and typography 


28:46.673 --> 28:50.000
from as far back 
as the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”


28:52.480 --> 28:57.385
The work of publishing Bible literature 
has seen many changes. 


28:57.385 --> 29:01.555
Now there are EPUBs, interactive PDFs, 


29:01.555 --> 29:05.227
Web design, and HTML content, 


29:05.227 --> 29:09.264
all of which require new skills


29:09.263 --> 29:11.431
as well as close collaboration 


29:11.432 --> 29:14.000
with many other Bethel departments.


29:15.403 --> 29:19.106
The Art Department 
is structured into teams. 


29:19.107 --> 29:22.910
Each team is made up 
of designers, photographers, 


29:22.910 --> 29:26.247
illustrators, prop and set makers, 


29:26.247 --> 29:29.084
costume and makeup artists, 


29:29.083 --> 29:32.000
as well as production workers.


29:33.253 --> 29:35.690
The team lead and the scheduler 
work directly 


29:35.690 --> 29:39.893
with the Writing Department contact 
known as a compiler.


29:39.893 --> 29:42.763
After receiving 
an early version of the text, 


29:42.763 --> 29:44.765
the three brothers discuss 


29:44.765 --> 29:47.968
the purpose 
and possible look of the design. 


29:47.968 --> 29:50.738
All on the team 
are invited to collaborate 


29:50.738 --> 29:52.706
as concepts are developed. 


29:52.707 --> 29:57.000
Each member contributes 
to the overall design of a project.


29:59.213 --> 30:01.415
Before any production work is started, 


30:01.415 --> 30:05.000
concepts are sketched and developed.


30:06.988 --> 30:09.623
These sketches become a blueprint 


30:09.623 --> 30:13.293
that helps the team 
understand the concept, 


30:13.293 --> 30:16.296
plan the resources, 


30:16.297 --> 30:20.000
and ensure 
that the project stays on track.


30:23.772 --> 30:26.240
Who is the target audience? 


30:26.240 --> 30:29.910
How will this publication be used?


30:29.910 --> 30:33.000
The design should be clear and simple. 


30:36.350 --> 30:39.000
And it needs to work in all languages. 


30:40.020 --> 30:43.000
This is no small task.


30:44.825 --> 30:47.162
When the design is ready, 


30:47.162 --> 30:50.432
the compiler presents a mock-up 
of the publication 


30:50.432 --> 30:52.434
to the Writing Committee. 


30:52.433 --> 30:56.000
The committee reviews the design 
and makes any needed adjustments. 


30:57.872 --> 31:02.000
After the concept is approved, 
production begins.


31:03.778 --> 31:06.846
Around the world, 
there are many photographers 


31:06.847 --> 31:10.000
who work part-time to assist 
in providing images. 


31:12.320 --> 31:15.457
Photographs are also taken in our studio 


31:15.457 --> 31:18.627
and other locations. 


31:18.627 --> 31:23.000
These images help give our publications 
an international look.


31:27.568 --> 31:29.000
Accuracy is vital. 


31:30.672 --> 31:34.000
A researcher provides 
historical references and inspiration.


31:36.143 --> 31:40.381
Hair, makeup, and costumes 


31:40.382 --> 31:44.000
are designed to depict 
the time period and region.


31:45.185 --> 31:48.757
Props, set design, and lighting 


31:48.757 --> 31:51.892
provide the right look and setting.


31:51.892 --> 31:53.895
When combined, 


31:53.895 --> 31:56.230
each element helps tell the story  


31:56.230 --> 31:59.000
and capture the imagination of the viewer.


32:00.268 --> 32:03.403
Sets are also built in 3D programs. 


32:03.403 --> 32:06.941
They can be used as art source 


32:06.942 --> 32:09.000
or as final illustrations.


32:18.452 --> 32:22.924
Whether painted digitally 
or with traditional materials, 


32:22.923 --> 32:25.460
the artist renders the illustration 


32:25.460 --> 32:29.000
in a style suited for its final use.


32:32.267 --> 32:35.470
When design meets illustration, 


32:35.470 --> 32:38.000
infographics are born.


32:42.710 --> 32:45.547
After final approval 
by the Writing Committee, 


32:45.547 --> 32:47.782
files are sent to the printeries 


32:47.782 --> 32:52.000
and to the website 
or used to create other digital versions.


32:54.088 --> 32:59.093
In order to reach the hearts of those 
who read a Bible-based publication, 


32:59.093 --> 33:03.000
hands and hearts 
have to be involved in its creation.


33:04.732 --> 33:07.069
Those of us in the Art Department 


33:07.068 --> 33:12.000
consider it a privilege to give support 
to the most urgent of all work


33:13.373 --> 33:15.000
—preaching the good news.


33:28.188 --> 33:31.058
Did you notice 
the answer to our question, 


33:31.058 --> 33:35.863
Why can looking up illustrations 
in our literature be helpful? 


33:35.863 --> 33:39.333
As the narrator said, “A visual aid 


33:39.333 --> 33:43.203
“often makes a clearer 
or more lasting impression on the mind 


33:43.203 --> 33:45.506
than does the spoken word.” 


33:45.507 --> 33:47.509
But on top of that, 


33:47.508 --> 33:50.845
illustrations 
can help a story come alive. 


33:50.845 --> 33:54.548
They help us 
envision an event before our eyes 


33:54.548 --> 33:58.285
and thus deepen our appreciation 
for Bible truths 


33:58.285 --> 34:00.955
and ultimately for Jehovah God. 


34:00.955 --> 34:05.427
While illustrations and photographs 
can be a great complement, 


34:05.427 --> 34:08.764
it’s the written Word, God’s Word, 


34:08.763 --> 34:11.000
that is the source 
of the spiritual food.


34:13.233 --> 34:17.738
But what if we face a situation 
in which we have access to nothing? 


34:17.738 --> 34:20.575
We are not allowed 
to have a Bible, 


34:20.575 --> 34:23.177
no literature with illustrations, 


34:23.177 --> 34:26.680
no videos, 
and no audio recordings. 


34:26.680 --> 34:28.783
What do we do? 


34:28.783 --> 34:32.253
Our recollection 
of what we have read in the past 


34:32.253 --> 34:35.723
can keep our spirituality intact. 


34:35.723 --> 34:39.893
One of our brothers from Russia 
faced such a situation. 


34:39.893 --> 34:42.000
Notice what helped him.


34:48.335 --> 34:51.972
The year was 1963.


34:51.972 --> 34:54.000
I was 36 at the time. 


34:56.443 --> 35:00.213
The KGB searched my home 
and found some Bible literature 


35:00.213 --> 35:04.818
and some publishers’ field service reports. 


35:04.818 --> 35:07.688
So I was sentenced 
to five years of imprisonment 


35:07.688 --> 35:10.190
for being an organizer. 


35:10.190 --> 35:14.995
That was the third time 
I had been imprisoned.


35:14.995 --> 35:17.698
Some brothers and sisters 
and I went to the court 


35:17.698 --> 35:20.868
to support Brother Vladimir. 


35:20.868 --> 35:23.570
When he saw us, 
he clasped his hands 


35:23.570 --> 35:27.000
and declared, 
“Everything is fine!” 


35:29.943 --> 35:32.111
A KGB officer told me 


35:32.112 --> 35:34.649
that the only reason 
I hadn’t been imprisoned 


35:34.648 --> 35:36.716
was because I had six children. 


35:36.717 --> 35:38.719
But Vladimir was single.


35:38.718 --> 35:41.721
I was just glad 
that they had arrested me and not him, 


35:41.722 --> 35:44.000
because I didn’t have a family. 


35:48.897 --> 35:53.134
In the camp, I didn’t have a Bible 
or any Bible literature at all. 


35:53.133 --> 35:57.000
All I had to keep me going 
was the knowledge I already had.


35:58.138 --> 36:01.008
We prayed for him, 
and we sent greetings 


36:01.008 --> 36:04.000
and encouraging messages 
to him through his relatives.


36:05.478 --> 36:07.615
Due to the strict censorship 
in the camp,


36:07.615 --> 36:10.483
we were not allowed 
to write anything spiritual in our letters 


36:10.483 --> 36:12.520
to encourage each other. 


36:12.520 --> 36:16.000
If we did, 
the letters were confiscated. 


36:17.425 --> 36:22.000
But I really wanted to send Brother Mikhail 
something encouraging. 


36:24.132 --> 36:26.867
I was growing flowers 
with a group of inmates in the camp. 


36:26.867 --> 36:28.970
So instead of a sending him a letter, 


36:28.970 --> 36:32.000
I decided to send him 
a bouquet of flowers.


36:35.175 --> 36:38.378
Vladimir’s sister Olga came to our home, 


36:38.378 --> 36:43.000
and she brought me a beautiful bouquet 
of flowers from Vladimir. 


36:47.588 --> 36:51.691
I couldn’t believe 
that I had received fresh flowers 


36:51.692 --> 36:56.000
from behind a barbed-wire fence
—from inside the camp. 


36:57.030 --> 36:59.600
I was so touched 
by his act of kindness 


36:59.600 --> 37:02.303
that my heart moved me 
to write down some verses, 


37:02.303 --> 37:06.000
a poem, 
which I called “The Bouquet.”


37:08.608 --> 37:11.878
My relatives came 
and visited me in the prison 


37:11.878 --> 37:14.848
and delivered to me the poem. 


37:14.848 --> 37:17.718
I kept the poem 
in a very secret place. 


37:17.718 --> 37:19.720
It could have been confiscated, 


37:19.720 --> 37:23.000
and I could have been punished 
because it was about God.


37:24.425 --> 37:27.428
After Vladimir was released from prison, 


37:27.428 --> 37:31.498
well, he told me that my poem 
had really strengthened him 


37:31.498 --> 37:33.633
and that he had often taken it out 


37:33.633 --> 37:37.000
of its secret hiding place 
to read it over and over again.


37:39.273 --> 37:42.310
If it hadn’t been for the support 
I received from Jehovah 


37:42.310 --> 37:44.312
and the prayers of friends, 


37:44.312 --> 37:47.000
it would have been much harder 
for me to serve my time. 


37:48.715 --> 37:52.152
The poem that I had received 
helped me not to feel 


37:52.152 --> 37:54.155
separated from my friends 


37:54.155 --> 37:57.000
and, most importantly, 
from Jehovah.


37:59.660 --> 38:02.262
So many years have now gone by. 


38:02.262 --> 38:05.734
But we have remained firm 
through the difficult times, 


38:05.733 --> 38:08.000
and we continue serving Jehovah. 


38:11.705 --> 38:15.375
Lately, Vladimir and I have been trying 
to keep in touch by phone, 


38:15.375 --> 38:19.113
but we haven’t seen each other 
for seven years. 


38:19.113 --> 38:22.000
I would really love 
to see Vladimir again.


38:24.752 --> 38:27.000
He doesn’t know 
that I’ve decided to go and visit him. 


38:28.322 --> 38:31.000
I hope that he likes the surprise.


39:04.158 --> 39:07.160
“I see these flowers, 
grown by hands


39:07.160 --> 39:09.997
“Hardened from work 
that prison demands.


39:09.997 --> 39:12.265
“My friend has sent a bouquet.


39:12.265 --> 39:14.902
“Prison three times 
prevented our meeting,


39:14.902 --> 39:18.705
“But you found a way 
to convey a greeting.


39:18.705 --> 39:21.642
“My joy now moves me to say:


39:21.642 --> 39:24.645
“‘Greetings, my brother, 
with all of my heart.


39:24.645 --> 39:27.782
“‘You gave me strength, 
although we’re apart.


39:27.782 --> 39:30.819
“‘While you have 
countless trials withstood,


39:30.818 --> 39:33.986
“‘You’ve strengthened me 
as best you could.


39:33.987 --> 39:37.392
“‘Greetings, my friend 
on that narrow road,


39:37.392 --> 39:40.729
“‘You were always with me 
through hardships untold.


39:40.728 --> 39:43.896
“‘We worked so hard 
for spiritual treasure.


39:43.897 --> 39:47.469
“‘Blessed we were 
for sticking together.


39:47.468 --> 39:50.971
“‘Cruelly, my friend, 
you were taken from me


39:50.972 --> 39:53.674
“‘When they tried 
to break our integrity.


39:53.673 --> 39:57.110
“‘But God stood by us 
and helped us to cope.


39:57.110 --> 40:02.382
“‘Conquer the evil, we did, 
for our dear Kingdom hope.


40:02.382 --> 40:05.820
“‘How grateful we are 
and always will be


40:05.820 --> 40:09.123
“‘For spiritual vision 
 by which we can see


40:09.123 --> 40:12.960
“‘The crown of life 
promised to those


40:12.960 --> 40:16.330
“‘Who stay on the loyal course 
they chose.


40:16.330 --> 40:19.733
“‘How much you’ve endured, 
long-suffering friend.


40:19.733 --> 40:22.736
“‘But Jehovah’s mercy 
will never end.


40:22.737 --> 40:25.840
“‘On a paradise earth 
our hands will unite,


40:25.840 --> 40:29.343
“‘Planting more flowers 
to gladden His sight.


40:29.343 --> 40:33.013
“‘Christ Jesus will heal us 
during his reign,


40:33.013 --> 40:36.250
“‘So no trace of sin 
will ever remain.


40:36.250 --> 40:39.052
“‘And far from the trials 
that we overcame,


40:39.052 --> 40:43.000
Forever we’ll praise 
Jehovah’s great name!’”


40:48.895 --> 40:51.898
True friends are such a blessing 
from Jehovah, 


40:51.898 --> 40:55.000
and you don’t really know 
who they are until disaster strikes.


41:00.540 --> 41:04.945
During my whole life, 
walking in the way of the truth, 


41:04.945 --> 41:09.850
I have often thought 
about the words of Psalm 119:63, 


41:09.850 --> 41:11.452
where it says: 


41:11.452 --> 41:13.954
“I am a friend of all who fear you 


41:13.953 --> 41:16.456
and of those who keep your orders.”


41:16.457 --> 41:20.027
Our serving side by side 
in the Kingdom work 


41:20.027 --> 41:23.000
has strengthened our friendship.


41:25.900 --> 41:29.000
It is only that sort of friendship 
that will last forever!


41:35.877 --> 41:38.245
What a beautiful friendship! 


41:38.245 --> 41:42.983
Our brotherhood truly is 
a blessing from Jehovah. 


41:42.983 --> 41:47.855
Brother Mikhail Savitsky spent many years 
as a circuit overseer,


41:47.855 --> 41:52.258
helping the Kingdom work progress 
in Siberia, northern Caucasus, 


41:52.258 --> 41:55.528
and the countries 
of Georgia and Armenia. 


41:55.528 --> 42:00.233
In 1992, he had the privilege 
of being one of those 


42:00.233 --> 42:05.000
who signed the documents that confirmed 
legal recognition of our work in Russia. 


42:06.407 --> 42:09.009
However, we regret to inform you 


42:09.008 --> 42:12.078
that some time 
after this segment was produced, 


42:12.078 --> 42:15.781
Brother Vladimir Varkholik 
fell asleep in death. 


42:15.782 --> 42:17.785
He was 88 years old 


42:17.785 --> 42:21.655
and had served Jehovah faithfully 
for over 59 years. 


42:21.655 --> 42:23.657
At the time of his death, 


42:23.657 --> 42:26.894
he had served as a pioneer 
for some 26 years 


42:26.893 --> 42:31.598
and as an elder 
in the congregation for 43 years. 


42:31.598 --> 42:35.701
From his interview, 
you can clearly see the faith 


42:35.702 --> 42:40.674
that kept his spirituality strong 
through 12 years of imprisonment. 


42:40.673 --> 42:44.176
And he is a good example for us. 


42:44.177 --> 42:49.149
Did you notice one aspect 
of his circumstances while incarcerated? 


42:49.148 --> 42:51.218
He said: 


42:51.218 --> 42:54.421
“In the camp, 
I didn’t have a Bible 


42:54.422 --> 42:56.757
“or any Bible literature at all. 


42:56.757 --> 42:59.059
“All I had to keep me going 


42:59.058 --> 43:01.461
was the knowledge I already had.” 


43:01.462 --> 43:03.697
That could happen to us. 


43:03.697 --> 43:07.300
When persecution starts, 
we need to be prepared. 


43:07.300 --> 43:10.670
That’s one reason 
why it is so important 


43:10.670 --> 43:13.173
not to neglect 
our study of the Bible 


43:13.173 --> 43:15.241
while we have the opportunity.


43:15.242 --> 43:18.679
Now, back to David.


43:18.678 --> 43:23.050
Thanks, Rocky. 
We’re truly sorry to hear about Vladimir. 


43:23.050 --> 43:27.387
But one thing is certain, 
we know that Jehovah God will not forget 


43:27.387 --> 43:30.790
the love that he showed for His name. 


43:30.790 --> 43:34.160
That was a moving interview indeed.


43:34.160 --> 43:36.163
Well, back in June, 


43:36.163 --> 43:40.366
a number of new Kingdom songs 
were released electronically, 


43:40.367 --> 43:44.305
but one was missing—number 151. 


43:44.305 --> 43:46.440
Now, you noticed that, didn’t you? 


43:46.440 --> 43:51.445
I know you did because nothing escapes 
the eagle eyes of you brothers and sisters. 


43:51.445 --> 43:54.582
Well, here it is, number 151. 


43:54.582 --> 43:58.219
It’s entitled 
“The Revealing of God’s Sons.” 


43:58.218 --> 44:01.155
And it reminds us 
that the time is getting near 


44:01.155 --> 44:04.425
when the anointed 
will hear the final call. 


44:04.425 --> 44:07.000
Let’s listen.


44:16.037 --> 44:25.912
The time is near when God reveals
His faithful chosen ones.


44:25.912 --> 44:35.222
In heaven they will rule with Christ
As mighty spirit sons.


44:35.222 --> 44:45.099
The sons of God will be revealed
Along with Christ, their Lord.


44:45.098 --> 44:56.543
They’ll join him in his victory
And share in his reward.


44:56.543 --> 45:06.520
And soon the last remaining ones
Will hear his final call.


45:06.520 --> 45:15.895
The King of kings and Lord of lords
Will then collect them all.


45:15.895 --> 45:25.905
The sons of God will be revealed
Along with Christ, their Lord.


45:25.905 --> 45:37.250
They’ll join him in his victory
And share in his reward.


45:37.250 --> 45:47.193
And then with Christ, these sons of God
Will wage the final war.


45:47.193 --> 45:56.703
The joyous marriage to the Lamb
Will last forevermore.


45:56.703 --> 46:06.746
The sons of God will be revealed
Along with Christ, their Lord.


46:06.747 --> 46:17.000
They’ll join him in his victory
And share in his reward.


46:18.925 --> 46:21.162
Don’t you think that was 
a beautiful song, Rocky?


46:21.162 --> 46:22.162
Absolutely!


46:22.162 --> 46:24.364
That was one beautiful song. 


46:24.363 --> 46:27.766
You know, I really do appreciate 
the Watchtower chorus. 


46:27.767 --> 46:30.637
Only two or three of them 
have professional training, 


46:30.637 --> 46:34.040
and the rest have got where they are 
just through hard work. 


46:34.040 --> 46:36.843
So this is something 
that all of us can keep in mind. 


46:36.843 --> 46:39.846
Practice, practice, practice singing. 


46:39.847 --> 46:42.000
And then when you 
get to the Kingdom Hall, sing out.


46:43.517 --> 46:48.122
And it’s a very timely song, 
considering how close we are to the end. 


46:48.122 --> 46:52.860
And I’m sure all of you agree that the closer
we are to the end of this system of things, 


46:52.860 --> 46:55.995
the more work there is 
in the field ministry. 


46:55.995 --> 47:01.000
But there are individuals whom we 
rarely find home due to their secular work. 


47:01.000 --> 47:04.872
In Europe, our brothers 
and sisters have found a way 


47:04.872 --> 47:07.000
to reach one such group.


47:16.283 --> 47:20.720
Every year, thousands of truck drivers 
from all over the world 


47:20.720 --> 47:23.000
crisscross the European continent.


47:24.858 --> 47:28.195
They work hard to make ends meet 
for their families 


47:28.195 --> 47:31.000
but often have to spend 
weeks away from home.


47:32.698 --> 47:36.836
Jesus and his apostles 
approached people wherever they were. 


47:36.837 --> 47:39.000
It is this same spirit 
that must motivate us.


47:40.807 --> 47:44.477
By trying to reach truck drivers 
wherever they can be found, 


47:44.477 --> 47:47.847
we can make sure 
that everyone receives a witness, 


47:47.847 --> 47:50.317
even those who would 
otherwise be missed.


47:50.317 --> 47:54.187
We live in the Rotterdam area 
which has a lot of truck traffic. 


47:54.187 --> 47:57.290
We cover our regular territory 
once every three months, 


47:57.290 --> 48:00.000
while these truck drivers 
are hardly ever reached.


48:02.095 --> 48:06.833
We noticed that 300,000 trucks 
crossed France every year. 


48:06.833 --> 48:09.301
Thus, it was necessary to explore 


48:09.302 --> 48:12.000
this formidable potential for the ministry.


48:14.340 --> 48:16.410
Many truck drivers use truck stops 


48:16.410 --> 48:19.212
to take a short break
or even spend the night there. 


48:19.212 --> 48:22.000
That’s ideal for preaching.


48:26.218 --> 48:29.421
While we are parked here, resting, 


48:29.422 --> 48:32.725
we are cleaning the trucks; 


48:32.725 --> 48:36.663
we are washing our clothes 
because there is no laundry here; 


48:36.663 --> 48:39.000
and also we do our cooking.


48:44.403 --> 48:46.873
One day on my way to France, 


48:46.873 --> 48:49.541
I had to stop in Austria 


48:49.542 --> 48:52.212
to swap drivers. 


48:52.212 --> 48:56.115
My colleague went to the bathroom, 
and I was alone. 


48:56.115 --> 49:00.000
At that moment, a Witness came 
and offered me a magazine.


49:02.622 --> 49:07.000
Much effort is being put into reaching 
truck drivers in an organized way.


49:08.895 --> 49:10.930
We made sure all truck stops 
were mapped 


49:10.930 --> 49:13.667
and organized schedules so that pioneers 


49:13.667 --> 49:16.000
can preach in this territory 
at least once a day.


49:19.372 --> 49:23.000
Publishers will encounter 
many different nationalities and languages.


49:25.378 --> 49:27.880
The language barrier 
is one of the biggest challenges. 


49:27.880 --> 49:29.917
On any given morning, 
you can encounter 


49:29.917 --> 49:33.000
up to ten different languages: 
Romanian, Russian, Polish.


49:36.155 --> 49:39.592
When I looked at the magazine, 
I saw that it was a Watchtower, 


49:39.592 --> 49:41.629
but I thought it was in German. 


49:41.628 --> 49:46.131
I told this brother 
that I did not speak German. 


49:46.132 --> 49:50.470
Then he had a look at my license plate 
and saw that it was Romanian. 


49:50.470 --> 49:53.073
He again offered me 
the magazine and told me: 


49:53.073 --> 49:56.175
“It is Romanian. 
It is for you.” 


49:56.175 --> 49:59.312
When I saw it, 
I was very happy. 


49:59.312 --> 50:02.000
I took the magazine 
and was very glad.


50:05.352 --> 50:08.622
Of course, we don’t speak in tongues 
like the first-century Christians did. 


50:08.622 --> 50:12.000
But jw.org makes us feel like 
we can preach in any language.


50:16.797 --> 50:20.700
We need to go further 
than just distributing publications. 


50:20.700 --> 50:23.637
We need to be real teachers, 
and to do that, 


50:23.637 --> 50:26.000
we can make use of the videos.


50:30.577 --> 50:34.280
A driver had his Bible 
wide open on his dashboard 


50:34.280 --> 50:39.000
and literally cried when he watched 
the video Why Study the Bible?


50:41.455 --> 50:44.000
Since truck drivers spend 
most of their time on the road, 


50:45.425 --> 50:50.000
it is a real challenge to follow up 
on those who have shown any interest.


50:52.165 --> 50:55.768
It’s very difficult to do return visits 
or to start Bible studies. 


50:55.768 --> 50:58.838
You just don’t know when you will meet 
a truck driver again. 


50:58.838 --> 51:02.000
So we try to get their e-mail addresses 
as soon as possible.


51:06.947 --> 51:08.682
The results were remarkable. 


51:08.682 --> 51:11.685
For example, in the last service year, 


51:11.685 --> 51:14.287
about 100,000 magazines were placed, 


51:14.287 --> 51:17.257
100 Bible studies were started, 


51:17.257 --> 51:21.000
and 4,000 videos were shown.


51:23.430 --> 51:26.667
Experience shows 
that even if it’s not possible 


51:26.667 --> 51:28.669
to obtain an e-mail address, 


51:28.668 --> 51:33.000
the slightest witness given 
can have a great impact.


51:34.340 --> 51:37.210
In time, I returned to Romania. 


51:37.210 --> 51:41.080
I started a Bible study, 
progressed spiritually, got married, 


51:41.080 --> 51:43.350
and now I am 
an unbaptized publisher. 


51:43.350 --> 51:47.000
The brother that first 
contacted me has no idea.


51:49.122 --> 51:51.725
Hebrews 6:11 invites us all 


51:51.725 --> 51:54.000
‘to show industriousness’ in our ministry.


51:56.997 --> 51:59.065
The more you invest in 
this form of ministry, 


51:59.065 --> 52:04.000
the more fulfillment you get 
from the positive response of the drivers.


52:07.407 --> 52:10.810
It is a good thing 
to preach the good news at truck stops 


52:10.810 --> 52:14.347
because all drivers need to feel God’s love, 


52:14.347 --> 52:17.000
to see that God really cares for us. 


52:18.083 --> 52:22.000
And like me, 
they can make changes in their lives. 


52:25.558 --> 52:29.128
And they need to see that Jehovah 
 has promised a future paradise 


52:29.128 --> 52:31.196
and how this will affect them 


52:31.197 --> 52:34.000
and their families.


52:37.170 --> 52:40.773
What great results 
came from this preaching initiative, 


52:40.773 --> 52:42.841
and what a delight to see 


52:42.842 --> 52:46.714
how many of the publishers 
used our videos while witnessing! 


52:46.713 --> 52:49.715
Although videos can be great tools, 


52:49.715 --> 52:53.187
we all must continue 
to develop our teaching skills 


52:53.187 --> 52:57.524
and our ability to reason 
from the Scriptures. 


52:57.523 --> 53:00.793
The brothers witnessing 
at truck stops did just that, 


53:00.793 --> 53:03.996
and the results 
speak for themselves. 


53:03.997 --> 53:08.000
You will be happy to know that one 
of the truck drivers who was interviewed 


53:08.000 --> 53:10.603
Ion Bolbotina from Romania 


53:10.603 --> 53:14.706
was recently baptized 
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


53:14.707 --> 53:17.844
It is beautiful 
to see how our efforts 


53:17.843 --> 53:20.513
in the ministry 
are blessed by Jehovah.


53:20.513 --> 53:23.516
Sister Margarita Königer has seen 


53:23.517 --> 53:26.185
the growth of the Kingdom work 
all her life. 


53:26.185 --> 53:30.123
She has served 
as a missionary since 1966, 


53:30.123 --> 53:32.191
and we met her in Hungary, 


53:32.192 --> 53:36.000
where she has now served 
for about nine years.


59:11.030 --> 59:14.300
In the 50 years 
since she graduated from Gilead, 


59:14.300 --> 59:17.703
Sister Königer has learned 
seven languages 


59:17.703 --> 59:20.606
and has served 
in five different countries. 


59:20.607 --> 59:23.910
And recently, 
she received a new assignment


59:23.910 --> 59:27.413
—the Chinese field 
in Munich, Germany. 


59:27.413 --> 59:31.683
Daily reading 
and meditating on God’s Word, the Bible, 


59:31.683 --> 59:34.286
has given her 
the strength she needs 


59:34.287 --> 59:38.825
to continue with joy 
in her missionary assignment.


59:38.825 --> 59:41.627
The same is important 
if you’re young. 


59:41.627 --> 59:46.032
Taking the time 
to properly digest spiritual food, 


59:46.032 --> 59:50.970
by enhancing your Bible reading, 
can teach you to make good decisions. 


59:50.970 --> 59:55.908
For example, 
whom should you choose as friends? 


59:55.908 --> 59:58.745
Pay special attention to this music video 


59:58.745 --> 1:00:01.948
entitled Where I Belong, 


1:00:01.948 --> 1:00:05.000
which will help you choose 
the best friends possible.


1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:25.270
Now everyone, it seems to me,
Knows just the place he wants to be.


1:00:25.270 --> 1:00:35.113
I know what’s right; I know what’s wrong;
And, yes, I know where I belong.


1:00:35.113 --> 1:00:45.123
It feels so good, so good to know
Where I should be, where I should go


1:00:45.123 --> 1:00:54.966
To find good friends and company
Who build me up and care for me.


1:00:54.967 --> 1:01:04.410
Yes, here in my heart 
The feelings are strong.


1:01:04.410 --> 1:01:14.587
Jehovah, it’s you 
Who’ll help me get through


1:01:14.587 --> 1:01:22.000
And show me where I belong.


1:01:29.602 --> 1:01:38.845
My heart is sure, it’s clear to me,
I’m standing where I want to be.


1:01:38.845 --> 1:01:48.722
I read God’s Word. I make it live.
It moves my heart. What can I give?


1:01:48.722 --> 1:01:58.297
And now I know; yes, now I see
Where real friends are; that’s where I’ll be.


1:01:58.297 --> 1:02:07.907
They’re all I want; they’re family;
Jehovah’s gift with love to me.


1:02:07.907 --> 1:02:18.184
Yes, here in my heart
The feelings are strong.


1:02:18.183 --> 1:02:28.093
Jehovah, it’s you
Who’ll help me get through


1:02:28.093 --> 1:02:36.000
And show me where I belong.


1:02:43.308 --> 1:02:45.376
What a fine young man! 


1:02:45.377 --> 1:02:47.847
And he made the right decisions. 


1:02:47.847 --> 1:02:51.717
He decided he belongs 
in Jehovah’s organization. 


1:02:51.717 --> 1:02:54.054
And did you notice his habit? 


1:02:54.053 --> 1:02:57.223
He read the Bible regularly, 


1:02:57.223 --> 1:03:01.893
brought it with him on the trip, 
meditated about what he read


1:03:01.893 --> 1:03:06.031
—both after reading 
and also when out in the ministry. 


1:03:06.032 --> 1:03:10.837
He took the time to grasp 
the wonders of Jehovah’s creation, 


1:03:10.837 --> 1:03:13.505
and we need to do the same. 


1:03:13.505 --> 1:03:16.575
We need to enhance our Bible reading


1:03:16.575 --> 1:03:21.380
—visualize what we read 
and try to get the whole picture. 


1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:25.485
And the organization 
has given us many fine tools 


1:03:25.485 --> 1:03:27.620
to visualize our Bible reading, 


1:03:27.620 --> 1:03:32.425
such as the illustrations 
in our publications, audio dramas, 


1:03:32.425 --> 1:03:35.762
and dramatic Bible readings 
and videos. 


1:03:35.762 --> 1:03:38.297
Make full use of them, 


1:03:38.297 --> 1:03:41.767
and meditate about what you learn.


1:03:41.767 --> 1:03:45.470
Thanks, Rocky, 
I agree with everything you’ve said. 


1:03:45.470 --> 1:03:49.208
Well, as of September the 1st, 


1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:52.076
members of the Bethel family 
have been moving 


1:03:52.077 --> 1:03:56.915
from Brooklyn to our new headquarters 
at Warwick, New York. 


1:03:56.915 --> 1:04:00.987
Now, if you’re listening in from Britain, 
that’s Warwick to you. 


1:04:00.987 --> 1:04:05.324
Warwick or Warwick, it’s the same place. 
Tomato, tomato. 


1:04:05.323 --> 1:04:08.326
And we’re very, 
very happy about this move. 


1:04:08.327 --> 1:04:12.064
It’s a tremendous project 
to move the entire Bethel family 


1:04:12.063 --> 1:04:16.135
from Brooklyn to Warwick, 
and it’s going to take some time. 


1:04:16.135 --> 1:04:19.572
So we know you’re anxious 
to see the property in person, 


1:04:19.572 --> 1:04:23.509
but we’re not going to be able 
to get the property ready for tours 


1:04:23.508 --> 1:04:28.180
until April 3, 2017, that’s a Monday. 


1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:30.182
I’m going to repeat that. 


1:04:30.182 --> 1:04:32.852
We’re not going to be able 
to open for tours 


1:04:32.852 --> 1:04:37.000
until Monday, April 3, 2017. 


1:04:38.390 --> 1:04:42.762
Now, if you 
happen to be touring Wallkill 


1:04:42.762 --> 1:04:47.634
or Patterson between now and then, 
it’s going to be a mighty temptation 


1:04:47.633 --> 1:04:50.636
for you to tiptoe 
up to the property line in Warwick, 


1:04:50.637 --> 1:04:53.172
perhaps put some twigs 
and branches in your hat, 


1:04:53.172 --> 1:04:56.009
climb a tree, 
and see what you can see. 


1:04:56.008 --> 1:04:58.010
Please, don’t do it. 


1:04:58.010 --> 1:05:01.413
We’re working very hard 
to get everything ready for you. 


1:05:01.413 --> 1:05:03.950
We want everything to be just right 


1:05:03.950 --> 1:05:07.085
when the facility is open for tours. 


1:05:07.085 --> 1:05:09.122
And here’s another interesting thing: 


1:05:09.122 --> 1:05:12.124
You are going to be able 
to go online 


1:05:12.123 --> 1:05:14.460
and schedule a tour. 


1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:18.663
And so arrangements are being made 
with the congregations and the branches 


1:05:18.663 --> 1:05:20.933
so that they’re going to be able 
to do that. 


1:05:20.933 --> 1:05:23.000
So you’ll be able to avoid the rush.


1:05:24.203 --> 1:05:28.473
We also wanted to take the opportunity 
to mention that two new interviews 


1:05:28.473 --> 1:05:32.811
in the Viewpoints on the Origin of Life 
video series 


1:05:32.812 --> 1:05:34.814
have now been posted. 


1:05:34.813 --> 1:05:38.083
You may remember this series 
from the April program. 


1:05:38.083 --> 1:05:40.418
It’s about scientists 
who have concluded 


1:05:40.418 --> 1:05:44.690
that life did not come about 
by chance, but by design. 


1:05:44.690 --> 1:05:46.825
You will find these new interviews 


1:05:46.825 --> 1:05:50.362
in the “Interviews and Experiences” 
category, 


1:05:50.362 --> 1:05:53.865
under the “Origins of Life” heading.


1:05:53.865 --> 1:05:56.435
We’d like to conclude 
with these greetings 


1:05:56.435 --> 1:06:00.000
from northeastern Bolivia, 
in a region called Beni. 


1:06:01.407 --> 1:06:06.000
This area has a publisher ratio 
of 1 Witness to 426 people. 


1:06:07.145 --> 1:06:11.883
Their territory consists 
mainly of rivers and jungles. 


1:06:11.883 --> 1:06:15.020
The approximately 350 publishers 


1:06:15.020 --> 1:06:18.823
in the cities of Riberalta 
and Guayaramerín 


1:06:18.823 --> 1:06:22.293
need to be innovative to reach 
all corners of their territory. 


1:06:22.293 --> 1:06:24.296
For example, 


1:06:24.297 --> 1:06:27.800
under the direction of the local branch, 
a Witness pilot 


1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:30.903
flies brothers to isolated populations. 


1:06:30.903 --> 1:06:33.138
In other cases, some communities 


1:06:33.138 --> 1:06:35.606
located on the banks of rivers 
are reachable 


1:06:35.607 --> 1:06:37.610
only by boat. 


1:06:37.610 --> 1:06:41.313
Thus, preaching trips by boat 
are arranged from time to time. 


1:06:41.313 --> 1:06:44.483
Some trips last well over a month. 


1:06:44.483 --> 1:06:48.120
But some parts of the territory 
can be reached by motorcycle. 


1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:50.322
The brothers and sisters travel 


1:06:50.322 --> 1:06:53.000
up to four hours 
to cover such territories.


1:06:54.693 --> 1:06:59.631
The brothers and sisters in Beni 
send their warm love, and so do we, 


1:06:59.632 --> 1:07:02.902
to all of you around the world. 


1:07:02.902 --> 1:07:07.540
Rocky, I’d like to thank you for doing 
the heavy lifting for me during this program.


1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:09.275
You’re a good brother, 
you know that?


1:07:09.275 --> 1:07:10.275
My privilege.


1:07:10.275 --> 1:07:11.410
He’s a good brother. 


1:07:11.410 --> 1:07:14.080
And this is JW Broadcasting 


1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:26.577
in Brooklyn, New York.

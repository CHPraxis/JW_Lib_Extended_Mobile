00:00 Welcome to JW Broadcasting!
00:04 In this month’s program,  we’ll meet a brother who preaches
00:07 in the Indian Sign Language field.
00:09 What can we learn from his view  of the challenges he faces
00:12 in his assignment?
00:15 Jehovah’s sheep  belong to him.
00:17 This dramatization  shows a special way
00:20 that Jehovah uses shepherds  in the congregation
00:23 to care for his flock.
00:26 And have you witnessed
00:28 the life-changing moment  when someone
00:30 first learns God’s name?
00:33 We’ll see the results of this sister’s  lifelong search to know the true God.
00:38 This and much more is ahead
00:41 on the June 2016 edition
00:43 of JW Broadcasting!
01:04 Jehovah’s people have always considered  the studying of his Word
01:08 to be an essential part of life.
01:10 God’s Law to Israel commanded  that the king “must read from [the Law]
01:15 all the days of his life, so that he  may learn to fear Jehovah his God.”
01:20 In the Mayan territories  of Yucatán, Mexico,
01:23 our brothers are helping people  learn to read God’s Word for themselves.
01:28 People’s lives change when they  can finally read the Bible on their own
01:33 and more readily ‘learn  to fear Jehovah their God.’
01:47 One out of every six people on earth  doesn’t know how to read.
01:52 Jehovah’s Witnesses  around the world
01:54 have organized literacy classes  to help such ones.
02:02 I don’t like to read.
02:05 I used to sleep at the meetings.
02:14 In our territory,
02:16 most people speak the Mayan language,  but very few can read it.
02:21 On occasion I would give a talk,  and when I would
02:24 cite a scripture,  most of the audience would look it up.
02:27 But then I would see  a blank stare on their faces
02:30 because they  couldn’t read the text.
02:34 I was moved  to learn how to read
02:37 because I wanted to learn about Jehovah  and study his Word, the Bible.
02:43 So a sister came  to my house to teach me.
02:48 Literacy classes are often conducted  on an individual level.
02:52 After a person has had their Bible study,  they can spend some time
02:56 to practice reading skills.
02:59 But when  the local elders notice
03:03 that there are many  that can benefit from this training,
03:06 they can schedule  a larger class
03:09 at the Kingdom Hall.
03:11 The study material used  for this purpose is the brochure
03:14 Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing.
03:17 It’s available in 30 languages  in the Central America branch territory.
03:23 Other study materials can be used  as well, as long as they help
03:27 the development of the students  enrolled in the class.
03:32 And we use a board  on which we write,
03:34 for instance, words  that are difficult to pronounce.
03:37 This helps in the reading  of complicated words.
03:41 There are some who are,  well, very quick learners.
03:46 On the other hand,  others go word by word.
03:49 But as they practice,  they start getting the hang of it.
03:54 I’m good at masonry work,
03:57 but learning to read
04:01 is not easy.
04:03 Reading at his age  is a big challenge.
04:07 You need to understand  that each student learns differently.
04:11 With some,  you need to be very patient.
04:16 The first word  I learned to write was Jehovah.
04:20 “It’s like this,” I tell him.
04:22 He says, “It’s ‘cause  you’re not being patient with me!”
04:26 Having a sense of humor  is a big help in the learning process,
04:30 so as not to focus  on errors and mistakes.
04:34 Since 1946, when records  began being taken in Mexico,
04:38 more than 152,000 people  have learned to read and write,
04:42 thanks to these training efforts.
04:44 The Secretary of Public Education
04:46 in the State of Mexico  has recognized the work and the great help
04:50 these literacy classes  have been to the local citizens.
04:54 The skills they learn  help in their day-to-day life,
04:57 but also it helps them  to learn more about Jehovah
04:59 and to be able to teach others.
05:03 I used to have to memorize  everything I was going to say,
05:07 but now I can read
05:09 short scriptures to people  directly from the Bible.
05:15 As the students progress  in the class, they demonstrate
05:18 the words found  at 1 Timothy 4:15,
05:21 which says in part
05:24 “so that your advancement  may be plainly seen by all people.”
05:28 And these benefits  are plainly seen in the students.
05:33 My husband was an alcoholic,
05:35 he smoked,  and he used bad language.
05:38 But he made big changes  in his life,
05:41 and we see that this training  has been a big help.
05:45 We really see  these great blessings.
05:49 Reading helped me  to get baptized.
05:53 Helping other people  to improve their reading skills
05:58 makes me feel very happy.
06:00 I feel great because I see  on their face the joy they get
06:04 from reading and understanding  the information.
06:08 Well, I’ve benefited so much.
06:11 For instance,
06:13 now we read the Bible  together as a family.
06:17 It makes me very happy.
06:19 We’re more united as a family.
06:22 Our children  respect my husband more,
06:25 like the father he is.
06:30 Now I’m a ministerial servant.
06:32 When I go preaching  door to door,
06:36 some people say,  “I don’t know how to read.”
06:40 But then I tell them,
06:43 “I didn’t know either,  but I learned about Jehovah.
06:46 And you can too!”
06:51 If I learned to read,  anybody can.
07:14 Our theme for this month
07:17 is “Consider, Incite, and Encourage  One Another All the More So.”
07:22 JW Broadcasting
07:25 —why do we enjoy it so much?
07:28 Many of you have expressed  how the monthly broadcast draws you closer
07:33 to our brothers and sisters  and to Jehovah’s organization.
07:36 If you’re homebound or isolated,  you especially treasure these programs.
07:41 And yet, while we appreciate  the advances in technology
07:45 that have made all of this possible,  we know that your sincere desire
07:50 is to be present  with your brothers and sisters in person
07:53 at our congregation meetings.
07:55 Jehovah’s Witnesses  around the world share this feeling.
08:00 In northern Finland, for example,  winters are especially cold,
08:04 even by Finnish standards.
08:06 At times, temperatures plummet  to minus 50 degrees Celsius,
08:10 or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit!
08:13 Under those conditions,  it’s very difficult to drive,
08:16 much less walk long distances.
08:19 Still, the brothers love  to gather together.
08:22 How do they manage it?
08:24 In one small village, there is a brother  who lives near the Kingdom Hall
08:28 and has a warm garage.
08:31 On meeting nights, he uses his car
08:33 to bring each family  in the congregation to the hall.
08:36 Then he parks in his garage and runs  the short distance back to the Kingdom Hall.
08:41 When the meeting is over, he returns  all the friends safely to their homes.
08:46 In the Bible,  gatherings for pure worship
08:50 were occasions for personal association  with fellow believers.
08:54 Such association required travel  to a designated place.
08:58 This involved work,  sacrifice, even risk.
09:03 Consider what is stated  at Exodus 34:24.
09:08 This verse has to do with the command  that every Israelite male
09:13 should gather three times a year  for the festivals in Jerusalem.
09:17 What would that mean  in practical terms?
09:20 Wouldn’t the nation  be left vulnerable to attack
09:22 if no men were left  to guard the land?
09:25 And if word spread  among the surrounding nations
09:27 that practically everyone  congregated in Jerusalem
09:30 three times a year,  like clockwork, year after year,
09:34 wouldn’t it be just a matter of time  before some invading army
09:37 would come  and pillage an Israelite city?
09:40 At Exodus 34:24,
09:43 we find  Jehovah’s remarkable answer:
09:47 “For I will drive the nations  away from before you,
09:51 and I will enlarge your territory,  and nobody will desire,”
09:56 yes, even desire, “your land
09:59 “while you are going up to see  the face of Jehovah your God
10:03 three times a year.”
10:05 Jehovah kept that promise.
10:08 It’s a historical fact  that from 1513 B.C.E.
10:13 all the way down to 66 C.E.  no foreign nation ever came
10:18 to invade Israelite territory  during those three annual festivals.
10:23 Jehovah placed high value  on having his people
10:26 gather together  in the same space.
10:30 In the Christian era,  the apostle Paul wrote
10:33 at 1 Corinthians 14:23  about ‘the whole congregation
10:37 coming together to one place.’
10:40 Now, although modern broadcasting  technology didn’t exist in those days,
10:44 there were other viable methods  of communicating, such as writing letters,
10:49 that didn’t require people to be physically  present in the same location.
10:54 Still, the apostle John,  though a capable writer,
10:58 preferred face-to-face interchange  with fellow Christians
11:02 as he expressed  at 2 John 12.
11:06 Or consider what is stated
11:08 at Job 1:6:
11:11 “Now the day came  when the sons of the true God
11:16 entered to take their station  before Jehovah.”
11:19 Job 2:1 speaks  of another such day.
11:23 Just imagine!
11:25 Here Jehovah himself,
11:27 though having all conceivable methods  of communication at his disposal,
11:31 set specific days  for his spirit creatures in heaven
11:35 to assemble  in his immediate presence.
11:38 Clearly, the Scriptures encourage  regular personal association
11:43 with fellow servants of God.
11:45 Virtual attendance through modern  communication technology has value,
11:50 and we’re happy to use it,  but it’s no substitute for being together.
11:54 And why not?
11:56 Because of what association  with the congregation achieves.
12:00 It’s not just that we receive nutritious  and varied spiritual food.
12:04 Meetings inform us,  but so does JW Broadcasting.
12:08 Meetings encourage us,  but so does JW Broadcasting.
12:13 Fellow Christians who offer comments  and sing from the heart build us up,
12:18 and yet we can hear that also  on JW Broadcasting.
12:22 It’s when we’re together —all together in one place—
12:26 that others can hear us  and draw encouragement
12:28 from our heartfelt convictions,  our smile, our handshake.
12:33 Meetings give us opportunities  to show our brothers and sisters
12:37 that we esteem them  as worthy of our time,
12:41 attention, and concern.
12:44 That is why we go and visit our brothers  who are homebound or isolated
12:48 because we want to show them  that we love them.
12:52 Moreover, in a special way,
12:55 our meetings bring us  under the influence of holy spirit.
13:00 At Revelation 2:7,
13:03 the glorified Jesus said:
13:06 “Let the one  who has an ear hear
13:09 what the spirit says  to the congregations.”
13:14 We need that spirit  to help us resist temptation,
13:17 to embolden and equip us  for the ministry,
13:21 and to enable us  to make sound decisions.
13:24 Still, there’s a reason  to attend meetings
13:28 that’s even more important  than the pleasant company,
13:31 the peaceful atmosphere,  the genuine refreshment,
13:34 the sense of belonging,  the opportunities to give,
13:37 or even the fact that meetings  are a means by which
13:39 we receive  Jehovah’s holy spirit.
13:41 The key reason  why we gather together
13:44 is stated at Psalm 26:12:
13:48 “My foot is standing  on level ground;
13:52 in the great congregation,  I will praise Jehovah.”
13:57 Yes, the principal reason  why we gather together in person
14:01 is to give Jehovah what he deserves
14:04 —praise, glory, yes, worship.
14:08 Our meeting attendance  shows Jehovah
14:11 that we want to draw close  to him and his Son.
14:15 In his abundant love, Jehovah invites  many more to serve him and keep living.
14:19 Because he lives eternally,
14:21 Jehovah can nurture  those relationships forever.
14:25 The Adversary can offer  no such hope of endless life,
14:28 so he promotes selfishness,  pride, and other negative traits
14:31 that isolate people from one another,  even when they are in the same room,
14:34 engaged in the same activities.
14:37 In contrast, our great God  is drawing his people
14:41 closer to himself,  to his Son,
14:44 and to one another  so that we “may all be one,”
14:48 as Jesus prayed  as recorded at John 17:21.
14:52 And it’s not just the act  of converging
14:55 on the same location  that unites us either.
14:58 Lots of people coexist in the same space  when they go to a market,
15:02 attend a sporting event,  or use public transportation.
15:05 Crowding of itself  does not equate with unity.
15:09 What makes the true  Christian congregation different?
15:13 Notice how Hebrews chapter 10,
15:15 verses 24 and 25  answers this question.
15:19 Now here we find  the divinely inspired standard
15:23 for all our gatherings:
15:26 “And let us  consider one another so as to incite
15:30 “to love and fine works,  not forsaking our meeting together,
15:35 “as some have the custom,  but encouraging one another,
15:39 “and all the more so as you see
15:41 the day drawing near.”
15:44 Now, what does it mean  to “consider one another”?
15:48 What does it mean  “to incite to love and fine works”?
15:51 And in what way might we  ‘encourage one another’?
15:55 The verb “consider”  could also be rendered
15:59 “be concerned about;  pay attention to.”
16:02 So when  we “consider one another,”
16:04 we show interest  that goes far beyond a brief greeting.
16:08 And when we pay careful attention  to one another, we’re better prepared
16:11 to incite, that is, to motivate one another,  to stir one another to action.
16:16 And how might we do this?
16:19 Not by making comparisons  or shaming our brothers,
16:22 for that would hardly be  “encouraging one another,”
16:24 we endeavor to lift one another’s hearts  when we’re together.
16:28 And when we do this  to the best of our ability,
16:31 then we can be confident  that Jehovah’s spirit will do the rest,
16:35 and that our brothers  will feel strengthened.
16:38 It’s evident, then,  that true worship
16:40 means participation;  it requires a response.
16:45 Another noteworthy example of this  is the encouragement we both give
16:50 and receive when we sing together  with our brothers and sisters.
16:54 In ancient Israel,  at times they had a chorus,
16:58 such as the one described  in Nehemiah chapter 12
17:00 that we talked about  in our midweek meeting back in February.
17:03 Much of Israel’s group singing  was antiphonal,
17:07 that is, some of the singers  prompted others to respond.
17:12 For instance, Psalm 106  which begins and ends with the words
17:15 “Praise Jah!” or “Hallelujah!”
17:18 encouraged the people  to say in response: “Amen!”
17:23 Psalm 136 was written
17:26 to allow for different choruses  to answer one another.
17:30 Now just imagine  responding choruses
17:33 singing these alternating lines:
17:37 “Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;
17:40 “his loyal love endures forever.
17:44 “Give thanks to the God of gods,
17:46 “for his loyal love endures forever.
17:49 “Give thanks to the Lord of lords,
17:52 for his loyal love endures forever.”
17:55 And on it went for 26 verses!
17:58 To this day,  singing demonstrates
18:02 our heartfelt response  to the goodness of Jehovah.
18:06 What a joy it is to sing  in company with others who are moved
18:09 to pour out the depths  of their feelings to Jehovah!
18:13 And now at our Kingdom Halls,  we’re accompanied by orchestral renderings
18:17 of many of our songs —another reason to sing out
18:20 at our midweek and weekend meetings.
18:23 And speaking of the midweek meeting,  how are you enjoying the new format?
18:27 More of the program is devoted  to delving into the Bible itself.
18:31 Time spent on preparing us  for our public ministry
18:35 focuses more than ever  on situations we face in field service.
18:40 And the meetings move along  at a satisfying pace.
18:44 Yes, JW Broadcasting  is a wonderful blessing,
18:49 a powerful means to talk to  and fortify our brothers
18:53 around the world —simultaneously.
18:55 Still, nothing can replace  the experience
19:00 of worshipping Jehovah  in concert
19:02 with our fellow servants of God  at congregation meetings.
19:06 When a meeting concludes  and we lift our heads
19:10 after the final prayer,  we find ourselves surrounded
19:15 by others who love Jehovah  and support his sovereignty.
19:19 These important benefits  are detailed
19:22 in the April 2016  study article
19:25 “Why Should We Meet  Together for Worship?”
19:28 This month, we’re studying  that article worldwide.
19:31 Later, in October,  we begin a special campaign
19:35 to invite the public  to our meetings.
19:38 If you do not yet regularly associate  with Jehovah’s Witnesses
19:42 or if you travel away  from your congregation, use jw.org
19:46 to find a meeting you can attend.
19:49 Click: “About Us,” “Meetings,”
19:51 and “Find a Location Near You”
19:54 or simply scroll to the bottom
19:57 of any jw.org page
19:59 and click “Attend Our Meetings.”
20:02 At our meetings,  you’ll experience what it means
20:06 to consider, incite, and ‘encourage  one another all the more so
20:11 as we see  the day drawing near.’
20:15 We’ve discussed  vital ways we benefit
20:19 when we come together  for worship at Christian meetings.
20:22 What many notice
20:24 when they first attend meetings  of Jehovah’s Witnesses
20:28 is that they hear  God’s name, Jehovah.
20:32 In this life story,  Soten Yoeun relates the impact
20:36 that learning God’s name  had on her
20:39 after surviving  the killing fields of Cambodia.
20:45 On the killing fields  in Cambodia,
20:50 I prayed to God,
20:53 but I didn’t know his name.
21:05 When I was a very young girl,
21:08 they separated our family
21:10 and they put me  to work in the rice field
21:13 from five in the morning  till nine in the evening.
21:17 When you see  some other children that get killed,
21:21 you really desperately cry  for help inside.
21:26 You always think  that you are next.
21:29 But in my heart I always believed  that there had to be a true God
21:33 somewhere, somehow  that can help me get through this.
21:37 One year later,  my family decided to escape Cambodia.
21:43 We walk close to six  or seven months to Thailand.
21:50 And I have 20 brothers and sisters
21:55 —only 4 of us survived.
22:01 I have a blind aunt that holds  on my shoulder all the time.
22:06 But one day, we got caught.
22:12 As they start shooting,  I push my aunt down to the ground
22:17 and try to pretend  that we are dead.
22:20 And when I get up,
22:22 I had no idea  where my parent was.
22:28 We spent  many months in the jungle.
22:31 As I try to survive,
22:33 I eat whatever I can find,  and I also help my auntie to survive.
22:37 One day when I go  out to look for food,
22:41 I walked so far away
22:44 I couldn’t find my way back.
22:46 I start crying really hard  underneath a tree
22:50 and look up to the sky
22:53 and pray to the true God.
22:56 I was raised as a child  to pray to Buddhas.
23:00 But on this night
23:02 when I start praying,  I specifically said
23:06 that I’m not praying  to Buddha
23:09 —I’m praying  to the true God.
23:13 And I say,
23:15 “True God,  if you are really here,
23:18 “please help me
23:21 “because I am really scared
23:23 and I’m hungry  and I’m cold.”
23:27 After I pray, I just fall to sleep  under the big tree.
23:34 Eventually, I make it  into the refugee camp in Thailand,
23:38 and I was reunited  with my family.
23:41 We lived in the refugee camp  in Thailand
23:45 for about ten years  before we come to United States.
23:50 My searching for the true God,  it didn’t stop there.
23:54 We tried to go  to different churches,
23:58 but we  didn’t understand anything.
24:00 One day when I come home  from school,
24:03 I met this gentlemen  named Herold,
24:05 and he asked if he can talk  to me about God.
24:08 I agree because I saw he have a Bible;  he must be a good man.
24:13 When he talked to me,  I tried to pay attention so hard,
24:18 but I still didn’t understand  what he was saying.
24:23 And he went very slow.
24:26 And then he said, “Your name?”  I said, “My name Soten.”
24:29 And then he said, “Your name, Soten;  my name is Herold.
24:33 God’s name, Jehovah.”
24:37 I never thought  that God had name.
24:41 And ever since that day on,  I never forget Jehovah’s name.
24:45 It’s superglued in my heart.
24:48 He gave me his phone number.
24:50 He say he gonna ask his wife  to stop by someday,
24:53 but then I move away  from where I lived.
24:56 Even though I didn’t do  the truth at that time,
25:00 I always pray to Jehovah.
25:03 After I learned God’s name,  I went back to the church.
25:08 The priest would start out
25:11 with “heavenly Father”  but leave out Jehovah’s name.
25:15 So I raised my hand.
25:17 I asked him, “Sir,
25:19 “when you pray “heavenly Father,”  why don’t you say
25:21 “‘heavenly Father, Jehovah’?
25:23 Why you not using God’s name?”
25:28 And then he told me that God  does not force me to be here,
25:32 so I’m welcomed to leave
25:35 or stay if I want.
25:38 So because I realized
25:40 that they don’t use  Jehovah’s name,
25:43 I left and never returned.
25:48 And after many years,  I tried to call Herold,
25:52 but no one  picked up the phone.
25:55 So I leave a message.
25:57 I was hoping  that they remembered me.
26:01 Two weeks later,  Herold comes to my door,
26:07 but at the time, I was working at night  and asleep during the day.
26:14 But Herold never give up;  he come back.
26:19 And I keep on praying  to Jehovah,
26:21 asking for someone  to knock on my door.
26:25 And finally, one day
26:28 I open the door,  and when I saw him,
26:31 I almost couldn’t talk.
26:33 I was teared up.
26:35 I was so happy to see him
26:38 because this is the man  who introduced me to Jehovah’s name.
26:41 Eventually, I start  to study with a sister,
26:45 and she helped me  grow spiritually.
26:49 To know that you have  a heavenly Father
26:52 that cares about you
26:55 —that was  the best feeling on earth.
26:57 It makes me want to know more about him —want to learn more about him.
27:02 I would ask questions:  “Did he like this?
27:04 Did he like that?”
27:06 And then when I go  to the Kingdom Hall,
27:11 I hear Jehovah’s name  so many times.
27:16 I feel, that’s it!
27:18 I found my place.
27:21 I got baptized in 2013.
27:24 My blind aunt that I help her  survive through the jungle,
27:28 she’s still living until today.
27:31 And now that I can get a chance  to talk to her about Jehovah,
27:35 that was a blessing.
27:37 And I can’t stress enough
27:40 how wonderful
27:42 and big privilege  that I receive from Jehovah
27:46 —just to know  who he is and to learn
27:50 that there is true God.
27:53 He have a name,
27:56 and his name is Jehovah.
28:08 Sister Yoeun  still carries painful memories
28:10 from what she and her family suffered  because of man’s ruthless wars.
28:15 But she now has hope  for the future
28:17 and the comfort of knowing  her heavenly Father, Jehovah
28:21 —something we  all share with her.
28:24 Sister Yoeun has the added joy  of worshipping the true God
28:27 together with her husband  and young daughter.
28:30 When we’re at our meetings,
28:32 we help the congregation  to stay close together,
28:36 part of the “one flock”  that follows the “one shepherd.”
28:40 In the following dramatization,  note the way in which one young man
28:44 receives Jehovah’s love  through faithful undershepherds.
28:50 I always loved music.
28:53 I got my first guitar  when I was 15,
28:56 and since then it’s been my way  of expressing myself.
29:01 When they asked,
29:03 “Dave, do you want  to join the band?”
29:06 I didn’t have to think twice.
29:09 Making music,  that’s all that really mattered to me.
29:15 I thought being a musician  would make me happy.
29:18 So that is the path  I followed.
29:26 Only it is not  what I thought it to be.
29:36 I work here  during the day to pay the bills.
29:40 I thought my life  would turn out better.
29:44 But something was missing.
29:47 Instead of being happy,  I just felt lost.
29:57 Man, I’m distracted!
30:08 They are friendly  and look happy.
30:18 He gave me a tract and said:
30:22 “Many people are searching  for true happiness.
30:26 Maybe you  are one of them.”
30:30 This could help.
30:38 I quickly wrote down my address
30:42 and asked whether they would mind  passing by after I finished my shift.
30:50 I was searching all right.
30:54 Actually, the answers  were in front of me all along.
31:03 How come I only get it now?
31:11 You see,
31:15 I was baptized.
31:17 But I never gave  the truth a chance.
31:26 Roy did come as promised.
31:32 I told him,  “I’m a baptized brother.”
31:41 He really listened to me.
31:46 Then he shared Psalm 100:3:
31:48 “Know that Jehovah is God.
31:52 “He is the one who made us,  and we belong to him.
31:55 We are his people  and the sheep of his pasture.”
32:00 In the Bible,  Jehovah is likened to a shepherd.
32:04 He knows  every single one of his sheep,
32:07 and he knows  when one goes missing.
32:11 A lost sheep is not a lost cause;  it still belongs to him.
32:16 And Jehovah  doesn’t spare any efforts
32:18 in searching for it  until he finds it.
32:27 I was like one of those lost sheep.
32:30 But I still belonged  to Jehovah,
32:35 and he has never  forgotten about me.
32:44 Roy promised  we would keep in touch
32:47 and invited me  to the Sunday meeting.
33:00 Man, I was nervous  that morning.
33:02 I wanted to look my best.
33:11 Roy and Matthew  were waiting for me,
33:15 giving me a warm welcome
33:18 —something I’ll never forget.
33:22 How I missed this!
33:27 This is indeed  Jehovah’s congregation.
33:30 This is where I belong.
33:39 The truth has never  been so clear to me.
33:48 How I enjoy the close company of my brothers and sisters!
33:55 What I enjoy most  is helping others
33:58 to find our loving Father,  Jehovah.
34:06 With Jehovah’s help,  I will never be lost again.
34:18 The November 2015 broadcast stressed
34:21 that there is no better place to be  than in Jehovah’s protective arms.
34:26 Those who have drifted away from Jehovah were then, and are still now,
34:31 warmly encouraged  to act without delay.
34:34 As we saw depicted,  Jehovah provides shepherds
34:38 who care for his sheep  and lovingly guide them
34:40 back into his organization.
34:43 When the preaching work  was getting started
34:46 in such countries  as South Korea,
34:48 Jehovah often used missionaries  to help strengthen our brothers.
34:52 In an archived interview,  Brother Chong-il Park
34:55 describes the effect  this had on his sacred service
34:59 and how it prepared him  for the trials he would face.
35:05 From 1939 on,  our brothers
35:08 didn’t have any contact  with Jehovah’s organization,
35:12 and they thought  that no organization existed.
35:16 Then, in 1948,
35:19 a brother  read from a newspaper
35:22 about the activity  of Watchtower Society.
35:25 And it surprised the brothers.
35:28 So brothers wrote the Society,  and the Society
35:31 was so happy  hearing from Korean brothers,
35:34 and they answered
35:36 with many booklets  in Korean.
35:41 There were  two different reactions.
35:43 Some brothers was excited  about preaching work.
35:47 Yet,  another group questioned:
35:50 “Is that true organization  of Jehovah?”
35:54 First missionary group —Brother and Sister Steele—
35:58 arrived on August 9, 1949.
36:03 All the questions  were answered
36:05 by Brother Steele,  and then
36:09 right away  brothers were preaching
36:12 in unity.
36:14 I began pioneering
36:17 in January 1950.
36:20 And then in March 1950,
36:23 six more missionaries  arrived from Gilead School.
36:26 We had only one congregation  in Seoul.
36:29 And the missionaries  were busy for many Bible studies.
36:34 So many interested persons  coming to the meetings.
36:38 The public talk was arranged
36:41 in school auditorium —first time.
36:44 And there were
36:47 over 360 people attended,
36:52 whereas the publishers was
36:57 about 60.
37:02 The same day,  Korean War broke out,
37:05 and the missionaries  had to leave
37:09 on 27th of June
37:12 to Japan.
37:15 And then our brothers  had to take refuge
37:20 to southern part  of Korea.
37:23 I was hiding  in the country.
37:26 Then few days later,
37:28 the secret police  from Communist found us.
37:32 We explained to him
37:34 as a Christian  we cannot participate in the war,
37:38 so we had  to hide ourselves.
37:45 And then he says: “Well,  I do not know much about religion,
37:49 “so I better take  one of my friends
37:53 “who knows about religion.
37:55 “So I will  come back tomorrow.
37:58 Don’t leave from here.”
38:01 So, then,  we waited until next day,
38:05 and he came with another.
38:07 So I started preaching  from the Bible
38:10 about why  this war broke out
38:15 and the many problems  in the world
38:17 and so on,  because the fulfillment
38:20 of Jesus’ prophecy  in Matthew 24.
38:23 And then they say,  “Well, thank you very much
38:25 for your preaching.”
38:28 And then say, “Goodbye.”
38:30 Then two days later,  the latter one came
38:34 with another friend  so that we could preach to them.
38:37 During three months  they were staying in Seoul,
38:41 and, in fact,  they protected us.
38:47 I was picked  by South Korean army
38:52 to serve the back support
38:57 of the military  in front line to carry arms
39:02 to the soldiers,
39:04 which I could not accept,
39:08 so I refused it.
39:11 And then
39:14 I was beaten.
39:19 And then one day
39:21 this company has to move  to another place.
39:24 I hide myself
39:26 in behind the ceiling
39:28 so that they don’t notice
39:32 when they leave the place.
39:35 And the next morning  when I came down,
39:39 there was nothing left.
39:41 I walked on one street,  toward one direction,
39:47 and then I found a sign
39:50 that said  “International Bible Students Association.”
39:54 So I stayed with the brothers  for six months.
39:58 Brother Steele  came back from Japan
40:03 by himself to take care  of the brothers.
40:07 In 1952, Brother Steele  recommended me
40:11 to Gilead School.
40:14 So that I was invited  in 22nd class.
40:19 So I took the steps
40:23 to get the passport.
40:25 And then the government find out  that I didn’t serve in military.
40:30 They gave me draft notice  instead of passport.
40:35 So I had to stand  for the neutrality
40:40 instead of going to Gilead School,  which made me to be confined
40:44 in military prison  for two years.
40:48 Then 1958, I was enrolled
40:52 in Gilead School in 32nd class.
40:57 I really appreciate
40:59 that great Gilead School training.
41:03 Since my job in the branch,  especially in translation work
41:08 —and translation work  involves much deep knowledge—
41:12 the Gilead training
41:15 has certainly helped  in translation work.
41:18 The real appreciation
41:21 about the truth  and the organization,
41:24 the brothers’ qualities,  the humbleness and meekness,
41:29 certainly it helped me
41:33 to follow the examples
41:35 to apply  in the full-time service.
41:43 Did you note what Brother Park  said he appreciated most
41:47 even after enduring persecution  and prison for his faith?
41:51 It was the Christlike qualities  of his brothers
41:54 and the training he received  from Jehovah’s organization
41:58 —another example of the benefits  that result from our meeting together.
42:02 If you’d like to find more ways  to imitate Brother Park’s faith,
42:06 you can read his life story  beginning on page 12
42:09 of the December 2008 issue  of Awake!
42:13 Like many older ones  before them,
42:15 younger brothers and sisters  are taking on challenging assignments
42:19 that bring them  rich spiritual rewards.
42:22 We go next to India to hear  from Brother Francis Rodrigues.
42:27 He’s using his training  from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
42:31 to teach people  in the Indian Sign Language field.
46:07 Brother Rodrigues searches for those  rightly disposed for everlasting life
46:11 wherever he can find them  despite the obstacles.
46:15 And you may have noted  that his joy comes from directing people
46:18 to the congregation to be part  of our true spiritual brotherhood.
46:23 That example is repeated millions  of times over through the diligent efforts
46:27 of publishers and pioneers  around the world.
46:31 Why not examine your ministry  to find ways to help
46:34 yet more people to build  a good relationship with Jehovah?
46:38 As we’ve seen  just in this program,
46:42 examples of faith  come in a variety of forms.
46:46 In the April 2016 program,  we saw the first two installments
46:50 in the series  “Viewpoints on the Origin of Life.”
46:54 We’ll now enjoy two more examples of those whose backgrounds in scientific study
46:59 enabled them to cultivate  strong faith in the Creator.
47:08 My name  is Rocío Picado Herrero.
47:11 I studied chemistry  at the University of Salamanca, in Spain.
47:16 I specialize in organic chemistry.
47:20 This field focuses  on the study of the carbon atom
47:23 and all the compounds  that are derived from this atom.
47:28 I believed that life  came about through evolution.
47:32 I remember seeing a picture  in a natural science book
47:35 that depicted the embryos  of different vertebrates,
47:38 and in the early stages of development,  the similarities were outstanding.
47:43 But when I started studying  at the university,
47:46 I began studying  in detail the process
47:49 on which  the evolution theory is based.
47:51 To my surprise,  I discovered that these processes
47:55 were not proven facts.
47:57 As a chemist, I’m fascinated
47:59 by the distribution  of atoms within a molecule.
48:02 In living creatures,  the 20 amino acids
48:06 that are vital  for the synthesis of life,
48:09 the basic proteins  required for life,
48:12 interestingly,  are all levorotatory or left-handed.
48:16 So when a ray  of polarized light arrives,
48:20 these amino acids  divert the light toward the left.
48:24 There is no explanation for this  because the logical thing would be
48:29 that if this were a random process,  half would be right-handed
48:33 and the other half  would be left-handed.
48:40 I asked myself, ‘How could evolution  produce compounds that are levorotatory
48:45 and precisely the ones  essential for life?’
48:53 In the end, I had to conclude  that there must be a force,
48:56 a Designer, a Creator of life  and of the elements
49:00 and the amino acids  required for life.
49:03 Even though  I had a religious upbringing,
49:05 my ideas were not clear  as to who God was.
49:09 I merely viewed him  as a Supreme Being
49:12 before whom  we would be held accountable.
49:16 The Bible  is not a science textbook.
49:18 Its purpose is not to describe  the universe we live in
49:22 or the laws  that regulate our universe.
49:24 But when it does mention science,
49:27 and when it discusses scientific matters,  it does so with great accuracy.
49:31 And undoubtedly the greatest benefit  is that it allows me to enjoy
49:35 a personal relationship  with the Creator of the universe
49:38 —a universe that fascinates me  from a scientific perspective.
49:46 My name is Davey Loos.
49:48 I studied biochemistry  at the University of Leuven in Belgium,
49:51 and after that time  I did a PhD in the same area.
49:55 When I was a young child,  I believed in the Bible.
49:59 But growing up,  I kind of lost my interest in it.
50:03 When you go to university  and you study life sciences
50:06 or biochemistry, for example,
50:08 you get introduced into the idea  of the origin of life very quickly
50:12 and also into the principle  of evolution.
50:14 The professors  who taught these courses,
50:17 they were really scientists  with long careers,
50:19 and they were well-established scientists,  and we had a lot of respect for them.
50:23 So there was just no way to really question the principle of evolution.
50:29 In 1999, there was a war  in Europe—in Kosovo—
50:33 and I remember reading  in the Bible as a child
50:36 about the future events  that would take place,
50:41 and I started wondering whether the war  in Kosovo was one of those events.
50:45 So that lead me  to pick up the Bible again.
50:49 At the time, I felt that I had to reexamine  my beliefs about the origin of life
50:53 and also about the principle  of evolution.
50:58 Based on the theory of evolution,  we would expect to see
51:01 an abundance of transitional forms  to be present in the fossil record.
51:05 But when we do look at the fossil evidence, we just don’t see that.
51:09 We see that the major species
51:11 come into existence  at specific times,
51:14 and their form and structure  is still exactly the same
51:16 as their form  and structure today.
51:19 It was actually Darwin himself  who wrote in his book
51:23 that the biggest objection  that could be brought against this theory
51:27 would be the fact  that the fossil record
51:30 does not show an abundance  of transitional forms.
51:34 And that’s what really happens  if you look at the set of data
51:39 —the fossil record seems to prove  the opposite of evolution.
51:43 As a biochemist,  I had the opportunity to learn about
51:48 and study  many different biomolecules.
51:50 And I observed  that pretty much every biomolecule
51:54 is really a complex molecule.
51:56 We can look at them  as nanoscale molecular motors
52:00 or machines that are performing  very complex and specific tasks.
52:06 For me, the complexity that we see in nature and the complexity in those molecules
52:11 points to the fact  that there really is a Creator.
52:15 Did you see common ground  that could help you
52:17 in your next discussion  with someone who believes in evolution?
52:21 When Sister Picado Herrero’s  chemistry research
52:24 showed evidence of design,
52:26 she called to mind her view of God  from her religious upbringing.
52:31 The person you meet  who believes in evolution
52:33 might also have unanswered questions  about God from their upbringing,
52:37 and they may respond  to the simple evidences
52:40 of a Creator  that you present.
52:42 Brother Loos  was moved by world events
52:45 to pick up the Bible  and reexamine his beliefs.
52:48 Everyone we meet,  even firm believers in evolution,
52:52 are affected by world conditions  and may listen to our message of hope.
52:57 So when someone says  that he believes in evolution,
53:00 don’t be quick to assume  that he’ll reject the good news.
53:03 Really, our ministry  and other aspects of life often improve
53:08 when we slow down,  take our time,
53:11 and as our music video admonishes:
53:14 “Don’t Run Fast.”
53:24 You can walk, but please don’t run. It’s hard to do when you’re having fun.
53:32 But there’s a reason we don’t race; When you’re with the friends,
53:38 It’s not the time or place.
53:42 Don’t run so fast. Take your time and make things last.
53:58 Learn to love the things you do. Just don’t run fast.
54:10 You’ve got things you have to do, People to serve, who depend on you.
54:19 But don’t forget why you’re here; Learn to love the friends;
54:25 Let them know you care.
54:29 Don’t run so fast. Take your time and make things last.
54:44 Learn to love the things you do. Just don’t run fast.
54:57 You can run to someone’s door. Is there someone home?
55:04 Well, you’re not real sure. But look around and see everyone,
55:10 People walking by. Can you talk to one?
55:17 Don’t run so fast. Take your time and make things last.
55:32 Learn to love the things you do. Just don’t run fast.
55:45 Oh. Just don’t run fast!
55:57 Of course, we shouldn’t run  at all in the Kingdom Hall.
56:01 But in a figurative sense,  this counsel, not to run fast,
56:05 applies to more  than just our young ones.
56:07 As we saw, even when we’re busy  with important theocratic work,
56:12 we can still take the time  to consider, incite,
56:16 and encourage our brothers.
56:18 And rather than rushing  through our field service,
56:21 we want to imitate  Jesus’ focus on finding people
56:24 and reaching hearts.
56:26 Jehovah reaches our hearts  in ever so many ways,
56:29 such as when we attend  our spiritual gatherings.
56:32 By now, some of you  have already attended
56:35 the 2016 “Remain Loyal to Jehovah!”  regional convention.
56:39 But millions of us still have  an exciting three days ahead
56:43 with 47 well-prepared talks,
56:46 18 songs that we’ll  sing to Jehovah,
56:49 and more than 50 audio  and video presentations,
56:52 including 2 feature-length dramas.
56:55 All of these program parts  have been prepared to help us
56:58 remain loyal to God  despite serious challenges.
57:02 For instance,  how can we maintain our loyalty
57:05 when under stress or temptation?
57:08 What did Jehovah  personally teach Job
57:11 that can strengthen  our loyalty?
57:13 And why does the Bible say  that Jehovah’s loyal love
57:16 is more precious than life itself?
57:19 To find out more  of what you can expect,
57:22 review the full convention program,
57:25 which can be downloaded  from jw.org.
57:28 You won’t want to miss any part
57:30 of the “Remain Loyal to Jehovah!”  convention program!
57:34 As we close,  we bring you greetings
57:37 from the Las Perlas-Ngäbere  congregation in Panama.
57:41 The Volcán region  is the highest point in the country,
57:44 enjoying a cool climate  for growing coffee
57:48 and a variety of vegetables.
57:50 The busy harvest work  from October to December
57:52 brings large numbers
57:55 of Ngäbere-speaking people  to the area.
57:58 Their kind nature gives our brothers  excellent opportunities
58:01 to teach them  about God’s Kingdom.
58:03 Local brothers and sisters
58:05 provide regular support  to the Ngäbere Remote Translation Office.
58:10 And some are making the effort
58:12 to learn the language to assist  in the congregation’s spiritual harvest.
58:20 We send them  our warm Christian love
58:23 and greetings in return and pray for them  to continue in their zealous spirit.
58:28 We thank you and hope  you’ve enjoyed our program.
58:32 This is JW Broadcasting
58:35 from Brooklyn, New York!

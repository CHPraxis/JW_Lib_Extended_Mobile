00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:12.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was something I always remembered,

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching my mother’s hands

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as she carefully prepared the bread

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Memorial of Christ’s death.

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She took it very seriously

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of its special meaning.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the night before his death,

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told his disciples:

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This [bread] means my body.”

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the bread and wine were passed around,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said to them:

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:56.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To this day, that’s what we do.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shari, can you bring me the flour, please?

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a simple mixture, really.

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:25.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what comes next?

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:27.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Water?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is right.

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:40.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you ever add anything else?

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:42.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is very important that the bread is made
in the same way

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it was in Jesus’ day

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just wheat flour and water.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is all.

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:56.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if people do not have wheat flour?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the bread can still be made

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:02.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with flour made from rice, barley,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
corn, or a similar grain.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But nothing should be added
besides the flour and the water

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no yeast.

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not even <i>salt</i> ?

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not even salt.

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Jesus said at Luke 16:10:

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The person faithful in what is least

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is faithful also in . . .”?

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In much”!

00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is right.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be faithful to Jehovah
in <i>all </i> things, right?

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:35.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After mixing, she would knead the dough,

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:39.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the dust would rise and fall
as she worked.

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, she’d let me roll it out.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:47.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, it would be placed
on a lightly oiled pan for baking.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:51.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it was done,

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:56.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it didn’t look like the kind of bread
you and I typically see.

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:58.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was rather plain-looking,

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:01.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dry, and crackerlike.

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:03.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It easily broke apart.

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was perfect.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we proudly brought it

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:11.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Kingdom Hall for the observance.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:18.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I happily remember those moments

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as I now prepare the bread
for the Memorial this year.

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:29.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even more important,

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I think of what Jesus did
for each of us,

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is a wonderful privilege
to have a small contribution

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this most important night of the year.

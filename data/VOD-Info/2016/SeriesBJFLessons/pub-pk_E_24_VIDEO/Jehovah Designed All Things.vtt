Whoa! 
They’re so beautiful! 

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:29.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do butterflies know 
they’re beautiful?

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. 
They don’t.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:34.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then why did Jehovah 
make them so pretty?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us! 

00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:39.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves us and wants us 
to have beauty all around.

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:44.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think of all 
the different butterflies you’ve seen.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:00:49.604 --> 00:00:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know 
that every single butterfly 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:54.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
starts out as a caterpillar?

00:00:57.062 --> 00:00:59.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look how cute they are!

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:01.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aw! 

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:07.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even before that, 

00:01:09.812 --> 00:01:12.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mommy butterfly 
has to find the right leaf 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lay her caterpillar eggs 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
since it’s going to be 
her babies’ food.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice!

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:25.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t believe that this 

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
turns into this!

00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:29.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it great that Jehovah designed 

00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:33.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
so many wonderful things 
for us to discover? 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
That shows how much he loves us!

00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:39.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to be in Paradise 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study every butterfly 
that Jehovah has designed.

00:01:47.187 --> 00:01:51.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made so many amazing things!

00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:53.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your favorite?

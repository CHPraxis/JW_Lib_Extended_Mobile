00:00:27 Sister Elsa,
00:00:29 did you paint these?
00:00:31 I did.
00:00:33 They’re amazing!
00:00:34 How long have you been drawing?
00:00:36 As long as I can remember.
00:00:39 It’s my way of being able to share
00:00:41 all the stories of my life.
00:00:43 Could you show me?
00:00:46 Yes, of course!
00:00:48 I remember a time when I was young and in East Germany.
00:00:51 We weren’t allowed to do our work as Jehovah’s Witnesses;
00:00:55 we were under ban.
00:00:57 I helped in copying our Watchtower magazines by hand
00:01:01 and then hiding them in food.
00:01:03 You did?
00:01:04 Yes!
00:01:05 We’d then send the food to our brothers who were in prison.
00:01:10 I was also asked to help in distributing Bible literature
00:01:13 to our congregations  as an underground messenger.
00:01:17 Wow!
00:01:18 Time passed and then things  started getting better in Berlin.
00:01:23 Shortly after,  I immigrated to New York.
00:01:26 And I met my darling husband.
00:01:32 Wow, that was a great story!
00:01:34 Thank you.
00:01:35 But I’m sure you have stories.
00:01:38 What do you like to draw?
00:01:40 Well, actually, here!
00:01:43 This was the time when Caleb and I went to the park,
00:01:46 and we met a little girl there.
00:01:48 I’m glad I reached out that day.
00:01:50 Lasting friends can be of any age when they love Jehovah.

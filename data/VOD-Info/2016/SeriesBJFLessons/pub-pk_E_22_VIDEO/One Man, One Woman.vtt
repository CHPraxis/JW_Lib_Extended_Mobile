00:19.395 --> 00:21.395
Look, Mom!

00:21.395 --> 00:23.479
I drew our family 
in school today!

00:23.479 --> 00:25.479
Oh, wow!

00:25.479 --> 00:27.479
I didn’t have time 
to finish Caleb’s face.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.562
Carrie drew two mommies.

00:30.562 --> 00:32.854
She told me 
they’re married to each other.

00:32.854 --> 00:34.854
My teacher says 
that all that matters

00:34.854 --> 00:36.854
is that people love each other 
and that they’re happy.

00:36.854 --> 00:38.020
Hmm.

00:38.020 --> 00:41.729
Well, people have their own ideas 
about what is right and wrong,

00:41.729 --> 00:44.895
but what matters 
is how Jehovah feels.

00:44.895 --> 00:48.645
He wants us to be happy, 
and he knows how we can be happiest!

00:48.645 --> 00:51.229
That’s why he invented marriage 
the way he did.

00:51.229 --> 00:53.229
You mean one man 
and one woman?

00:53.229 --> 00:56.812
Exactly! 
Look at Genesis 1:27.

00:56.812 --> 01:00.812
Jehovah created Adam and Eve, 
male and female.

01:00.812 --> 01:03.520
Then in Genesis 2:24 he said

01:03.520 --> 01:06.937
that “a man 
will . . . stick to his wife.”

01:06.937 --> 01:09.937
Later, Jesus said the same thing!

01:09.937 --> 01:13.020
Jehovah’s standards 
haven’t changed.

01:13.020 --> 01:15.104
It’s kind of like 
going on an airplane.

01:15.104 --> 01:17.354
What would happen 
if someone wanted to bring

01:17.354 --> 01:19.604
something on the plane 
that wasn’t allowed?

01:19.604 --> 01:21.604
They couldn’t go on their trip!

01:21.604 --> 01:24.437
Right! 
It’s the same with Jehovah.

01:24.437 --> 01:29.020
He wants us to be his friend 
and live in Paradise forever!

01:29.020 --> 01:32.687
But we have to follow 
his standards to get there.

01:32.687 --> 01:37.687
At Matthew 7:13, 14 it talks 
about the road leading to Paradise.

01:37.687 --> 01:41.104
To get there, Jehovah says 
we have to leave some things behind.

01:41.104 --> 01:45.187
That means anything 
Jehovah doesn’t approve of.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.687
But I want everyone 
to get to Paradise!

01:50.687 --> 01:53.270
So does Jehovah! 
And you know what?

01:53.270 --> 01:55.354
People can change!

01:55.354 --> 01:57.687
That’s why 
we share his message.

01:57.687 --> 02:00.437
So, what can you say 
to Carrie?

02:00.437 --> 02:03.520
Well, I can tell her 
about the Paradise.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.854
I can tell her about the animals 
and the resurrection!

02:06.854 --> 02:22.668
That’s awesome! 
Let’s practice.

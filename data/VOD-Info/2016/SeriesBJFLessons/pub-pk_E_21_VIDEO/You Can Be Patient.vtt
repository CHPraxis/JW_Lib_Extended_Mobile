Ugh, I wish it would stop raining,
so I could go outside.

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:22.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahh, I wish you could go outside too.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need the rain,

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
so plants can grow
and we can have things to eat.

00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:29.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a good thing!

00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:34.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even Jehovah waits for things,

00:00:34.437 --> 00:00:36.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he knows how we feel.

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:41.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
There have been lots of things wrong
with the world for thousands of years.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants to fix them all.

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:45.479 line:10% position:50% align:center
But he’s waiting

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.270 line:10% position:50% align:center
for just the right time to do it.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah must be <i>so</i><i>  </i><i>bored!</i>

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:52.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not even a little bit!

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:55.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he stays busy doing good things,

00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:58.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
like teaching us
and taking care of the preaching work.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can stay busy doing good things too!

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:04.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can ask Jehovah
to help you be patient.

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:12.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, instead of just sitting there
being <i>bored,</i>

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:16.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can help <i>me</i><i> </i><i> </i>do all these dishes!

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:26.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow,

00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:28.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are fast!

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:29.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Caleb!

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:31.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look! It stopped raining!

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:33.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rain always stops eventually.

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:36.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just have to be patient.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since you helped me with the dishes
—so nice of you—

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
now I can take you to the park.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:43.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a frog!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ribbit.

00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:46.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frogs live in the mud.

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:47.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cannonball!

00:01:47.437 --> 00:01:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no! Wait!

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aw.

Mephiba . . . 
Mephibo . . . 

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:11.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ugh, I can’t do this!

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:13.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
How’s your talk coming?

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Terrible! 
Maybe someone else could do this.

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:19.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm. 

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember 
what Jehovah’s name means?

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:25.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
He causes to become?

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes! 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can become anything he needs 

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:29.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get great things done. 

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:31.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he can also help others 

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:33.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become 
what he wants them to be. 

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it! 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Creator.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of all the animals he’s made.

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:43.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:45.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! 
That’s a big whale!

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:55.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
He created our universe. 

00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:57.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at all the planets he made.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:58.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
He makes sure everything 
has what it needs to grow.

00:01:13.062 --> 00:01:14.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahh!

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can make us powerful too. 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Moses. 

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:21.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took a shy man 

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:24.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and used him to split the Red Sea.

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:27.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
If He can do all of that, 

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you think He can help you 
pronounce hard names 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get prepared for your talk?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, 
to receive His help, 

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:38.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have to ask Him for it.

00:01:41.812 --> 00:01:44.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His name was Mephibosheth. 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, 

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:49.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rechab and Baanah, . . .”

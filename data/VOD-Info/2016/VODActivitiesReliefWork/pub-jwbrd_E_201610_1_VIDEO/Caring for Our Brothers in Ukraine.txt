00:00 We begin with a report from Ukraine.
00:04 In 2014,  political tensions in eastern Ukraine
00:08 boiled over  into a full-blown military conflict.
00:12 Within months,
00:14 over 7,600 Witnesses
00:17 needed to flee the area  to seek refuge.
00:20 Others sheltered in their homes.
00:22 How did our brothers  survive physically
00:25 and spiritually  through the fighting?
00:27 Relief was organized  from hundreds of miles away
00:30 at the branch office in L’viv.
00:33 In the following interviews,
00:35 our brothers and sisters  describe the love and care
00:39 they received from the organization  and from each other.
00:58 It happened that the hostilities
01:00 started without warning,
01:03 and the brothers needed to flee quickly.
01:08 There was not enough food;
01:10 there was nothing in the stores;
01:12 there was a lack of medicine;
01:14 there was no water,
01:16 no electricity.
01:19 It was scary.
01:20 There was no stability at all.
01:22 We did not know what to do.
01:25 Should we stay, or should we leave?
01:30 There were triplets;  they were seven years old.
01:34 As soon as they  got into the shelter,
01:36 they started singing  a Kingdom song.
01:42 The adults  also joined them in singing,
01:44 and because of that,  we couldn’t hear the explosions
01:47 that were happening outside.
01:51 True, we ran out of foodstuffs,
01:53 and we had no money.
01:55 But I knew we would be able to get by.
01:58 God would not let us die of hunger.
02:01 Because the shelling was happening so often, it was impossible
02:06 to conduct our usual meetings.
02:08 We also couldn’t organize the ministry  in the normal way.
02:12 It was just too dangerous.
02:14 When we received the first reports  about the unrest in the east,
02:18 our Branch Committee gathered
02:20 and we prayerfully analyzed  the situation.
02:23 We asked Jehovah for wisdom —how to act,
02:26 how to help our brothers  to be spiritually and physically safe.
02:30 We were also sending regular update reports to the Governing Body.
02:33 More than 156 tons of food
02:37 and 21 tons of clothing donated
02:40 by local brothers have been distributed
02:42 to fellow believers  and also to some non-Witnesses.
02:45 We had been told  that we would be receiving
02:48 about five tons of relief supplies.
02:50 So we were astounded  when instead of 5 tons,
02:54 we received 15 tons!
02:56 It was lovely to find little notes
02:58 that our brothers  and sisters had written
03:01 and included in the packages.
03:05 Brothers from neighboring cities responded
03:08 and offered their homes,
03:10 provided foodstuffs
03:12 and, more importantly,  their brotherly hospitality.
03:16 So we are ready to make sacrifices,
03:18 to adjust our schedules,
03:21 and to even take time  out from our families
03:23 to render practical help  to our brothers.
03:28 For example, beginning at 6 a.m.,
03:31 I would visit  the brothers and sisters
03:34 and bring them  the things that they needed.
03:39 So during two and a half months of war
03:42 and two months of reconstruction,
03:44 I rode my bicycle
03:46 6,500 kilometers.
03:50 The local elders from Slavyansk
03:53 organized small congregations
03:55 and regularly conducted meetings
03:57 to support them spiritually.
04:01 Major repairs  have been carried out on 20 houses
04:04 of brothers and sisters,  and minor repair work
04:06 was done on 72 houses  and apartments.
04:10 We prepared two more programs.
04:12 This time, not only  for the congregations in the war zone
04:16 but for the whole country of Ukraine,
04:18 even for Russia and Belarus.
04:20 We even had 325,000  in attendance.
04:25 An interesting experience
04:27 was the response of the people  who were not Jehovah’s Witnesses.
04:31 They belong to another religion,  yet they said:
04:35 “You are the only ones  that really care.
04:38 Your genuine love  is shown by your deeds.”
04:42 This is what makes us different
04:45 from all other religions.
04:49 This unselfish love  shown by our brothers
04:51 did not go unnoticed  by my husband and my son.
04:55 My husband  started studying the Bible,
04:58 and he regularly attends  the meetings now.
05:00 Recently, he enrolled  in the Theocratic Ministry School.
05:06 I experienced this love personally,
05:09 and I started studying  the Bible again with the brothers.
05:13 Now I am preparing for baptism.
05:16 Unfortunately,  one of our sisters was killed.
05:20 I realized that a person can lose
05:23 —lose everything, but that
05:27 is really nothing  compared to losing your children.
05:31 The brothers and sisters listened to us.
05:34 We cried together.
05:36 I just can’t put it into words.
05:38 It is as if Jehovah  is holding you in his arms
05:42 —he doesn’t let you fall—
05:44 as if he is saying to you:
05:46 ‘Don’t let go, my dear one.
05:48 I’m helping you.  I’m supporting you.’
05:52 With Jehovah there are no borders  between nations.
05:56 I could see  that this was the true religion.
06:02 We continue to pray  for our brothers in Ukraine.
06:06 We’re confident  of Jehovah’s love for them,
06:09 and we know he’ll sustain them  through any tribulation.

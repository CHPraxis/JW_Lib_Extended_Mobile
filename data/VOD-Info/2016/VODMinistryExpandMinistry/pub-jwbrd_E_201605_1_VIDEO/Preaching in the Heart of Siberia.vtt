00:00.550 --> 00:05.555
An excellent way of maintaining 
the spirituality of the family 


00:05.555 --> 00:10.093
is by spending quality time 
together in the ministry. 


00:10.093 --> 00:14.563
We would now like to introduce you 
to a family from Russia. 


00:14.563 --> 00:17.633
They traveled far away 
to work together 


00:17.633 --> 00:20.970
in unassigned territory 
in Siberia. 


00:20.970 --> 00:24.940
Their experience confirms 
how spiritual activities 


00:24.940 --> 00:29.545
not only build up our faith 
but can also bring our family 


00:29.545 --> 00:33.000
closer to each other.


00:37.987 --> 00:41.457
We are traveling 
to a very interesting territory. 


00:41.457 --> 00:44.927
It is on the shores 
of Lake Baikal. 


00:44.927 --> 00:49.132
From where we live, 
it is 600 kilometers.


00:49.132 --> 00:52.535
We have so many memories 
to take home. 


00:52.535 --> 00:56.840
The scenery is always stunning 
in all types of weather.


00:56.840 --> 01:00.000
Here there are beautiful cliffs 
and valleys.


01:02.112 --> 01:04.280
We cross 
several mountain passes. 


01:04.280 --> 01:07.650
Then we go by ferry.


01:07.650 --> 01:12.322
It felt very strange 
being in the car while crossing the river.


01:12.322 --> 01:15.725
When we have the opportunity, 
we witness 


01:15.725 --> 01:17.527
to people 
we meet on the way.


01:17.527 --> 01:20.830
Why do sincere people 
trust the Holy Scriptures? 


01:20.830 --> 01:24.300
Please have a look 
at what it says here: 


01:24.300 --> 01:27.000
“All scripture is inspired of God.”


01:29.005 --> 01:33.375
We usually serve 
in isolated territory for a week or more. 


01:33.375 --> 01:37.013
We have come to the same place 
where we were last year, 


01:37.013 --> 01:39.215
so we already know 
a lot about it.


01:39.215 --> 01:41.250
Living in a tent 


01:41.250 --> 01:43.987
is very different 
from living in the city. 


01:43.987 --> 01:45.989
Here we don’t have 


01:45.988 --> 01:48.558
any conveniences, 
like a toilet or a shower. 


01:48.558 --> 01:53.295
The only place to wash 
is in Lake Baikal, which is freezing. 


01:53.295 --> 01:58.000
This simple life 
is like an adventure.


01:58.000 --> 02:00.770
As we have quite a big group


02:00.770 --> 02:04.940
—there are 12 of us
—we have also organized 


02:04.940 --> 02:06.977
our spiritual routine. 


02:06.977 --> 02:10.280
We consider 
the daily text together and take part 


02:10.280 --> 02:14.017
in discussing our publications 
using the questions.


02:14.017 --> 02:17.120
We have a friendly, 
relaxed atmosphere. 


02:17.120 --> 02:20.122
Everybody enjoys it.


02:20.122 --> 02:23.560
Our isolated territory, 
where we are preaching, 


02:23.560 --> 02:25.662
is a rural area. 


02:25.662 --> 02:27.930
Here we don’t have 
any prepared maps. 


02:27.930 --> 02:30.600
So when we have our meetings 
for field service, 


02:30.600 --> 02:34.000
we divide up, 
all taking different streets. 


02:36.505 --> 02:39.508
We also think 
about what clothes to wear. 


02:39.508 --> 02:41.845
Experience has shown 
that our clothes 


02:41.845 --> 02:44.947
can help us 
to win over these people. 


02:44.947 --> 02:49.000
So we try to dress simply. 
We don’t wear ties.


02:51.320 --> 02:54.290
The people there are kind. 


02:54.290 --> 02:57.027
Sometimes they even invite us in.


02:57.027 --> 03:01.830
We can have discussions 
with some of them—sometimes long ones.


03:01.830 --> 03:04.200
There you meet 
more receptive people 


03:04.200 --> 03:07.037
than unresponsive ones, 


03:07.037 --> 03:09.339
and that really is encouraging. 


03:09.338 --> 03:12.608
It makes you just want 
to keep on preaching 


03:12.608 --> 03:15.245
without stopping.


03:15.245 --> 03:17.847
The trips have helped 
our son make spiritual progress. 


03:17.847 --> 03:21.850
For us as his parents, 
that is the greatest blessing. 


03:21.850 --> 03:23.853
For example, 


03:23.853 --> 03:28.490
after one of these trips, 
he became an unbaptized publisher.


03:28.490 --> 03:30.927
This territory is different 


03:30.927 --> 03:33.129
from what I am used to, 
so I was worried. 


03:33.128 --> 03:36.331
I didn’t know 
what sort of people lived there 


03:36.332 --> 03:39.402
or what their attitude 
was toward Witnesses. 


03:39.402 --> 03:44.340
But after praying when knocking 
on the first door, my fear disappeared. 


03:44.340 --> 03:47.677
I was able to place 270 tracts.


03:47.677 --> 03:50.547
While we were witnessing, 


03:50.547 --> 03:53.082
we showed the people 
the addresses in our publications 


03:53.082 --> 03:55.352
so that they could write 


03:55.352 --> 03:58.689
if they found
what they had read interesting. 


03:58.688 --> 04:02.625
We usually start witnessing 
about 12 noon, and we finish 


04:02.625 --> 04:04.460
around 5:00 p.m. 


04:04.460 --> 04:09.000
Then the relaxation part 
of our day begins.


04:12.135 --> 04:14.137
We have a campfire, 


04:14.137 --> 04:18.140
some games, 
some music, and fun.


04:18.140 --> 04:21.743
Early in the day, 
we used our energy in the ministry, 


04:21.743 --> 04:25.815
and afterward we were able 
to relax and enjoy each other’s company.


04:25.815 --> 04:29.552
So we combine 
both our ministry and relaxation. 


04:29.552 --> 04:33.724
One of the delights 
of these trips is the fish


04:33.723 --> 04:36.000
—the famous Baikal omul.


04:38.293 --> 04:43.131
These trips really strengthen 
the unity in our family.


04:43.132 --> 04:46.735
We really have 
drawn closer together.


04:46.735 --> 04:50.238
It is invigorating 
and enriches us spiritually. 


04:50.238 --> 04:53.341
We experience 
pure joy from knowing 


04:53.342 --> 04:56.445
that Jehovah 
has blessed our efforts. 


04:56.445 --> 05:01.000
We feel like we have our batteries 
charged for the entire year.


05:07.057 --> 05:10.259
It is very encouraging to see 


05:10.258 --> 05:13.228
such a spiritually focused family. 


05:13.228 --> 05:16.365
And did you notice 
that it was after one such trip 


05:16.365 --> 05:19.902
that their son 
became an unbaptized publisher? 


05:19.902 --> 05:24.174
I’m sure that brought 
much joy to his parents.


05:24.173 --> 05:27.176
Are you interested 
in a preaching assignment


05:27.177 --> 05:29.379
in territory seldom worked? 


05:29.378 --> 05:33.716
If so, form a group 
of no more than 20 publishers 


05:33.717 --> 05:37.454
and ask the elders 
in your congregation for further instructions


05:37.453 --> 05:41.056
and an Application 
for Territory Seldom Worked. 


05:41.057 --> 05:45.462
Once you have filled out the form, 
the Congregation Service Committee 


05:45.462 --> 05:59.359
will review it and submit it 
to your local branch.

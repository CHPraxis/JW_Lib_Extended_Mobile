00:00 An excellent way of maintaining  the spirituality of the family
00:05 is by spending quality time  together in the ministry.
00:10 We would now like to introduce you  to a family from Russia.
00:14 They traveled far away  to work together
00:17 in unassigned territory  in Siberia.
00:20 Their experience confirms  how spiritual activities
00:24 not only build up our faith  but can also bring our family
00:29 closer to each other.
00:37 We are traveling  to a very interesting territory.
00:41 It is on the shores  of Lake Baikal.
00:44 From where we live,  it is 600 kilometers.
00:49 We have so many memories  to take home.
00:52 The scenery is always stunning  in all types of weather.
00:56 Here there are beautiful cliffs  and valleys.
01:02 We cross  several mountain passes.
01:04 Then we go by ferry.
01:07 It felt very strange  being in the car while crossing the river.
01:12 When we have the opportunity,  we witness
01:15 to people  we meet on the way.
01:17 Why do sincere people  trust the Holy Scriptures?
01:20 Please have a look  at what it says here:
01:24 “All scripture is inspired of God.”
01:29 We usually serve  in isolated territory for a week or more.
01:33 We have come to the same place  where we were last year,
01:37 so we already know  a lot about it.
01:39 Living in a tent
01:41 is very different  from living in the city.
01:43 Here we don’t have
01:45 any conveniences,  like a toilet or a shower.
01:48 The only place to wash  is in Lake Baikal, which is freezing.
01:53 This simple life  is like an adventure.
01:58 As we have quite a big group
02:00 —there are 12 of us —we have also organized
02:04 our spiritual routine.
02:06 We consider  the daily text together and take part
02:10 in discussing our publications  using the questions.
02:14 We have a friendly,  relaxed atmosphere.
02:17 Everybody enjoys it.
02:20 Our isolated territory,  where we are preaching,
02:23 is a rural area.
02:25 Here we don’t have  any prepared maps.
02:27 So when we have our meetings  for field service,
02:30 we divide up,  all taking different streets.
02:36 We also think  about what clothes to wear.
02:39 Experience has shown  that our clothes
02:41 can help us  to win over these people.
02:44 So we try to dress simply.  We don’t wear ties.
02:51 The people there are kind.
02:54 Sometimes they even invite us in.
02:57 We can have discussions  with some of them—sometimes long ones.
03:01 There you meet  more receptive people
03:04 than unresponsive ones,
03:07 and that really is encouraging.
03:09 It makes you just want  to keep on preaching
03:12 without stopping.
03:15 The trips have helped  our son make spiritual progress.
03:17 For us as his parents,  that is the greatest blessing.
03:21 For example,
03:23 after one of these trips,  he became an unbaptized publisher.
03:28 This territory is different
03:30 from what I am used to,  so I was worried.
03:33 I didn’t know  what sort of people lived there
03:36 or what their attitude  was toward Witnesses.
03:39 But after praying when knocking  on the first door, my fear disappeared.
03:44 I was able to place 270 tracts.
03:47 While we were witnessing,
03:50 we showed the people  the addresses in our publications
03:53 so that they could write
03:55 if they found what they had read interesting.
03:58 We usually start witnessing  about 12 noon, and we finish
04:02 around 5:00 p.m.
04:04 Then the relaxation part  of our day begins.
04:12 We have a campfire,
04:14 some games,  some music, and fun.
04:18 Early in the day,  we used our energy in the ministry,
04:21 and afterward we were able  to relax and enjoy each other’s company.
04:25 So we combine  both our ministry and relaxation.
04:29 One of the delights  of these trips is the fish
04:33 —the famous Baikal omul.
04:38 These trips really strengthen  the unity in our family.
04:43 We really have  drawn closer together.
04:46 It is invigorating  and enriches us spiritually.
04:50 We experience  pure joy from knowing
04:53 that Jehovah  has blessed our efforts.
04:56 We feel like we have our batteries  charged for the entire year.
05:07 It is very encouraging to see
05:10 such a spiritually focused family.
05:13 And did you notice  that it was after one such trip
05:16 that their son  became an unbaptized publisher?
05:19 I’m sure that brought  much joy to his parents.
05:24 Are you interested  in a preaching assignment
05:27 in territory seldom worked?
05:29 If so, form a group  of no more than 20 publishers
05:33 and ask the elders  in your congregation for further instructions
05:37 and an Application  for Territory Seldom Worked.
05:41 Once you have filled out the form,  the Congregation Service Committee
05:45 will review it and submit it  to your local branch.

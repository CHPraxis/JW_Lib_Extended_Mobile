00:05 Armenia is an ancient country  with rich history,
00:08 situated in the lands  of Mount Ararat.
00:13 In the Caucasus region,  Lake Sevan
00:16 is considered to be  a prized jewel.
00:22 Diversity of its flora and fauna
00:25 contribute to the unique  and beautiful countryside.
00:30 Yerevan, the capital,
00:33 is a modern metropolis  with picturesque views
00:36 that remind many of Paris  with its trees, cafés,
00:40 and beautiful water fountains.
00:47 Recently, a special three-week  preaching campaign took place.
00:53 Groups of Armenian-speaking  Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:56 from six different countries
00:58 wholeheartedly responded  to the invitation.
01:07 The main purpose of the campaign  was to cover as many
01:10 of the 512 unassigned territories as possible
01:13 with the Kingdom good news.
01:16 Thus, an opportunity
01:18 for an interchange  of encouragement was created
01:21 for both the local friends  and the campaign participants.
01:27 They were warmly greeted  at the airport
01:29 by local brothers and sisters.
01:37 The Witnesses made good use  of their tablets and smartphones to show
01:41 videos from the jw.org website.
01:45 Armenia is also currently home
01:48 to over 11,000 Western-Armenian refugees.
01:52 A special effort was made  to share with these individuals
01:55 the positive message of hope and peace from the Bible
01:58 in their native tongue,  West Armenian.
02:02 Metropolitan witnessing  served as an effective way
02:05 to reach these ones.
02:07 It was the first time in my life
02:10 that I participated in public witnessing,
02:12 and it was very encouraging.
02:14 When individuals would approach us  and show interest,
02:17 I could explain to them  the truth in their own language.
02:19 It was amazing.
02:21 It’s been very heartwarming.
02:24 People have really responded well.
02:26 They were in need of comfort
02:28 and the good news, especially those that
02:30 we came for, the Western Armenians.
02:32 Pretty much every door invited us in,
02:34 and they were very hospitable  and receptive.
02:37 After we heard the announcement  about the special campaign
02:40 in the Western language  that’s going to take place in Armenia,
02:43 we said: “We cannot miss this.
02:45 “We have to be there  and bring our share
02:47 in this very joyful preaching campaign.”
02:50 During the three-week campaign,
02:53 over 15,000 pieces
02:55 of Bible-based literature  were left with interested ones,
02:58 and over 200 Bible studies  were started.
03:03 We were very happy to see
03:06 how many brothers and sisters  were ready to come
03:09 for the campaign in Armenia
03:11 from different countries  around the world.
03:13 That response showed
03:15 that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.
03:19 Those who came from far and wide
03:21 greatly appreciated the share
03:23 they had in this special event.
03:25 Everyone was so happy to see us.
03:28 And when we were giving them a Bible,
03:30 they were so excited to find answers from their own Bible.
03:34 I’m so blessed to be here.
03:36 This has been the best vacation
03:38 that we have had as a family.
03:41 The first time I came to Armenia,
03:43 it was in 1982.
03:45 And I looked for the Witnesses,
03:48 and I hardly found just a few.
03:51 But now that I came  for this campaign,
03:54 we have 11,000 Witnesses!
03:57 I’m really so happy!  I really want to come back!
04:02 It is our hope that Jehovah God  continues to help
04:06 all sorts of people to be saved
04:09 and come  to an accurate knowledge of truth.

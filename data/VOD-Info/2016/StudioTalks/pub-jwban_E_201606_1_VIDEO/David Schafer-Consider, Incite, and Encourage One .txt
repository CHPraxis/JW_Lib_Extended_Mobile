00:00 Our theme for this month
00:03 is “Consider, Incite, and Encourage  One Another All the More So.”
00:08 JW Broadcasting
00:11 —why do we enjoy it so much?
00:14 Many of you have expressed  how the monthly broadcast draws you closer
00:19 to our brothers and sisters  and to Jehovah’s organization.
00:22 If you’re homebound or isolated,  you especially treasure these programs.
00:27 And yet, while we appreciate  the advances in technology
00:32 that have made all of this possible,  we know that your sincere desire
00:36 is to be present  with your brothers and sisters in person
00:39 at our congregation meetings.
00:42 Jehovah’s Witnesses  around the world share this feeling.
00:46 In northern Finland, for example,  winters are especially cold,
00:50 even by Finnish standards.
00:52 At times, temperatures plummet  to minus 50 degrees Celsius,
00:56 or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit!
00:59 Under those conditions,  it’s very difficult to drive,
01:03 much less walk long distances.
01:05 Still, the brothers love  to gather together.
01:09 How do they manage it?
01:11 In one small village, there is a brother  who lives near the Kingdom Hall
01:15 and has a warm garage.
01:17 On meeting nights, he uses his car
01:19 to bring each family  in the congregation to the hall.
01:22 Then he parks in his garage and runs  the short distance back to the Kingdom Hall.
01:27 When the meeting is over, he returns  all the friends safely to their homes.
01:32 In the Bible,  gatherings for pure worship
01:36 were occasions for personal association  with fellow believers.
01:41 Such association required travel  to a designated place.
01:44 This involved work,  sacrifice, even risk.
01:49 Consider what is stated  at Exodus 34:24.
01:54 This verse has to do with the command  that every Israelite male
01:59 should gather three times a year  for the festivals in Jerusalem.
02:03 What would that mean  in practical terms?
02:06 Wouldn’t the nation  be left vulnerable to attack
02:08 if no men were left  to guard the land?
02:11 And if word spread  among the surrounding nations
02:13 that practically everyone  congregated in Jerusalem
02:16 three times a year,  like clockwork, year after year,
02:20 wouldn’t it be just a matter of time  before some invading army
02:23 would come  and pillage an Israelite city?
02:26 At Exodus 34:24,
02:29 we find  Jehovah’s remarkable answer:
02:33 “For I will drive the nations  away from before you,
02:37 and I will enlarge your territory,  and nobody will desire,”
02:42 yes, even desire, “your land
02:45 “while you are going up to see  the face of Jehovah your God
02:49 three times a year.”
02:51 Jehovah kept that promise.
02:54 It’s a historical fact  that from 1513 B.C.E.
02:59 all the way down to 66 C.E.  no foreign nation ever came
03:04 to invade Israelite territory  during those three annual festivals.
03:09 Jehovah placed high value  on having his people
03:12 gather together  in the same space.
03:16 In the Christian era,  the apostle Paul wrote
03:19 at 1 Corinthians 14:23  about ‘the whole congregation
03:23 coming together to one place.’
03:26 Now, although modern broadcasting  technology didn’t exist in those days,
03:31 there were other viable methods  of communicating, such as writing letters,
03:36 that didn’t require people to be physically  present in the same location.
03:40 Still, the apostle John,  though a capable writer,
03:44 preferred face-to-face interchange  with fellow Christians
03:48 as he expressed  at 2 John 12.
03:52 Or consider what is stated
03:54 at Job 1:6:
03:57 “Now the day came  when the sons of the true God
04:02 entered to take their station  before Jehovah.”
04:06 Job 2:1 speaks  of another such day.
04:09 Just imagine!
04:11 Here Jehovah himself,
04:13 though having all conceivable methods  of communication at his disposal,
04:18 set specific days  for his spirit creatures in heaven
04:22 to assemble  in his immediate presence.
04:25 Clearly, the Scriptures encourage  regular personal association
04:29 with fellow servants of God.
04:31 Virtual attendance through modern  communication technology has value,
04:36 and we’re happy to use it,  but it’s no substitute for being together.
04:40 And why not?
04:42 Because of what association  with the congregation achieves.
04:46 It’s not just that we receive nutritious  and varied spiritual food.
04:50 Meetings inform us,  but so does JW Broadcasting.
04:55 Meetings encourage us,  but so does JW Broadcasting.
04:59 Fellow Christians who offer comments  and sing from the heart build us up,
05:04 and yet we can hear that also  on JW Broadcasting.
05:08 It’s when we’re together —all together in one place—
05:12 that others can hear us  and draw encouragement
05:15 from our heartfelt convictions,  our smile, our handshake.
05:19 Meetings give us opportunities  to show our brothers and sisters
05:23 that we esteem them  as worthy of our time,
05:27 attention, and concern.
05:30 That is why we go and visit our brothers  who are homebound or isolated
05:34 because we want to show them  that we love them.
05:38 Moreover, in a special way,
05:42 our meetings bring us  under the influence of holy spirit.
05:46 At Revelation 2:7,
05:49 the glorified Jesus said:
05:52 “Let the one  who has an ear hear
05:56 what the spirit says  to the congregations.”
06:00 We need that spirit  to help us resist temptation,
06:04 to embolden and equip us  for the ministry,
06:07 and to enable us  to make sound decisions.
06:10 Still, there’s a reason  to attend meetings
06:14 that’s even more important  than the pleasant company,
06:17 the peaceful atmosphere,  the genuine refreshment,
06:20 the sense of belonging,  the opportunities to give,
06:23 or even the fact that meetings  are a means by which
06:25 we receive  Jehovah’s holy spirit.
06:28 The key reason  why we gather together
06:30 is stated at Psalm 26:12:
06:34 “My foot is standing  on level ground;
06:39 in the great congregation,  I will praise Jehovah.”
06:44 Yes, the principal reason  why we gather together in person
06:47 is to give Jehovah what he deserves
06:51 —praise, glory, yes, worship.
06:55 Our meeting attendance  shows Jehovah
06:57 that we want to draw close  to him and his Son.
07:01 In his abundant love, Jehovah invites  many more to serve him and keep living.
07:05 Because he lives eternally,
07:07 Jehovah can nurture  those relationships forever.
07:11 The Adversary can offer  no such hope of endless life,
07:14 so he promotes selfishness,  pride, and other negative traits
07:18 that isolate people from one another,  even when they are in the same room,
07:21 engaged in the same activities.
07:23 In contrast, our great God  is drawing his people
07:27 closer to himself,  to his Son,
07:30 and to one another  so that we “may all be one,”
07:34 as Jesus prayed  as recorded at John 17:21.
07:39 And it’s not just the act  of converging
07:41 on the same location  that unites us either.
07:44 Lots of people coexist in the same space  when they go to a market,
07:48 attend a sporting event,  or use public transportation.
07:52 Crowding of itself  does not equate with unity.
07:55 What makes the true  Christian congregation different?
07:59 Notice how Hebrews chapter 10,
08:01 verses 24 and 25  answers this question.
08:05 Now here we find  the divinely inspired standard
08:09 for all our gatherings:
08:12 “And let us  consider one another so as to incite
08:16 “to love and fine works,  not forsaking our meeting together,
08:21 “as some have the custom,  but encouraging one another,
08:25 “and all the more so as you see
08:28 the day drawing near.”
08:31 Now, what does it mean  to “consider one another”?
08:34 What does it mean  “to incite to love and fine works”?
08:38 And in what way might we  ‘encourage one another’?
08:42 The verb “consider”  could also be rendered
08:45 “be concerned about;  pay attention to.”
08:48 So when  we “consider one another,”
08:50 we show interest  that goes far beyond a brief greeting.
08:54 And when we pay careful attention  to one another, we’re better prepared
08:58 to incite, that is, to motivate one another,  to stir one another to action.
09:03 And how might we do this?
09:05 Not by making comparisons  or shaming our brothers,
09:08 for that would hardly be  “encouraging one another,”
09:11 we endeavor to lift one another’s hearts  when we’re together.
09:14 And when we do this  to the best of our ability,
09:17 then we can be confident  that Jehovah’s spirit will do the rest,
09:21 and that our brothers  will feel strengthened.
09:24 It’s evident, then,  that true worship
09:27 means participation;  it requires a response.
09:31 Another noteworthy example of this  is the encouragement we both give
09:36 and receive when we sing together  with our brothers and sisters.
09:40 In ancient Israel,  at times they had a chorus,
09:44 such as the one described  in Nehemiah chapter 12
09:46 that we talked about  in our midweek meeting back in February.
09:50 Much of Israel’s group singing  was antiphonal,
09:54 that is, some of the singers  prompted others to respond.
09:58 For instance, Psalm 106  which begins and ends with the words
10:02 “Praise Jah!” or “Hallelujah!”
10:04 encouraged the people  to say in response: “Amen!”
10:09 Psalm 136 was written
10:12 to allow for different choruses  to answer one another.
10:16 Now just imagine  responding choruses
10:19 singing these alternating lines:
10:23 “Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good;
10:27 “his loyal love endures forever.
10:30 “Give thanks to the God of gods,
10:33 “for his loyal love endures forever.
10:35 “Give thanks to the Lord of lords,
10:38 for his loyal love endures forever.”
10:41 And on it went for 26 verses!
10:45 To this day,  singing demonstrates
10:48 our heartfelt response  to the goodness of Jehovah.
10:52 What a joy it is to sing  in company with others who are moved
10:55 to pour out the depths  of their feelings to Jehovah!
10:59 And now at our Kingdom Halls,  we’re accompanied by orchestral renderings
11:03 of many of our songs —another reason to sing out
11:06 at our midweek and weekend meetings.
11:10 And speaking of the midweek meeting,  how are you enjoying the new format?
11:14 More of the program is devoted  to delving into the Bible itself.
11:18 Time spent on preparing us  for our public ministry
11:21 focuses more than ever  on situations we face in field service.
11:26 And the meetings move along  at a satisfying pace.
11:30 Yes, JW Broadcasting  is a wonderful blessing,
11:35 a powerful means to talk to  and fortify our brothers
11:39 around the world —simultaneously.
11:42 Still, nothing can replace  the experience
11:46 of worshipping Jehovah  in concert
11:48 with our fellow servants of God  at congregation meetings.
11:52 When a meeting concludes  and we lift our heads
11:57 after the final prayer,  we find ourselves surrounded
12:01 by others who love Jehovah  and support his sovereignty.
12:06 These important benefits  are detailed
12:08 in the April 2016  study article
12:11 “Why Should We Meet  Together for Worship?”
12:14 This month, we’re studying  that article worldwide.
12:18 Later, in October,  we begin a special campaign
12:21 to invite the public  to our meetings.
12:24 If you do not yet regularly associate  with Jehovah’s Witnesses
12:28 or if you travel away  from your congregation, use jw.org
12:33 to find a meeting you can attend.
12:35 Click: “About Us,” “Meetings,”
12:38 and “Find a Location Near You”
12:40 or simply scroll to the bottom
12:43 of any jw.org page
12:46 and click “Attend Our Meetings.”
12:48 At our meetings,  you’ll experience what it means
12:52 to consider, incite, and ‘encourage  one another all the more so
12:57 as we see  the day drawing near.’

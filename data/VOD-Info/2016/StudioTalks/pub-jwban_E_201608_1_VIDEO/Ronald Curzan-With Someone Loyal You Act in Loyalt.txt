00:01 This month’s theme is taken  from David’s poetic song to Jehovah
00:06 at Psalm 18:25, which states:
00:09 “With someone loyal you act in loyalty.”
00:12 The Hebrew term “act in loyalty”
00:15 reminds us  of God’s loyal love
00:17 —that is love motivated  by commitment,
00:20 integrity, loyalty,  and deep attachment.
00:24 So loyalty is more  than just a feeling;
00:27 it is active;  it’s rooted in love.
00:30 How comforting it is  to know that Jehovah
00:33 lovingly attaches himself  to those who are loyal to him!
00:37 But what motivated David  to write the words
00:40 at Psalm 18:25?
00:42 The superscription reveals  that it was composed
00:45 after “Jehovah rescued him  from the hand of all his enemies
00:49 and from the hand of Saul.”
00:51 Think of the great joy  and relief he must have felt
00:54 after experiencing firsthand  Jehovah’s loyal love
00:57 and mighty saving acts.
01:00 However, throughout his life,
01:02 David experienced  disloyalty at its worst:
01:06 from his king, Saul;  from his wife Michal;
01:10 from his trusted counselor Ahithophel;  and from his son Absalom.
01:15 He felt the deep hurt of betrayal  by those he trusted and loved most.
01:19 Loyalty is a choice.
01:22 What do we find when we look back  at David’s life?
01:26 David chose to stay loyal to God.
01:30 From a humble shepherd boy  caring for his sheep
01:33 to a valiant king  caring for the nation,
01:36 he proved  to be someone loyal,
01:38 a man agreeable  to Jehovah’s heart.
01:41 But it can be a real test  to maintain loyalty to God
01:45 when we face injustices.
01:47 Imagine the desperate situation  that David and his mighty warriors
01:51 experienced when they  were fugitives,
01:53 forced to hide in the wilderness,  often low on provisions.
01:57 They saw firsthand  King Saul’s jealous rage.
02:01 But what choice did David make  when urged by his men
02:05 to seize the opportunity  to take Saul’s life?
02:08 Notice what David told his men
02:11 at 1 Samuel 24:6:
02:15 “It is unthinkable  from Jehovah’s standpoint
02:18 “that I should do  such a thing to my lord,
02:21 “the anointed of Jehovah,  by lifting my hand against him,
02:24 for he is the anointed of Jehovah.”
02:28 David knew that if he remained loyal,
02:32 Jehovah would remain loyal to him
02:35 —He would show him loyal love.
02:37 He humbly put aside  his personal feelings
02:39 and viewed matters  from Jehovah’s perspective.
02:42 He chose to wait patiently  for Jehovah to “act in loyalty.”
02:48 We’ll soon be facing  life-changing events foretold in the Bible
02:52 that will test our loyalty  to Jehovah and his organization.
02:56 So now is the time  to strengthen our loyalty!
03:00 As we do, we can be sure  that Jehovah knows our circumstances
03:05 —perhaps injustices  we have experienced—
03:08 and will reward our loyal service.
03:11 So ask yourself, ‘What loyal actions
03:14 will motivate Jehovah to be loyal to me?’
03:18 Let’s consider three areas.
03:21 First, we can be loyal  to Jehovah by defending him.
03:25 But Jehovah is  the Sovereign of the universe.
03:28 How can we come to his defense?
03:30 We can learn how  from the fine example of Elihu!
03:35 In the book of Job,  Elihu listened patiently as Job
03:39 and his three false comforters spoke.
03:41 Notice Elihu’s reaction
03:43 at Job 32:2, 3:
03:47 “His anger blazed against Job
03:50 “for trying to prove himself  right rather than God.
03:53 “He was also very angry  with Job’s three companions
03:56 “because they could not find an answer
03:59 but had declared God wicked.”
04:02 A fire of righteous indignation  was burning inside young Elihu.
04:07 In Job 36:2, 3,
04:11 he loyally comes  to Jehovah’s defense saying:
04:14 “Be patient with me  a little longer while I explain,
04:18 “for I still have words  to speak on God’s behalf.
04:21 “I will speak comprehensively  about what I know,
04:25 and I will ascribe  righteousness to my Maker.”
04:28 Elihu courageously proved loyal
04:31 by praising,  and, yes, defending God.
04:36 Why do we need to come  to Jehovah’s defense today?
04:39 Because our loving heavenly Father is blasphemed in so many ways.
04:44 False religions claim  that he’s part of a Trinity
04:47 and that he torments people  eternally in burning hell.
04:50 Others say that he  does not exist or if he does,
04:54 he doesn’t really care about us.
04:56 We know that such lies  come from Satan the Devil.
05:00 We demonstrate our loyalty
05:02 by speaking in defense of Jehovah,
05:05 thereby proving  Satan the liar that he is.
05:08 We boldly and zealously proclaim
05:11 that he does exist  as the almighty God;
05:13 and that he is  wise, just, and loving,
05:17 and that he will soon  bring an end to all evil
05:19 and reward his loyal ones  with eternal life.
05:23 Jehovah could make  the stones cry out in defense,
05:26 yet he honors his loyal Witnesses —you and me—
05:30 with this fine privilege.
05:33 Second, we can be loyal  to Jehovah by being loyal
05:37 to “the faithful and discreet slave,”  the Governing Body.
05:41 Jehovah and Jesus are using  “the faithful and discreet slave”
05:44 to feed us spiritually,  so we owe our loyalty to that slave.
05:49 But some may say,
05:51 ‘Isn’t the Governing Body  made up of imperfect men?’
05:54 Yes, it is.
05:56 The last perfect person to walk  the earth was Jesus himself.
05:59 There is no perfect person  or organization on the globe.
06:04 But as a long-time faithful brother  used to say,
06:07 “This is the best imperfect organization  on earth.”
06:11 Jesus didn’t say  the slave would be infallible.
06:14 He said it would be  faithful and discreet.
06:18 The way we listen to  and obey the faithful slave
06:21 has a direct bearing on the strength  of our friendship with God.
06:25 In fact, it means our very life.
06:29 But what if the Governing Body
06:32 serves some spiritual food  that is not to our liking?
06:35 Or what if we do not fully understand
06:38 or agree with a clarification of a belief?
06:42 On one occasion, Jesus’ followers,  including the apostle Peter,
06:46 were confronted  with a new teaching.
06:48 How did most react?
06:50 Notice John 6:60, it states:
06:55 “When they heard this,  many of his disciples said:
06:58 ‘This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?’”
07:01 The result?
07:03 Continuing in verse 66:
07:05 “Because of this,  many of his disciples
07:08 went off to the things behind  and would no longer walk with him.”
07:13 But how did Peter respond  when Jesus asked them,
07:17 ‘Are you too stumbled?’
07:19 At John 6:68, we read:
07:21 “Simon Peter answered him:
07:24 ‘Lord, whom shall we go away to?
07:27 You have sayings of everlasting life.’”
07:30 What loyalty!
07:32 Peter’s loyalty  was based on solid evidence
07:36 that Jesus was the Messiah.
07:38 His loyalty  was evidence of his faith.
07:41 That is the kind of loyalty  we want to imitate today.
07:46 There are times we must wait on  Jehovah to clarify matters.
07:51 In the meantime,  may we prove ourselves loyal like Peter
07:55 and follow closely  the lead of the faithful slave,
07:59 who closely follow  in the footsteps of their Master, Jesus.
08:04 At times, though, we receive  counsel that touches us personally.
08:08 For instance, on JW Broadcasting  we’ve received loving reminders
08:12 from members of the Governing Body  to be forgiving,
08:16 to honor Jehovah  with our valuable things,
08:18 and to remain spiritually alert.
08:21 Through The Watchtower  and at Christian meetings,
08:24 we’re reminded to be careful  about our dress and grooming,
08:27 to choose good associates  and wholesome entertainment,
08:30 and to remain morally clean.
08:33 Are we quick to respond  and make needed adjustments
08:36 or do we find ourselves wanting  to defend our personal rights?
08:42 A situation  in the apostle Paul’s life
08:45 tested his loyalty  to theocratic direction.
08:47 It’s found in Acts chapter 21.
08:51 As you recall,  Paul arrived in Jerusalem in 56 C.E.
08:55 after a very successful missionary tour.
08:57 You can imagine his excitement  as he related in detail
09:01 “the things God did among  the nations through his ministry.”
09:04 After hearing  Paul’s extraordinary account,
09:07 the older men revealed to Paul
09:10 a problem in Judea  that involved him personally.
09:14 Read what they said  at Acts 21:21:
09:19 “But they [the Jewish believers]  have heard it rumored about you
09:23 “that you have been teaching  all the Jews
09:25 “among the nations  an apostasy from Moses,
09:29 “telling them  not to circumcise their children
09:31 or to follow the customary practices.”
09:35 Well, perhaps Paul thought,  ‘Me, an apostate?
09:39 ‘Really?  How can they say such a thing?
09:41 ‘I just finished  my third missionary tour,
09:44 and look how  Jehovah blessed the work!’
09:46 Nevertheless, the older men  gave Paul very clear direction
09:51 at Acts 21:23, 24
09:54 that he likely did not anticipate,
09:56 and there it reads:
09:58 “So do what we tell you:
10:00 “We have four men who have put  themselves under a vow.
10:03 “Take these men with you  and cleanse yourself
10:06 “ceremonially together with them  and take care of their expenses,
10:10 “so that they may have  their heads shaved.
10:12 “Then everyone will know  that there is nothing
10:14 “to the rumors  they were told about you,
10:16 but that you are walking orderly  and you are also keeping the Law.”
10:21 Was this the time  for Paul to question
10:24 their decision  or demand his rights?
10:26 He could have reasoned:
10:28 ‘Didn’t you read my letter  to the Galatians,
10:31 ‘where it says the Law was nailed  to the torture stake with Jesus?
10:34 ‘I did nothing wrong!
10:36 ‘Why do I have to put on  this pretense
10:38 just because a few  are overly sensitive?’
10:41 No.
10:43 He humbly did  as they requested,
10:45 although it  nearly cost him his life.
10:48 Yes, it meant swallowing his pride,
10:50 but Paul knew  there were bigger issues
10:52 involved than his personal rights.
10:55 He was considerate  of the consciences of others.
10:59 But more importantly,
11:01 he showed his loyalty to Jehovah  and to the governing body.
11:05 Do we see  the bigger issue in our life?
11:09 Let us be determined  to be humble,
11:12 flexible,  and obedient like Paul,
11:15 and thereby  prove ourselves faithful
11:18 to “the faithful and discreet slave.”
11:22 Third, we can be loyal to Jehovah
11:25 by being loyal to the elders.
11:27 We’ve discussed loyalty to Jehovah himself  and to the faithful slave,
11:32 but what about direction  we receive
11:34 from the elders  in our congregation?
11:37 We listen  to our elders give talks
11:39 and comments  at the meetings each week,
11:41 we work with them  in the ministry,
11:43 and we associate  with them.
11:45 This regular contact  gives us more opportunities
11:48 to see their imperfections  and flaws.
11:51 We could begin to focus  on their weaknesses,
11:55 weakening our trust  in God’s arrangement.
11:58 For example, if you zoom in
12:01 on any of our pictures  in our magazines,
12:03 all you’ll see are colored spots or pixels.
12:07 But when you zoom out,
12:09 you see a beautiful photo or painting.
12:12 Similarly, when looking at our elders,
12:15 don’t zoom in on their imperfections —the spots of ink—
12:19 rather, see the big picture.
12:22 Why, then, is it so important
12:24 to strengthen our loyalty  to our hard-working, loving shepherds?
12:28 Because these “gifts in men”
12:30 are an expression  of Jehovah’s loyal love
12:33 as they loyally lead, feed,
12:36 and protect  his precious sheep.
12:38 As the great tribulation nears,  our survival will depend
12:42 on our readiness  to respond to their direction,
12:44 as they follow  the Governing Body’s direction.
12:47 Our loyalty is not to men,
12:50 but to Jehovah’s arrangement
12:52 made up of imperfect,  but loyal men.
12:55 That is a lesson  that Korah, Dathan,
12:58 and Abiram refused to learn.
13:01 In this clip from the video  Respect Jehovah’s Authority,
13:05 listen to Korah’s defiant attitude  toward Moses
13:08 as taken  from Numbers chapter 16.
13:10 There’s Moses.
13:18 That is enough of you
13:21 because the whole assembly  are all of them holy
13:24 and Jehovah is in their midst.
13:28 Why, then, should you lift yourselves up  above the congregation of Jehovah?
13:34 Korah and the others  made great pretenses of loyalty to God,
13:38 but completely ignored the fact
13:41 that Jehovah directly appointed  Moses and Aaron.
13:45 Who, then, were  they really murmuring against?
13:49 Notice Numbers 26:9:
13:53 “This Dathan and Abiram  were chosen ones of the assembly
13:57 “who fought against Moses  and Aaron along with Korah’s group
14:00 when they fought against Jehovah.”
14:05 While focusing on the man Moses  and his imperfections,
14:09 they did not really see that it was Jehovah  who was directing the nation.
14:14 They were actually fighting  against Jehovah.
14:17 Their disloyalty to God’s appointed men cost them their lives.
14:21 But Korah’s sons  made a different choice.
14:24 In this next clip, notice an attitude  far different from their father’s.
14:29 My father and his companions
14:32 actually rebelled  against Jehovah’s authority.
14:35 Their envy, pride,  and ambition led to rebellion,
14:39 and in the end they brought  dishonor upon themselves.
14:42 My father sought glory,  but his glory was short-lived.
14:47 I’m glad, though, that my brothers  and I took the right side of the issue.
14:52 It must have been hard though.
14:55 Yes, it was.
14:57 But that helps us to understand  how important it is
15:00 that we do not allow  friendships or family
15:04 to take priority  over our relationship with Jehovah
15:07 and our obedience to him.
15:09 That’s what Father  has always told me.
15:12 Mmm, yes.
15:14 Ultimately, successful direction  for us humans
15:18 comes from Jehovah.
15:20 We should completely trust  in his choices of appointed ones.
15:24 You see, respect for those  whom Jehovah has appointed
15:28 shows respect  for Jehovah’s authority.
15:33 The loyalty displayed by Korah’s sons
15:35 moved Jehovah to act  in loyalty by sparing their lives.
15:40 What fine examples  for us to imitate!
15:43 May we never find ourselves  fighting against Jehovah
15:46 by murmuring  or complaining against those
15:49 who he has appointed  to lead his people today.
15:52 To see more  of the good and the bad examples
15:55 of loyalty  among the Israelites,
15:57 we encourage you to watch the entire  Respect Jehovah’s Authority video
16:01 on JW Broadcasting.
16:03 In review, how can we show  our loyalty to Jehovah?
16:08 First, by coming to his defense  as his Witnesses.
16:12 Second, by maintaining our loyal support
16:15 of “the faithful and discreet slave.”
16:18 And third, by loyally following direction  from the appointed elders.
16:22 As you imitate faithful examples  like the sons of Korah,
16:27 like David, Peter, and Paul,
16:29 you will prove to be someone  Jehovah views as loyal
16:33 —worthy of receiving  his acts of loyalty forever.

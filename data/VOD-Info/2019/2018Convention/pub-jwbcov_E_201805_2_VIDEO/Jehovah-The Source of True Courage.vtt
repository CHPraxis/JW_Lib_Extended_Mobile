Welcome to the 2018 “Be Courageous”!

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:10.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regional Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each year,
our convention is a highlight of our worship.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you’ve been looking forward 
to this year’s program.

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why has the Governing Body

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arranged for three days of Scriptural instruction

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the subject of courage?

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All around the earth,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are showing godly courage.

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, it can be a challenge
to do so when faced with various trials.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As world conditions worsen,

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us can expect to face

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greater tests of our courage in the future.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon this world will experience
the foretold great tribulation.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:59.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, we’ll no doubt need
to act with courage as never before.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has assigned us the vital work

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of preaching the good news.

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work is refreshing, and it brings us great joy.

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m sure you’ll agree that we need courage

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can fully accomplish our ministry,

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:22.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in difficult times.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that this convention

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will strengthen you to be courageous now

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help you to be prepared

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what lies just ahead.

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does Jehovah allow his servants

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom he loves
to face situations that call for courage?

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has the power to remove any trial.

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he could accomplish
the preaching work by another means.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider the bigger issues involved.

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan has challenged
the rightfulness of Jehovah’s rule,

00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has questioned
our motives for serving God.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By not shielding us from all trials,

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah grants us the privilege

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:10.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of making a reply to Satan.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:14.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore,
Jehovah honors us by allowing us to preach

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bear witness to His name.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:22.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 22:31, 
Jesus told Simon Peter:

00:02:22.454 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! Satan has demanded
to have all of you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sift you as wheat.”

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we fear
the Devil’s efforts to break our integrity?

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not!

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:38.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We agree with Psalm 46:1, which says:

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is our refuge and strength.”

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As loyal servants of Jehovah,

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re under the protective care

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:47.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Almighty himself.

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the next three days,

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see how Jehovah
has been a refuge for his people

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in both ancient and modern times.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:02.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll learn how Jehovah
helps us to show courage.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:06.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay careful attention
to the entire program.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah bless and reward you
for the love you show for his name.

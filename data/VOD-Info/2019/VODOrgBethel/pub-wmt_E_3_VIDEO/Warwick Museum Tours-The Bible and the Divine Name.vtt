The Bible is a modern-day treasure.

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reveals the satisfying truth about God,

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life, and our hope for the future.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s more,
it contains another priceless treasure

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—God’s personal name, Jehovah.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Jehovah preserved his name
in the Holy Scriptures,

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against all attempts to remove it,
is a fascinating story.

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s told here in the Bible Museum

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters in Warwick.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take the tour.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the museum’s entry,

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine name is shown in various languages

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a total of 7,216 times.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how many times it appears

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the New World Translation
of the Holy Scriptures.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always made his name known,
even to the very first humans.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Cain was born,
Eve declared:

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have produced a male child

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the help of Jehovah.”

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that time,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people knew and used God’s name.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The oldest example
of the divine name in Hebrew letters

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on the Moabite Stone
from the ninth century B.C.E.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moabite King Mesha
boasted against Israel:

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I took from it the vessels of Jehovah,

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offered them before Chemosh.”

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s also evidence that in ancient times

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name was used in everyday life.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:45.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This silver scroll
from the seventh century B.C.E.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the earliest known inscription

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:50.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Bible text containing God’s name.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May Jehovah bless you and keep you.

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:58.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah make his face to shine on you.”

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most important, God’s name

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was in ancient copies of the Bible text.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:06.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Fouad Papyrus

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the first century B.C.E.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a fragment of the Greek Septuagint,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first known translation

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek.

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s Deuteronomy 32:3:

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:25.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I will declare the name of Jehovah.”

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the text is in Greek,

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:31.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine name is written in Hebrew.

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greek-speaking Jews

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:36.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ day used the Septuagint.

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:40.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jesus read and taught
from the Scriptures,

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people heard him use the divine name.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:48.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, though,
by the third century C.E.,

00:02:48.022 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name was removed
from the Septuagint

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replaced with the title “Lord.”

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:55.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Vatican Codex

00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:00.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the fourth century C.E.
includes the text

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:04.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Greek Septuagint
but omits God’s name.

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:09.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:3 here reads:

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I will declare the name of the LORD.”

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:16.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t allow his name to be lost.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was never removed
from Hebrew copies of the Bible.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Aleppo Codex

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:25.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was copied by Jewish scribes

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:27.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the year 930 C.E.

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:28.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same verse,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:3, says in Hebrew:

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:36.945 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“For I will declare the name of Jehovah.”

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.947 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Still,

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:42.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for centuries, most people didn’t have

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Bible in their own language,

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor one that contained God’s name.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Latin Vulgate,

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translated around 405 C.E.,

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:55.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
omitted the divine name.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It became the official translation

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:02.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Catholic Church for over 1,000 years.

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a new technology triggered events

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:09.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would soon make
the Bible widely available

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:11.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in fresh translations

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that returned God’s name
to its rightful place.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:19.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 1453, 
Johannes Gutenberg

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produced an important edition
of the Latin Vulgate.

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the first Bible 

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:26.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
printed using movable type.

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:32.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an original page
from a Gutenberg Bible.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While only some 180 Bibles were made,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his invention sparked a printing revolution.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just 20 years later,
Anton Koberger was printing

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to 1,000 Bibles per run,

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:51.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making it the first mass-produced Bible.

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On display is an original copy

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the second edition

00:04:56.233 --> 00:05:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Koberger’s Latin Bible from 1477.

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, in the early 1500’s,

00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible scholars took a renewed interest

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the original Bible languages.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:11.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the very first time,

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:16.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the original-language Hebrew
and Greek Scriptures were printed together.

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:19.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Complutensian Polyglot,

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
printed between 1514 and 1517.

00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:25.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A polyglot is a book

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:29.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with text in several languages
arranged in columns.

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:32.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Complutensian Polyglot,

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:34.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible text appears in Latin,

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:38.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comparing the Hebrew text with the Latin,

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:44.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scholars could see where God’s name

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:48.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been replaced
in the Latin Vulgate with “LORD.”

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:54.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would seeing the divine name
in the original Hebrew text

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:56.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lead Bible translators to restore

00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:59.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name in their translations?

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, some did!

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1551,

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:07.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sebastian Castellio published

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his fresh Latin translation of the Bible.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He appears to be the first

00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:14.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use God’s name consistently

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:16.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a Latin translation

00:06:16.563 --> 00:06:18.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:21.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translations into other languages

00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:23.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were also using God’s name.

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:27.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1530, William Tyndale

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:29.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published his English translation

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Genesis through Deuteronomy.

00:06:31.453 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the first time

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:35.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the divine name appeared

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:37.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in any English Bible.

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:40.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The popular Reina-Valera Spanish Bible

00:06:40.504 --> 00:06:43.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was published in 1602.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contains the divine name

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:47.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:53.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a rare original first edition

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the English King James Version

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:59.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Bible, published in 1611.

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It uses the name Jehovah

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:03.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just four passages.

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, the King James Version became

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:09.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most widely printed book in the world.

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:11.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some 200 years later,

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:13.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Benjamin Boothroyd,

00:07:13.537 --> 00:07:15.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a minister and Hebrew scholar,

00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:19.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set out to revise the King James Version.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:22.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His 1817 translation

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the first English Bible

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:26.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use the divine name throughout

00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:28.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile, church missionaries

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:34.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were taking the Bible to new lands.

00:07:34.474 --> 00:07:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But without the divine name,
people couldn’t distinguish

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

The Chinese Delegate’s Version from 1854

that uses God’s name throughout

the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:05.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, there was

00:08:05.797 --> 00:08:08.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one more place where God’s name

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:11.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not yet restored

00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:13.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:08:13.597 --> 00:08:16.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Nuremberg Polyglot,

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
published by Elias Hutter in 1599.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It contains the Christian Greek Scriptures

in 12 languages, including Hebrew.

“Blessed is the one who comes
in Jehovah’s name.”

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:40.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his Hebrew translation of the Gospel,

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:44.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hutter preserved the divine name
in the quotation

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Psalms.

00:08:45.754 --> 00:08:49.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did this in many other places
in the Greek Scriptures.

00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:52.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translators had a precedent

00:08:52.636 --> 00:08:56.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use God’s name
in the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:08:56.848 --> 00:09:00.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the name appeared
in verses quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures.

Its translators benefited

00:09:30.715 --> 00:09:33.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the scholarly work of those before them

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:38.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had chosen to preserve God’s name

about his works, his qualities,

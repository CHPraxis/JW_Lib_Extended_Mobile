00:00:01 How heartwarming it’s been
00:00:03 to see millions take their stand for true worship!
00:00:07 Thousands more are joining us every week.
00:00:11 Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering work,
00:00:14 and this makes us very happy.
00:00:17 But who will work to provide the Bibles,
00:00:20 Bible literature, and the audio and video publications
00:00:24 that sustain us spiritually and help us to accomplish
00:00:27 our Kingdom preaching and teaching work?
00:00:31 Bethel is a unique place.
00:00:34 It’s where mature Christians render sacred service to Jehovah
00:00:39 in close association with Christ’s brothers.
00:00:42 They minister to the needs of our worldwide brotherhood
00:00:46 and support the preaching work.
00:00:49 The Bethel family is a group
00:00:51 of dedicated, baptized servants of Jehovah
00:00:55 who live and work together closely.
00:00:58 So they experience in a special way
00:01:01 what Psalm 133:1 says:
00:01:04 “Look! How good and how pleasant it is
00:01:09 for brothers to dwell together in unity!”
00:01:12 We’re very pleased to see that many
00:01:15 have expanded their service to Jehovah
00:01:18 by making themselves available
00:01:20 for the special privilege of Bethel service.
00:01:23 Have you considered this as a goal?
00:01:28 Making yourself available for Bethel service
00:01:31 is like knocking on a door that leads to many other privileges of service.
00:01:35 Of course, to serve at Bethel requires
00:01:38 a self-sacrificing spirit
00:01:41 and a willingness to serve wherever there is a need,
00:01:44 in harmony with the attitude displayed by the prophet Isaiah
00:01:47 at Isaiah 6:8:
00:01:49 “Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying:
00:01:53 “‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’
00:01:57 And I said: ‘Here I am! Send me!’”
00:02:02 When Isaiah learned about an opportunity to do more in Jehovah’s service,
00:02:07 he responded eagerly, even though he did not know exactly
00:02:11 what he was going to be assigned to do.
00:02:13 It was enough for him to know that Jehovah was extending an invitation
00:02:17 to serve in a special way,
00:02:19 and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.
00:02:22 The same spirit is shown by Bethel family members worldwide.
00:02:28 What especially motivates so many to serve at Bethel?
00:02:32 Love for Jehovah moves us
00:02:34 to put Kingdom interests ahead of self-interest.
00:02:38 As stated in the Proclaimers  book, page 295:
00:02:42 “This is not work in which they gain
00:02:44 “personal prominence or material possessions.
00:02:47 “Their desire is to honor Jehovah, and they are satisfied
00:02:51 “with the provisions made for them in the way of food, lodging,
00:02:55 and a modest [allowance] for personal expenses.”
00:02:59 Are there any rewards that come from serving in this unique way?
00:03:03 Those who have offered themselves willingly for Bethel service
00:03:07 have truly been blessed.
00:03:11 The love and unity we feel here
00:03:13 is incomparable.
00:03:15 It’s not like in a company out in the world
00:03:17 because here you can work with your friends every day.
00:03:23 Like-minded people have the same goals
00:03:25 and support each other.
00:03:26 That is what you can feel here.
00:03:29 Maybe you’re assigned a task
00:03:31 that you’ve never performed before,
00:03:33 but there are many experienced brothers and sisters who can help
00:03:36 —professionally as well as personally.
00:03:40 Whether it is the consideration
00:03:42 of the daily text or the Watchtower  Study
00:03:44 with the Bethel family,
00:03:45 listening to the practical, valuable comments of our brothers and sisters
00:03:49 is really refreshing.
00:03:51 You really feel that they love Jehovah,
00:03:53 and their comments help you to feel the same.
00:03:57 Here in Bethel, you have
00:03:59 the best Employer that there is—Jehovah.
00:04:01 No other employer is as grateful and considerate as he is,
00:04:05 so out of love for Jehovah, you’re simply happy to give him your best.
00:04:10 Whenever I think
00:04:11 about what is being done at Bethel
00:04:13 —publications are being produced
00:04:15 and shipped,
00:04:16 videos for our conventions are being made,
00:04:18 and translation is being done into so many different languages—
00:04:23 I keep getting goose bumps.
00:04:25 No matter what I can do here,
00:04:27 knowing that by doing it
00:04:29 I am supporting Christ’s brothers
00:04:31 makes me feel very, very good.
00:04:34 So how does a young person qualify for Bethel service?
00:04:39 My parents raised me to have a spiritual focus.
00:04:43 So during the school holidays and growing up,
00:04:47 our life revolved around the ministry
00:04:50 —doing spiritual activities.
00:04:52 And it really helped us
00:04:53 keep focused spiritually as a family
00:04:56 and helped me stay focused
00:04:58 on the goals that I wanted to achieve.
00:05:01 I really enjoy reading,
00:05:04 and one day my Dad just said to me, “Why don’t you read the Bible?”
00:05:08 And I know it sounds obvious, but at that point, I had never read it
00:05:10 from Genesis to Revelation.
00:05:13 So when I finished reading the Bible,
00:05:15 it really changed my thinking,
00:05:18 and it really proved the truth to me.
00:05:23 And this helped me to keep a spiritual focus,
00:05:27 and it really was the first step
00:05:31 in reaching out and achieving the spiritual goals that I wanted to achieve.
00:05:35 In the congregation, I was able to help out
00:05:38 with doing the magazines and the sound and the platform.
00:05:41 And these privileges really helped me
00:05:44 to build a good work ethic
00:05:46 and to give in many ways, so that I could give more to Jehovah.
00:05:51 So the elders used to work with me a lot in the ministry.
00:05:54 So when I felt that ‘I can’t do this’
00:05:58 or ‘This is too much’ or ‘It’s too overwhelming’
00:06:00 or ‘I’ll never be able to reach this goal,’
00:06:02 an elder showed me a scripture in the Bible
00:06:06 where Jehovah was encouraging Joshua to be courageous.
00:06:11 And that really impacted me,
00:06:13 so that I was able to be courageous, too,
00:06:16 and to reach my goal of Bethel.
00:06:19 So when I visited Bethel, I saw that they were normal people,
00:06:24 and they had so many good qualities
00:06:28 that I wanted to imitate
00:06:30 —very hospitable, very warm, very inviting.
00:06:35 That helped me to want to reach my goal, so that I could be like them.
00:06:41 To serve at Bethel, there are qualifications that need to be met.
00:06:45 You should have a deep love for Jehovah
00:06:48 and the organization,
00:06:49 which is demonstrated by living
00:06:51 in harmony with Bible standards.
00:06:53 You must have a fine reputation
00:06:56 as a spiritual person.
00:06:58 You should have respect
00:07:00 for Jehovah’s moral standards,
00:07:02 avoiding uncleanness and sexual immorality.
00:07:05 You should have a clean conscience
00:07:07 before Jehovah
00:07:08 and be at peace with yourself
00:07:10 and with Jehovah’s organization.
00:07:13 Your dress and grooming
00:07:14 should be exemplary,
00:07:16 befitting a Christian minister
00:07:18 even during leisure time.
00:07:20 Styles that are faddish or extreme
00:07:23 or that identify us
00:07:25 with undesirable elements of the world
00:07:27 are not acceptable at Bethel.
00:07:31 The applicant would not read, listen to,
00:07:34 or view any type of material
00:07:36 that is inappropriate for a Christian.
00:07:39 Such unwholesome material
00:07:40 certainly would include pornography,
00:07:43 debasing music,
00:07:44 or any kind of entertainment
00:07:46 that features sexual immorality,
00:07:49 spiritism, or violence.
00:07:52 Bethel applicants should be
00:07:54 from 19 to 35 years of age.
00:07:57 Occasionally, there is an opening
00:07:59 for someone over 35 years of age
00:08:02 who may have specialized skills
00:08:04 that are needed at Bethel,
00:08:05 such as those with certain technical
00:08:07 or medical experience,
00:08:09 translation skills,
00:08:11 or building trades such as plumbing,
00:08:14 electrical, heavy equipment mechanics,
00:08:17 or carpentry.
00:08:18 Those with such capabilities and training
00:08:21 are welcome to apply.
00:08:24 In view of the unique demands
00:08:26 of a full-time assignment at Bethel,
00:08:28 you should be mentally
00:08:30 and emotionally sound,
00:08:31 physically strong,
00:08:33 and able to work long hours.
00:08:36 You should be able to read, write, and speak
00:08:38 the primary language of the branch territory.
00:08:42 This will enable you to communicate well
00:08:44 with others serving at Bethel,
00:08:46 to receive needed training,
00:08:48 and to work safely in the Bethel environment.
00:08:52 Bethel applicants agree to serve
00:08:54 for a minimum of one year,
00:08:56 during which time you will receive training
00:08:58 for continued Bethel service.
00:09:02 With regard to secular skills, we do not encourage individuals
00:09:05 to obtain university education or training
00:09:09 with the thought that this will improve their chances of being called into Bethel.
00:09:14 The best way to prepare for Bethel service
00:09:17 is to first serve in the full-time pioneer ministry.
00:09:22 The greatest need is for single brothers.
00:09:24 However, all who meet the qualifications, including sisters,
00:09:28 are encouraged to apply for temporary volunteer service.
00:09:32 Serving as a temporary volunteer at Bethel
00:09:35 may open the way to other opportunities to expand your service to Jehovah.
00:09:40 If you are interested in applying for Bethel service,
00:09:43 you should make your desire known to your Congregation Service Committee,
00:09:47 who will provide you access to the online applications
00:09:50 by means of my.jw.org.
00:09:54 However,
00:09:55 which application should you complete,
00:09:57 since there are two types of applications available?
00:10:01 First give careful and prayerful consideration
00:10:04 to your circumstances.
00:10:06 Thereafter, decide whether you will complete
00:10:08 the Application for Volunteer Program (A-19),
00:10:12 which is available for those interested
00:10:14 in serving on a temporary basis
00:10:16 for as brief as one week or as long
00:10:18 as several consecutive months.
00:10:20 Or you may decide to complete
00:10:22 the Application to Become a Member of the Worldwide Order
00:10:26 of Special Full-Time Servants of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:10:29 (A-8).
00:10:31 This application is for those interested
00:10:33 in serving on a long-term basis
00:10:35 for one full year or longer.
00:10:38 If the Branch Committee determines
00:10:40 that there is a need for your services,
00:10:43 they will decide where you can best be used,
00:10:46 whether at Bethel or perhaps on a theocratic construction assignment.
00:10:51 Submitting your application may open a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah
00:10:55 and his organization in a variety of ways.
00:11:01 Of course, not all of us who have
00:11:04 such a self-sacrificing spirit
00:11:07 have the circumstances in life to serve at Bethel.
00:11:11 But we can encourage others who do.
00:11:14 Parents, follow the example of God-fearing parents
00:11:19 such as Hannah and Elkanah,
00:11:22 who willingly made their son available
00:11:25 for expanded theocratic privileges.
00:11:28 Continue to place the goal of Bethel service before your young ones,
00:11:33 and stimulate their interest in the full-time ministry
00:11:36 by your example and your positive expressions.
00:11:41 If possible,
00:11:43 bring them on a tour of world headquarters in New York, U.S.A.,
00:11:47 or make arrangements to bring them on a tour of the Bethel
00:11:51 in the branch territory in which you live.
00:11:55 Such visits can help young ones to witness firsthand
00:11:59 the work that’s being done at Bethel to promote Kingdom interests.
00:12:04 Elders, help young ones in your congregation
00:12:07 who have the potential to expand their service to Jehovah
00:12:11 to meet the qualifications.
00:12:14 Jehovah continues to look for those
00:12:16 willing to respond to his invitation
00:12:19 to expand their service to him.
00:12:22 As in Isaiah’s day, He asks:
00:12:24 “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
00:12:29 Will you answer as did the prophet:
00:12:31 “Here I am! Send me!”
00:12:35 We encourage you to progress to spiritual maturity
00:12:38 and serve Jehovah whole-souled.
00:12:41 In due time, you may qualify to serve at Bethel
00:12:44 or in another form of exciting theocratic service
00:12:48 that permits you to use the health and strength that Jehovah has granted you
00:12:52 in an expanded way, all to his praise.
00:12:58 Please be assured that we love you for the willing spirit you show
00:13:03 as you continue to reach out in Jehovah’s service.

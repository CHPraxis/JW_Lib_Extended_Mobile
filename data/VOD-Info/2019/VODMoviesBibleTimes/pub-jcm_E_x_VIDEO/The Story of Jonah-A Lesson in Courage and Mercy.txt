00:12 I thought I would find you here.
00:14 Joanna, my sister.
00:16 Please sit.
00:27 Listen to this:
00:31 “You are a holy people to Jehovah your God,
00:35 “and Jehovah your God  has chosen you to become his people,
00:40 “his special property,
00:42 out of all the peoples  who are on the face of the earth.”
00:45 The words of Moses,
00:47 speaking to our people  before they entered this land.
00:49 Yes.  And just before that,
00:51 he told them to destroy  all the idols of the Canaanites.
00:58 I wonder if there are more idols  in the land now than there were then.
01:02 At every turn,  our people bow and pray to them.
01:07 You’re doing all you can.
01:10 How dare you promote this filth!
01:11 But they don’t listen.
01:12 The true God . . .
01:13 Stop right there.
01:13 I listen.
01:14 Moses came down from the mountain.
01:15 Stop talking.
01:16 And I think you’re great.
01:21 You’re like Elijah.
01:23 I’m surprised Jehovah uses me at all.
01:26 Well, I’m not.
01:28 You always want to do the right thing.
01:30 It makes us proud.
02:03 Jonah!
02:06 Jonah!
02:11 Ye—  Yes, my Lord.
02:13 Get up,
02:15 go to Nineveh the great city,
02:17 and proclaim judgment against her,
02:20 for their wickedness  has come to my attention.
02:25 Nineveh?
02:28 Nineveh.
02:32 They deserve to die.
02:33 It’s not his responsibility.
02:33 He’s just going to get himself killed.
02:35 You need to talk to him.
02:36 Someone needs to talk to him.
02:48 We’ve prepared a meal for you.
02:51 I’m not hungry.
02:54 They haven’t spoken a word to me in hours.
02:56 Your brothers are young, Jonah.
02:59 The news you brought to us this morning
03:03 —it was heavy.
03:04 What did your brothers say?
03:09 Izliah is afraid they will kill me;
03:11 skin me alive.
03:13 He doesn’t think they should even be warned.
03:15 Just let Jehovah slaughter them all.
03:20 And Eber doesn’t believe they will listen.
03:23 What do you think?
03:26 I think that if it’s Jehovah’s will  to destroy them,
03:29 he wouldn’t have commanded me to go.
03:33 But I do think Eber is right.
03:36 Why would they listen?
03:37 Our own people don’t listen.
03:39 And yet the warning still goes out.
03:42 But when has Jehovah  ever asked a prophet to go to a foreign land
03:46 to preach judgment against it?
03:50 Jonah, I—
03:53 I don’t have all the answers.
03:56 To be sent to declare judgment  in the heart of Assyria,
03:59 it’s unlike anything Jehovah  has asked of his prophets to do before.
04:03 But if it’s Jehovah’s will  that you should go,
04:06 then you should go.
04:09 He must have good reason  for sending you there.
04:13 Trust him.
04:17 Jonah!
04:18 Jonah!
04:19 Jonah, look!
04:21 I got figs!
04:23 I’m going to pack you some cakes too.
04:25 I wish I could go with you.
04:39 Izliah is afraid they will kill me;
04:41 skin me alive.
05:30 You’re leaving without saying good-bye?
05:33 You need to go back inside, Joanna.
05:35 But we had things prepared for you!
05:38 You’ll need them in Nineveh.
05:43 You’re not going to Nineveh, are you?
05:45 No, Tarshish.
05:48 No, Jonah!
05:49 That’s the wrong way!  Go back!
05:50 We can talk to Father!
05:52 Joanna!
05:54 I can’t go to Nineveh.
05:56 I just can’t do it.
05:58 But what will you do in Tarshish?
06:00 When will you be back?
06:02 I don’t know, maybe never.
06:06 Never?
06:08 Then who’s going to Nineveh?
06:11 Who’s going to tell them what Jehovah said?
06:13 I’m sorry, Joanna.
06:15 I don’t know what Jehovah will do.
06:17 But I just can’t do it.
06:19 It’s too much.
06:20 He doesn’t need me anyway.
06:22 We need you.
06:23 And you’re Jehovah’s prophet.
06:26 You’re like Elijah.
06:27 Remember?
06:29 Not anymore.
06:32 Go home, Joanna.
06:33 I’m sorry.
06:51 If it’s Jehovah’s will  that you should go,
06:54 then you should go.
07:21 Trust him.
08:48 Look!
08:55 By the gods.
08:57 Furl the sail!
09:02 Fasten those lines, men!
09:03 Hatches!
09:07 Brace yourselves!
09:20 Secure the cargo!
09:33 Turn into the wave!
09:36 Turn into the wave!
10:11 Captain, we’re taking on too much water!
10:14 Throw the cargo overboard!
10:17 All of it! Now!
10:24 Get it over!
10:28 It’s no use!
10:30 This storm is from the gods!
10:32 Baal!
10:33 Eshmun!
10:35 Melqart!
10:41 Help us!
10:42 Help us!
10:43 Where is the passenger?
10:47 He’s down below!
10:49 He’s down below.
10:51 Please! Save us! Help us!
10:56 Why are you sleeping?
10:57 Get up, call out to your god!
10:59 Perhaps the true God  will show his concern for us,
11:02 and we will not perish.
11:08 Save us! Help us!
11:09 Please, help us, Melqart!
11:11 Please, help us! Baal!
11:13 Save us! Save us! Baal!
11:14 Deliver us! Baal!
11:15 Let’s cast lots to find out  who is to blame for this calamity!
11:28 It’s him!
11:35 Why has this calamity come upon us?
11:37 It is from the true and living God.
11:42 He has brought this storm because of me.
11:44 Where do you come from?
11:46 What is your country?
11:47 From what people are you?
11:48 I am a Hebrew,
11:49 and I fear Jehovah the God of the heavens,
11:53 the One who made the sea and the dry land.
11:56 I am—  I was his prophet.
11:59 What have you done?
12:01 He told me to go to Nineveh  and deliver a message.
12:04 Instead, I ran away.
12:06 What must we do to you
12:07 to make the sea calm down for us?
12:10 What must we do?
12:14 Lift me up and throw me into the sea,
12:17 and the sea will calm down for you;
12:19 for I know that it is because of me
12:22 that this violent storm has come upon you.
12:27 Let’s do it!
12:28 He’ll die!
12:30 If we kill Jehovah’s prophet,  what will He do to us?
12:33 If Jehovah wants him in Nineveh,
12:35 won’t He be angered  if we throw him overboard?
12:42 Take to the oars, men.
12:43 Row for your lives!
12:55 There’s the land over there.
12:58 Hurry!
12:59 Row!
13:01 Row!
13:04 It’s no use.
13:05 We have to do what Jonah said.
13:22 Jehovah, may we not perish  because of this man.
13:27 Do not hold us responsible  for innocent blood,
13:30 since you have done as you pleased,  O Jehovah.
14:14 He gave his life for us.
14:17 Our gods did nothing.
14:22 We should sacrifice  to his God for sparing us.
14:52 How am I still alive?
14:56 What will become of me?
15:02 O Jehovah,
15:05 out of the depths of the Grave,
15:08 I cry to you for help.
15:11 Please hear my voice.
15:15 I know I have been driven  away from your sight!
15:20 How will I gaze again upon your holy temple?
15:28 Oh, may my prayer come in to you.
15:33 With a voice of thanksgiving  I will sacrifice to you.
15:40 What I have vowed, I will pay.
16:16 Hey!
16:18 Hey, are you OK?
16:24 What happened?
16:25 Are there others?
16:28 We’re here to help.
16:30 What is your name?
16:34 Jonah.
16:37 My name is Jonah.
16:38 Grab his other arm;  we need to get him to the house.
17:01 Papa says you are a prophet.
17:09 I was a prophet.
17:11 Papa says that you  were swallowed by a big fish.
17:15 Yes.
17:16 Why would a fish swallow you?
17:19 Well, I was in the water.
17:21 Why where you in the water?
17:24 I was on a ship;
17:26 then I was in the water.
17:28 Why were you on a ship?
17:37 Because I tried to run away from Jehovah.
17:44 When you were in the fish, were you scared?
17:47 Yes.
17:49 Did you pray a lot?
17:54 Yes.
17:57 Why did you pray to God  if you were running away from him?
18:47 Father!
18:49 It’s Jonah!
18:50 He’s back!
18:52 Jonah!
18:53 Joanna.
18:54 I thought I wouldn’t see you again.
18:57 I thought you wouldn’t be back.
18:59 I’m so sorry, Joanna.
19:00 Please forgive me.
19:01 Father waited for you to come home every day.
19:04 He never gave up hope.
19:08 What happened?
19:16 A fish?
19:19 How is that possible?
19:22 It was a miracle, Izliah.
19:25 Jehovah saved you.
19:28 So, what will you do now?
19:33 I don’t know.
19:38 I think it’s time  for everyone to get some rest.
19:41 We can talk more tomorrow.
19:44 Jonah,
19:46 I’m sorry about the things  I said before you left.
19:49 I didn’t realize . . .
19:50 It’s no matter, Izliah.
19:55 My decision to run was my own.
19:57 Thank you.
20:08 It’s good to have you back.
20:14 Oh, thank you.
20:17 Thank you.
20:24 I’m still proud of you.
20:27 Sleep well, my son.
20:30 Father?
20:33 Yes?
20:35 I can’t stop thinking  about those men on that ship,
20:37 all the cargo they lost,
20:41 the fear in their eyes.
20:44 What if they didn’t survive?
20:47 I put them in danger.
20:50 Disobedience often hurts others, Jonah,
20:55 not just ourselves.
20:58 We’ll pray for those men.
21:01 Do you think Jehovah will ever use me again?
21:04 He’s shown you mercy, Jonah.
21:07 He brought you home.
21:09 Let’s be content with that for now.
21:15 Father,
21:20 I’m sorry.
21:23 I know, my son.
21:25 I know.
21:27 Let’s try to get some rest.
21:48 Jonah!
21:53 My Lord!
21:58 I am so sorry.
22:01 I am so sorry.
22:03 Get up,
22:07 go to Nineveh the great city,
22:09 and proclaim to her the message
22:11 that I tell you.
22:16 Yes.
22:17 Yes.
22:18 Thank you.
22:21 I will do as you command.
22:49 May Jehovah be with you, my son.
22:51 He saved me from the heart of the sea;
22:54 he can save me again in the days ahead.
23:01 Here, I made these cakes for you.
23:03 Thank you, Joanna.
23:09 How long will it take you to get to Nineveh?
23:12 If all goes well, maybe 40 days.
23:14 May it go well.
23:17 Thanks.
24:21 Where are you traveling to?
24:23 Nineveh.
24:25 Really?
24:27 I was just there.
24:28 Hmm.
24:28 I was selling some horses.
24:30 I’ll tell you this,  I’m glad to be going home.
24:34 You should really be careful over there.
24:36 That’s what I’ve heard.
24:40 Tell me about it.
24:42 Well, the city is huge.
24:44 It would probably take you  three days to walk around it.
24:48 The chariots —they’re the best in the world.
24:52 And the horses . . .
24:53 Hmm.
24:53 The horses are magnificent.
24:57 What about the people?
25:00 The people—
25:03 They worship gods of war.
25:05 What do you think they’re like?
25:08 They love conquest and violence;
25:11 it’s like bread to them.
25:13 That’s comforting.
25:15 Hey, don’t worry.
25:17 Just don’t attract any attention to yourself.
25:20 Stick to your business,   and you’ll be just fine.
25:25 What is your business anyway?
25:33 I’m a prophet of Jehovah.
25:36 He’s sending me  to proclaim judgment against it.
27:05 Same thing again?
27:07 It’s your fault!
27:13 Hello there, Foreigner.
27:15 Where are you going, Foreigner?
27:35 Hey! Stop! Stop!
27:42 My food!
27:44 Somebody help me!
27:51 Thank you.
28:30 What about the people?
28:31 They worship gods of war.
28:34 What do you think they’re like?
29:02 In— in just 40 days more,
29:07 Nineveh will be overthrown.
29:20 In just 40 days more,
29:24 Nineveh will be overthrown!
29:39 Who’s the foreigner?
29:43 In just 40 days more,
29:46 Nineveh will be overthrown!
29:56 In just 40 days more,  Nineveh will be overthrown.
29:59 Who can possibly overthrow our city?
30:00 Is he crazy?
30:02 He looks like an Israelite.
30:04 The true God has spoken.
30:17 The great violence of this city  has come to the attention of the true God.
30:19 Jehovah, the true God, has spoken.
30:22 This city will be destroyed.
30:24 Nineveh will be overthrown.
30:27 Jehovah, the true God, has spoken.
30:30 Your city will be destroyed.
30:32 In 35 days,
30:34 this city will be destroyed.
30:36 Nineveh will be overthrown.
30:40 This city will be destroyed.
30:47 We can’t just leave everything.
30:48 What should we do?
30:49 Listen!
30:50 He is a prophet  of the Israelite God, Jehovah.
30:52 What should we do?  Should we flee the city?
30:54 We can’t just leave everything.
30:55 Leave our homes?
30:57 Where should we go?
31:03 Listen.
31:04 If we repent,
31:05 maybe his God will have mercy on us.
31:16 According to the prophet,
31:17 there are only 20 days left  until the destruction of the city.
31:21 Throughout the city,  people are fasting and putting on sackcloth.
31:24 They are asking the prophet  how Jehovah wants them to behave,
31:27 and they’re trying to do as he says.
31:30 Is that what Jonah is telling them to do?
31:32 No, the people simply reason  that because there’s a warning
31:36 and time before calamity strikes,
31:38 maybe this God will change his mind.
31:43 What else have we learned about Jonah?
31:46 A Ninevite reported  overhearing a conversation of Jonah’s.
31:50 It seems he originally chose not to come.
31:53 Instead, he fled to Tarshish  but was thrown overboard.
31:57 Then he claims Jehovah sent a fish  to swallow him and bring him back.
32:02 Is he insane?
32:04 Maybe not.
32:06 This man speaks for the God of Israel
32:09 —a God of miracles,
32:11 known for his greatness and his power.
32:13 He might be powerful in Israel,  but we have our own gods here.
32:16 True, but Jehovah is the one responsible
32:19 for humiliating the gods of Egypt,
32:23 even destroying their army in the Red Sea.
32:26 He’s also the One  who brought about the great Flood
32:29 mentioned in our histories.
32:31 He did this because the people of the time
32:34 were extremely violent.
32:41 Call my scribe.
32:43 Help us, please!
32:44 Save us!
32:46 I cannot accept gifts and bribes.
32:49 Jehovah has spoken.
32:58 In 10 days more,
33:00 the true God will overthrow Nineveh!
33:06 The true God has spoken.
33:15 The violence of the city  has come to the attention of the true God.
33:20 The true God has spoken.
33:21 Nineveh will be overthrown.
33:23 The city will be destroyed.
33:34 Hear the word of the king, people of Nineveh.
33:37 Hear the word of the king!
33:40 “By the decree of the king and his nobles:
33:43 “No man or beast,
33:46 “herd or flock, should eat anything at all.
33:50 “They should not take food,
33:53 “nor should they drink any water.
33:56 “Let them be covered with sackcloth,
33:58 “both man and beast;
34:01 “and let them call out earnestly to God
34:04 “and turn from their evil ways
34:07 “and from the violence they practice.
34:11 “Who knows whether the true God
34:13 “may reconsider what he intends to do
34:16 “and turn from his burning anger,
34:19 so that we may not perish?”
34:27 In three days,  Nineveh will be overthrown!
34:35 Jehovah has spoken!
34:37 Nineveh will be overthrown!
35:22 Something should be happening;
35:25 there’s nothing.
35:27 Would Jehovah actually pardon the city?
35:33 No.
35:35 No, that’s not possible.
35:40 How could Jehovah change his mind?
35:46 What will these people think of me?
35:48 What good is a prophet  if his words don’t come true?
35:54 Was this not my concern  when I was in my own land?
35:58 That is why I tried to flee
36:00 to Tarshish in the first place;
36:03 for I knew that you are  a compassionate and merciful God,
36:07 slow to anger  and abundant in loyal love,
36:10 and one who feels grieved over calamity.
36:14 O Jehovah, please take away my life,
36:18 for it is better for me to die than to live.
36:33 Is it right for you to be so angry?
36:38 I must leave the city.
36:42 We know you are a prophet of the true God.
36:44 We have faith that you speak truth.
36:46 Please, stay in our home.
36:47 No.
36:48 We will make you comfortable.
36:49 I will not stay in this city.
37:12 Still nothing?
39:28 This plant grew so quickly.
39:36 Jehovah still cares for me.
41:31 O Jehovah, let me die.
41:37 Take my life.
41:44 It is better
41:47 for me to die than to live.
41:53 Is it right for you to be so angry  over the bottle-gourd plant?
42:02 I have a right to be angry,
42:05 so angry that I want to die.
42:09 You felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant,
42:11 which you did not work for,
42:14 nor did you make it grow;
42:16 it grew in one night  and perished in one night.
42:20 Should I not also feel sorry  for Nineveh the great city,
42:24 in which there are more than 120,000 men
42:29 who do not even know right from wrong,
42:32 as well as their many animals?
43:38 Are you Jonah?
43:40 I am.
43:41 Mommy says you saved us.
43:45 No, Jehovah saved you.
43:49 I was just—
43:53 I was just a messenger.
43:55 Thank you.
44:13 What are you doing?
44:17 I’ve written about Nineveh
44:20 but also about Jehovah’s great mercy
44:23 both to the people there and to me.
44:28 Was it hard to write about all that?
44:30 Painful.
44:32 So, what will you do now?
44:36 Whatever Jehovah asks me to do.

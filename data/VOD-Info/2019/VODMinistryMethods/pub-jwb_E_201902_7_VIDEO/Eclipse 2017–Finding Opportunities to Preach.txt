00:00:00 ‎An exciting event took place
00:00:04 ‎in 2017 across the United States.
00:00:07 ‎August 21, 2017,
00:00:08 ‎has been on a lot of people’s calendars
00:00:10 ‎for a long time because of the total eclipse.
00:00:13 ‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses,  ‎we are constantly on the lookout
00:00:16 ‎for events where we can support ‎community outreach.
00:00:19 ‎Brothers and sisters
00:00:21 ‎prepared well in advance ‎to give a Bible education
00:00:23 ‎to the many travelers.
00:00:26 ‎What convinced us  ‎that this was an opportunity
00:00:29 ‎to give a great witness  ‎was that we did a little research,
00:00:31 ‎and we noticed the hotel bookings.
00:00:34 ‎The town was packed,
00:00:36 ‎so we could tell  ‎that this was going to be a big event.
00:00:38 ‎We needed to do something.
00:00:40 ‎We wanted to be in a position to share
00:00:43 ‎the wonderful things from the Bible with them.
00:00:45 ‎We needed to take a global approach.
00:00:47 ‎We had to identify ‎all the resources in Bend
00:00:50 ‎and not just do it  ‎by individual congregation.
00:00:52 ‎So in our campaign we decided ‎to feature three primary tools:
00:00:56 ‎first, What Does the Bible Really Teach? ‎because many people wonder;
00:01:00 ‎second, Was Life Created?  ‎because with an eclipse event,
00:01:04 ‎people are thinking about the universe, ‎and it’s a good opportunity
00:01:08 ‎to talk about our Creator;
00:01:10 ‎and third,
00:01:11 ‎jw.org,
00:01:13 ‎since we expect a lot of visitors ‎from all over the world,
00:01:16 ‎we can reach them in their language.
00:01:18 ‎Over 200 brothers and sisters ‎attended two seminars
00:01:22 ‎put on by local brothers to help prepare ‎individuals for the massive campaign.
00:01:27 ‎We had examples  ‎of what not to do and what to do
00:01:32 ‎so as to benefit  ‎as many people as possible.
00:01:36 ‎We had an interview;
00:01:38 ‎we had demonstrations on how to speak ‎to people in different languages.
00:01:43 ‎We’re expecting people ‎from many different parts of the world.
00:01:47 ‎It’s actually an opportunity
00:01:49 ‎to be like a missionary ‎in our own hometown.
00:01:53 ‎Some of the estimates  ‎that we have heard are conservative estimates
00:01:56 ‎of probably 200,000 visitors.
00:01:58 ‎It may be more than that.
00:02:01 ‎The local congregations ‎made themselves available
00:02:03 ‎to work with city officials
00:02:05 ‎to prepare the parks ‎for the large influx of people.
00:02:09 ‎So many of Jehovah’s Witnesses ‎have volunteered
00:02:11 ‎to help with all kinds of things.
00:02:14 ‎These are really small communities ‎that are having a very large influx of people.
00:02:18 ‎So all of that extra effort
00:02:20 ‎and help in kind of preparing and cleaning up
00:02:23 ‎is much appreciated.
00:02:25 ‎We have been working with Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:02:27 ‎for a period of years here at Smith Rock.
00:02:30 ‎It’s been a good experience  ‎for our staff and our volunteers,
00:02:33 ‎and we want to accommodate that ‎in any way we can.
00:02:35 ‎There’s been a lot of good things ‎happening with cart witnessing.
00:02:38 ‎One of the friends had a nice experience ‎with an Arabic-speaking man,
00:02:43 ‎and she said the seminar  ‎is what helped her to be prepared.
00:02:46 ‎She knew how to work the app,
00:02:48 ‎how to find the video in the language,
00:02:50 ‎and she already  ‎had it downloaded and ready to go.
00:02:53 ‎Paul spoke about his ministry.
00:02:56 ‎He said: “Woe is me  ‎if I did not declare the good news!”
00:02:59 ‎So we don’t want to look back ‎and wish we would’ve done more.
00:03:05 ‎Trying it for the first time can be scary.
00:03:06 ‎It can be nerve-racking,
00:03:07 ‎but it’s not so scary after you get started.
00:03:11 ‎What’s really been fun ‎is what we are calling roving.
00:03:15 ‎We go into an area  ‎where there are a lot of people,
00:03:18 ‎and we just start conversations.
00:03:20 ‎We don’t carry any literature.
00:03:22 ‎We just have our device
00:03:24 ‎and the jw.org contact card.
00:03:26 ‎And then, hopefully,  ‎if the opportunity presents itself,
00:03:30 ‎we may share with them a video
00:03:32 ‎or tell them ‎we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:35 ‎It’s just been a paradise for them
00:03:36 ‎—a preaching paradise— ‎all these visitors coming in.
00:03:39 ‎We may not see the results
00:03:41 ‎of the seed that was planted ‎when they took a look at our cart,
00:03:44 ‎but Jehovah knows
00:03:46 ‎and the angels know ‎and can make that grow.
00:03:50 ‎This endeavor  ‎has really helped me to appreciate
00:03:53 ‎the need to be alert  ‎to ways to expand our ministry.
00:03:57 ‎Most communities have a calendar of events.
00:04:01 ‎Have we thought about looking at it
00:04:03 ‎and then making plans to give a witness
00:04:06 ‎by having our literature carts out?
00:04:08 ‎And, really, events like this, ‎they have a bigger impact
00:04:12 ‎on us as Jehovah’s Witnesses ‎because we have an opportunity to talk.
00:04:15 ‎We get excited about our work.
00:04:17 ‎We’re all working together shoulder to shoulder.
00:04:20 ‎It really builds our faith.
00:04:22 ‎Recently, a scripture  ‎that stood out to me was 1 Chronicles 28:20,
00:04:27 ‎where it says:  ‎“Be courageous . . . and go to work.”
00:04:30 ‎It helped me to realize  ‎that I just need to take the initiative and try.
00:04:35 ‎That’s what we all need to do,
00:04:37 ‎and then let Jehovah  ‎decide how things turn out.
00:04:41 ‎Jehovah will no doubt bless your efforts
00:04:43 ‎as you show an interest in others.

‎An exciting event took place

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:07.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in 2017 across the United States.

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:08.904 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎August 21, 2017,

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎has been on a lot of people’s calendars

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:13.033 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎for a long time because of the total eclipse.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
‎we are constantly on the lookout

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for events where we can support
‎community outreach. 

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:21.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Brothers and sisters

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎prepared well in advance
‎to give a Bible education

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:26.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the many travelers.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What convinced us 
‎that this was an opportunity

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to give a great witness 
‎was that we did a little research,

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we noticed the hotel bookings.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The town was packed,

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:38.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so we could tell 
‎that this was going to be a big event.

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We needed to do something.

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:43.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We wanted to be in a position to share

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the wonderful things from the Bible with them.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We needed to take a global approach.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had to identify
‎all the resources in Bend

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and not just do it 
‎by individual congregation.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So in our campaign we decided
‎to feature three primary tools:

00:00:56.952 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎first, What Does the Bible Really Teach?
‎because many people wonder;

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎second, Was Life Created? 
‎because with an eclipse event,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎people are thinking about the universe,
‎and it’s a good opportunity

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to talk about our Creator;

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and third,

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎jw.org,

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎since we expect a lot of visitors
‎from all over the world,

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we can reach them in their language.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Over 200 brothers and sisters
‎attended two seminars

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎put on by local brothers to help prepare
‎individuals for the massive campaign.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had examples 
‎of what not to do and what to do

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so as to benefit 
‎as many people as possible.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We had an interview;

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we had demonstrations on how to speak
‎to people in different languages.

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We’re expecting people
‎from many different parts of the world.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s actually an opportunity

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to be like a missionary
‎in our own hometown.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Some of the estimates 
‎that we have heard are conservative estimates

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of probably 200,000 visitors.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It may be more than that.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The local congregations
‎made themselves available

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to work with city officials

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to prepare the parks
‎for the large influx of people.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So many of Jehovah’s Witnesses
‎have volunteered

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to help with all kinds of things.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎These are really small communities
‎that are having a very large influx of people.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So all of that extra effort 

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and help in kind of preparing and cleaning up

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is much appreciated.

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.876 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎We have been working with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:30.379 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎for a period of years here at Smith Rock.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s been a good experience 
‎for our staff and our volunteers,

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we want to accommodate that
‎in any way we can.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎There’s been a lot of good things
‎happening with cart witnessing. 

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:43.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎One of the friends had a nice experience
‎with an Arabic-speaking man,

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and she said the seminar 
‎is what helped her to be prepared.

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎She knew how to work the app,

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:50.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how to find the video in the language,

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and she already 
‎had it downloaded and ready to go.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Paul spoke about his ministry.

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He said: “Woe is me 
‎if I did not declare the good news!” 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So we don’t want to look back
‎and wish we would’ve done more.

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Trying it for the first time can be scary.

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It can be nerve-racking,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but it’s not so scary after you get started.

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What’s really been fun
‎is what we are calling roving.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We go into an area 
‎where there are a lot of people,

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we just start conversations.

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We don’t carry any literature.

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We just have our device

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the jw.org contact card.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And then, hopefully, 
‎if the opportunity presents itself,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we may share with them a video

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or tell them
‎we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s just been a paradise for them

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:39.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—a preaching paradise—
‎all these visitors coming in.

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We may not see the results

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the seed that was planted
‎when they took a look at our cart,

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:46.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but Jehovah knows

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the angels know
‎and can make that grow.

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This endeavor 
‎has really helped me to appreciate

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:57.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the need to be alert 
‎to ways to expand our ministry.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Most communities have a calendar of events.

00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Have we thought about looking at it

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and then making plans to give a witness

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by having our literature carts out?

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, really, events like this,
‎they have a bigger impact

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎on us as Jehovah’s Witnesses
‎because we have an opportunity to talk.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We get excited about our work.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We’re all working together shoulder to shoulder.

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It really builds our faith.

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:27.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Recently, a scripture 
‎that stood out to me was 1 Chronicles 28:20,

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where it says: 
‎“Be courageous . . . and go to work.”

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:35.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It helped me to realize 
‎that I just need to take the initiative and try.

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s what we all need to do,

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:41.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and then let Jehovah 
‎decide how things turn out.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah will no doubt bless your efforts

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as you show an interest in others.

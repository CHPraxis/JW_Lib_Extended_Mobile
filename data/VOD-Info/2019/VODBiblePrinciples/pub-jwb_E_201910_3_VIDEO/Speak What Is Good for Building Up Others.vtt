I embarrassed my wife tonight.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew when it happened,

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t want to talk about it.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew in my heart that Yoomi was right.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had become unkind.

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were lots of examples.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d complained about the way one brother
conducted meetings for field service.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was jealous

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a ministerial servant
who received new privileges.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was pretty blunt

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how frustrated I got
with Yoomi’s parents.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:50.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I’d gotten rid
of my old personality,

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it still lurked inside of me.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of my friends
were OK with and even encouraged

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these bad qualities.

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The change was so gradual

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I didn’t even realize
how far I’d fallen.

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think I need to do to change?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about we search
for “good for building up”

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the ONLINE LIBRARY?

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds good.
Let’s take a look.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We considered Ephesians 4:29,

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says:

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:35.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let a rotten word
not come out of your mouth,

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but only what is good
for building up . . . ,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to impart what is beneficial
to the hearers.”

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was struck by this powerful word picture.

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:52.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rotten words are as disgusting

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:55.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as rotten food.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want the things
coming out of my mouth

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:04.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to disgust my wife or anyone else.

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to change,

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:08.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed a plan.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I really try to think before I speak.

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:18.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have a goal to give someone

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real commendation at every meeting.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a goal for my conversations too.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:38.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to keep them
wholesome, true, and kind.

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:44.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how speaking kindly to others

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:48.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make you feel so good inside.

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shouldn’t be surprised,

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:59.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s just another way
of showing God’s love.

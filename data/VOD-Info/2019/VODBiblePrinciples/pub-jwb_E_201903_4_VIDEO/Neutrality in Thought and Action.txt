00:00:20 “They are no part of the world.” —John 17:16.
00:00:24 “We must remain neutral in order to be loyal subjects of God’s Kingdom.
00:00:28 “Otherwise, how could we have a clean conscience
00:00:30 “when we preach the good news
00:00:31 “that only God’s Kingdom can solve mankind’s problems?
00:00:33 “. . . As Satan’s system nears its end,
00:00:36 we can expect the issue of neutrality to become more prominent.”
00:00:41 OK, people, we’re ready to go.
00:00:43 Dawn, Jordan, can I get you to grab the blinds please?
00:00:59 In your work groups this week, you’ll outline the policies
00:01:03 you feel world governments should implement.
00:01:05 Remember, it’s young people like you,
00:01:09 each of you, who must take action to solve the problems that threaten our planet.
00:01:33 When war comes, they’ll look for you and me to do the fighting.
00:01:36 Will you speak up and tell them, ‘No, no, we won’t?’
00:01:54 But I’m more worried about the elections, especially for your generation.
00:01:59 I mean, who do you think is going to win?
00:02:01 Uhm, well, we believe that—
00:02:05 uhm . . .
00:02:06 That’s actually a very interesting question.
00:02:09 And as Jehovah’s Witnesses, we believe that it’s God’s Kingdom
00:02:12 that’s going to bring about all the solutions that we need for all of our problems.
00:02:15 For example, . . .
00:02:16 That’s £7.50, please.
00:02:18 Thank you.
00:02:21 Hello, how can I help you?
00:02:25 But you know, this new government policy
00:02:27 —I really think it’s going to work.
00:02:29 You’re crazy.
00:02:32 With their policies, we’ll be bankrupt within three years.
00:02:34 But if it works, though, it’s going to make people rich.
00:02:37 Those who are rich already.
00:02:38 No, I’m fed up. They say the same thing.
00:02:58 We’ve invited a panel of experts to explore these issues,
00:03:01 namely, can the opposition party win?
00:03:04 Will they keep their promises to lower-income people?
00:03:07 And what changes could we expect on required military service?
00:03:11 You’ll want to hear the answers.
00:03:13 Let’s begin by speaking to John McGarthy,
00:03:16 the minister of education.
00:03:17 If put to the test, I do want to take my stand for Jehovah.
00:03:21 But the outcome of all these things can affect me now
00:03:25 —my family, my goals.
00:03:29 How can I stay neutral, even in my heart?
00:03:36 John 17:14:
00:03:43 “I have given your word to them,  but the world has hated them,
00:03:48 “because they are no part of the world,
00:03:50 “just as I am no part of the world.
00:03:53 “I do not request that you take them out of the world,
00:03:56 “but that you watch over them because of the wicked one.
00:04:00 “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.
00:04:04 “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.
00:04:08 “Just as you sent me into the world,
00:04:11 “I also sent them into the world.
00:04:13 “And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf,
00:04:17 so that they also  may be sanctified by means of truth.”
00:04:22 No part of the world,
00:04:24 like Jesus, both in thought and action.
00:04:32 Sure, but in our lifetime?
00:04:34 Yes! And I have found something that has helped me to be sure of this.
00:04:37 Can I share it with you?
00:04:39 It’s here at Matthew 24:33.
00:04:42 Jesus said: “Likewise also you, when you see all these things,
00:04:47 know that he is near at the doors.”

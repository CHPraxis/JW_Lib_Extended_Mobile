“They are no part of the world.”
—John 17:16.

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We must remain neutral
in order to be loyal subjects of God’s Kingdom.

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Otherwise,
how could we have a clean conscience

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when we preach the good news

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that only God’s Kingdom
can solve mankind’s problems?

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . As Satan’s system nears its end,

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can expect the issue of neutrality
to become more prominent.”

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, people, we’re ready to go.

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dawn, Jordan,
can I get you to grab the blinds please?

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your work groups this week,
you’ll outline the policies

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you feel world governments should implement.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it’s young people like you,

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of you, who must take action
to solve the problems that threaten our planet.

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When war comes,
they’ll look for you and me to do the fighting.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you speak up and tell them,
‘No, no, we won’t?’

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m more worried about the elections,
especially for your generation.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, who do you think is going to win?

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, well, we believe that—

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uhm . . .

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:09.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s actually a very interesting question.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we believe that it’s God’s Kingdom

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to bring about all the solutions
that we need for all of our problems.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, . . .

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s £7.50, please.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, how can I help you?

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know, this new government policy

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I really think it’s going to work.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:31.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re crazy.

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With their policies,
we’ll be bankrupt within three years.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if it works, though,
it’s going to make people rich.

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who are rich already.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m fed up.
They say the same thing.

00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve invited a panel of experts
to explore these issues,

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely, can the opposition party win?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they keep their promises
to lower-income people?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what changes could we expect
on required military service?

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll want to hear the answers.

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s begin by speaking to John McGarthy,

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the minister of education.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If put to the test,
I do want to take my stand for Jehovah.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the outcome
of all these things can affect me now

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my family, my goals.

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:33.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I stay neutral, even in my heart?

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:43.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 17:14:

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have given your word to them, 
but the world has hated them,

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are no part of the world,

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as I am no part of the world.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not request
that you take them out of the world,

00:03:56.632 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but that you watch over them
because of the wicked one.

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:04.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are no part of the world,
just as I am no part of the world.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sanctify them by means of the truth;
your word is truth.

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as you sent me into the world,

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:13.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I also sent them into the world.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:17.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf,

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:21.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they also 
may be sanctified by means of truth.”

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No part of the world,

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:28.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Jesus,
both in thought and action.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, but in our lifetime?

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! And I have found something
that has helped me to be sure of this.

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I share it with you?

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:42.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here at Matthew 24:33.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:47.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Likewise also you,
when you see all these things,

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know that he is near at the doors.”

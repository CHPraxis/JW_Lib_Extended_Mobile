00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:09.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made it.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on, y’all.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be good.
You’ll see.

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go out and meet her.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Taysha.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin?

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, talk to me.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing to talk about.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know this whole move hasn’t been easy.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s only temporary
until we’re able to get back on our feet.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just the move.

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:53.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s everything.
It’s all upside down.

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good thing is, we’re not alone.

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have help,
and it’s the best kind of help

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it comes from Jehovah,
and he will never let you down.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s up to you to give him a chance.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in this together, OK?

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leah, we’re so happy
that you are all here with us.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Mom.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:19.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how long we’ll be here,
but we’ll try to help out as much as we can.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:23.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stay with us as long as you need to.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Dad.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought Taysha would be down by now.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said she had a headache.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go check on her.

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leah.

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Dad.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is everything OK?

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah.
Everything is fine.

00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re doing a wonderful job, you know.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I?

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since Scott left us, nothing has been right.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leah, it’s not your fault.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scott left Jehovah.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now losing my job—

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m trying so hard to be strong for the kids,

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:01.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, Dad, inside I . . .

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:07.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Leah, 
the Scriptures are so encouraging

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helpful in situations like this.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read for me Psalm 27:14.

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hope in Jehovah; 
be courageous and strong of heart.

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:25.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope in Jehovah.”

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t feel very courageous, Dad.

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can be, Leah, dear.

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:36.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The key is in the first sentence of that verse:

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hope in Jehovah.”

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, meditating on our hope

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enables us to build courage right now.

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with courage like that,

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:54.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to meet any challenge.

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taysha,

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come taste this for me, please.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mmm.
Smells good.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mhm, that tastes good.

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:24.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe add just a little bit more cumin.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So any plans for this weekend?

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m going to get 
an early start out in service

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then come home and finish my book.

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you want to go out
with some friends and have some fun?

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that would be nice.

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the matter?

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first you need friends.

00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, this must be about my job interview.

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:51.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be right back.

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben?

00:04:57.317 --> 00:04:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes?

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to talk to you.

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:03.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why hasn’t the congregation
taken more of an interest

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:04.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Leah and the kids?

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:06.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been two months.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve invited people over to our home.

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s as you said,
it’s only been two months.

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:14.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Ben, that’s not it.

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was out in service this morning,

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:20.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard that someone
invited the Campbells over.

00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:21.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just moved here!

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I’m being biased,

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:28.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t think
of a sweeter girl than Taysha.

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the fact that she’s having
a hard time finding friends?

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:35.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve all been through so much!

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just hurts!

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:38.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I expected more.

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve all been through so much!

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:48.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just hurts!

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I expected more.

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know what I think?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:05:56.043 --> 00:05:59.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That I’m completely overreacting
as a grandmother?

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no.

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:03.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re—
you’re a wonderful grandmother,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re probably right.

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:09.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But although we may feel justified,

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:13.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to remember that the congregation

00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:15.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made up of imperfect people,

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:17.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re doing the best they can.

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:19.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re going to have their failing moments,

00:06:22.736 --> 00:06:26.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’ll have their shining ones also

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:29.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like when you were sick years ago.

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We both needed them,
and they were there for us.

00:06:33.872 --> 00:06:36.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of what the psalmist said:

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:41.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light and my salvation.”

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:45.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, he said: “Jehovah,” not people.

00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:51.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, I’m going to try
and leave it in Jehovah’s hands.

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do trust Jehovah.

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:54.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s my Abby.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, remember when we used to recount

00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three things every day that we were thankful for?

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we start doing that again?

00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:06.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, that sound like a good idea.

00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:09.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can already think of one thing

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:14.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m thankful for today, and that’s you.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:19.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go.
Here’s a plate for you.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank you.

00:07:20.168 --> 00:07:20.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:22.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.

00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:25.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, we really appreciate
the both of you inviting us over.

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:26.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our pleasure.

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:29.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really love
having Leah and the kids with us.

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:31.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we’ve been wanting
to do this for quite a while.

00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we just haven’t had the chance until now.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate it.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on.

00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:51.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks again, Grandpa,
for a fun service morning.

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:52.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have any plans for later?

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:54.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’m meeting some friends later 
at the movie theater.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, have a good time.

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:57.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:05.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jamin, pass the popcorn.

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:07.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trade.
Give me that.

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:17.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, this looks kind of . . .

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t this bother you?

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:24.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let it freak you out.

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:27.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I just think maybe we need to leave.

00:08:27.652 --> 00:08:29.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way!
I’m not losing my money.

00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:31.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really think we need to leave.

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:33.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, what’s going on?

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin is all freaked out because of this scene.

00:08:35.827 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just this scene.

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:37.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, dude, just chill.

00:08:38.288 --> 00:08:40.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, I’m trying to watch a movie.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s cut the chit-chat.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, dude, just chill.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:57.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, I’m trying to watch a movie.

00:08:57.682 --> 00:08:58.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s cut the chit-chat.

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:00.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.

00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:07.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning, Sir.

00:09:07.526 --> 00:09:09.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My grandson and I
would like to share an encouraging . . .

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:11.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, Jehovah’s Witnesses, right?

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to save you some trouble.

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:14.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a professor.

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve read some of your books,
but the science in them is really out-of-date.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:20.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you people insist on writing
about things you don’t understand?

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:22.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is true, Sir,

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:26.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that over time,
scientific research can become out-of-date.

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:30.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know, there’s a book
that is never out-of-date,

00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:32.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible.

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:34.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin, would you please read

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:37.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:22 for the gentleman?

00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is One who dwells
above the circle of the earth,

00:09:41.351 --> 00:09:43.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:46.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is stretching out the heavens
like a fine gauze.”

00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:50.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That ended so much better than I expected.

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:51.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was so intimidating.

00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:54.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s normal to feel that way, Dustin.

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:56.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve even had those feelings.

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:59.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the apostles have had their moments.

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:01.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to show you something.

00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in Acts chapter 4.

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you find that and read Acts 4:29?

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:15.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what the apostles prayed for.

00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And now, Jehovah,
give attention to their threats,

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grant to your slaves
to keep speaking your word with all boldness.”

00:10:23.268 --> 00:10:24.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the point, Dustin?

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:28.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped the apostles,
and he’s going to help us.

00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:33.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we never ever have to feel
ashamed of the truth.

00:10:40.243 --> 00:10:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m out of here.

00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:54.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dustin?

00:10:55.258 --> 00:10:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not going back, Jamin.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I know.
Me neither.

00:11:00.096 --> 00:11:01.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom’s going to come and pick me up.

00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:02.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want a ride?

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:04.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:11:04.017 --> 00:11:05.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right.

00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:14.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, dinner was very good, thank you.

00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:16.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:18.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it really is good to see you all.

00:11:18.448 --> 00:11:20.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five years is a long time.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is.

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:24.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Dad told me you were coming,
I couldn’t wait to see you.

00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have gifts.

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:34.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s beautiful!

00:11:35.006 --> 00:11:36.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:36.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:38.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?
This is the latest model!

00:11:38.802 --> 00:11:39.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Uncle Jackson.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome.

00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:43.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, this is very . . .

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:44.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . professional.

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:46.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Professional.

00:11:46.101 --> 00:11:48.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to come and work for me.

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:50.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what to say.

00:11:50.564 --> 00:11:51.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to help.

00:11:51.898 --> 00:11:53.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let me.

00:11:53.108 --> 00:11:56.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s entry-level, but with benefits and bonuses.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:00.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the hours?
Anything like yours?

00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:04.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not as intense, but full-time
—weekends, evenings too.

00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:06.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ll be able to save money,

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:07.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
buy a home.

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:08.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:12:08.873 --> 00:12:10.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a job for you too.

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:10.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:11.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could even buy a car.

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:12.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow.

00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:15.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And anytime you want to come
to the agency, it’s open.

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:16.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll make it a family business.

00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:18.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:23.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is work.
Excuse me.

00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:36.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you two help me with the dishes?

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:48.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could use the job, Dad.

00:12:48.622 --> 00:12:51.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would it be so bad to work the extra hours?

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t make that decision for you.

00:12:55.837 --> 00:12:59.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your brother loves you very much,

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:03.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he genuinely wants to help.

00:13:03.678 --> 00:13:08.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you know,
he never made the truth his own.

00:13:08.224 --> 00:13:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:13:10.602 --> 00:13:13.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve got to figure out

00:13:13.104 --> 00:13:18.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if his offer is worth the cost.

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:21.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, extra hours

00:13:21.655 --> 00:13:25.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means extra association.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Proverbs 13:20 says:

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:34.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:37.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will become wise.”

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:45.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah, I got you. All right.

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey look, I have to go.
I’ll talk to you later.

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:49.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leah.

00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jackson, I want to thank you
for offering to give me a job.

00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:55.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You got it.
I’ll set up an interview.

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I have to turn it down.

00:13:56.898 --> 00:13:59.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad talked to you, didn’t he?

00:13:59.025 --> 00:14:00.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t coming from Dad.

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:01.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s coming from me.

00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just can’t sacrifice
spiritual things for material ones.

00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:06.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope you can understand.

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:10.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jackson, I love you.
We all do.

00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:12.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to see you
come back and visit us.

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:14.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But please, for my sake,

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:17.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t promote different goals
for the kids when you come.

00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:22.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m trying hard to help them
set spiritual priorities. OK?

00:14:22.048 --> 00:14:23.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right.

00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:25.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a while,
but come on give me a hug.

00:14:25.969 --> 00:14:27.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know I’m keeping the bag, right?

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:28.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:14:32.308 --> 00:14:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instruct me in your way, O Jehovah,

00:14:35.812 --> 00:14:39.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lead me in the path of uprightness
because of my foes.”

00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:40.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:41.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not hand me over to my adversaries.”

00:14:41.693 --> 00:14:43.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taysha!
You’re up early.

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:45.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, they called and asked
if I could do a double shift today.

00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandpa, I’m sorry
you had to give up your office space for me.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be, Taysha.

00:14:52.412 --> 00:14:55.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, this suits me better.

00:14:55.248 --> 00:14:59.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, being outside
makes personal study more enjoyable.

00:14:59.586 --> 00:15:02.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I hope you enjoy
the rest of your day, and I’ll see you later.

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:04.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, we’ll see you when you get back.

00:15:04.424 --> 00:15:06.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:15:10.263 --> 00:15:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey, I found you.

00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey.
Yeah, I decided to take my break outside.

00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:17.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, cool. Well, when you get back,
Denise was looking for you.

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:18.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, thanks.

00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:22.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m making this dressing,
but I think that it’s just missing something.

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:23.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you try it?

00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:24.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:15:27.113 --> 00:15:28.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mmm, maybe a little bit more lemon.

00:15:28.948 --> 00:15:29.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More lemon, OK.

00:15:29.616 --> 00:15:29.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:31.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want me to help you?

00:15:31.075 --> 00:15:31.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure. OK.

00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:34.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sweet.

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:36.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, can I borrow
some of your hot pepper flakes?

00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:38.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:42.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s OK.

00:15:42.253 --> 00:15:43.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry about that.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming out.

00:15:47.217 --> 00:15:48.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming in.

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:49.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my salad?

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:49.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yep.

00:15:52.722 --> 00:15:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, everybody.
I think that was the last plate.

00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:56.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mhm-mhm.

00:15:56.267 --> 00:15:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, let’s clean up and get out of here.

00:15:58.561 --> 00:15:59.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds good to me.

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:03.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, are you going to come with us?

00:16:03.733 --> 00:16:05.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thanks, Denise.
But, no, I don’t think so.

00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on.

00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:08.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t say no again.

00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:09.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.

00:16:09.072 --> 00:16:10.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have other plans.

00:16:10.615 --> 00:16:12.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you have other plans. Huh?

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:14.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I get it.

00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:16.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a secret boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:16:16.913 --> 00:16:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait. What?

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:18.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on.

00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:21.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you’re into, it’s all right with us.

00:16:21.876 --> 00:16:23.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just let us in on it.

00:16:23.711 --> 00:16:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the deal?

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:32.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you’re into, it’s all right with us.

00:16:32.345 --> 00:16:34.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just let us in on it.

00:16:35.765 --> 00:16:38.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the deal?

00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:42.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moses must have felt inadequate

00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:44.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and incapable.

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God assured him
that he would not be alone.

00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will prove to be with you,’ said Jehovah.”

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:56.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I don’t have a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a Bible study.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we volunteer our time 
to help people learn about the Bible.

00:17:04.168 --> 00:17:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible?

00:17:05.628 --> 00:17:08.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on.
That book is ancient.

00:17:08.298 --> 00:17:10.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It closes your mind to new ideas.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, it doesn’t.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives people a wonderful hope for the future.

00:17:16.014 --> 00:17:18.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I believe we make our own future.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry you don’t feel the same.

00:17:20.852 --> 00:17:22.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on.

00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:24.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go.

00:17:24.105 --> 00:17:25.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:36.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I told them
I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:38.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just glad they know now.

00:17:38.244 --> 00:17:40.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so proud of you for standing up like that.

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:42.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I surprised myself.

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wish it ended a little bit better.

00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:50.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter the response,
you made Jehovah happy today.

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:52.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Grandpa.

00:18:03.144 --> 00:18:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey.

00:18:04.103 --> 00:18:04.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey.

00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:07.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, the other day, you said something about

00:18:07.649 --> 00:18:09.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that you do Bible studies.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it reminded me of something

00:18:11.152 --> 00:18:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mom and I
used to do together before she died.

00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:16.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would read the Bible to me before bed.

00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was wondering

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you would show me
what you show other people?

00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.
I’m really sorry to hear that about your mom.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that the Bible
actually gives us a hope for a resurrection?

00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:28.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here.

00:18:33.132 --> 00:18:37.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we have Brother Ben Matthews with us.

00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:39.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Matthews,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve been able to raise a family,
serve as an elder,

00:18:43.226 --> 00:18:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pioneer for many years.

00:18:45.853 --> 00:18:48.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a good example of faith and courage!

00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:51.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Nicoletti.

00:18:51.693 --> 00:18:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But truthfully,

00:18:53.236 --> 00:18:57.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
courage isn’t something that comes easy to me.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to keep working on it.

00:18:59.242 --> 00:19:00.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:19:00.535 --> 00:19:02.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I remember years ago

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:06.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my wife, Abby, became very ill.

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:09.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was in the hospital for months

00:19:09.168 --> 00:19:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while I cared for our newborn son
and young daughter.

00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know if she would ever recover.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed and prayed,

00:19:17.802 --> 00:19:21.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it appeared as if nothing changed.

00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could feel my faith

00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:28.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning to crack and give way to doubt.

00:19:28.062 --> 00:19:32.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even started doubting
Jehovah’s promises for the future.

00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what changed that?

00:19:34.777 --> 00:19:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A friend stepped in at the right time.

00:19:37.488 --> 00:19:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged me
when I was home alone to read David’s words

00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:44.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 27.

00:19:44.078 --> 00:19:46.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I didn’t want to.

00:19:46.664 --> 00:19:49.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But eventually I did,

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:51.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something about those words

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touched my heart.

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:56.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, like a plant deprived of water,

00:19:56.716 --> 00:19:59.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was starving my faith.

00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:02.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept reading and meditating

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on those words in Psalm 27,

00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:08.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and eventually my doubts began to melt away.

00:20:09.145 --> 00:20:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you mentioned, Brother Matthews,

00:20:11.147 --> 00:20:12.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was decades ago.

00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you said courage is something
that you’re continuing to work on.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for much of my life
I’ve had to help other people be courageous.

00:20:21.824 --> 00:20:23.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But recently,

00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:28.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found out that soon I will go blind.

00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Between this and not being able to do

00:20:34.504 --> 00:20:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as much in the congregation as I used to,

00:20:38.382 --> 00:20:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, I could feel those doubts creeping up again.

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:46.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s easier to help others

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be courageous.

00:20:49.018 --> 00:20:53.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be able to meet any challenge.

00:20:53.064 --> 00:20:57.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light and my salvation.”

00:20:57.276 --> 00:20:59.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped the apostles,

00:20:59.821 --> 00:21:02.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s going to help us.

00:21:02.115 --> 00:21:03.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter the response,

00:21:03.783 --> 00:21:06.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you made Jehovah happy today.

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:11.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s harder to be courageous for yourself.

00:21:11.124 --> 00:21:14.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We empathize with you, Brother Matthews.

00:21:14.168 --> 00:21:18.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us
what you’re doing right now to build courage?

00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s my prescription:

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regular prayer and study,

00:21:25.304 --> 00:21:28.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
application of the Bible’s guidance,

00:21:28.766 --> 00:21:31.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending as many meetings as I can,

00:21:31.477 --> 00:21:36.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course,
preaching to others about our hope.

00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:39.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very good prescription.

00:21:39.193 --> 00:21:43.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a particular scripture
that has meaning for you right now?

00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:48.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, it’s Hebrews 11:6.

00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Moreover,

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“without faith it is impossible

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to please God well,

00:21:56.002 --> 00:21:58.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever approaches God

00:21:58.296 --> 00:22:01.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must believe that he is

00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:04.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:07.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:22:07.388 --> 00:22:10.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even if I lose my eyesight,

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:15.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Nicoletti, I will continue to seek Jehovah

00:22:15.855 --> 00:22:17.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my family

00:22:17.857 --> 00:22:20.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my eyes of faith.

00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:25.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Matthews,
for being such a good example of courage!

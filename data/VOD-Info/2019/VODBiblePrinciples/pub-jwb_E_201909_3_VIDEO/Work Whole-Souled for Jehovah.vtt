Sometimes I really hate my job.

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how Jason stays so positive.

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jason why he refused the money,

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I found out
that he’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife is too,

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I know a lot about them.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what Jason did really surprised me.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered why he didn’t feel like

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was entitled to the extra money.

00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s such a hard worker,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and most of our supervisors accept bribes.

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason showed me a Bible verse:

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever you are doing,
work at it whole-souled

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as for Jehovah, and not for men.”

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason’s relationship with God influences

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every aspect of his life,

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even his attitude toward work.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t participate

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in something dishonest, even if others did.

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could see that Jason really lived by his beliefs.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason invited me to see the construction project

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s been volunteering at.

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:53.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I had entered another world.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People of different races

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked alongside each other

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:01.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without prejudice,
and they were all volunteers.

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason offered to study the Bible with me.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emma has asked me to study in the past,

00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve always refused.

00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time, I accepted.

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked my study

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even enjoyed going
to the Kingdom Hall occasionally.

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had to work overtime

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support my family.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t go to meetings every week.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Jason,

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you do it all

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:11.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—work, family, meetings, even volunteer work?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to keep in mind
Jesus’ words at Matthew 6:22.

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus compared our eyes to a lamp.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that if ‘our eye was focused,
our whole body would be bright.’

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:31.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s impossible

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on more than one thing at a time.

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus wanted his followers
to focus on a single purpose:

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that of doing God’s will.

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than being distracted by material things,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I lead a simple life,

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoiding unnecessary debt

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or acquiring possessions
that consume a lot of time and attention.

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way of life allows us
to have time for what’s truly important.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you asked Emma,
which do you think she would prefer:

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you made more money
or spent more time with her at the Kingdom Hall?

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:14.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jason’s example really impressed me.

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was an honest and diligent worker,

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:22.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also kept secular work in its proper place.

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:26.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me think about the choices I make,

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:28.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I decided that I too

00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:32.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to ‘work whole-souled for Jehovah.’

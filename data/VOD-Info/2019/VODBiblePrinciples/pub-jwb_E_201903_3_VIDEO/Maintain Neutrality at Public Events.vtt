Collette, I’m home.

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the kitchen, Curtis.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was your day?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it was a long day,
but it’s nice being home.

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That smells amazing!
I can’t wait.

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, well, it will be ready
in a few minutes.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I have a surprise;

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my job gave us tickets
to the game this weekend

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—enough for all of us to go.

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s downtown at the . . .

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounded like fun.

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:25.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a sport we could enjoy watching.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Collette and I hadn’t been in years,

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I don’t think the kids had ever gone.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were all looking forward
to a family night out.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Dad, what exactly do we do
during the national anthem?

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, I wasn’t sure.

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you please stand
for the singing

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our national anthem?

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad, I have a question too.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they salute the flag at my new school?

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conference
with her teachers was next week,

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:15.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we didn’t know what they’d do there.

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, class.
Now that everyone is here,

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s all stand
for the pledge of allegiance.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth, is everything all right?

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think, Honey?

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, tomorrow night
is our Family Worship evening.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why don’t we do
a study project as a family

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Christian neutrality at public events?

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds like a good idea.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think this will be great.
We’ll all get a chance to do our research.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Daniel to research
Christian principles on neutrality.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Collette and Elizabeth would find examples

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones who proved loyal under pressure.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for me,

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my job was to call Elizabeth’s new school

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out if they saluted
the flag or sang the anthem.

00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:12.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Mr. Johnson?
This is Curtis, Elizabeth’s dad.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d studied this topic
when the kids were younger,

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we needed reminders
for these new challenges.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kids found some great information.

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several Bible principles applied.

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:33.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what Jesus said at Matthew 4:10

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an essential foundation:

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:44.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we participate in a nationalistic ceremony,

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re sharing in worship

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of something or someone
other than Jehovah God.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would help us know what to do?

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth found
some good examples to imitate.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one of our favorites.

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:10.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When King Nebuchadnezzar
ordered them to worship the gold image,

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they bravely stood
while others bowed down.

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were determined
to worship only Jehovah,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He rescued them from the furnace.

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:23.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are modern-day examples

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:26.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of courage like the three Hebrews.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some children have had to take a stand

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when governments tried to force them

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take part
in patriotic events during wartime,

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when feelings of national pride ran strong.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite legal victories
in some countries,

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
young ones today are still put to the test.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned there was
no one answer on what to do.

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:52.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Situations are different
depending on where we live

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what a person does
to show he’s participating.

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:58.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in every case,

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians in some way make it evident

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are respectful observers,
not participants.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:08.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt good because we had decided

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we would do
to be respectful but neutral

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show Jehovah
that our family worships him alone.

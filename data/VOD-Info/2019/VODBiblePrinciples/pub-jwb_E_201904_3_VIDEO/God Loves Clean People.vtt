I graduated
from high school that summer

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to start
regular pioneering.

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my dad, Grayson.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad was having
car trouble that morning

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and needed a ride to work,
so I gave him one.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, my car
was a little messy and smelly.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it was winter,
and my car is pretty old anyway.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why bother?

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I get a new car,
then I’ll keep it clean.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was making
a big deal out of nothing.

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That morning was not good.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was over.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later that evening,
Dad brought it up again.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time, it went better.

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed me a picture of his first car.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It looked pretty old too.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that while our home
or car may not be

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fancy or luxurious,
it should be as clean and presentable

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as circumstances allow.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still didn’t see what the big deal was.

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he explained
that Jehovah is a clean God,

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from ancient times,
he has always required

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his people be a clean people.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the Mosaic Law
that Jehovah gave to Israel,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:49.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cleanness and worship
were inseparable.

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:55.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It specified that priests were required
to wash their hands and feet

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before offering sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While in an unclean state, an Israelite

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:03.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not have
any part in worship,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it could mean death.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I’m not an Israelite,

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re not
under the Mosaic Law anymore.”

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “True, but it gives us insight

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Jehovah’s thinking.”

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Law emphasized that cleanness

00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was required
of all those who worshipped him.

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as Malachi 3:6 tells us,

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah has not changed.’

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he said something
that really stuck with me,

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Besides, it’s not all about us.”

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he gave me a scripture to look up.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4:

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that no fault
may be found with our ministry;

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:56.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in every way

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.”

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that things like our appearance,

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our homes, and our cars

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these can all be
a silent witness to Jehovah in themselves.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made sense to me now.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not all about us.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:31.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew what I had to do.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:42.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did I clean my car,
but later that year,

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to turn in
my application for pioneering.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m glad for the lesson
I learned from my dad.

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not all about us.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:59.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in little ways,

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can reflect favorably
on the God we love.

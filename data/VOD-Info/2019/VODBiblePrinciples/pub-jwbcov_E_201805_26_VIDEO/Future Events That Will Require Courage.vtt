Well, brothers,
the next item on our agenda

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:08.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what we’ve been working on
for the past three months.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Kevin,
since this is your first elders’ meeting with us,

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe we can fill you in on the background.

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, that would be great.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We noted that some
in the congregation were anxious

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:20.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of unstable world conditions,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we decided to focus
on strengthening the friends when shepherding

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they’d be able to face
future events with courage.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also wanted to commend them
where they’re already showing courage

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help them to see
that the courage they develop now

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help them to display courage in the future.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luther, how did things go in your group?

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can share an experience

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that gives an idea of the overall results.

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the experience
that best illustrates it is Mark O’Brien’s.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was facing some serious pressure at work

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to compromise his neutrality.

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, Mark, I understand
you don’t like to get involved in politics.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t either.

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we don’t protest this new bill,

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our company is going to get hit
with cutbacks and layoffs.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joel, don’t get me wrong.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m concerned too,

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I won’t join the protest.

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you won’t stand in line and protest,

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at least sign the sheet
to show you support the protest.

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not like you’re voting
or joining a political party.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your name won’t even be noticed.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just need signatures.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far, everyone in the company has signed it.

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark, I’m going to be straight with you.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boss told me

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:48.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s going to have to let some people go,

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your name is under serious consideration

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depending on the outcome of this discussion.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:02:01.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just sign the paper, Mark!

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he sign the paper?

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you know why?

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:20.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment,
he said a silent prayer

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:24.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that gave him the courage
needed to remain neutral.

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I commended him, and I reminded him

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that displaying courage now
is going to help him in the future.

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Luther.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very encouraging to hear.

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew, how did things go with your group?

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew, how did things go with your group?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Sally’s experience
is one that stands out for me.

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to make
a donation to the marathon?

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, no thank you.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shall I put it in the bag,
or do you want to wear it now?

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:44.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no thank you.

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:49.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong, Honey?

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You got something against them?

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:59.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no I—
I don’t have anything against them personally.

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the problem?

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:07.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I respect that they
have a right to choose their lifestyle,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:08.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as a Bible reader, I choose—

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:09.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excuse me!

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:11.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a Bible reader too!

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I go to church,

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our church is one
of the biggest supporters of this marathon!

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:20.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are you trying to say?

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:30.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Displaying courage now

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help me display courage in the future.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:37.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we believe the Bible
teaches that sex is for a man

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a woman who are married.

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:44.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Intolerant people.

00:04:56.483 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, that sure took courage.

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:02.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what I told her.

00:05:02.781 --> 00:05:05.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I asked her 
to think about when the political powers

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
destroy false religion.

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:11.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
people won’t want to admit that they’re religious.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so for us
to admit that we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses then,

00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:19.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, that’s going to require
the same type of courage

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:21.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she displayed at that market.

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, I remember

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:28.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Sally was just a little girl handing out tracts,

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:31.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now look how well she’s done.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of tracts,

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:35.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may I share an experience with you brothers?

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:36.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall a little over ten years ago?

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had the Kingdom News campaign

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:49.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The End of False Religion Is Near!”

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:53.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our shepherding visit with Sherry Spencer,

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:56.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she admitted that something
happened to her during that campaign.

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:04.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a public service,

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sharing in an earth-wide distribution
of this important message.

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:10.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s your free copy.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey!
What’s this about?

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:19.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you trying to tell me
that my religion is false and yours is true?

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get off my property!

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:26.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you come back again,
I’m going to set my dog on you!

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody wants you here!

00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:44.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Spencer said that
that experience stayed with her.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To this day,
she finds it very difficult to be in the ministry.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:57.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that after all these years,

00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I can’t get over this fear,

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I may not make it when times get harder.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Spencer,
you may be surprised to know

00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:18.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that most of us
get nervous when talking at the doors.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:20.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that I do.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:23.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re just trying to make me feel better.

00:07:23.547 --> 00:07:24.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m saying it because it’s true.

00:07:29.094 --> 00:07:32.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being courageous
doesn’t mean we won’t get nervous.

00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:37.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes being courageous means
taking action even though we are nervous.

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.
That is encouraging.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a suggestion that may help.

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:48.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve discussed Psalm 27:14.

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:50.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on that scripture,

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:54.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the next time you’re about to face
a situation that calls for courage,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it be in the ministry or otherwise,

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:01.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell yourself
you just need to do these three things:

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:04.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray,

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hope in Jehovah,

00:08:06.923 --> 00:08:09.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act.

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:10.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You got it?

00:08:11.678 --> 00:08:13.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray,

00:08:13.388 --> 00:08:15.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hope in Jehovah,

00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:17.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act.

00:08:17.976 --> 00:08:21.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait.
I’m going to write that down.

00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:26.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent!

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:28.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping the friends address their fears

00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:30.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is really going to help

00:08:30.322 --> 00:08:34.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when our message changes
from good news to judgment.

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:38.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Peter, let’s hear from you next.

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:44.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Peter, let’s hear from you next.

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:48.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we informed everyone

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:50.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the publishers were going to be redistributed

00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:53.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the North or South Congregation,

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:56.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s just say some struggled with the idea.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paula!

00:09:07.484 --> 00:09:09.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see?

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have us going to the South Congregation,

00:09:11.655 --> 00:09:14.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everybody else
from our group is going to North.

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:17.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I saw that.

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:19.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My aunt and cousins will be going there too.

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:21.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that doesn’t make any sense.

00:09:21.706 --> 00:09:23.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They should keep you together.

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:28.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at least the brothers said
that the list was just a recommendation.

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:33.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they didn’t say it exactly like that.

00:09:33.343 --> 00:09:36.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said,
“if we had extenuating circumstances.”

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:38.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you don’t have to go if you don’t want to go.

00:09:39.975 --> 00:09:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Kim,
if everyone did that, don’t you think—

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hi, Sister Taylor.

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:46.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hello, girls.

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:49.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw your name
on the list for the South Congregation,

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:53.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but your grandkids and their families
—they’re going to North.

00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:55.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are you going to do?

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you mean?

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:02.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, are you going to North,
or are you going to South?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Sweetie, didn’t you say you saw

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:08.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my name listed under the South Congregation?

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:10.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but . . .

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll be going to the South Congregation.

00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, don’t you think it would make more sense

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:20.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you were in the same congregation
as your grandkids and their families?

00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:24.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it make more sense?

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:28.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a whole different question.

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:30.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers outlined an arrangement.

00:10:30.358 --> 00:10:33.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said they hoped
we could support that arrangement

00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:37.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless we had extenuating circumstances,

00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:39.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I don’t have any right now.

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me, it’s simple.

00:10:42.329 --> 00:10:45.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether I know all of the reasons or not,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to support that arrangement.

00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:51.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, look, girls, I’ve got to go.

00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:53.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, and by the way,

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope to see you both
in the South Congregation.

00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:01.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter, you got a sec?

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:06.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think this experience well illustrates

00:11:06.144 --> 00:11:08.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one way to show courage now,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s by following
the direction of the brothers taking the lead

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:16.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even if we don’t fully understand
the reasons why this direction is being given.

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:19.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:21.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been told

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:24.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when Gog of Magog
attacks Jehovah’s people,

00:11:24.913 --> 00:11:26.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may receive direction

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:30.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may not seem practical.

00:11:30.043 --> 00:11:33.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, courageously following directions now

00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:36.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to do so then.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, we’re almost done.

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:45.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, we’re almost done.

00:11:45.058 --> 00:11:48.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you don’t mind,
I’d like to share what happened with my group.

00:11:50.438 --> 00:11:53.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Monroes asked if I would join them
on one of their Family Worship evenings.

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s ask our final review question:

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How can we prepare ourselves
for the events that are to come?”

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:03.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah.

00:12:03.451 --> 00:12:05.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to develop heartfelt obedience

00:12:05.954 --> 00:12:08.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the guidance that we receive now,

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:12.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’ll obey
any future instructions Jehovah may give us.

00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:18.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, doing this will help us survive Armageddon.

00:12:18.508 --> 00:12:20.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well said.

00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:21.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice, Dear.

00:12:23.555 --> 00:12:24.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May I ask Brad a question?

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, go ahead.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:32.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brad, I noticed
you’ve really been focused on that picture.

00:12:32.397 --> 00:12:35.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you mind if I ask what you’re thinking about?

00:12:37.485 --> 00:12:42.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, will the brothers tell us
how to fight the people who will be attacking us?

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:45.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t need to do any fighting.

00:12:45.577 --> 00:12:47.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then what will we need the instructions for?

00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:50.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we just going to stand there and do nothing?

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:53.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know
what those instructions will be, Son.

00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:57.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brad, when Armageddon comes,

00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have nothing to worry about

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:03.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we won’t have to fight.

00:13:03.303 --> 00:13:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that because of what Jehovah
has done for his people in the past.

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:11.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to show you an account

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:15.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:20.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a time when Moabites and Ammonites

00:13:20.612 --> 00:13:23.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to war against the land of Judah,

00:13:23.698 --> 00:13:26.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was being ruled by King Jehoshaphat.

00:13:26.451 --> 00:13:31.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of those Israelites
were likely anxious, just like you.

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:36.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoshaphat gathered Judah at the temple

00:13:36.503 --> 00:13:38.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and began to inquire of Jehovah.

00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:43.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah caused
a Levite named Jahaziel to give an answer

00:13:43.718 --> 00:13:46.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that gave everyone courage.

00:13:48.056 --> 00:13:50.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he say?

00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:53.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:58.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or be terrified because of this large crowd,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the battle is not yours

00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:03.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but God’s. . . .

00:14:03.738 --> 00:14:06.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will not need to fight this battle.

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:09.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take your position, stand still,

00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:13.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.”

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:28.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had turned
the enemies against each other.

00:14:28.138 --> 00:14:30.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time the Israelites arrived,

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:33.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one soldier was left.

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:39.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was obvious
that Brad’s courage was strengthened

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:42.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after reviewing this Bible account.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m happy to say that after our discussions,

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the friends in our group are more aware
of how their own acts of courage now

00:14:49.993 --> 00:14:52.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help them be courageous in the future.

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:55.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough from me.

00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:57.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your turn, Albert.

00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:01.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough from me.

00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:02.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your turn, Albert.

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:04.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did things go with your group?

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:07.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All responded nicely,

00:15:07.343 --> 00:15:11.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was one discussion
about courage that I didn’t anticipate.

00:15:11.014 --> 00:15:13.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember when Philip got accepted

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:15.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work with LDC as a construction volunteer?

00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, getting accepted to LDC
wasn’t quite what he expected.

00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:27.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, Philip! This is great!

00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:30.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s what everybody keeps saying.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just overwhelming.

00:15:32.202 --> 00:15:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I was more cut out for Bethel.

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But construction volunteer

00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:40.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I don’t even know what that is.

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows where they’ll send me?

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:45.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what if I get asked to do stuff
I’ve never done before?

00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:48.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip, your concerns are understandable.

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:52.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just don’t think I can handle all of this.

00:15:54.015 --> 00:15:56.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think you can either.

00:15:58.812 --> 00:16:02.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, I’m glad someone finally agrees with me.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say I don’t think you can handle this assignment

00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it requires more than you to get it done.

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:13.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know what you’re saying.

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:16.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah will help me.

00:16:16.037 --> 00:16:18.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you really believe that?

00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:21.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do, but . . .

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what?

00:16:23.962 --> 00:16:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess what I’m saying is I’m afraid.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s OK.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I first arrived
in this congregation as my SKE assignment,

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid.

00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, one verse
that really helped me is 1 Chronicles 28:20.

00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are David’s words to his son Solomon,

00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom Jehovah assigned to build the temple.

00:16:52.073 --> 00:16:54.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then David said to his son Solomon:

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be courageous and strong and go to work.

00:16:58.162 --> 00:17:00.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid or be terrified,

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:03.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for Jehovah God, my God, is with you.

00:17:03.543 --> 00:17:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘He will not desert you or abandon you,

00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but he will be with you

00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:12.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until all the work for the service
of Jehovah’s house is finished.’”

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:19.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This verse reminded me
not to overthink all that needs to be done.

00:17:19.267 --> 00:17:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just get started.

00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:25.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help, you can “be courageous”

00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:27.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“go to work”!

00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s Philip, happy as can be.

He’s really doing well.

00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:01.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Albert, for sharing that with us.

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:07.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers,
it’s clear that Jehovah has blessed

00:18:07.982 --> 00:18:11.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hard work of the body of elders.

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:17.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now there’s something I wanted to say

00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:20.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we conclude our meeting.

00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:25.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s—that’s, ah . . .

00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:32.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know, David; we know.

00:18:32.757 --> 00:18:34.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re feeling it too.

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but I just have to say it.

00:18:40.723 --> 00:18:44.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve really appreciated serving with you brothers.

00:18:46.145 --> 00:18:49.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw that our congregation
was going to be merged,

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:52.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wasn’t easy for me.

00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:58.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we sure couldn’t tell.

00:18:58.449 --> 00:19:01.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it really hit me hard

00:19:03.621 --> 00:19:06.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the night we posted the list

00:19:06.332 --> 00:19:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recommending where the publishers should go.

00:19:14.924 --> 00:19:17.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems like it would have made more sense

00:19:17.677 --> 00:19:20.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to be assigned to the North Congregation,

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:23.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the majority of my friends will be going.

00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve known those friends
longer than any of the other brothers.

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:32.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they’re sending
that younger elder over to North

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:35.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the coordinator of their body of elders.

00:19:35.486 --> 00:19:38.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just don’t get it.

00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why am I having such a hard time with this?

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
I’m going to go to the South Congregation.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no reason not to.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the problem is my attitude.

00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:02.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve told others for years that there are times

00:20:02.764 --> 00:20:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we have to put aside
our personal preferences

00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:10.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show our wholehearted support
of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:13.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of those times.

00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:15.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to be courageous

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stand up to selfishness
and independent thinking,

00:20:19.447 --> 00:20:22.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it’s my own.

00:20:25.078 --> 00:20:27.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was reminded.

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:29.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s simple.

00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:34.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah’s organization
outlines an arrangement,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we support it,

00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:39.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just because we’re supposed to;

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:41.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do it with the right attitude.

00:20:41.928 --> 00:20:43.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen to that.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a lesson we’re all learning.

00:20:46.891 --> 00:20:50.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m glad
we’ve been able to shepherd the congregation

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the changes take place.

00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:54.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now our brothers and sisters are better equipped

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:57.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face the challenges ahead with courage.

00:20:59.362 --> 00:21:03.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a real pleasure to serve with you all.

00:21:04.283 --> 00:21:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter, would you please conclude
our meeting with prayer?

00:21:08.538 --> 00:21:09.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:15.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Father, Jehovah . . .

The next part of our program is one

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve come to enjoy so much
in the past few years.

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:13.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the prerecorded video The Inside Story.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This installment of The Inside Story will be hosted

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Kenneth Stovall,
with our Theocratic Schools Department.

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s give attention to and enjoy this video.

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:53.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this edition of The Inside Story.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine yourself as a child

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
growing up in a country
where our work is under ban.

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that be like?

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to find out
as we talk to a couple from Romania.

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you familiar with the progress
of our work in India?

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’re in for a few surprises
as we talk to four students

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who come to us from the India branch.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s get started by introducing our first guests.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Romania
—please welcome Ionuţ and Delia Cicio.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice to see you.

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good to see you, Brother Stovall.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to The Inside Story.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a privilege to be here.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is—but a nervous privilege.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I hope you’re not too nervous.

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to start with, could you just help us

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand how
the work got started in Romania?

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work started in 1911.

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By 1919, there were over 1,700 publishers

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:55.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 150 groups or congregations in Romania.

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My goodness, that was very fast growth!

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was some opposition to the work.

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, in 1949,
the Communist government banned our work,

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:09.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sadly, it lasted until 1990.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s amazing!
So that’s 40 years under ban.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, as I understand it,

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s when both of your families got the truth
—when the ban was going on.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that correct?

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my mother was a baby

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:24.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my grandparents got baptized,

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so she grew up in the truth.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, my grandmother was
a pioneer under the ban for many years.

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, my two sisters and I

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were raised in the truth.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very interesting.

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Ionuţ, what about you?

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents were contacted by the Witnesses

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ten years before the ban was lifted,

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my sister and I were also raised in the truth.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is very interesting.

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, we have talked about brothers
who were faithful under ban who were adults,

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you were children while
the ban was going on, and you stayed faithful.

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Delia, do you remember what it was like

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going to meetings under ban?

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we met secretly in small groups.

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends would arrive at different times,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but once everyone was inside the home,

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would lock the gate and the door

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pull down all of the shades.

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:17.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The meetings were moved
to a different location each week.

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:18.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very interesting.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it must have been, though,

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:23.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you probably had to miss
a lot of meetings under ban.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no—we didn’t want to miss
any opportunity to meet together.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:29.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But weren’t you frightened in these meetings

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(where you’d pulled down all the shades)

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:34.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you might be discovered or arrested?

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:37.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might think so, but the opposite was true.

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt the most safe when we were all together.

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could feel Jehovah’s protection.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very touching.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Ionuţ, did you and Delia
know each other growing up?

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we grew up in the same town, Negreşti-Oaş,

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so our families knew each other.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:58.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did your families, then,
occasionally attend the same meetings?

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we didn’t.

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, my family was

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:06.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a separate group from Delia’s family.

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:08.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a separate group?

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:10.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, explain what you mean.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might remember Brother Lösch’s video

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the 2018 annual meeting.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He explained how government spies

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:21.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
infiltrated the Witnesses in Romania,

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:25.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this made it difficult to know who to trust.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This caused the Witnesses to separate

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into two large groups

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one group stayed in contact

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with world headquarters in Brooklyn,

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other did not.

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But both groups continued to worship Jehovah.

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing!

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you grew up
—both of you as Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but associating with different groups.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did one group view
the other group as apostates?

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generally, no.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t see the other group as apostates.

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our beliefs were essentially the same.

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I should mention that when I was small,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember my mother
stayed up one night studying.

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:09.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all night of study,
meditation, and prayer,

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:13.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she decided to switch to the group
connected to the main organization.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s why I grew up as a part of the group
associated with the main organization.

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, it sounds like your mother
was very conscientious

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and set a really good example for you.

00:05:24.052 --> 00:05:27.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I deeply appreciate her and my grandparents

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:30.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for being faithful examples and good teachers.

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:33.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, when you say good teachers,
what do you mean?

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:38.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we kept beehives in our garden;

00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother helped us to see how
Jehovah made them to be industrious.

00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:45.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then she drew the lesson
that we could be industrious like the bees,

00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in spite of the ban,
we could stay busy serving Jehovah.

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:53.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those must be some cherished memories,
those lessons like that.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I wonder.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:58.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At meetings, since the literature was banned,
what did you study?

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At meetings, usually there was one copy
of The Watchtower for the whole group.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the paragraph was read,

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:09.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would listen and answer the question from memory.

00:06:09.056 --> 00:06:13.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My goodness, you had
to pay really close attention at the meetings.

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were there ever times
when you could get together in larger groups?

00:06:18.148 --> 00:06:21.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t have assemblies and conventions,

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:24.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we could have funerals,

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:27.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weddings, picnics.

00:06:27.157 --> 00:06:29.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These became our assemblies and conventions.

00:06:29.576 --> 00:06:32.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, a funeral could have

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many as 1,000 people,

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it could last up to four hours.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about songs?

00:06:39.753 --> 00:06:42.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The songbook would have been part
of the banned literature.

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:45.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you sing songs at your meetings?

00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:47.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember being a child

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting together to memorize the songs.

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:52.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoyed that; it was entertainment for us.

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:54.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you memorized the songs?

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if someone called out a song number,

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:59.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could sing the song from memory?

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:03.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was going to school like under ban?

00:07:03.402 --> 00:07:06.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our classmates and our neighbors

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all knew we were Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:11.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when under ban,

00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:16.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we didn’t hide our identity as Witnesses.

00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:19.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just hid the things

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the government outlawed, such as meetings,

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:24.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching, literature.

00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:27.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you must have been very determined

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:29.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay faithful in school.

00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:31.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever happened to the two groups?

00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:35.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m happy to say they reunited

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one organization in 1988;

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:42.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the ban was lifted in 1990.

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:44.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were overjoyed.

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:45.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can imagine.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have felt a great deal of relief

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:50.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they could go about
their spiritual routine without the ban.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:51.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I learned a lesson I never want to forget:

00:07:55.412 --> 00:08:00.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ban or no ban,
we are always under attack by Satan.

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:04.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw brothers that stayed faithful during the ban

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:07.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but fell away once the ban was lifted.

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:10.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As circumstances change,

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will always look for new ways to attack us.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:18.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So ban or no ban,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must stay close to Jehovah.

00:08:21.104 --> 00:08:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are profound thoughts, Ionuţ.

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:29.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how is Jehovah blessing
the work in Romania today?

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:33.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, there are more than
40,000 Witnesses in Romania.

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:37.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we brought a video
that shows what’s being done in Romania today.

00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see it?

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that would be wonderful!

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:
“Be on the watch for the false prophets

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who come to you in sheep’s covering,

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:57.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inside they are ravenous wolves.”

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the mid-20th century,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government agents in Romania used techniques

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to infiltrate the congregation

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feigning interest
and posing as spiritual brothers.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were so convincing
that some were even appointed as elders

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given very responsible positions.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not knowing who could be trusted,

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large group of brothers
separated from the organization

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:25.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was being used by headquarters.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:29.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, they were really brothers in their heart;

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they loved the truth.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1988,

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:38.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a reunification of about 5,000 was accomplished.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:42.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now that our Romanian brothers
and sisters were reunited,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could fully work “shoulder to shoulder”

00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:48.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sharing the good news of God’s Kingdom.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was beautiful timing

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because conditions in Romania were ripe

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for accelerated spiritual growth.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1990, the ban that they had endured

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than 40 years was finally lifted.

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers Ian Florian and Tetu Bindu

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:10.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember the period of fiery test.

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:13.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one time, Brother Florian
was part of the separated group.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Bindu was always with a congregation

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that remained with the main organization

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
associated with headquarters.

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They now serve together
as elders in the congregation.

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I returned to Jehovah’s organization,

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had experienced
the most profound and noble feelings

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only someone who belongs
to Jehovah’s worldwide family can have.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, they serve in unity

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:42.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy many spiritual blessings.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:45.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like so many other mature ones
with a similar background,

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:50.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their rich history and experience
benefit younger ones.

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just six years after the ban was lifted,

00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:56.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of publishers nearly doubled.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regular pioneers increased
by nearly 3,000 percent.

00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:04.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are now more than 40,000 publishers.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:09.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking forward,
the Romanian branch has begun working

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:12.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Central European branch
to form foreign-language circuits

00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:16.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Hungarian- and Romany-speaking people.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, a seminar was organized

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for language instructors.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:25.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unity of our Romanian brothers and sisters

00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:28.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is making it possible to reach

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:32.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people of all languages with the good news.

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:36.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The cold, insidious tactics of Satan’s agents

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:40.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
failed to separate our brothers from Jehovah

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and each other,

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even now,

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is blessing them

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a spiritual paradise.

00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:01.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful video!

00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, the brothers in Romania,

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:07.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both the adults and the children,

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:10.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a lot of courage and faith

00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:12.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep their integrity under the ban.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Ionuţ and Delia,
for sharing your story with us.

00:12:22.053 --> 00:12:24.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s introduce our next guests.

00:12:24.681 --> 00:12:29.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From India, we have not two, but four students.

00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:32.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please welcome Sarb and Geeta Dhillon

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:34.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Puneet and Ritu Aggarwal.

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:37.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ritu.

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:39.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Brother Stovall.

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:42.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, good to see you.

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:49.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

00:12:49.247 --> 00:12:51.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you!

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you all serve at the India branch,

00:12:53.543 --> 00:12:55.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as I understand,

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:57.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are in English congregations.

00:12:57.297 --> 00:13:00.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are several
English congregations in India.

00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:01.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very interesting.

00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:04.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So could we start by having you just explain

00:13:04.638 --> 00:13:06.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little bit about the background
of the work in India?

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure!

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work got started around 1905.

00:13:10.393 --> 00:13:13.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a man called A. J. Joseph.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had questions about the Bible,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and somebody gave him books
by Brother Russell.

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He read those books

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:23.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and came into the truth,

00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for around 60 years,

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he proved to be instrumental
in establishing the work in India.

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:32.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is amazing how Jehovah used Brother Russell

00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:34.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spread the good news so far!

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:35.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, Brother Russell went to India
in 1912, and in one village,

00:13:40.632 --> 00:13:44.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the villagers actually changed
the name of the village to Russelpuram,

00:13:44.886 --> 00:13:46.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which means “The Place of Russell.”

00:13:46.888 --> 00:13:48.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing!
So is it still there today?

00:13:49.432 --> 00:13:53.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s in the beautiful state of Kerala,
which is in the south of India.

00:13:53.144 --> 00:13:56.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are a lot of misconceptions about India.

00:13:56.272 --> 00:13:57.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-huh.

00:13:57.148 --> 00:13:59.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, when you see pictures,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see what appear to be
tremendously overcrowded cities,

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:05.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there must be more to India than that.

00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:09.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, brother, actually India is a very, very diverse country,

00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:11.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a very beautiful country.

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:13.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go to the north of India,

00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have
the world famous Himalayan Mountains;

00:14:16.292 --> 00:14:19.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you go to the northwest,
you will find the Great Indian Desert;

00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you go to the southwest and southeast,
you will have miles of beaches;

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:26.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in the southern tip of it,

00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:29.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have another national beauty
that’s called backwaters.

00:14:29.013 --> 00:14:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are actually lagoons or lakes.

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:34.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful country!

00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:35.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:37.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what diversity!

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:41.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, the peoples and the cultures
are as diverse as the country.

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:44.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we have over 700 languages.

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seven hundred languages!

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:48.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s amazing!

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:51.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about religion?
Is it diverse also?

00:14:51.035 --> 00:14:54.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the majority of people are Hindus,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there are also Buddhists and Muslims.

00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, there are several states in the northeast,

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:04.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known as the Seven Sisters,
where people profess to be Christians.

00:15:04.382 --> 00:15:06.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many people are we talking about?

00:15:06.384 --> 00:15:07.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions of people.

00:15:08.219 --> 00:15:10.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are millions of people in India
that profess to be Christian.

00:15:10.597 --> 00:15:11.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:15:11.264 --> 00:15:12.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not know that.

00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:15.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the situation
with Jehovah’s Witnesses in India?

00:15:16.686 --> 00:15:20.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have just under
50,000 Witnesses in the whole of India.

00:15:20.982 --> 00:15:23.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a ratio of 1 publisher

00:15:23.568 --> 00:15:26.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every 27,000 people.

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:29.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what that means is that some 90 percent

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:32.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our territory is actually unworked,

00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:35.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the need over there is very, very great!

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can see there’s an amazing need.

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:41.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in those states where the people are,

00:15:41.085 --> 00:15:44.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or profess to be, Christian,
there are actually millions of people

00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:47.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can speak to about the truth very easily.

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:49.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s also been an amazing response

00:15:49.135 --> 00:15:51.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the truth in other parts of India too.

00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:52.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing response?

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:56.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do you mean by amazing response?

00:15:56.851 --> 00:16:01.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there have been reports
of congregations where there are 50 publishers,

00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:05.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but over 850 people have attended the Memorial,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example, in places like Kaushambi and Allahabad.

00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers have been sent 
into untouched territories,

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:15.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into villages where villagers just come out,

00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:18.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sit on the ground,
and listen to the brothers for hours.

00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are such interesting reports.

00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:22.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you personally?

00:16:22.627 --> 00:16:27.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, what have you personally experienced
as far as response to the truth?

00:16:27.423 --> 00:16:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother, when I was a pioneer back in my congregation,

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:32.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found people were very, very nice.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were always ready to listen.

00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:37.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t difficult to start two
or three Bible studies in a day.

00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:40.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And eventually,
I came to the point that I couldn’t continue

00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:43.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the house-to-house ministry
because I had so many Bible studies.

00:16:43.982 --> 00:16:45.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s fantastic!

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes the people so eager to listen?

00:16:48.736 --> 00:16:53.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Indian people
in general are spiritually-minded,

00:16:53.283 --> 00:16:55.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the majority do believe

00:16:55.368 --> 00:16:59.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the existence of a God, or even many gods.

00:16:59.122 --> 00:17:02.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many people
feel downtrodden and overlooked,

00:17:02.876 --> 00:17:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so they are drawn to the love and respect

00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:08.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they experience among the brothers.

00:17:08.006 --> 00:17:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And especially when they learn about a Creator

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who actually loves them and cares for them,

00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:16.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it changes their viewpoint toward themselves,

00:17:16.389 --> 00:17:19.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that also helps them to come into the truth.

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:24.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, given the need
and the response that you’re getting,

00:17:24.105 --> 00:17:26.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you get help from other places,

00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:29.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like from brothers or publishers
from other countries?

00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:34.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, every year we organize special campaigns

00:17:34.198 --> 00:17:37.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to cover some of our unworked territory,

00:17:37.327 --> 00:17:41.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have friends come from other countries
who support these campaigns.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does that work out?

00:17:42.999 --> 00:17:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the friends who come
really enjoy themselves.

00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:49.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They enjoy themselves so much
that they often come back again

00:17:49.297 --> 00:17:51.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for longer periods of time.

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have need-greaters in India?

00:17:53.843 --> 00:17:55.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do!

00:17:55.011 --> 00:17:56.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you use more?

00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:57.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes, please!

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is also
a growing sign-language field in India.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The deaf field is one
of the fastest growing fields in India.

00:18:05.188 --> 00:18:08.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a few years ago,
there were no congregations for the deaf,

00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:11.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but today, we have 13 congregations

00:18:11.027 --> 00:18:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and over 46 pregroups and groups.

00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:16.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
Again, that’s amazing response.

00:18:16.282 --> 00:18:19.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of sign language do you use in India?

00:18:19.994 --> 00:18:22.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it similar to American Sign Language?

00:18:22.455 --> 00:18:24.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
We have Indian Sign Language,

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:27.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is very natural and very easy to learn.

00:18:27.377 --> 00:18:29.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I can help you to learn some.

00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:30.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can try!

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:31.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, OK.

00:18:31.464 --> 00:18:34.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the sign for women is like this

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they wear nose rings,

00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:38.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sign for men is like this

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:41.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have mustaches
—not all, of course.

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:46.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I just act like I’m eating a fruit.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now I’m going to do a sign,
and let’s see if you can understand.

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can guess.

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:52.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re giving me a test.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s from the Bible; it’s very easy.

00:18:54.195 --> 00:18:57.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if I do like this, which Bible character is it?

00:18:57.448 --> 00:18:58.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eve.

00:18:58.324 --> 00:18:59.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh!
Very good!

00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I do like that?

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:02.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam.

00:19:02.912 --> 00:19:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
Very good!

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m on my way to learning Indian Sign Language.

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, yes!

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent!

00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:10.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Stovall, the deaf people

00:19:10.962 --> 00:19:13.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are really drawn to the attention

00:19:13.256 --> 00:19:15.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they receive in the congregation

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:19.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, unfortunately,
in the Indian society, they are neglected.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, there was a brother who was trying

00:19:21.973 --> 00:19:25.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to contact a deaf man to arrange for a meeting.

00:19:25.643 --> 00:19:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the deaf man asked
if he could bring a friend along.

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:32.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the brothers arrived at his village,

00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:36.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found the interested person
—the deaf man—

00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:39.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not just one of his friends was with him,

00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:43.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but 136 of his deaf friends

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had come along with him to listen.

00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:47.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Incredible!

00:19:47.874 --> 00:19:52.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How in the world could
the brothers speak to 136 people?

00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:54.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there was a school nearby,

00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:58.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they divided the full group
into classrooms there.

00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can see there is a tremendous amount

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:05.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of work to do in India!

00:20:05.308 --> 00:20:08.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a lovely video to show to you.

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A video!
Let’s watch!

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:15.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you considered India?

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have a list of questions, such as:

00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:25.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there really a great need in India?

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the facts:

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For every 1 Witness,

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:33.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are about 27,000
potential brothers and sisters.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the response?

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have moved here are finding

00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:42.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many progressive Bible studies
as they can handle.

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:45.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a married couple?

00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:47.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a single person?

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what your situation,

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:54.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the thought of moving to India
must raise questions like:

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What about the food?

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:02.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What about the culture?

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How will I get around?

00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:10.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it like to live here?’

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:15.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With some research,
the answers may surprise you.

00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:22.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all are searching
for those “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are praying for a fuller share in this work,

00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:28.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask Jehovah if he will help you

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“step over” into India.

00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:39.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a fascinating view of India!

00:21:39.694 --> 00:21:41.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you feel

00:21:41.988 --> 00:21:45.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you see the work really taking off in India?

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there is no doubt that the end is so close,

00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:54.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we all feel that now is the time for India.

00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:56.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, therefore, we are very much excited

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:59.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what Jehovah has in store for us there.

00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:03.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for coming
and sharing these things with us.

00:22:03.801 --> 00:22:05.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging to hear
how our young ones were faithful under the ban

00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:17.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see what our brothers
in Romania are doing today!

00:22:17.773 --> 00:22:20.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you heard those reports from India,

00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:23.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were you not reminded of Jesus’ words:

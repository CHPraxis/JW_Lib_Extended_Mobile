00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:06.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work as a legal secretary.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was quite happy with the work I was doing,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was just coasting along,

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t really have
that burning desire, at the time, to pioneer.

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:16.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I specifically remember
a talk about young ones

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what they were doing with their lives—

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:20.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really did make me think.

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work three days a week as a nanny.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good job for me.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps me to do something that I love

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also have the freedom
to do things for Jehovah.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love construction
and particularly wanted to get involved

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the project going on at Chelmsford.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the time,
I lived in the northeast of England,

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would have been
way too far to commute.

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My work consists
of supporting people in the community

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with mental health issues.

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband was involved in construction
—that was his work—

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:54.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also he made himself available

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be involved in any Kingdom Hall build,
any construction.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the beginning I thought:
‘Yeah, that’s his thing, not my thing.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll stay home and pioneer.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My construction skill is nonexistent.’

00:01:06.503 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The talk just helped me to see

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if I didn’t have a desire to pioneer,
then I should pray.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really felt motivated
to want to change my life,

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I started regular pioneering.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing young sisters and brothers, as well,

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:24.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were getting involved
with doing different aspects of worship,

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing their joy
in what they were doing constructionwise

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really spurred me on
to want to apply as well.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah
that I really wanted to be involved somehow

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the project
and that he would work things out.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started looking for accommodations
and started looking for work.

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And within days,
I had a job and somewhere to live;

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and two weeks later,
I moved to London.

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew my husband loved it so much,

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I thought, ‘I’ll come with him.’

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Losing my husband in death
is just something that happened

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very suddenly and very quickly.

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, I had to go back home,

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the avenue

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was opened for me
to come back again if I wished to.

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a period of time,
I decided I would come back.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:20.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were
very conscious of my circumstance.

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my family.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jehovah’s organization
without a doubt.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers have given me
all the support I need.

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s always best
to be busy in Jehovah’s work;

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s part of healing.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came on-site and the brothers said,

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:42.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’d like you to drive one our machines,”

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d never driven
construction machinery before.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:50.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was able to be trained
and felt confident after that.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was invited to work
on the Home Cleaning Team.

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not what I thought
I would be doing in construction,

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s fun, and I really love knowing
that Jehovah is happy with the work we do.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very quickly after I moved,

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:08.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was invited to commute
to the branch relocation project.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first half of my week

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is working with children
and playing with toy trucks,

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the second half of my week,

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am driving this huge machine
on a building site.

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:22.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s really good emphasis on training,

00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you never feel
completely out of your depth.

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy training;
it’s a very rewarding assignment.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters pay attention to detail;

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:33.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t get overconfident

00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:36.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have a healthy respect
for the machines that they’re driving.

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:39.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many positive comments

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from contractors and various authorities

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the proactive training
and use of women on our construction site.

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:50.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re amazed at what they see
because it’s not normal in the industry.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of what it says
in Romans chapter 16,

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:55.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the apostle Paul
mentions women by name

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“working hard in the Lord,”

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here on this site,
we have lots of women doing just that.

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having no construction skills
hasn’t stopped me from being used at all.

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:08.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re seeing sisters
being used for things

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:11.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would never have pictured
themselves doing,

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re doing it,
and it’s because they’ve been trained,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s because Jehovah is behind it.

00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:18.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being here has drawn me closer to Jehovah

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a sense that you rely on him,

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I rely on him daily.

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had told me three years ago

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:29.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’d be commuting
to the project every week

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and driving a massive truck around on-site,

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I probably wouldn’t have believed you.

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I absolutely love coming here;
it’s like a dream come true.

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just don’t want it to end.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:44.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back to when I first heard
that talk at the convention,

00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really pleased that I used my time

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in these last days to serve Jehovah.

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:54.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would encourage anybody
to be in full-time service

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s such a joyful way of life.

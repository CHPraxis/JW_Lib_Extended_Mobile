00:00:03 I work as a legal secretary.
00:00:06 I was quite happy with the work I was doing,
00:00:08 but I was just coasting along,
00:00:10 and I didn’t really have that burning desire, at the time, to pioneer.
00:00:13 I specifically remember a talk about young ones
00:00:16 —what they were doing with their lives—
00:00:18 and it really did make me think.
00:00:20 I work three days a week as a nanny.
00:00:22 It’s a good job for me.
00:00:24 It helps me to do something that I love
00:00:26 but also have the freedom to do things for Jehovah.
00:00:29 I really love construction and particularly wanted to get involved
00:00:33 with the project going on at Chelmsford.
00:00:35 But at the time, I lived in the northeast of England,
00:00:38 which would have been way too far to commute.
00:00:42 My work consists of supporting people in the community
00:00:45 with mental health issues.
00:00:47 My husband was involved in construction —that was his work—
00:00:51 but also he made himself available
00:00:54 to be involved in any Kingdom Hall build, any construction.
00:00:57 So in the beginning I thought: ‘Yeah, that’s his thing, not my thing.
00:01:01 ‘I’ll stay home and pioneer.
00:01:03 My construction skill is nonexistent.’
00:01:06 The talk just helped me to see
00:01:09 that if I didn’t have a desire to pioneer, then I should pray.
00:01:12 I really felt motivated to want to change my life,
00:01:16 so I started regular pioneering.
00:01:18 Seeing young sisters and brothers, as well,
00:01:21 that were getting involved with doing different aspects of worship,
00:01:24 and seeing their joy in what they were doing constructionwise
00:01:28 really spurred me on to want to apply as well.
00:01:32 I prayed to Jehovah that I really wanted to be involved somehow
00:01:36 in the project and that he would work things out.
00:01:39 I started looking for accommodations and started looking for work.
00:01:42 And within days, I had a job and somewhere to live;
00:01:46 and two weeks later, I moved to London.
00:01:48 I knew my husband loved it so much,
00:01:51 so I thought, ‘I’ll come with him.’
00:01:56 Losing my husband in death is just something that happened
00:01:59 very suddenly and very quickly.
00:02:05 Initially, I had to go back home,
00:02:07 but the avenue
00:02:09 was opened for me to come back again if I wished to.
00:02:13 After a period of time, I decided I would come back.
00:02:16 The brothers were very conscious of my circumstance.
00:02:20 This is my family.
00:02:21 This is Jehovah’s organization without a doubt.
00:02:24 The brothers have given me all the support I need.
00:02:27 It’s always best to be busy in Jehovah’s work;
00:02:32 that’s part of healing.
00:02:35 When I came on-site and the brothers said,
00:02:39 “We’d like you to drive one our machines,”
00:02:42 I’d never driven construction machinery before.
00:02:45 But I was able to be trained and felt confident after that.
00:02:51 I was invited to work on the Home Cleaning Team.
00:02:54 It was not what I thought I would be doing in construction,
00:02:57 but it’s fun, and I really love knowing that Jehovah is happy with the work we do.
00:03:01 Very quickly after I moved,
00:03:04 I was invited to commute to the branch relocation project.
00:03:08 The first half of my week
00:03:10 is working with children and playing with toy trucks,
00:03:13 and then the second half of my week,
00:03:15 I am driving this huge machine on a building site.
00:03:19 There’s really good emphasis on training,
00:03:22 so you never feel completely out of your depth.
00:03:24 I really enjoy training; it’s a very rewarding assignment.
00:03:28 Sisters pay attention to detail;
00:03:31 they don’t get overconfident
00:03:33 because they have a healthy respect for the machines that they’re driving.
00:03:36 We have many positive comments
00:03:39 from contractors and various authorities
00:03:41 about the proactive training and use of women on our construction site.
00:03:46 They’re amazed at what they see because it’s not normal in the industry.
00:03:50 It reminds me of what it says in Romans chapter 16,
00:03:53 where the apostle Paul mentions women by name
00:03:55 “working hard in the Lord,”
00:03:57 and here on this site, we have lots of women doing just that.
00:04:00 Having no construction skills hasn’t stopped me from being used at all.
00:04:06 You’re seeing sisters being used for things
00:04:08 that they would never have pictured themselves doing,
00:04:11 but they’re doing it, and it’s because they’ve been trained,
00:04:13 and it’s because Jehovah is behind it.
00:04:15 Being here has drawn me closer to Jehovah
00:04:18 in a sense that you rely on him,
00:04:21 that I rely on him daily.
00:04:24 If you had told me three years ago
00:04:26 that I’d be commuting to the project every week
00:04:29 and driving a massive truck around on-site,
00:04:32 I probably wouldn’t have believed you.
00:04:34 I absolutely love coming here; it’s like a dream come true.
00:04:37 I just don’t want it to end.
00:04:41 Looking back to when I first heard that talk at the convention,
00:04:44 I’m really pleased that I used my time
00:04:47 in these last days to serve Jehovah.
00:04:50 I would encourage anybody to be in full-time service
00:04:54 because it’s such a joyful way of life.

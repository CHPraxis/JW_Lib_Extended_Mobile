I suppose whatever we give to Jehovah

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:25.921 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is little in comparison with what he gives to us.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And like Malachi 3:10 says, you know,

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:29.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we just have to ‘bring in the tenth part.’

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s really all that Jehovah is asking,

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he pours out a blessing.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And part of those blessings from Malachi 3:10,

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I consider to be
the friendships that we’ve gained.

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:42.855 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For me, my favorite thing is the people.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s always just getting to work

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:47.985 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with your brothers every day.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The personalities shine through,
even with language differences.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just make friends,
and you just get this taste

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what the new world is going to be like.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:59.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Side by side with our brothers,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve made parent figures
and brother and sister figures,

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everybody just becomes
part of such a solid family.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Working along with the local brothers and sisters

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:12.676 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made it clear to me

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.054 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we really are in the organization

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is directing today.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:23.312 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What I have seen is how Jehovah’s spirit

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:25.940 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
operates in his organization.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many international servants here

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from various countries,

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:33.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with different personalities,

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with our local brothers
with their distinct customs.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it was time to work, we were as one.

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There wasn’t a big guy, a little guy,

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone more intelligent, or less intelligent.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all formed one united team.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The language definitely was an issue for me.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first I thought,

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will I really be able to work with the brothers?’

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since I didn’t understand the language,

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how could I explain
the work that had to be done?

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, if you go in there with a good attitude

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:15.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re just having
a good time working with your brothers,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not going to have too much of a problem.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smiles
—they cross borders.

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.253 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Chiclayo dedication program

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:32.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was held April 9, 2016,

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.341 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the Trujillo Assembly Hall

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.760 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was dedicated shortly thereafter,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.179 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on July 31.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All present marveled with appreciation

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at seeing the facilities,

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their own new Assembly Hall.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.281 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before, we had to work a lot,

00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:59.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
maybe up to 15 days beforehand

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:02.661 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to prepare a completely inappropriate site.

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not anymore.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the brothers only need to maintain it

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and simply arrive
in order to enjoy their assembly.

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:12.963 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that this new Assembly Hall

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:14.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will strengthen the spirituality

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:16.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I can say something about the video monitors:

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:25.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve revolutionized
Jehovah’s method of teaching.

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:28.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We get so much more out of the talks now

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.563 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because we can see

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:31.148 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the gestures of the brothers.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.150 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It really touches the heart.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so amazing!

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember more than 25 years ago,

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:41.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah and said,

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, please,
permit me at some point to see

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:47.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an Assembly Hall here.”

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Jehovah let me

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be part of the buying process,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of getting the documentation,

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:55.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of being part of the construction.

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember, and I say,

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah answered my prayer.”

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:06.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, it affected me

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:09.144 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
seeing the construction progress

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:11.146 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because when we first arrived

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.315 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at our project in Chiclayo,

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you know what the brothers had

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.278 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and what they were using as an Assembly Hall.

00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:20.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then to see the finished project

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.574 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we see now,

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:25.494 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy for the brothers and sisters.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:28.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s so beautiful, clean, neat, and tidy.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:31.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s like, in reality, for where it is,

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.168 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s a little jewel within that whole city

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:37.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to me when I see the completed project.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:42.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know that brothers
do just love to be able to care for that place,

00:04:42.344 --> 00:04:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to worship Jehovah there,
and to be with their brothers and sisters.

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing that will ever compare

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this wonderful experience
we’ve been able to have.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been great!

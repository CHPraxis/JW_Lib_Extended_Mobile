WEBVTT

00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:03.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This morning, I thought we’d talk about accepting

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.388 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the facts about our figurative heart

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and how that safeguards

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:12.062 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the day’s text

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.898 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in its entirety

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jeremiah chapter 17.

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:22.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a sobering inspired thought

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our heavenly Father!

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah chapter 17

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 9:

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart is more treacherous

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:35.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than anything else and is desperate.”

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have it.

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the truth.

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jehovah makes very clear to us

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:47.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that each and every one of us
has to deal with a treacherous,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or deceitful, figurative heart.

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how encompassing

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the expression here

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“more treacherous than anything else.”

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what complicates it even more
is that it’s desperate.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It always wants its way

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so a lot to meditate on.

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now,
Jehovah put it here for the very reason

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to accept this fact.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:17.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to safeguard our relationship with him,

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to accept that this is the case.

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:24.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you could be a fine Christian for many years

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mature, nice outlook, nice attitude.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:33.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you ever find yourself
forgetting Jehovah’s estimation

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:37.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we have within us,
in our figurative heart,

00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:42.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re in danger
because the Devil will always exploit

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fact that our imperfect figurative hearts

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are treacherous and deceitful

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than anything else
and are desperate.

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:53.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So accept that fact.

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that we want to dwell on it,
and you start feeling,

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, what a miserable person I am!’

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though that is something
the apostle Paul acknowledged,

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just accepting the fact.

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we’re cautious about allowing

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treacherous heart to lead us astray.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, perhaps you haven’t thought
about this in a while,

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice what Jesus said

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a fundamental truth for all of us—

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in Matthew chapter 6

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we sometimes
refer to as the model prayer.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 6

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:35.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and a lot of spiritual food for thought,

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of course, anything Jesus said
is spiritual food for thought)

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 13 of Matthew chapter 6:

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And do not bring us into temptation,

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:53.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but deliver us from the wicked one.”

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:58.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s been there for all these years.

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:01.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could personally reflect on,

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:06.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When was the last time we mentioned
that in a prayer to our Father, Jehovah:

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Do not bring us into temptation

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:13.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but deliver us from the wicked one,”
or “rescue us from the wicked one”?’

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we really saying there?

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re asking our heavenly Father
to guide and help us

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:26.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re not “overreached by Satan”
—very simple.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the closer we get to the end,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make no mistake, it’s even more urgent

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:38.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep in mind the need
to beg Jehovah not to bring us into temptation

00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to guide us so that we’ll be delivered

00:03:41.604 --> 00:03:46.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this wicked one
who wants to exploit the fact that we have

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a treacherous,
traitorous figurative heart

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can ruin our relationship
with Jehovah personally.

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:58.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the apostle Paul recognized this,

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s quite interesting what he wrote

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his beloved brothers
in Thessalonians, that first letter.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’d find 1 Thessalonians,

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:11.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 3,

00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found this quite revealing.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And tying in with the thought

00:04:18.374 --> 00:04:20.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of accepting the facts
about how our figurative heart

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
safeguards our relationship
with our God and Father, Jehovah,

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 3:5,

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul writes: “That is why,
when I could bear it no longer,

00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:37.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I sent to learn of your faithfulness,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice] in case somehow

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Tempter might have tempted you,

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our labor
might have turned out to be in vain.”

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:50.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he didn’t get into any specific detail.

00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:55.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it helps us to appreciate
that there’s this danger that somehow

00:04:55.411 --> 00:05:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Tempter, Satan the Devil,
might tempt us,

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:03.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is connected with the need to beg

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah to deliver us, or rescue us,
from the wicked one

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:10.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his effort to tempt us to break our integrity

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:15.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have our cherished relationship
with Jehovah be damaged.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he knows the heart is treacherous.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:23.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whoever we are and however long
we’ve been in the truth,

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember what Paul wrote to the Thessalonians

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“somehow”—
because he’s always looking

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to somehow lead us

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:33.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into breaking our integrity to Jehovah God.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you think of Revelation chapter 12

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where we are in this stream of time,

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(this occurred to me
when preparing these thoughts here)

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:49.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation chapter 12
has very familiar thoughts here.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil is expelled from the heavens,

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:56.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and the demons, and notice

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the familiar verse 12
of Revelation chapter 12:

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘On this account be glad, you heavens

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [boy, they’re rejoicing]
those that reside in them!’

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:07.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s an exclamation.

00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:12.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, though:
“Woe for the earth and for the sea,

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:17.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because the Devil has come down to you,
having great anger,

00:06:17.026 --> 00:06:20.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that he has a short period of time.”

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if that was true
after he was ousted from the heavens,

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:27.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you think about now?

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:30.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s sobering.

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:32.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to safeguard
our relationship with Jehovah

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because notice verse 17 of the same chapter:

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:40.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the dragon became enraged.”

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great anger—he’s enraged,

00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:47.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s waging war with the remnant,
as it brings out here.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those that observe
the commandments of God

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—anyone supporting the remnant—
this is a war.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the war
is that he’s out to somehow

00:06:56.766 --> 00:07:01.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause us to break our integrity to our precious

00:07:01.003 --> 00:07:04.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heavenly Father,
so this helps us to appreciate that,

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:07.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it was long before

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:10.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the thoughts here in Revelation
and what Jesus taught us.

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Proverbs chapter 4,
it still helps us:

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:18.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“More than all else that is to be guarded,
safeguard your heart,

00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for out of it are the sources of life.”

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even back then,
there was the recognition

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:31.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to safeguard our heart
and accept the fact that our heart,

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our figurative heart, is treacherous

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’ll safeguard our precious relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:42.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to help us with that,
notice what Paul wrote

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:47.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very familiar verses in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve used this
in the ministry many times,

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:54.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet think about it as it connects

00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with safeguarding our hearts

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:00.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and accepting the fact that it’s treacherous

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:04.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we won’t break our integrity

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or allow the Devil
to somehow cause us to break our integrity.

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy chapter 3
and you’ll notice what we’re emphasizing here.

00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is in verse 16:
“All Scripture is inspired of God.”

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice the benefits.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s “for teaching,” it’s “for reproving,”
“setting things straight”

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—see the point here, though?—

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for disciplining in righteousness.”

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you think of that maybe on your Bible study.

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:36.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I use the Bible to discipline
my Bible study to get God’s thinking.’

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s appropriate that elders
use the Scriptures to discipline.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:44.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we want to emphasize here for you

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when you’re doing your
personal Bible reading (many of us),

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:53.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let the Scriptures discipline
that treacherous heart.

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a mirror.

00:08:55.918 --> 00:09:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When something hits you
because maybe you’ve had wrong thinking

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(could be all sorts of things,
anything that could lead us astray

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:07.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause us to break our integrity),
just face the fact.

00:09:07.897 --> 00:09:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just between you and Jehovah.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re reading it,
and let it discipline you in righteousness.

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what’s going
to enable us to protect

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our precious relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we all have to face that fact,
as we mentioned,

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:28.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our figurative heart is treacherous;
it’s a traitor.

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wonderful is we’re confident
that Jehovah loves us.

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:35.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he made that estimation in Jeremiah,

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:38.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s motivated by his love.

00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:42.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that helps us to protect
our relationship with him

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—facing that fact.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:46.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the way it is.

00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So indeed, we accept the fact
about our figurative heart,

00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re determined
to protect and safeguard

00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:56.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our precious relationship with Jehovah God.

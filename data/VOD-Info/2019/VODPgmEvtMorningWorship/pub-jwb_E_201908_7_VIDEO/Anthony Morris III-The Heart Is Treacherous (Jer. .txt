00:00:01 This morning, I thought we’d talk about accepting
00:00:03 the facts about our figurative heart
00:00:05 and how that safeguards
00:00:07 our relationship with Jehovah.
00:00:09 Let’s read the day’s text
00:00:12 in its entirety
00:00:14 in Jeremiah chapter 17.
00:00:18 And what a sobering inspired thought
00:00:22 from our heavenly Father!
00:00:24 Jeremiah chapter 17
00:00:26 and we’ll read verse 9:
00:00:29 “The heart is more treacherous
00:00:33 than anything else and is desperate.”
00:00:35 So there we have it.
00:00:37 That’s the truth.
00:00:39 That’s what Jehovah makes very clear to us
00:00:42 —that each and every one of us has to deal with a treacherous,
00:00:47 or deceitful, figurative heart.
00:00:49 And how encompassing
00:00:51 the expression here
00:00:53 “more treacherous than anything else.”
00:00:58 And what complicates it even more is that it’s desperate.
00:01:02 It always wants its way
00:01:05 —so a lot to meditate on.
00:01:08 And now, Jehovah put it here for the very reason
00:01:11 that we have to accept this fact.
00:01:14 And to safeguard our relationship with him,
00:01:17 we have to accept that this is the case.
00:01:20 And you could be a fine Christian for many years
00:01:24 —mature, nice outlook, nice attitude.
00:01:29 But if you ever find yourself forgetting Jehovah’s estimation
00:01:33 of what we have within us, in our figurative heart,
00:01:37 then we’re in danger because the Devil will always exploit
00:01:42 the fact that our imperfect figurative hearts
00:01:45 are treacherous and deceitful
00:01:48 more than anything else and are desperate.
00:01:51 So accept that fact.
00:01:53 It’s not that we want to dwell on it, and you start feeling,
00:01:56 ‘Well, what a miserable person I am!’
00:01:59 Even though that is something the apostle Paul acknowledged,
00:02:02 it’s just accepting the fact.
00:02:04 And then we’re cautious about allowing
00:02:07 the treacherous heart to lead us astray.
00:02:10 Now, perhaps you haven’t thought about this in a while,
00:02:14 but notice what Jesus said
00:02:16 —a fundamental truth for all of us—
00:02:18 here in Matthew chapter 6
00:02:21 and what we sometimes refer to as the model prayer.
00:02:26 Matthew chapter 6
00:02:30 (and a lot of spiritual food for thought,
00:02:35 of course, anything Jesus said is spiritual food for thought)
00:02:40 and verse 13 of Matthew chapter 6:
00:02:45 “And do not bring us into temptation,
00:02:49 but deliver us from the wicked one.”
00:02:53 So it’s been there for all these years.
00:02:58 We could personally reflect on,
00:03:01 ‘When was the last time we mentioned that in a prayer to our Father, Jehovah:
00:03:06 ‘“Do not bring us into temptation
00:03:09 but deliver us from the wicked one,” or “rescue us from the wicked one”?’
00:03:13 What are we really saying there?
00:03:16 Well, we’re asking our heavenly Father to guide and help us
00:03:21 so that we’re not “overreached by Satan” —very simple.
00:03:26 But the closer we get to the end,
00:03:29 make no mistake, it’s even more urgent
00:03:33 to keep in mind the need to beg Jehovah not to bring us into temptation
00:03:38 and to guide us so that we’ll be delivered
00:03:41 from this wicked one who wants to exploit the fact that we have
00:03:46 a treacherous, traitorous figurative heart
00:03:50 that can ruin our relationship with Jehovah personally.
00:03:54 Now, the apostle Paul recognized this,
00:03:58 and it’s quite interesting what he wrote
00:04:00 to his beloved brothers in Thessalonians, that first letter.
00:04:05 So if you’d find 1 Thessalonians,
00:04:08 in chapter 3,
00:04:11 I found this quite revealing.
00:04:15 And tying in with the thought
00:04:18 of accepting the facts about how our figurative heart
00:04:20 safeguards our relationship with our God and Father, Jehovah,
00:04:25 at 1 Thessalonians 3:5,
00:04:30 Paul writes: “That is why, when I could bear it no longer,
00:04:34 “I sent to learn of your faithfulness,
00:04:37 “[now notice] in case somehow
00:04:40 “the Tempter might have tempted you,
00:04:43 and our labor might have turned out to be in vain.”
00:04:46 So he didn’t get into any specific detail.
00:04:50 But it helps us to appreciate that there’s this danger that somehow
00:04:55 the Tempter, Satan the Devil, might tempt us,
00:05:00 and this is connected with the need to beg
00:05:03 Jehovah to deliver us, or rescue us, from the wicked one
00:05:06 in his effort to tempt us to break our integrity
00:05:10 and have our cherished relationship with Jehovah be damaged.
00:05:15 So he knows the heart is treacherous.
00:05:18 And whoever we are and however long we’ve been in the truth,
00:05:23 remember what Paul wrote to the Thessalonians
00:05:26 —“somehow”— because he’s always looking
00:05:28 to somehow lead us
00:05:31 into breaking our integrity to Jehovah God.
00:05:33 Now, if you think of Revelation chapter 12
00:05:37 and where we are in this stream of time,
00:05:41 (this occurred to me when preparing these thoughts here)
00:05:45 Revelation chapter 12 has very familiar thoughts here.
00:05:49 The Devil is expelled from the heavens,
00:05:53 he and the demons, and notice
00:05:56 the familiar verse 12 of Revelation chapter 12:
00:05:59 ‘On this account be glad, you heavens
00:06:01 and [boy, they’re rejoicing] those that reside in them!’
00:06:05 And that’s an exclamation.
00:06:07 Notice, though: “Woe for the earth and for the sea,
00:06:12 “because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger,
00:06:17 knowing that he has a short period of time.”
00:06:20 Well, if that was true after he was ousted from the heavens,
00:06:24 what do you think about now?
00:06:27 So it’s sobering.
00:06:30 We want to safeguard our relationship with Jehovah
00:06:32 because notice verse 17 of the same chapter:
00:06:37 “So the dragon became enraged.”
00:06:40 Great anger—he’s enraged,
00:06:43 and he’s waging war with the remnant, as it brings out here.
00:06:47 And those that observe the commandments of God
00:06:49 —anyone supporting the remnant— this is a war.
00:06:53 And the war is that he’s out to somehow
00:06:56 cause us to break our integrity to our precious
00:07:01 heavenly Father, so this helps us to appreciate that,
00:07:04 even though it was long before
00:07:07 the thoughts here in Revelation and what Jesus taught us.
00:07:10 In Proverbs chapter 4, it still helps us:
00:07:14 “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart,
00:07:18 for out of it are the sources of life.”
00:07:22 So even back then, there was the recognition
00:07:26 that we have to safeguard our heart and accept the fact that our heart,
00:07:31 our figurative heart, is treacherous
00:07:33 —that’ll safeguard our precious relationship with Jehovah God.
00:07:38 Now, to help us with that, notice what Paul wrote
00:07:42 —very familiar verses in 2 Timothy chapter 3.
00:07:47 And we’ve used this in the ministry many times,
00:07:52 and yet think about it as it connects
00:07:54 with safeguarding our hearts
00:07:58 and accepting the fact that it’s treacherous
00:08:00 —that we won’t break our integrity
00:08:04 or allow the Devil to somehow cause us to break our integrity.
00:08:08 Second Timothy chapter 3 and you’ll notice what we’re emphasizing here.
00:08:13 The fact is in verse 16: “All Scripture is inspired of God.”
00:08:18 But notice the benefits.
00:08:20 So it’s “for teaching,” it’s “for reproving,” “setting things straight”
00:08:23 —see the point here, though?—
00:08:25 “for disciplining in righteousness.”
00:08:29 So you think of that maybe on your Bible study.
00:08:31 ‘I use the Bible to discipline my Bible study to get God’s thinking.’
00:08:36 And it’s appropriate that elders use the Scriptures to discipline.
00:08:41 However, we want to emphasize here for you
00:08:44 that when you’re doing your personal Bible reading (many of us),
00:08:49 let the Scriptures discipline that treacherous heart.
00:08:53 It’s a mirror.
00:08:55 When something hits you because maybe you’ve had wrong thinking
00:09:00 (could be all sorts of things, anything that could lead us astray
00:09:04 and cause us to break our integrity), just face the fact.
00:09:07 It’s just between you and Jehovah.
00:09:09 You’re reading it, and let it discipline you in righteousness.
00:09:14 And that’s what’s going to enable us to protect
00:09:18 our precious relationship with Jehovah God.
00:09:21 So we all have to face that fact, as we mentioned,
00:09:24 our figurative heart is treacherous; it’s a traitor.
00:09:28 What’s wonderful is we’re confident that Jehovah loves us.
00:09:32 So when he made that estimation in Jeremiah,
00:09:35 it’s motivated by his love.
00:09:38 So that helps us to protect our relationship with him
00:09:42 —facing that fact.
00:09:44 That’s the way it is.
00:09:46 So indeed, we accept the fact about our figurative heart,
00:09:49 but we’re determined to protect and safeguard
00:09:53 our precious relationship with Jehovah God.

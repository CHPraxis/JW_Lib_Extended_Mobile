00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:03.186 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The whole obligation

00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:05.622 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and privilege of mankind

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:08.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to develop a relationship

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:12.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with our God and Maker, Jehovah.

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:13.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:17.167 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How do we develop that relationship?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, How do we keep it?

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s start with,
How do we develop it?

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you open to Ecclesiastes 12:13,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the two components
mentioned in this verse

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:38.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ecclesiastes 12:13.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:41.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“The conclusion of the matter,

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everything having been heard, is:

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:48.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fear the true God
and keep his commandments,

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this is the whole obligation of man.”

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the obligation begins
with fearing the true God

00:00:57.774 --> 00:00:59.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then keeping
his commandments.

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does it mean to fear?

00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of fear are we talking about?

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Insight </i>book says this:

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of God is healthful;

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is an awe

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:14.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and a profound reverence for the Creator

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:17.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and a wholesome dread of displeasing him.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This fear of incurring his displeasure

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:24.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a result of appreciation

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of his loving-kindness and goodness

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“together with the realization
that he is the Supreme Judge

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:33.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Almighty.”

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:38.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how does one
come to have this awe of God?

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as the text says today
that we’ve already read,

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘we first hear about his fame

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and about all he has done.’

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s of interest
that just simply hearing

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowing what he does

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not necessarily lead to awe

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to the kind of awe

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:02.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us develop
a relationship with him.

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures explain this
if you go to Joshua chapter 9,

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:10.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we read
about a group of Canaanite kings.

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:14.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Joshua chapter 9

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in verse 1, it says:

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When all the kings
who were on the west side of the Jordan

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heard what had happened.”

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did they hear that had happened?

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the stories
of the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one thing they heard

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the mighty acts of Jehovah God
in connection with his people.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:42.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then when Israel
first penetrated Canaan

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:44.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after crossing the Jordan,

00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:46.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they set up a camp at Gilgal,

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was not far
from the walled city of Jericho.

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these Canaanite kings

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had heard about what
Jehovah did at Jericho

00:02:55.992 --> 00:03:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the great destruction there
in behalf of his people.

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:04.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, Rahab was spared,
and her family was spared,

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when she heard
about the mighty acts of Jehovah God,

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it moved her to put faith in him.

00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you just glance
through Joshua chapter 8,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find that following
that great destruction,

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went to Ai
—the city of Ai.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:27.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah God had instructed them
how to ambush that city,

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:29.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which led to the destruction there.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after hearing those acts of Jehovah
and then many other acts of Jehovah,

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did it do to the Canaanite kings?

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:39.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were they moved with awe?

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:42.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read chapter 9, verse 2.

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:45.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“They formed an alliance

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fight against Joshua and Israel.”

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it had the opposite effect
upon them, didn’t it?

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, notice the different reaction
it had upon the Gibeonites.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they heard the very same reports,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in chapter 9 and verse 9, it says:

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:07.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this they said to him:

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Your servants have come
from a very distant land

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘out of regard for the name
of Jehovah your God,

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because we have heard about his fame

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:20.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and about all he did in Egypt

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and about all he did
to the two kings of the Amorites.’”

00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:26.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this case,

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:30.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they heard it and it led to their awe,

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:34.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which led to their developing
a relationship with Jehovah God.

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:36.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today, the same thing is true

00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:39.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the mighty acts of Jehovah God

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are all around us.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those that are “rightly disposed”

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognize them
and are moved to this awe

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that leads to a good relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a number
of experiences in this regard

00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are related to the relief efforts
going on right now.

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to share one of them with you.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was in the middle of the night,
Monday, October 9, 2017,

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the wildfires began to engulf areas

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:10.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the city of Santa Rosa, California.

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:13.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders began to call, text,

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:17.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even personally alert
those in the congregation

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they needed to evacuate immediately.

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in time, hundreds of friends
made their way to the Kingdom Hall,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from there arrangements were made

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these displaced publishers to be housed

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their brothers and sisters

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in unaffected areas,
especially to the south.

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:41.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there was one Spanish family
that hesitated to accept the hospitality

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was being extended to them,
and they did not want to be relocated.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:49.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And upon the loving inquiries of the elders,

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:53.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was learned
that the father was a non-Witness

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:57.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he felt uncomfortable
staying in another Witness home.

00:05:57.707 --> 00:05:59.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was embarrassed
at the way he looked,

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way he was dressed,

00:06:01.844 --> 00:06:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how dirty he was
because of the circumstances.

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he requested to stay overnight
at the Kingdom Hall with his family.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, temporary beds
were set up at the Kingdom Hall.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the night, the circuit overseer

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:20.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had children
singing Kingdom songs on the platform

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which really encouraged all.

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next morning,

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after experiencing
the loving atmosphere in the Kingdom Hall

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing how well
Jehovah took care of this man’s family,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the other publishers,

00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:39.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the man stated
that he was going to call the brother back

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who studied with him many years ago

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would resume his Bible study

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would never ever miss a meeting again.

00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, those “rightly disposed”
become in awe of Jehovah God,

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:57.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that moves them
to have a good relationship with him.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
‘the whole obligation of man is to fear God.’

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question is,
Now that we have developed

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this relationship with Jehovah God,

00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:11.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do we keep it?

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:15.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for sure,
we must continue to be observant

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s mighty acts

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection not only with ourselves

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in connection with his people worldwide.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never should we allow
the wonderful experiences that we hear

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:34.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the outstanding World Service Report

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the support and comfort
that Jehovah God is giving those in need—

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:42.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become commonplace to us.

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:47.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must stay in awe of our God and Father.

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:52.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember the first scripture
we read in Ecclesiastes

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says that in addition
to fearing the true God,

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told to keep his commandments.

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would be good
to ask ourselves this question:

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:07.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What commandment of Jehovah God
do I have difficulty keeping?

00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is it a commandment
that involves my self-control,

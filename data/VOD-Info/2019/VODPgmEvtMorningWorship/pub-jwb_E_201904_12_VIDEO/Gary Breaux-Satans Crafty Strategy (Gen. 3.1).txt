00:00:00 This morning we’re talking
00:00:02 about the clever strategy of Satan,
00:00:06 designed to lure people away from Jehovah God.
00:00:10 And so we’re going to examine two approaches:
00:00:13 One he used
00:00:16 with the youngest intelligent creature in the universe,
00:00:22 and the other he used
00:00:24 on the oldest intelligent creature in the universe.
00:00:28 Let’s take the youngest first.
00:00:30 Of course, that was Eve.
00:00:32 So taking advantage of her inexperience,
00:00:35 his purpose was to trick this woman
00:00:38 and to seduce her.
00:00:41 Now, how would he do it?
00:00:43 Well, as we know, he was behind a serpent.
00:00:45 He didn’t want to show her who he really was
00:00:48 —what his aim really was.
00:00:51 His choice of words also reveal a lot.
00:00:53 And our text is Genesis chapter 3.
00:00:57 Let’s go there if you would.
00:00:59 I’d like to just read his question again,
00:01:04 Genesis 3:1:
00:01:07 “Did God really say
00:01:10 that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?”
00:01:14 Now, what was his motive in asking this question?
00:01:19 Well, as was stated by one of the commenters,
00:01:22 what he was trying to do
00:01:24 was to seed a doubt in her mind,
00:01:28 implying that Jehovah God was holding something back from her.
00:01:32 ‘He was too restrictive on you.’
00:01:36 Well, it’s interesting concerning questions.
00:01:39 The be book, Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education,
00:01:43 on page 66 says:
00:01:45 “Some questions are like icebergs.
00:01:49 “The most substantial part lies hidden beneath the surface.
00:01:53 An underlying issue is often more important than the question itself.”
00:01:59 And in the case of Eve,
00:02:02 when the question was asked,
00:02:04 she didn’t see the underlying purpose of the question.
00:02:09 Her answer in verses 2 and 3 indicate this.
00:02:14 She said: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
00:02:18 “But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden:
00:02:22 ‘You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it; otherwise you will die.’”
00:02:28 Her answer was truthful,
00:02:30 and it was an honest, innocent answer.
00:02:34 But Satan had her exactly where he wanted her.
00:02:39 You see, he was banking
00:02:43 on her self-interest,
00:02:46 that she would be more interested in herself
00:02:49 —her own needs—
00:02:51 than the love she had
00:02:54 for the God that gave her everything that she had.
00:02:57 Read his words again in verses 4 and 5.
00:03:01 Satan said:  “You certainly will not die.
00:03:04 “For God knows that in the very day you eat from it,
00:03:06 “your eyes will be opened and you will be like God,
00:03:09 knowing good and bad.”
00:03:12 Tragically, his gamble worked.
00:03:16 She had not cultivated
00:03:18 the kind of love and appreciation for Jehovah God
00:03:23 that she should have.
00:03:25 So, what can we learn from this example?
00:03:28 Well, if a perfect human can succumb
00:03:31 to this kind of reasoning —irrational reasoning, really—
00:03:35 it can happen to any one of us.
00:03:37 Jehovah God created us as free moral agents.
00:03:40 That’s the way he made Eve.
00:03:42 He doesn’t want robots.
00:03:44 He wants us to be able to think things through,
00:03:47 make the right choices,
00:03:49 decide between right and wrong.
00:03:52 Satan is counting on us to make the wrong choices.
00:03:57 Now, what can we do to counter that attack from Satan?
00:04:02 Well, we have to know what is in our hearts.
00:04:07 If you go to Hebrews 12:15, 16,
00:04:11 the apostle Paul gives a warning to his fellow Christians
00:04:16 against becoming people who do not appreciate sacred things.
00:04:21 And that’s sort of the context
00:04:23 of verses 15 and 16.
00:04:27 He says: “Carefully watch that no one
00:04:30 “fails to obtain the undeserved kindness of God,
00:04:33 “so that no poisonous root springs up
00:04:36 “to cause trouble and many are defiled by it;
00:04:39 “and watch that among you there is no one who is sexually immoral
00:04:44 nor anyone who does not appreciate sacred things.”
00:04:49 So there is a need, as he said here in verse 15,
00:04:53 to: “Carefully watch.”
00:04:55 ‘Carefully watch that no poisonous root will spring up and contaminate the congregation.’
00:05:00 The expression “poisonous root” refers to a few that may be in a congregation
00:05:05 who may find fault with the way things are done,
00:05:08 maybe even find fault
00:05:10 with the direction Jehovah has given on matters
00:05:15 —maybe the sacredness of marriage or the need for moral cleanness.
00:05:20 So we don’t want to be those kind of people —obviously.
00:05:24 But tell me, what’s necessary before a root can appear?
00:05:29 Well, a seed has to be planted,
00:05:33 and then it germinates, and then it grows into a root.
00:05:36 So it’s at the seed level
00:05:39 that we have to give special attention.
00:05:42 We have to learn to identify
00:05:44 these improper seeds, as it were.
00:05:47 No one can do that for us because they can’t read our heart.
00:05:51 The seed may even—
00:05:53 We’ve never even voiced what the seed is,
00:05:56 but it could be in our thinking and in our heart.
00:05:58 And these internal weaknesses have to be addressed
00:06:03 for fear we find ourselves in a circumstance
00:06:08 maneuvered by Satan
00:06:11 to accentuate that particular weakness.
00:06:16 Now, James 1:14, 15 really describes the process well.
00:06:21 James 1:14, 15, where he says:
00:06:26 “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed
00:06:29 “by his own desire [own desire].
00:06:36 “Then the desire [the seed],
00:06:39 “when it has become fertile [starts to grow],
00:06:42 “gives birth to sin; in turn sin,
00:06:45 when it has been carried out, brings forth death.”
00:06:48 So, being “enticed by his own desire.”
00:06:52 Does that sound familiar?
00:06:53 It’s a powerful force.
00:06:55 It’s one that happened to Eve,
00:06:59 the self-interests —they’re similar.
00:07:02 So, what do we need to do?
00:07:04 Well, as we said earlier, identify the seed or seeds
00:07:09 if that may be the case.
00:07:11 Don’t let them germinate; don’t let them start to grow.
00:07:15 Rid ourselves of that thinking.
00:07:17 And if a “poisonous root”
00:07:19 may happen to be in us
00:07:21 or starting to grow, then we need to rip it out.
00:07:24 And you may need to have help to do it.
00:07:26 It may be impossible to remove a “poisonous root” by yourself.
00:07:32 Now, let’s spend a few moments on the approach Satan used
00:07:35 for the oldest intelligent creature in the universe,
00:07:39 of course, Christ Jesus.
00:07:41 Now, in this case, he didn’t try to hide himself.
00:07:44 He realized there was no need to do that.
00:07:46 Jesus knew exactly who he was.
00:07:48 He understood the motive.
00:07:51 And so he just went overtly right to Jesus.
00:07:55 And as you know, in the account of Matthew 4,
00:07:58 he said, ‘Look, just fall down and do an act of worship to me.’
00:08:04 Now, what does this tell us about Satan?
00:08:08 Well, he has long been driven by jealousy
00:08:12 over the worship that goes to Jehovah God.
00:08:15 And he’s going to go to any length possible
00:08:19 to try to violate our worship to Jehovah God.
00:08:23 He wants to pervert our worship to Jehovah God.
00:08:29 And so if he has enough boldness
00:08:33 to approach Jesus Christ,
00:08:37 then we know he will approach any one of us.
00:08:40 And it makes no difference how spiritually strong we look on the outside;
00:08:45 he will try to break our integrity.
00:08:47 Clearly, the Bible reveals that Satan
00:08:50 is a deadly strategist in seeking his aims.
00:08:55 Happily, though, we don’t have to be like Eve,
00:08:57 because we know the designs of Satan the Devil.
00:09:01 May each of us cultivate the kind of love Jesus had for Jehovah God,
00:09:06 so we too can stand firm in our integrity.

“He will crush your head.”

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:07.390 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That was Jehovah speaking to the serpent

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.392 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—really, to Satan.

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:12.495 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And God-fearing people who have understood

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.798 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the prophecy of Genesis 3:15

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:16.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have been hanging on to those words

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a long time

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we long to see
the complete elimination of Satan

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his influence from our lives.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we fully imagine what life will be like

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once Satan and the demons
are out of the picture?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much influence do they have on us

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our thinking right now?

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you open <i>Watchtower Library </i>

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:43.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go to the
<i>Watchtower Publications Index 1986-2016</i><i> </i>

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:45.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the subject “Satan,”

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will find a subheading entitled

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“methods of operation on humans.”

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It lists 56 devices that he uses

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trip us up mentally, emotionally,

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
morally, and spiritually.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely you see things in the list
that you have had to contend with

00:01:03.913 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or are contending with even now:

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:09.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discouragement,
entertainment, family opposition,

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intimidation, personal differences,

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ridicule, temptations.

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:16.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each of these,
the <i>Index </i> provides

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
references to our publications
where we can find helpful encouragement

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Scriptural principles
to deal with whatever is threatening us.

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:31.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s talk about two
of Satan’s methods that were on the list,

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with one
that was near the top of the list:

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:38.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
convincing people
of being unloved or worthless.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil would have us believe

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from God’s standpoint
we are unlovable and unforgivable.

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:47.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to worry about our past mistakes,

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:49.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become overly self-critical,

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:52.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and underestimate
Jehovah’s compassion and forgiveness.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Satan is just taking
the spotlight off of himself

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is the one
who is unlovable in God’s eyes

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:01.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who is really unforgivable.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:06.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how do we combat
this method of Satan’s to dishearten us?

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one thing is that we can remember:

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is impossible for God to lie.”

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:14.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take to heart
what Jehovah has written truthfully

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible about his love for us.

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:19.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
please turn to Romans chapter 8,

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:22.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep your Bibles open there, if you will.

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Romans chapter 8.

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 33 and 34:

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:33.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will file accusation
against God’s chosen ones?

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:36.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is the One who declares them righteous.

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will condemn them?

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ Jesus is the one who died,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, more than that,
the one who was raised up,

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is at the right hand of God
and who also pleads for us.”

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those words were addressed
to spirit-anointed Christians,

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:54.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, in principle,
they also apply to those of the other sheep

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are declared righteous as God’s friends.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do Satan’s false accusations
really matter?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah
who declares true Christians righteous

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on their faith
in the sacrifice of Christ.

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, why would Jehovah
stop loving his worshippers

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after he has given them
the most precious gift he possibly could

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his own beloved son
who even now “pleads for us” with God?

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s keep reading in Romans chapter 8,

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:28.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continuing with verses 38 and 39:

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am convinced
that neither death nor life nor angels

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor governments nor things now here

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor things to come nor powers

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor height nor depth nor any other creation

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:43.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one, including Satan,
can successfully challenge

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s favorable judgment
of his devoted servants.

00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:55.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a second thing we can do

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:58.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to combat this method
of the Devil’s to dishearten us

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:01.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to remember
that Satan is a malicious liar.

00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:03.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth is not in him,

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we have to reject his lying accusations.

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A reference listed in the <i>Index </i>

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:11.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells of how a traveling overseer
addresses this issue.

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:15.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asks downhearted ones,
“Do you believe in the Trinity?”

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:18.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the discouraged one would say,
“Of course not,”

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
realizing that’s one of Satan’s lies.

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:23.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the brother would ask,
“Do you believe in hellfire?”

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again comes the answer,
“Of course not.”

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brother tells them
that there is another satanic lie

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s usually not recognized as such

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:34.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the lie that Jehovah
does not love us as individuals.

00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that approach often gets positive results

00:04:37.126 --> 00:04:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping the person
to recognize and reject Satan’s lie

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are unloved
or worthless in God’s eyes.

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to take Jehovah at his word.

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one who tells the truth,

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:53.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to believe
that he loves us individually.

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another method
that was in that list in the <i>Inde</i><i>x </i>

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan uses
to deceive people is propaganda.

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is false, biased,
or deceptive information

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:06.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used to manipulate the way we think.

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first reference
shown in the <i>Index </i> for propaganda

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an article in <i>The Watchtower</i><i> </i>
that we are currently studying

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an article entitled
“Winning the Battle for Your Mind.”

00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it begins:
“You are under attack!

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And your chief enemy, Satan,
is using a very dangerous weapon against you.

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What is it?

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Propaganda!

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A weapon specially designed to attack,
not your body, but <i>your mind.” </i>

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:33.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan can use any part
of his wicked system of things

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to disseminate his lies.

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:38.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his objective
is to weaken our faith and morals,

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:40.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stir up contentions between us,

00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:44.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to undermine our confidence
in the leadership that God is providing us.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we resist?

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:50.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article says:
“Jesus gave this simple rule

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for combating propaganda:

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:56.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Know the truth,
and the truth will set you free.’”

00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible,
we can find all we need

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to combat Satan’s propaganda,

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided we’re diligent
in “carefully examining the Scriptures daily”

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we use our God-given abilities

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and power of reason
to make the truth our own.

00:06:10.053 --> 00:06:13.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second thing we can do
to combat this method of the Devil’s

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to keep in mind
that Satan does not want us

00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:19.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think clearly or reason things out well.

00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:22.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never be content passively

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:26.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to blindly accept
what you hear from politicians,

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the news media, the Internet,

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:31.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Satan is the master of fake news.

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the article concludes:

00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you ever watched a film in which,

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from your vantage point in the audience,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you can clearly see that someone
is being deceived and manipulated?

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:43.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you find yourself thinking:

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not believe it! They are lying to you!’

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imagine, then, the angels
shouting the same message to you:

00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be fooled by Satan’s lies!’

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:54.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shut your ears, then, to Satan’s propaganda.

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him.”

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, all satanic influence
will be gone when Satan is bound

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hurled into the abyss
for a thousand years.

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:05.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a relief it will be

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live in a world totally free
from his wicked influence.

But then he’ll be released from the abyss

00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a short while for a final test.

00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What method will he use then to deceive us

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of the 56 devices
we saw earlier in the list

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some new diabolical trick
that he has thought of?

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know.

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do know
that if we remember that he is the liar

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah is the truth-teller,

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should fare just fine.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to Paul’s letter to the Romans,

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:41.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he echoes the first Bible prophecy

00:07:41.777 --> 00:07:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 16:20

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 16:20:

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For his part, the God who gives peace

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:57.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will crush Satan under your feet shortly.”

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than being merely abyssed,

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will actually
be completely annihilated.

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Revelation Climax </i> book says:

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is more than a superficial bruising.

00:08:08.204 --> 00:08:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . Paul here used a Greek word,

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . that means
to bruise into a jellylike state,

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:18.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trample down,
to destroy utterly by crushing.”

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:20.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the <i>“God’s Love” </i> book says:

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With Satan . . . out of the way,

00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will feel relief
that may be hard to fathom now.”

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:30.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile,
whenever wrong or negative thoughts

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:32.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
creep into our mind,

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to reject Satan’s lies

00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus our mind
on the truths that Jehovah has taught us.

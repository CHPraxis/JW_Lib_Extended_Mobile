00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:02.585 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt

00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:05.021 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was the Great Teacher,

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.457 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and there were many reasons for that.

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:08.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But one of them is

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:10.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he really understood

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:13.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the people that he was dealing with.

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:16.666 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He knew what was really inside.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he had God-given ability
to actually read hearts.

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he also had abilities
that he got from his Father as well

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:30.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as insight, discernment,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understanding, wisdom.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of this combined
to make him an outstanding teacher.

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, obviously, we can’t read hearts,

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can imitate Jesus

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:44.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in developing the qualities
that will help us

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:47.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the most effective
in helping others.

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, insight:

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you define it?

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the ability to see into a situation,

00:00:56.372 --> 00:01:00.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to act with discretion, to be successful.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means
not just looking at the obvious

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:05.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but going deeper.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s related to understanding.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understanding is the ability

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distinguish different components

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a subject or a situation,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but insight goes further.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an intelligent knowledge
of the reason.

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
it answers the question, Why?

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is this happening?

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:32.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or why would I say
what I’m about to say

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s the best thing to say?

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also related to discernment

00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s being keen in judgment,

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:43.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perceiving differences,

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being able to see
what appears to be one way

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but may not be that way at all.

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it helps to identify the true needs

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a person or the real problem.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate how the use
of these qualities can be very helpful,

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suppose someone in the congregation
comes to you and says:

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m really having a problem
controlling my temper.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m getting angry.”

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:11.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, right away
we may think (and rightfully so),

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:14.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I have a number of scriptures
that I can share with you

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:19.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about controlling anger,
controlling the tongue,

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not letting any bad thing
come out of our mouth.’

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:24.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are excellent.

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:26.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the teacher
or the helpful counselor

00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will do the best good
would want to do what?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d want to ask the question, Why?

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you getting angry?

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you pinpoint it?

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you feeling well?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you not gotten enough rest?

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a catalyst at work, at school,

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation, at home?

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after determining why,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most effective scriptures

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:58.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the most encouragement can be given.

00:02:58.294 --> 00:03:00.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And where do we get these qualities

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:03.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of insight, discernment,
and understanding?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they come
from Jehovah, don’t they?

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 32:8 says:

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will give you insight
and instruct you

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way you should go.”

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he does that through his Word

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also through his organization.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 3:15 says:

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will give you shepherds
after my own heart,

00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will feed you
with knowledge and insight.”

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re blessed
to have Jehovah’s Word

00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist us to gain these qualities.

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:39.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how will it help us?

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles, please, to Psalm 119,

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:45.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together verse 99.

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 119:99:

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have more insight
than all my teachers,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I ponder over your reminders.”

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the psalmist did not say,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I can quote more scriptures
than anybody else,

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:08.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I can answer
all the difficult Bible questions—no problem.’

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, in this context he says:
“I have more insight.”

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:16.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah has given me the ability

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to see beyond the obvious in myself

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:24.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also in my ability
to help someone else.’

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:27.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we learn to display this?

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we go back
to our exemplar Jesus,

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we start
with his approach to people

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:37.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—warm, kind, affectionate,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compassionate, empathetic.

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:43.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when a person
conveys that spirit

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those that he is trying to help,

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:50.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they feel comfortable
and they are more likely

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal what may be in their heart.

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that fine approach,

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:58.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was able to put himself

00:04:58.982 --> 00:05:03.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into others’ situations
—to have empathy and compassion—

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example, with Martha and Mary

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the time of Lazarus’ death.

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can appreciate, can’t we,
that that is a critical element

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being insightful,
making others feel comfortable?

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, what else can we do

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:22.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out what’s really
in a person’s heart?

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t read it.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles
to the book of Proverbs chapter 20.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs chapter 20,
and let’s look at verse 5:

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:37.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The thoughts
of a man’s heart are like deep waters,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the discerning man draws them out.”

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:45.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how does he do that?

00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By questions.

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He seeks knowledge;

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gathers facts

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in line with Proverbs 15:14,

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it talks about the wise one,

00:05:57.573 --> 00:06:01.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the understanding one,
“seeks knowledge.”

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he doesn’t answer
before he has all the facts.

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he uses tactful
and respectful questions,

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he doesn’t probe

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point
of embarrassment unnecessarily.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:20.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he realizes
that point-blank questions, blunt questions,

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:22.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may give him an answer

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they can be very harmful

00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:27.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially if they insinuate

00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:30.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a suspicion of wrongdoing

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without any warranting of that.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such questions
may cause deep wounds

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as described at Proverbs 12:18:

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thoughtless speech
is like the stabs of a sword.”

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So ask respectful, gentle,
meaningful questions,

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:50.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then listen.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Be swift about listening,

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:55.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
slow about speaking,’
according to James,

00:06:55.064 --> 00:06:58.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not overreacting
to what they may say.

00:06:58.568 --> 00:07:00.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have, in effect, asked them:

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Please tell us,
how do you feel about this?

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, what’s happening?’

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they tell us,

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can’t get mad at them,
because we asked them.

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s a time to be quiet.

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:17.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask a meaningful, tactful question

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:20.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ecclesiastes 3:7 applies:

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:23.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A time to be silent
and a time to speak.”

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, not talking too much
helps us in another way

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:31.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Proverbs 10:19 says:

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When words are many,
transgression cannot be avoided,

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but whoever controls
his lips acts discreetly.”

00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s this matter
of being cautious

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:46.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with how much we talk,
especially before we have all the facts.

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want the complete picture
(with thoughtful questions),

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we will be able to assist.

00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they say something,

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:57.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to be careful
that we don’t overreact.

00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s insightful,

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:02.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it shows discernment
not to overreact.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:04.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an illustration of that:

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:06.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Christian couple noticed

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:09.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their daughter
was withdrawing

00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:12.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from family association.

00:08:12.308 --> 00:08:16.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would isolate herself
and want to be by herself.

00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:20.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they gently questioned her,
trying to find out what was happening.

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:22.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would never open up.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They kept it up—kindly, patiently.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one day, the mother
went into the daughter’s bedroom,

00:08:29.992 --> 00:08:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sat down,
put her arm around her daughter,

00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said,
“Honey, tell me, what’s happening?”

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she said:

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, Mom, I don’t feel like you

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:44.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the rest of the family
like my company.

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m staying away as much as possible.”

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now the mother’s first reaction
as she reported,

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mother said:
“I wanted to say,

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That is absolutely ridiculous!’

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I held it in,” she said,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I listened,
and she poured out her heart.”

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She got better.

00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family
made some adjustments and, in time,

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:14.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this fine young woman
went into the full-time service.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s think back.

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if the mother
had not used discernment and insight

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when her daughter told her
what the problem was

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she did say, “That’s ridiculous?”

00:09:25.047 --> 00:09:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that have done
to the daughter?

00:09:28.384 --> 00:09:31.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, now you think I’m stupid,

00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:33.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and I’m ridiculous.

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:36.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, that really helps a lot.
Thank you very much.

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:39.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel even more willing
to be with you folks now.’

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it could have happened
that way, perhaps.

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:47.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does show the value
of listening and not overreacting

00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:49.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get really what’s in a person’s heart.

00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they tell us,
we respond accordingly.

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:55.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in imitation of Christ,

00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to know what’s inside people
so that we can help them the most.

00:09:58.948 --> 00:10:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do that by relying on the insight

00:10:01.884 --> 00:10:04.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discernment that Jehovah gives us

00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by being compassionate
and caring and kind

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probing gently
to find out what the real problem is

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can use
the most effective scriptures

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:16.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them for that particular problem.

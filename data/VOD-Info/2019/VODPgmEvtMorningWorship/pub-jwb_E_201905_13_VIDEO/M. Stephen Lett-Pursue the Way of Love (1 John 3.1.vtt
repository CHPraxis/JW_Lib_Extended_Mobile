Today’s scripture text and Watchtower comments

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
encourage us to exert ourselves

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to show love to others,

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:11.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
especially our brothers.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.064 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So let’s discuss the theme

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:17.534 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Pursue the Way of Love.”

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And interestingly, that expression,

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pursue love,” is found three times in the Bible.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verb “pursue” is very appropriate.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it means to chase,

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:32.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to persistently follow in an effort

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overtake or capture.

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we could illustrate with

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a small child chasing a butterfly

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.493 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—pursuing it, chasing,

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:48.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
pursuing in an effort to overtake or capture.

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:50.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is the butterfly trying to do?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.504 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Get away, escape, evade.

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:58.475 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
If we think about it, that’s what love tries to do to us.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, why?

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question is,
Why does love try to get away from us,

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:06.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus requiring that we pursue it?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the main reason

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of the imperfection that we’ve inherited.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:15.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 1:27 tells us

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that originally Adam was made

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s image,

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perfectly reflecting Jehovah and his qualities.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did that just perfectly.

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then when he sinned,

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:30.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imperfection entered.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we could say that Adam became

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:36.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a distorted reflection of Jehovah and his qualities.

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:37.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can illustrate this

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a distorted mirror,

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps at the fair or circus.

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can make you look a lot taller,

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot shorter, a lot fatter,

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:52.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot thinner than you really are

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:54.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and distort you in other ways.

00:01:54.798 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in effect, Adam became a distorted reflection

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah and his qualities,

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve inherited that condition.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are distorted reflections

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah and his qualities,

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we have to pursue love.

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let me ask this,

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that Jehovah is pursuing the way of love?

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that could be a trick question.

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is Jehovah chasing, trying to catch love?

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:26.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:30.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 4:8: “God is love.”

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just naturally displays it, see.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t have to work at it.

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He, you can say, radiates it.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It emanates from Jehovah God.

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with us it’s different, see.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our imperfection,

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love is not our natural inclination;

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to pursue it.

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is, How do we do it?

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:55.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the entire Bible tells us how to pursue love,

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:59.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but specifically the five verses

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 13:4-8

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell us how to pursue love.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there we have 16 expressions of love:

00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nine ways that love does not behave

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seven ways that it does behave.

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:20.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we closely examine
those 16 expressions of love,

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have direction in our pursuit of love.

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t wander aimlessly;

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we won’t travel erroneously.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as time permits,

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s discuss some of the ways that love

00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:37.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not act and ways it doesn’t behave.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One: “Love is not jealous.”

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the Bible, jealousy can have
a good connotation or a bad connotation.

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the good connotation,
it’s closely related to zealous.

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course,
here Jehovah is using it in the bad sense,

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:58.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by far the majority of times
in the Bible that’s the way the word is  used.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:00.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does it mean?

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it means envious

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:06.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of good things coming to others.

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be worse than anger.

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anger can come and pass quickly,

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but jealousy can be harbored deep.

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Proverbs 14:30

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:23.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talks about it being deep down in the bones.

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we avoid jealousy

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:30.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pursue love even though it’s not easy?

00:04:30.586 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to prayerfully, with Jehovah’s help,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do what is mentioned in Romans chapter 12.

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:38.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there.

00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:40.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Romans chapter 12,

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:42.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s what Jehovah tells us to do,

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse number 15:

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice with those who rejoice;

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weep with those who weep.”

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:54.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about it.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which of the two is the hardest?

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, generally, it’s not so hard
to weep with someone who is weeping.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They found out they have cancer;
they lose a loved one in death.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be very sorry with them.

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:07.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, often it’s harder

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice with someone who rejoices.

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may receive some good thing

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something good has happened to them,

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it didn’t happen to us.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s just one little illustration:

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say an elder is so happy that he received

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an assignment for the regional convention.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’ve always wanted to get an assignment,

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we didn’t get an assignment.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we going to rejoice

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brother who is rejoicing

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:36.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just on the outside,

00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outwardly appearing that we’re happy for him—

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inside we have jealousy?

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly in our heart being happy,

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoicing with our brother who is rejoicing

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—with Jehovah’s help—
we can do that.

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:51.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can work on our attitude.

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:54.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it, about the only emotion

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:59.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is stronger than jealousy is love.

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:03.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With love we can smash jealousy.

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:06.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another expression of love:
Love “does not brag.”

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re pursuing the way of love,

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will prayerfully work hard

00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:15.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to elevate ourselves in our speech.

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:19.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll strive not to so often use the pronouns

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I” and “me,”

00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:24.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus directing attention to ourselves.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we’ll play our role down.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll direct attention to others

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially to our God, Jehovah.

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another expression of love:

00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:37.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love “does not get puffed up.”

00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:40.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, puffed up is closely related to bragging

00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:44.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because normally a person
who is puffed up brags, doesn’t he?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you think it would be possible
to be puffed up and not brag?

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:49.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could actually have this attitude, 
thinking too much of ourselves

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we didn’t make
an outward expression of that attitude.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why would that be unloving

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were puffed up but we didn’t brag?

00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, others would sense it

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:08.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—see, that attitude would come across.

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would project and, in effect,

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would put others down rather than build them up.

00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:18.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most important,
Jehovah would read that attitude in our heart,

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wouldn’t bless us.

00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:23.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s what he
tells us to do regarding our thinking.

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12 again,

00:07:25.394 --> 00:07:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this time take a look at verse 3,

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right in the middle there Jehovah says:

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:34.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I tell everyone there among you

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:38.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not to think more of himself

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than it is necessary to think.”

00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you notice, Jehovah is saying that we

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shouldn’t even think that way about ourselves.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should have a humble attitude.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another expression of love:

00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:55.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love “does not behave indecently.”

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are varying degrees of indecency

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—shocking indecency, immorality.

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the other end of the spectrum,

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps a lack of good manners.

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:09.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t even
want to be slightly indecent, do we?

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially as Bethelites,
we want to have good manners

00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by generously using the expressions

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thank you” and “please,”

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by holding the door for others,

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by allowing them

00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:29.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have their preferences

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the first place, and so forth.

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pass them in the hall,

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
warmly greeting our brothers

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:40.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not being
more interested in our electronic device

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than we are that brother that we’re passing.

00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:44.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, show good manners

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we interact with our brothers.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another expression of love:
Love “does not become provoked.”

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s one example, just quickly.

00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:56.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say we’re driving our car;

00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:59.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re parked at a red light;

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the light turns green,

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and immediately
the person behind us blows the horn,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicating we should move on quicker.

00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:09.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, does that get to us?

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we start off very slow?

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:16.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to make them pay for that.

00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:18.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re getting provoked.

00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, love does not get provoked.

00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One more example:
Love “does not keep account of the injury.”

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:30.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean
we have to totally blot out of our mind

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:32.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any recollection of the injury?

00:09:32.088 --> 00:09:33.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:09:33.256 --> 00:09:37.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the scripture says,
we don’t “keep account of the injury,”

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would indicate maintaining a ledger

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a debt being owed.

00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we may remember the injury,

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have forgiven in our heart.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have cancelled the debt.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there we have six expressions of love.

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m going to assign you the other ten

00:09:56.712 --> 00:10:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do the research
there in those verses that we were talking about.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But from our discussion,
it’s obvious that we have to pursue love.

00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:06.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t come easy;

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:08.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t come effortlessly

00:10:08.224 --> 00:10:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—none of these expressions.

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like that butterfly we talked about  in the beginning

00:10:13.296 --> 00:10:15.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to get away from the child,

00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love tries to get away from us.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help, we can pursue it.

00:10:20.436 --> 00:10:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to have to keep doing this.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long?

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:27.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, until the marvelous time

00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re perfect,

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:33.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we’ll no longer have to pursue love.

00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:35.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jehovah and Jesus,

00:10:35.918 --> 00:10:39.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will simply be able to display love.

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:41.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until that marvelous time,

00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may 1 Corinthians 13:4-8

00:10:45.328 --> 00:10:49.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give direction to our pursuit of love.

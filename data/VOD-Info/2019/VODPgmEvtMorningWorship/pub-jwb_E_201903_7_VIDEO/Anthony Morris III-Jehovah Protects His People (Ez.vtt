Now, The Watchtower

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from where the comments are taken

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:07.457 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had the theme

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:10.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Your Deliverance Is Getting Near.”

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.130 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was a sobering and yet

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very encouraging 
Watchtower study article,

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that theme 
was taken from Luke chapter 21.

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’d like to find that
—Luke 21—

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the context prior to verse 28,

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know verse 26: 
“People will become faint out of fear

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:36.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and expectation of the things

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming upon the inhabited earth.”

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it mentions “the heavens . . . shaken,”

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:45.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, “see the Son of man.”

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s where 
we find the theme, verse 28:

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:52.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as these things start to occur,

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stand up straight and lift up your heads,

00:00:56.906 --> 00:01:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because your deliverance is getting near.”

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:06.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we know, 
this is fulfilled during the great tribulation.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:09.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something to keep in mind,

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:14.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at that time 
when these events take place,

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll be able to stand up

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look forward to their deliverance.

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for a moment, just reflect back

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:26.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Hezekiah video

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:28.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we enjoyed

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the convention season last year.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing!

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:36.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful job 
the brothers did in Audio/Video

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicting one angel

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that destroyed 185,000 men.

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was spectacular!

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:52.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, find Revelation chapter 17

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:56.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Revelation chapter 17—

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is what

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is foretold for the near future.

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The context here at Revelation 17,

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:07.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where verse 12 mentions “the ten horns,”

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:10.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then down into verse 13

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after this “one hour with the wild beast”
(the United Nations)—

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they give their “authority to the wild beast.”

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:21.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans in general 
would find that hard to believe

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they look 
at what’s going on in the world today.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s what they’re going to do,

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 14:

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These will battle with the Lamb,

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but because he is Lord of lords 
and King of kings,

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Lamb will conquer them.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, those with him

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are called and chosen 
and faithful will do so.”

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as good as our brothers are in Audio/Video,

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally doubt that anyone

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could do a videography 
and capture this event.

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re talking about Christ Jesus,

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 144,000

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:10.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anointed immortal spirit creatures,

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Jesus has the holy angels

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are under his direction as King.

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is going to be spectacular!

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:20.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, all things are possible with God,

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:25.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I think they’d have to have Him 
to be able to show a video

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:28.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to capture what’s coming in the future.

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:30.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just spectacular!

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:34.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just keep in mind 
(and The Watchtower made this clear),

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t know the sure 
and exact sequence of events

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the time order—
some of it (as The Watchtower says)

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:44.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will likely overlap.

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, what we do know

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah has been kind about this—

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what’s going to take place

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start the great tribulation.

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:58.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we find here in verse 15,

00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read 
through verse 17 of Revelation 17:

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to me: ‘The waters that you saw,

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘where the prostitute is sitting,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And the ten horns 
that you saw and the wild beast,

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘these will hate the prostitute

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and will make her devastated and naked,

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:21.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will eat up her flesh

00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and completely burn her with fire.’”

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:27.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the fact

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:31.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verification for why this will happen,

00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 17: “For God put it into their hearts

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to carry out his thought,

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, to carry out their one thought

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the words of God will have been accomplished.”

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:48.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s as good as done.

00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:50.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what’s going to happen

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of how people view us

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we preach this good news.

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:58.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is good news
—the destruction

00:04:58.448 --> 00:05:01.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the world empire of false religion,

00:05:01.184 --> 00:05:03.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beginning of the great tribulation.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is spectacular news 
for God’s people,

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and until it takes place, 
they won’t believe it.

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it will happen because 
Jehovah says it’s going to happen.

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’ll be a time for us 
to prove our love for Jehovah God.

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be the only group protected by him.

00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:25.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was profound, too,

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this article in The Watchtower made this—

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was 
a profound statement when you think

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the organization we’re a part of.

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:37.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said in paragraph 9:

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This will not be the time to preach

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ‘good news of the Kingdom.’”

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, we’re a preaching organization.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s a time 
we’ll not preach the good news?

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember one of our favorite verses?

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s etched on the minds 
and hearts of God’s people:

00:05:57.874 --> 00:06:00.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this good news 
of the Kingdom will be preached

00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all the inhabited earth 
for a witness to all the nations.”

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, don’t forget the last part:

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And then the end will come.”

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during the great tribulation
—no good news.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we do know there’ll be preaching.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you think we’re unpopular now?

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, my!

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Revelation chapter 16,

00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the context 
Armageddon is being addressed,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice verse 21:

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:40.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then great hailstones, 
each about the weight of a talent,

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“fell from heaven on the people,

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:45.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the people blasphemed God

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the plague of [the] hail,

00:06:47.857 --> 00:06:50.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the plague was unusually great.”

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the message and the preaching

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to be like “hailstones.”

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know if you’ve 
ever been in a hailstorm,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this is a huge hailstorm

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being depicted here.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s likely, possibly, a hard-hitting message

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe a declaration 
announcing that Satan’s world

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is about to come to a complete end.

00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:22.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just stay tuned.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:24.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t feel bad—I know.

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was out in the ministry

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one territory recently,

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s good to suffer reproach.

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all need that, like Jesus did.

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:38.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The door-to-door ministry 
is good for us.

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, if you think 
we’re suffering reproach now—

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, get ready!

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just training for this future declaration

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll have the privilege to share in.

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep in mind

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is this event that The Watchtower

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did mention in Matthew chapter 24.

00:07:57.793 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’ll find that,

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s nice to have this clear.

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 24,

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 31:

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:15.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will send out his angels

00:08:15.978 --> 00:08:17.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with a great trumpet sound,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will gather 
his chosen ones together

00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the four winds,

00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:27.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one extremity of the heavens 
to their other extremity.”

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what The Watchtower stated there was

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s not the initial gathering

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the anointed nor the final sealing;

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is when the remnant
—the remaining ones—

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive their heavenly reward 
during the great tribulation.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:44.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this event takes place at some point

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the beginning of the attack by Gog.

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at that time,

00:08:50.413 --> 00:08:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s when Matthew 13:43 is fulfilled:

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous ones 
will shine as brightly as the sun

00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:00.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kingdom of their Father.”

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we mentioned
—sobering, yes, but encouraging.

00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:07.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes, so encouraging.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, let’s be confident;

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s trust in Jehovah.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no need to be afraid.

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s keep up our spiritual routine

00:09:18.608 --> 00:09:20.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prove ourselves ready,

00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:25.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the great tribulation is near.

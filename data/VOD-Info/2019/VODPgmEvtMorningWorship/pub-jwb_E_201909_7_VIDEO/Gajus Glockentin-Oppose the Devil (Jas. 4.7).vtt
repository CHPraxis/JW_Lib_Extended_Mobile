James 4:7:

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:06.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you”

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.291 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is indeed powerful encouragement.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.293 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
By these reassuring words,

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah reminds us of the potential we have.

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:16.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say so?

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah
would never expect us to do something

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is beyond our abilities.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even if we ourselves
in certain situations might feel

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not have the strength anymore,

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know Jehovah will empower us.

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:34.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:38.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when was the last time
that you opposed the Devil?

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all understand
the general concept of James 4:7,

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet it might be a challenge

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:50.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get specific when it comes
to applying it on a personal level.

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not having conversations
directly with the Devil

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus did 
when he was tempted three times.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that the Devil

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might not cause all of our problems,

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:05.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also know

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is sure to use them for his purpose.

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, let us try

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to analyze two examples, two areas,

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:21.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we oppose the Devil
and experience that he flees from us.

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:25.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, let’s talk about our health.

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, health problems are something

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:31.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of us
have to deal with in one way or another.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, some of us even have to deal
with serious issues or disabilities.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, what does this
have to do with opposing the Devil?

00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the subtle attacks of the Devil

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that he tries to use
our proper concern for our health

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to shift
our focus away from spiritual things.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to make use
of us being overly distracted.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would like us

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:02.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become consumed
with matters of health to the extent

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they take first place in our life,

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or he would like us to go to extremes

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:13.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in striving to maintain our health.

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he has no success.

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:20.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the reasons for this
we find in Luke chapter 12.

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:23.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to invite you to open
with me to Luke chapter 12,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we would like to read verse 25.

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:30.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Jesus asked a good question.

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who of you by being anxious

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can add a cubit to his life span?”

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:44.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we take good care of our health

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in line with Jesus’ words found at Luke 5:31,

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are not becoming unduly anxious

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over things we cannot control.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:57.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the convention,
I talked to one of the attendants,

00:02:57.794 --> 00:02:59.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother in his 30’s.

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, it was just normal small talk
till later in the conversation

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he revealed to me that he was actually
supposed to be at the hospital.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctors had told him

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would not survive
the next five months.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he now be fully absorbed
in finding some treatment

00:03:20.483 --> 00:03:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forgetting all of his spiritual routine?

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother persisted
in getting some medicine

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to attend the convention.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to serve as an attendant.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to care for others.

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so strengthened by the program,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was ready to go back
to the hospital the next day.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not sacrificing our spirituality.

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:48.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We maintain our spiritual balance,

00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:52.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and despite our challenges,
we are caring for others.

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we oppose the Devil

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and some of us on a daily basis.

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at this second example.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:06.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another area where we successfully
oppose the Devil is our attitude.

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know that attitude
makes a big difference in life.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
a positive or a negative attitude

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:18.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can influence
how we deal with certain situations

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how other people react to us.

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true with a complaining

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:28.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a grateful attitude.

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had a bad attitude,
nothing would seem right,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when from an objective point of view,

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life is just good.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be like

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting a dirty towel
on a nice piece of decoration in our room.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does this
have to do with opposing the Devil?

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A negative attitude can be used by Satan.

00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can accumulate in our heart

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overpower our ability to decide wisely.

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might lose our joy in Jehovah’s service.

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also can weaken
our resolve to resist wrongdoing.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do we see how the Devil

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be able to benefit from it?

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, as Christ’s followers,

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:18.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we avoid a negative
or a complaining attitude,

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although this is not always easy.

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:25.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe we feel down

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:29.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are sometimes not content
with what we’re able to accomplish.

00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we, for example, disappointed at times

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:36.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we did not reach a goal
that we set for ourselves?

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we were encouraged
to spend more time in the ministry,

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then things just did not turn out
the way we planned them.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we are sitting
in a congregation meeting,

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are listening
to the nice experiences of others.

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:56.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we feel?

00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we discouraged?

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That can be dangerous.

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Proverbs chapter 24 together.

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Proverbs 24:10

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here this danger

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be utilized by Satan is identified.

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we read at Proverbs 24:10:

00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:22.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you become discouraged
in the day of distress

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that’s what we’re talking about],

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:27.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your strength will be meager.”

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:34.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prolonged negative feelings
can rob us of our strength,

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making us feel weak and vulnerable.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan knows this well.

00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is difficult enough
if our heart is plagued

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:46.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with such feelings
of unworthiness or worthlessness.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:50.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when Satan
attempts to exploit such feelings,

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:54.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes this situation
even more burdensome.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:07:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we maintain
a balanced view of ourselves

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:05.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, as the apostle Paul
calls it at Romans 12:3,

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we maintain “a sound mind,”

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:11.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we oppose the Devil.

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:16.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we remind ourselves
that Jehovah just expects 100 percent

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our personal 100 percent,
today’s 100 percent,

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:23.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the 100 percent of somebody else,

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the 100 percent
of what we were able to do years ago

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and as we keep
this balanced view of ourselves,

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are not doing the Devil’s work.

00:07:35.238 --> 00:07:39.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when was the last time
that you opposed the Devil?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just discussed
two subtle forms of his attacks.

00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably we are all
opposing the Devil on a daily basis.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not allow ourselves
to be unduly anxious about health matters,

00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we work hard
in maintaining a good attitude.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are here together today

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is proof that we all oppose the Devil

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we experience that he flees from us.

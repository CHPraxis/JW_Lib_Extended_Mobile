00:00:01.184 --> 00:00:03.186 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The matter of dress and grooming

00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:05.689 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is a deeply personal matter.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.691 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s something that elicits

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all sorts of emotions.

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:11.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But let me just ask at this point,

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What are you thinking about?

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’re thinking,
‘Why does he have this hat on his head?’

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:20.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are thinking,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This must be a very defining moment
in Brother Jackson’s lifetime.’

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others are thinking:
‘Is this a new precedent?

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve never done that before.’

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:32.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let me take it off.

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:36.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an object lesson

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to point out how distracting
our dress and grooming can be.

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:44.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it can distract
from the message that we bear.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of thinking about what someone 

00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:48.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is conveying in the message,

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:52.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if our dress and grooming
is just out of the ordinary

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something that is shocking,

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it certainly can take away
from the glory to Jehovah

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:01.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the message that we bear.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:03.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we go around the world,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see a large variety of dress and grooming

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:09.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used by our brothers and sisters.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without showing you photos,

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might remember
many of the Watchtower<i> </i>photographs

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where our brothers are witnessing.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some don’t have a tie;
others don’t have a jacket.

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Fiji, of course,

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
men wear what might be referred to

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a kilt, or a sulu. 

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s a large variety of dresses

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and costumes and outfits that are acceptable.

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we probably noticed, too,
some of the Governing Body members,

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they’ve released Bibles
or have been at conventions,

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:45.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have donned some of the local attire.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not as if Jehovah’s organization

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so strict and inflexible

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:55.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we all have to dress
exactly the same way.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, there are various circumstances

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:00.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s people face.

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:04.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some countries,
there’s such a variety of items

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can use for dress and grooming.

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:09.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other countries,
there really aren’t as many things

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:11.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers can use.

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know my wife and I were very touched

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a number of years ago
when we attended a regional convention.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:20.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I was waiting to give the last talk,

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sitting behind the platform,

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed the brothers and sisters

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were in the Watchtower Study
were giving comments.

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it really touched my heart

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:33.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I saw sisters come off of the platform

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then give their shoes and their jewelry

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to other sisters who were
about to go on the same platform.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:43.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, they didn’t have much;
they shared what they had.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have a lot of choice.

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes we know
that some of you dear sisters, particularly,

00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:52.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may go into a department store

00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may look like you have a huge variety

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of things that you can choose from.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you start looking,
sometimes you may feel

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like those sisters
at that particular convention

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that there really isn’t a lot
that you can use as a Christian.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us?

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:11.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the encouraging thing is
that wherever you go in the world

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the brothers have ties or jackets
or whatever they have,

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s one thing in common:

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:22.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people try to be neat,
clean, and presentable.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from the Governing Body’s viewpoint,

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of course, you know
we’re not trying to make all sorts of rules

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—rigid rules—
with regard to this.

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us to help our brothers
and sisters to have the right viewpoint

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the viewpoint that brings glory to Jehovah?

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:41.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I thought
we might think of five Scriptural principles.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are many other
Scriptural principles we could look at,

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but these are five principles
that perhaps could help us.

00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:50.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, first of all, let’s take our Bibles

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:54.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn to 1 Timothy 2:9,

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are going to have this on the screen

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the highlighted portions.

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Likewise, the women
should adorn themselves

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in appropriate [and then notice
the footnote says “respectable”] dress,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with modesty and soundness of mind

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:15.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and again look at the footnote,
“good judgment; sensibleness”],

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not with styles of hair braiding and gold

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:23.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or pearls or very expensive clothing.”

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what principle do we get here,

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:28.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter where we live in the world?

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:32.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, certainly,
we wouldn’t want any clothing

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:35.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s showy or bizarre

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or provocative or that’s revealing

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:42.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or too extreme with regard to fads.

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:45.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the principle of the hat

00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if we’re doing something
or wearing something that,

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really, is so different
from what is expected, what happens?

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps at the very least,
it distracts from the message,

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it could be
a lot worse than that, couldn’t it?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:05.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could give the wrong impression
with regard to our morals and so forth.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a second scripture we can look at

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is at 2 Corinthians 6:3.

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that no fault
may be found with our ministry.”

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the comment here,

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:27.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“no way” or “any cause.”

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:32.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever selections we make
with regard to dress and grooming,

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:34.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we certainly would want to make sure

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in no way at all
could this cause some stumbling

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the part of those

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:44.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only outside the congregation
when we’re presenting the message

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also within the congregation.

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were to wear something
that could be provocative,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps it would arouse
in some wrong desires.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having that in mind
gives us a good principle

00:05:57.974 --> 00:06:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to selection
of dress and grooming.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a third principle

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found in the book of Numbers 15:39.

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we might say
that this is in the context

00:06:11.354 --> 00:06:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Israelite nation
when Jehovah did give them

00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:19.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some strict laws
with regard to dress and grooming

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—laws that made sure the Israelites

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be different
from the nations around them.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s read Numbers 15:39:

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must have this fringed edge
so that you will see it

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remember all the commandments
of Jehovah and observe them.”

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice this point:

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:40.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not follow
your own hearts and eyes,

00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:44.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are leading you
to spiritual prostitution.”

00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:46.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a very interesting principle,
isn’t it?

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not for one minute suggesting

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to have these fringed edges
on our garments today.

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:55.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s the thought?

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was telling them

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when you’re selecting what you wear,

00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:03.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t just follow your hearts and eyes.

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:06.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we shouldn’t feel:

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I really like this.
This is just nice.

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It suits me.

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:14.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reflects the colors of my skin,’

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whatever other feelings we may have.

00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, there are a lot more factors
to take into consideration.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt,
there were some back in Israelite times

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that didn’t like a fringe
on the edge of their garments,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but having in mind what Jehovah wanted

00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped them to see what they needed to do.

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the principle
is a good principle for us today

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:38.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to ask such questions as:

00:07:38.407 --> 00:07:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will this raise eyebrows?

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will it lower the standards that I have?

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:47.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it fit?

00:07:47.783 --> 00:07:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it the appropriate dress for my age?

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are important questions
that all of us need to think about.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a fourth principle is found

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:03.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, it’s one of the principles

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps we would have thought
of when we were thinking about this subject.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:12.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,

00:08:12.808 --> 00:08:16.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not all things are advantageous.

00:08:16.012 --> 00:08:18.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not all things build up.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep seeking,
not his own advantage,

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again, what type of questions
would we need to ask?

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, perhaps this selection we’ve made 

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not so bad

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:39.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going to have
someone come and talk to us about it.

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:41.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it upbuilding?

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it represent Jehovah in a fine manner

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we could say)
not only at times of worship,

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:52.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are in the Kingdom Hall
or when we’re witnessing,

00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:55.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also when we’re relaxing?

00:08:55.017 --> 00:08:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would someone be shocked to find out
that we’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:03.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re on vacation
because of the way we’re dressed?

00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:06.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are interesting questions,
aren’t they?

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the final scripture
that perhaps gives us a little direction

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:14.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is at Philippians 3:17.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Paul says:

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:19.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers,

00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and keep your eye on those
who are walking in a way that is

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in harmony
with the example we set for you.”

00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s the thought
behind that principle?

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:34.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we have questions in our mind
with regard to dress and grooming,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s good for us to look at those
who are mature in the congregation.

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:41.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, what do they wear?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:46.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What standards have been set
within the congregation as a whole?

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will give us some idea
as to what type of clothing we should wear.

00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:54.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers and sisters,
particularly the Bethel family,

00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we commend you
for the dress and grooming that you display.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that it does bring honor to Jehovah.

00:10:00.983 --> 00:10:05.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s always keep in mind
these basic principles.

00:10:05.054 --> 00:10:07.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, without making
a whole lot of rigid laws,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s always do things to Jehovah’s glory.

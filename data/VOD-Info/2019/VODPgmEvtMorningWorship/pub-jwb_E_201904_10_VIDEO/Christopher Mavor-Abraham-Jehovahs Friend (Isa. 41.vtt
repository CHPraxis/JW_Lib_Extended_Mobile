Our text today really highlights

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:07.090 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a very important kind of relationship.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.960 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s our friendship with our God, Jehovah.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was really exemplified

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.665 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for us in the man Abraham.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:17.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible, in several areas,

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that Jehovah called him his friend.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this was indeed a great honor
—to be called Jehovah’s friend.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is it that Jehovah felt so close

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:34.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Abraham that He called him his friend?

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of James, in chapter 2, verse 23,

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:40.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlights some points about what it is

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:43.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Abraham that made him so dear

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah God that He 
drew close to him to call him His friend.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 23, where, of course,

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:55.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the concluding phrase says:
“And he came to be called Jehovah’s friend.”

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look in the context 
of the paragraph of this scripture,

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:02.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Abraham lived a life of faith

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:07.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just expressing faith in Jehovah,
but actually living faith—

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing everything
that Jehovah God told him to do

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and did so in complete faith

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:17.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exactly the way
Jehovah expressed to him, or told him to do it.

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It culminated, really, when Jehovah told him

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go sacrifice his son Isaac.

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we stop and think for a moment,

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a great privilege 
that drama was for Abraham to reenact

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to actually play the part
of Jehovah God himself!

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:37.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really showed
how close Jehovah felt toward Abraham

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the trust that he had toward Abraham

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:44.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would fulfill this drama
to really demonstrate to all of us

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:46.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the depth of Jehovah’s love for mankind

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to really show

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that He really was a friend of Abraham’s.

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:58.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships like that of Jehovah and Abraham

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are truly rewarding and very satisfying,

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:03.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re needed.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times,
they can also be a little bit challenging,

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as even Abraham would attest,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had to fulfill
a very difficult assignment on several occasions

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:18.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to maintain Jehovah’s friendship.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible paints 
a very interesting definition for friendship,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we look at the proverbs, especially.

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:30.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think of Proverbs 18:24, where it says:

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:34.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are companions
ready to crush one another,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:38.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there is a friend
who sticks closer than a brother”;

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Proverbs 17:17:

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:45.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A true friend shows love at all times

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:48.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is a brother 
who is born for times of distress”;

00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:51.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and further, at Proverbs 27:6, it says:

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wounds inflicted by a friend are faithful.”

00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:58.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we put all these thoughts together,

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:03.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we get a very deep
and beautiful composite definition

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what a true friend really is

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Jehovah’s standards and not man’s.

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see that true friendship means

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going the distance 
with our brothers and sisters (our friends),

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing them love
—especially when it is difficult to do so

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even at times giving our friends

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some helpful counsel 
and direction when they need it.

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can see that friendships

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:32.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not only rewarding but even necessary.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t made to go life alone.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:39.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need friends, as created in Jehovah’s image.

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:42.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He chose certain ones to be his friend,

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:46.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so likewise, we need to follow his example

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and build friendships with others.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:53.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the Bible,
there are several very good examples

00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:55.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of friendships that existed between men.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think of David and Jonathan,

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:03.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul and Timothy,
and even Jesus Christ loved his apostles.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there were those whom
he was particularly close to,

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:10.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Peter and John and,
of course, Lazarus and his two sisters.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
we cannot forget the loving friendship

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Ruth and Naomi had toward one another.

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we just look on the surface,

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:23.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wonder why it is that such ones
were even friends with one another.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:28.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, great age differences
were in evidence there,

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even perhaps maybe some cultural differences,

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe it wasn’t socially

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or politically advantageous to be good friends.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:41.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, these individuals
were very close friends.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how nicely this was portrayed
in this month’s broadcast too

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:49.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we saw the young man Akil
develop a close relationship

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an older brother in the congregation.

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why?

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the foundation,
or the reason, for such friendships?

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:02.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was their mutual love
and devotion to Jehovah God.

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:07.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what really lays
a firm foundation for true friendship.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the key, isn’t it?

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that in reviewing
the accounts of these individuals,

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is noted that their love for God

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:19.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
superseded anything of a physical nature.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This unswerving faithfulness to God

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what enabled them to be a friend

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Jehovah’s definition
in his Word, the Bible.

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:31.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is in contrast to friendships in the world

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are oftentimes based on circumstances

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:40.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or situations or even perhaps a social status.

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think of children in school.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:46.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They develop friendships there
because of being in class together

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:48.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the situation there.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps workmates develop
a good working relationship with one another,

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:54.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or work well together,

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:57.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may even consider one another friends.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may even develop a very strong bond
—emotional bond—

00:06:01.477 --> 00:06:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of a certain situation
that they have undergone together.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:08.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, while many of these 
say this will last forever,

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realize that they can quickly dissolve,

00:06:11.888 --> 00:06:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not friendships based on Jehovah’s love.

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah endures forever.

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is for time indefinite,

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:24.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so any friendship
based on the love of God is similar.

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, like Abraham

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to all those whom Jehovah calls friends,

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also gives us work to do

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:35.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—assignments to carry out.

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in order to maintain
a friendship with Jehovah,

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he expects us to carry them out
according to his directions

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to maintain the friendship.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:47.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we think today of how wonderfully
our brothers and sisters are volunteering

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve in areas where the need is greater

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—offering themselves willingly
in obedience to Jehovah’s command

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach the good news
and to put Kingdom interests first

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any, perhaps,
physical sacrifices that they may endure.

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:04.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we see that today!

00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just recently, I had the privilege

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of visiting the India branch on a branch visit.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there they reviewed with me
some special campaigns

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they had organized and the results.

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:21.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s fascinating to consider
how our brothers and sisters gave of themselves

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to maintain their friendship with God,
to put his Kingdom interests first,

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah richly blessed them.

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider one special campaign
that took place recently.

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:33.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were some 250 brothers and sisters

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from North America and Western Europe,

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Indian descent, that came to participate

00:07:39.108 --> 00:07:41.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a special preaching campaign.

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:43.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And consider one of the blessings

00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some of the blessings
—actually, many of the blessings.

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one village,

00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the local congregation
that was many miles away

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was conducting several Bible studies
by phone with individuals.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, because of the special campaign there,

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:01.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters were sent to this village

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet up with these Bible students
to see how they were doing.

00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:07.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when they arrived,
they were surprised to see

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at each home of a Bible student,

00:08:10.506 --> 00:08:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least 15 to 20 other people
were there in attendance,

00:08:14.377 --> 00:08:17.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanting to hear more
about the Kingdom good news.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,
this group was sent to another village,

00:08:21.684 --> 00:08:23.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when our brothers arrived,

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:28.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what greeted them were some 275 people

00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were gathered
at one of the Bible student’s homes,

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all thirsting for Kingdom truth.

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the publishers
quickly divided up into groups of 20,

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:43.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they taught group Bible studies
of 20 to interested persons.

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:46.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One person came up and said:
“I’ve got a relative in another city.

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:50.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to go call on her. 
She’s a pastor.”

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:52.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened was
that when the brothers

00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:56.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called on that woman
who was a pastor there at her apartment,

00:08:56.085 --> 00:09:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had 70 others gathered
to hear the Kingdom good news.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A similar experience
can be seen in the deaf field.

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:06.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother was sent (was given) a referral slip,

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had to travel
some four hours on a train to this village.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he arrived,
he was greeted at the train station

00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by over 130 deaf people

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanting to hear the Kingdom good news.

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A group was started, and now a year later,

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have over 50 attending meetings regularly.

00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:30.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see, then, that the brothers and sisters

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:34.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are responding to Jehovah’s direction
to expand the Kingdom ministry

00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:37.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to cultivate their friendship with God.

00:09:37.727 --> 00:09:39.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing!

00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, such blessings
make us echo David’s words at Psalm 63:3,

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he said:
“Your loyal love [yes, your friendship]

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:50.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is better than life [itself].”

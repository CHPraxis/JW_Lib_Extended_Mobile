00:00:01 In a recent poll,
00:00:02 over 6,000 people surveyed worldwide
00:00:05 were asked to rank
00:00:07 what they felt were keys to happiness.
00:00:10 Of interest was that only 16 percent believed
00:00:14 that one’s faith or religious beliefs
00:00:17 had any impact or bearing on their personal happiness.
00:00:22 Now, the words of today’s text, as we know,
00:00:24 are part of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount,
00:00:27 and he begins this by letting us know
00:00:31 what is needed in order to be truly happy.
00:00:33 But in his discussion,
00:00:35 Jesus explained something quite different from that poll.
00:00:39 He explains that our happiness
00:00:41 is directly connected to our faith
00:00:45 and to our relationship with God.
00:00:47 I invite you to turn with me in your Bibles
00:00:50 —we’re going to consider portions of this account—
00:00:52 to Matthew chapter 5.
00:00:58 And let’s begin with the reading of Matthew 5:3:
00:01:06 “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need,
00:01:09 since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.”
00:01:13 Notice the start:
00:01:15 “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.”
00:01:20 Or, as the footnote says,
00:01:22 or “those who are beggars for the spirit.”
00:01:27 A literal beggar is likely,
00:01:30 painfully aware of his need for physical food.
00:01:34 And isn’t that exactly how you and I have to be conscious of our spiritual need?
00:01:39 You see, we have to beg Jehovah for his holy spirit.
00:01:43 And you notice this point is highlighted again if you look in verse 6
00:01:47 —the thought of “hungering and thirsting” for divine guidance,
00:01:52 begging to be led in the right way
00:01:54 to allow Jehovah’s spirit to be operative upon us and in our lives.
00:01:59 And, of course, we do this by taking advantage of spiritual provisions
00:02:03 —so reading and meditating on God’s Word,
00:02:06 having a regular study program
00:02:08 and, of course, constantly going to Jehovah in prayer.
00:02:12 When we do this, all of this shows
00:02:15 that we are putting our complete dependence and reliance upon Jehovah.
00:02:21 And, of course, as we beg for holy spirit
00:02:25 and we work to apply the things that we learn,
00:02:28 well, obviously, now we’re happy because it helps us to become better individuals
00:02:33 and we’re better able to display various aspects of the fruitage of the spirit.
00:02:38 And this becomes evident in our dealings with others.
00:02:41 Jesus mentions some of these qualities in his sermon.
00:02:43 For example, if you look in verse 5, we develop the quality of mildness.
00:02:48 In verse 7, we’re able to be merciful with others.
00:02:53 And then in verse 9,
00:02:55 we’re peaceable or we’re “peacemakers.”
00:02:59 So we’re the ones that go about working to initiate peace with one another.
00:03:04 And being in such a large family, certainly, can’t we see the benefit of this?
00:03:08 The more that we’re able to integrate these qualities into our dealings with one another,
00:03:13 the happier we’re going to be and, of course,
00:03:16 the happier our Bethel family will be as they deal with one another.
00:03:20 Now, next in the sermon is our text for today, verse 8.
00:03:25 And here in verse 8, we’re helped to examine our motives for serving God.
00:03:30 As our commenters mentioned,
00:03:32 being pure in heart has to do with what we are on the inside.
00:03:35 So it’s our motives; it’s our affections; it’s our desires.
00:03:40 And can’t we say,
00:03:42 ‘Aren’t we happiest  when we know that we’re serving Jehovah
00:03:45 ‘with a clean conscience and that everything that we do
00:03:48 is motivated by our sincere love and gratitude for him?’
00:03:53 You know, the interesting thing about Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount
00:03:56 was that as he spoke with these large crowds that gathered from all over,
00:04:02 likely the majority of the people in the crowds were happy.
00:04:07 They were probably very excited they were able to make this journey.
00:04:11 They were thrilled about the possibility of meeting Jesus and learning about him.
00:04:16 Many of them had probably been healed by him
00:04:19 and cured of some sickness and infirmity.
00:04:22 But despite all of that joy and excitement,
00:04:25 Jesus was helping them to see that real happiness,
00:04:29 genuine happiness, was more than how they felt
00:04:34 or what they were doing at present.
00:04:36 Happiness was not just a joyous occasion.
00:04:39 It was more than just a good time with others.
00:04:42 It went much deeper than that.
00:04:44 It involved their contentment,
00:04:47 satisfaction, fulfillment in life.
00:04:50 And all of those things are directly related to one’s relationship with God.
00:04:56 That’s why if we go back to chapter 6
00:04:59 —even if you look in verses 10 and 11—
00:05:02 it’s amazing how members of our brotherhood
00:05:05 can experience hurt, disappointment,
00:05:09 ridicule, even severe persecution,
00:05:12 and yet they’re able to remain remarkably happy.
00:05:16 Why?
00:05:18 It’s because of their relationship and service to Jehovah.
00:05:23 Now, this Sermon on the Mount was not the only time that Jesus focuses on this point.
00:05:28 If we look at another account—
00:05:29 If you turn with me, please, to Luke chapter 11,
00:05:33 and here we’ll see another account where Jesus shows the connection
00:05:36 between happiness and one’s relationship with Jehovah.
00:05:40 Luke chapter 11,
00:05:42 and we’ll look at verse 27.
00:05:48 It says: “Now as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd called out to him:
00:05:52 ‘Happy is the womb that carried you and the breasts that nursed you!’”
00:05:58 Well, Jewish women desired the privilege of being the mother of a prophet
00:06:01 and particularly the Messiah.
00:06:03 So this woman must have thought:
00:06:05 ‘What a privilege for Mary.
00:06:08 ‘How happy she must have been
00:06:10 to be the mother of Jesus Christ.’
00:06:13 And likely she was.
00:06:15 But yet, what did Jesus do?
00:06:18 Notice how he gently corrects the woman
00:06:21 and directs her attention as to the true source of happiness.
00:06:26 Verse 28:
00:06:28 “But he said: ‘No, rather,
00:06:32 happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!’”
00:06:38 So again, Jesus emphasizes that true happiness
00:06:41 is not found in any physical ties;
00:06:44 it’s not found in privileges; it’s not found in accomplishments.
00:06:49 True happiness is found in being a true, faithful servant of God;
00:06:55 because likely Jesus knew that if we were to gauge our happiness
00:06:58 on any of these other things,
00:07:00 you see, our life becomes one giant roller coaster of events.
00:07:05 It’s basically a bunch of highs and lows,
00:07:08 and we’re just waiting for the next big thing in life to make us happy.
00:07:11 That’s a very tough way to live.
00:07:14 It’s a stressful way to live.
00:07:16 Well, Jesus and his Father —they don’t want us to live this way.
00:07:21 How interesting that our Watchtower for this week really helped to capture this point.
00:07:25 And didn’t we learn that we  cannot gauge happiness by what we have,
00:07:30 by what we do, even by where we serve.
00:07:35 Because isn’t it true that the reality is there are some things that are just not in our control?
00:07:40 And as our Watchtower so nicely highlighted,
00:07:43 our circumstances can always change.
00:07:45 And that’s going to affect, expand, or limit
00:07:49 what we’re able to do in Jehovah’s service.
00:07:53 If we just go back for a minute to that survey that was taken,
00:07:57 the top answer on the list  as far as what made one happy
00:08:02 was “family and relationships.”
00:08:06 And doesn’t that really highlight the disconnect
00:08:10 when a person does not view Jehovah as family
00:08:15 —when they don’t see him as their heavenly Father?
00:08:18 So don’t we rejoice in the fact
00:08:21 —we cherish the fact—
00:08:22 actually, that Jehovah is our Father?
00:08:25 And he’s a happy God, and he wants us to be happy as well.
00:08:29 Jehovah is certainly appreciative of anything
00:08:32 that we’re able to do in his service
00:08:34 according to our circumstances and our abilities.
00:08:37 And we rejoice in the fact that our faith
00:08:39 is strong and we are happy
00:08:43 —genuinely happy.
00:08:45 Why?
00:08:46 Because we have a good relationship with God,
00:08:49 and this is the relationship that allows us to learn about him,
00:08:53 that allows us to be fellow workers with him in our Christian ministry
00:08:57 and, ultimately, gives us the tremendous privilege
00:09:01 to bear and to carry his name.

In a recent poll,

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
over 6,000 people surveyed worldwide

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were asked to rank

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what they felt were keys to happiness.

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:14.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Of interest was that only 16 percent believed

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one’s faith or religious beliefs

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:22.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had any impact or bearing on their personal happiness.

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:24.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the words of today’s text, as we know,

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are part of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount,

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:31.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he begins this by letting us know

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is needed in order to be truly happy.

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:35.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in his discussion,

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:39.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explained something
quite different from that poll.

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He explains that our happiness

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is directly connected to our faith

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to our relationship with God.

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to turn with me in your Bibles

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we’re going to consider portions of this account—

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:54.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Matthew chapter 5.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s begin with the reading of Matthew 5:3:

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are those
conscious of their spiritual need,

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the Kingdom of the heavens
belongs to them.”

00:01:13.723 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the start:

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are those
conscious of their spiritual need.”

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, as the footnote says,

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “those who are beggars for the spirit.”

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:30.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A literal beggar is likely,

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
painfully aware of his need for physical food.

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:39.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t that exactly how you and I
have to be conscious of our spiritual need?

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
we have to beg Jehovah for his holy spirit.

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you notice this point
is highlighted again if you look in verse 6

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the thought of “hungering and thirsting”
for divine guidance,

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begging to be led in the right way

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to allow Jehovah’s spirit
to be operative upon us and in our lives.

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:03.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, we do this
by taking advantage of spiritual provisions

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so reading and meditating on God’s Word,

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a regular study program

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course,
constantly going to Jehovah in prayer.

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:15.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this, all of this shows

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:20.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are putting our complete
dependence and reliance upon Jehovah.

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:25.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, as we beg for holy spirit

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we work to apply the things that we learn,

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, obviously, now we’re happy
because it helps us to become better individuals

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re better able to display
various aspects of the fruitage of the spirit.

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this becomes evident in our dealings with others.

00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:43.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus mentions some of these qualities in his sermon.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if you look in verse 5,
we develop the quality of mildness.

00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 7, we’re able to be merciful with others.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 9,

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:59.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re peaceable or we’re “peacemakers.”

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:04.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re the ones that go about working
to initiate peace with one another.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:08.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And being in such a large family,
certainly, can’t we see the benefit of this?

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:13.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more that we’re able to integrate these
qualities into our dealings with one another,

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happier we’re going to be and, of course,

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happier our Bethel family will be
as they deal with one another.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, next in the sermon
is our text for today, verse 8.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here in verse 8, we’re helped
to examine our motives for serving God.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our commenters mentioned,

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:35.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being pure in heart has to do
with what we are on the inside.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s our motives;
it’s our affections; it’s our desires.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can’t we say,

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Aren’t we happiest 
when we know that we’re serving Jehovah

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:48.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘with a clean conscience
and that everything that we do

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:52.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is motivated
by our sincere love and gratitude for him?’

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, the interesting thing
about Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:01.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that as he spoke with
these large crowds that gathered from all over,

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely the majority
of the people in the crowds were happy.

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were probably very excited
they were able to make this journey.

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were thrilled about the possibility
of meeting Jesus and learning about him.

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:19.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of them had probably been healed by him

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:22.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cured of some sickness and infirmity.

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:25.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite all of that joy and excitement,

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:29.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was helping them to see that real happiness,

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
genuine happiness, was more than how they felt

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:36.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what they were doing at present.

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:39.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happiness was not just a joyous occasion.

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was more than just a good time with others.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:44.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It went much deeper than that.

00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involved their contentment,

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
satisfaction, fulfillment in life.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of those things are directly related
to one’s relationship with God.

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:59.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why if we go back to chapter 6

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even if you look in verses 10 and 11—

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s amazing how members of our brotherhood

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can experience hurt, disappointment,

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ridicule, even severe persecution,

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:16.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they’re able to remain remarkably happy.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because of their relationship and service to Jehovah.

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:28.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this Sermon on the Mount was not
the only time that Jesus focuses on this point.

00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:29.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look at another account—

00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me, please, to Luke chapter 11,

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here we’ll see another account
where Jesus shows the connection

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between happiness
and one’s relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke chapter 11,

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll look at verse 27.

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:52.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Now as he was saying these things,
a woman from the crowd called out to him:

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:56.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Happy is the womb that carried you
and the breasts that nursed you!’”

00:05:58.174 --> 00:06:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jewish women desired
the privilege of being the mother of a prophet

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and particularly the Messiah.

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this woman must have thought:

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:08.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What a privilege for Mary.

00:06:08.217 --> 00:06:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How happy she must have been

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the mother of Jesus Christ.’

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likely she was.

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But yet, what did Jesus do?

00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:21.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how he gently corrects the woman

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:26.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and directs her attention
as to the true source of happiness.

00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:28.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 28:

00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he said: ‘No, rather,

00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happy are those
hearing the word of God and keeping it!’”

00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:41.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again, Jesus emphasizes that true happiness

00:06:41.517 --> 00:06:44.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not found in any physical ties;

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not found in privileges;
it’s not found in accomplishments.

00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True happiness is found
in being a true, faithful servant of God;

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:58.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because likely Jesus knew
that if we were to gauge our happiness

00:06:58.568 --> 00:07:00.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on any of these other things,

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:05.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, our life
becomes one giant roller coaster of events.

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s basically a bunch of highs and lows,

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re just waiting
for the next big thing in life to make us happy.

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very tough way to live.

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:16.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a stressful way to live.

00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus and his Father
—they don’t want us to live this way.

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How interesting that our Watchtower
for this week really helped to capture this point.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And didn’t we learn that we 
cannot gauge happiness by what we have,

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by what we do, even by where we serve.

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:40.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because isn’t it true that the reality is there
are some things that are just not in our control?

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as our Watchtower so nicely highlighted,

00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our circumstances can always change.

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s going to affect, expand, or limit

00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:52.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we’re able to do in Jehovah’s service.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we just go back for a minute
to that survey that was taken,

00:07:57.793 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the top answer on the list 
as far as what made one happy

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was “family and relationships.”

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doesn’t that really highlight the disconnect

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:15.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a person does not view Jehovah as family

00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when they don’t see him as their heavenly Father?

00:08:18.781 --> 00:08:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t we rejoice in the fact

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:22.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we cherish the fact—

00:08:22.618 --> 00:08:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually, that Jehovah is our Father?

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:29.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s a happy God,
and he wants us to be happy as well.

that we’re able to do in his service

according to our circumstances and our abilities.

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we rejoice in the fact that our faith

is strong and we are happy

00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:45.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—genuinely happy.

Why?

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we have a good relationship with God,

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is the relationship
that allows us to learn about him,

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:57.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that allows us to be fellow workers
with him in our Christian ministry

00:08:57.253 --> 00:09:01.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, ultimately,
gives us the tremendous privilege

00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bear and to carry his name.

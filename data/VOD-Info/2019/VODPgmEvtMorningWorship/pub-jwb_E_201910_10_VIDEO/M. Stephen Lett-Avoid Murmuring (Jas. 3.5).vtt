James 3:5, 6 tells us in part:

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:10.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“The tongue is a small part of the body,

00:00:10.193 --> 00:00:14.264 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“and yet . . . see how small a fire it takes

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to set a great forest ablaze!

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tongue is also a fire.”

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just how small is the tongue?

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An average adult’s tongue weighs

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only about two and a half ounces (70 g).

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:33.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a small part of the body weight
of a 200-pound (90 kg) man.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that little two-ounce tongue
has great power.

00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about it, it can actually lift
thousands of pounds of weight

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for example, when a chairman
at a convention says, “Please stand.”

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, that power

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be used for good or for bad.

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the warning in today’s scripture text:

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:01.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not careful,
it can cause great damage,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:06.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like a tiny lighted match
flipped carelessly aside

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:09.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can burn thousands of acres

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of beautiful trees to the ground.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what are types of speech
that can be like a destructive fire?

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lying, slander, backbiting, harmful gossip,

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:23.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and false teaching
—a few examples.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during our discussion, let’s talk

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:31.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about a type of speech
that may be more subtle, more insidious,

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nevertheless is very harmful.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?
Murmuring.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:40.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discuss: “Avoid Murmuring.”

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:43.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is murmuring?

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the dictionary, to murmur

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “to make a low, continuous,

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indistinct sound or succession of sounds.”

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:53.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, in nature,

00:01:53.897 --> 00:01:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many
very pleasant murmuring sounds.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, it’s pleasant to listen

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:05.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gentle breezes murmur
through the leaves of trees.

00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s soothing to listen

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:11.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a small stream murmuring its way

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through a forest or down a mountain slope.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the same cannot be said
about murmuring by the human tongue.

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is far from pleasant.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One dictionary said that “murmuring by humans

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“means complaining

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:32.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in low mumbling tones, grumbling.”

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Watchtower said

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:39.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the Hebrew term meaning
‘to murmur’ can also mean ‘to growl.’”

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re out in service
and if a dog growls at us,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not a pleasant sound that draws us.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to distance ourselves.

00:02:48.017 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, murmuring
permeates Satan’s world.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children murmur against their parents;

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wives murmur against their husbands;

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
employees murmur against their employers;

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:05.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
multitudes murmur against God,

00:03:05.902 --> 00:03:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blaming him for bad things that happen.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:13.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, here’s an important question,
How does Jehovah view murmuring?

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open up to Numbers chapter 12, please,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s an interesting account

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that gives us some insight
into Jehovah’s viewpoint

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Numbers 12:1:

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Miriam and Aaron

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“began to speak against Moses

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the Cushite wife he had married.”

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 2: “They were saying

00:03:35.932 --> 00:03:39.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and apparently on an ongoing basis]:

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Is it only by Moses

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:45.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that Jehovah has spoken?

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:48.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has he not also spoken through us?’”

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the next thought:

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah was listening.”

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:56.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah didn’t like
what he heard, did he?

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at verse 9, his “anger burned,”

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he struck Miriam with leprosy.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about this: Of all the diseases

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:08.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah could have struck Miriam with,

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why did he choose leprosy?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah doesn’t tell us.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think about this:
A person struck with leprosy,

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:20.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in Bible times,
was made physically repulsive,

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or (you could say) physically ugly.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by talking
the way she was talking already,

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:28.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was spiritually repulsive
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by striking her with leprosy,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah allowed everyone to see

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:36.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah already saw in Miriam.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another account two chapters later.

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It talks about how
the Israelites began to murmur

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after hearing the negative report

00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:49.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the ten spies.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:51.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jehovah react?

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He decreed that all the murmurers
20 years of age and over

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would never make it to the Promised Land.

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would die in the wilderness.

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:03.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously, Jehovah hates murmuring.

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say that he abominates it.

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:08.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is, Why?

00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s briefly discuss three reasons.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One: It breeds discontent

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:18.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both in ourselves and in others.

00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:22.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jude 16 speaks of ‘murmurers

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
complaining about their lot in life.’

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:28.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s true that the more

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a person complains about his lot in life,

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the deeper
the discontent becomes in his own heart.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since murmurers
never keep their complaints to themselves,

00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:43.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it sows discontent in others.

00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about this:

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was the original promoter
of discontent with one’s lot in life?

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil.

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He succeeded
in sowing discontent in Eve’s heart.

00:05:55.471 --> 00:06:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a murmurer is actually
imitating the methods of the Devil,

00:06:00.076 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apparently a murmurer

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds Jehovah of his archenemy, Satan.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s certainly something
no wise person wants to do

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to remind Jehovah of Satan.

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is the antidote?

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:16.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cultivating contentment.

00:06:16.526 --> 00:06:18.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 6:6:

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:23.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is great gain
in godly devotion along with contentment.”

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:26.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And several scriptures
talk about contentment.

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we count our blessings
that we have from Jehovah,

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:32.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be content
—can’t we?—

00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what our circumstances now.

00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:38.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second reason Jehovah hates it:

00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:40.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It incites hatred,

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:44.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, both in our own heart and in others.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to Proverbs chapter 17, please.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s an interesting scripture on this,

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 17:9:

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love,

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the one who keeps harping on a matter

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
separates close friends.”

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:11.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, love should move us to cover over,
forgive, the transgressions of others.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we don’t do that and we keep harping

00:07:14.183 --> 00:07:16.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about their transgressions,

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
murmuring about them,

00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then hatred for that one
grows in our own heart.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does it affect others?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, it sows hatred in their heart.

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Watchtower
some years ago had a little article

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:31.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why Keep Free from Murmuring?”

00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:33.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it gave an example.

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:37.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Suppose . . . a Christian
starts to complain to you

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about a certain appointed elder

00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:42.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[about how he
performs his duties, how he] . . .

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
handles his parts on the platform.”

00:07:44.413 --> 00:07:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says:
“If you listen to the complainer,

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:50.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you can begin to think as he does.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then, as you observe the elder,
you could be saying to yourself:

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now that I think [about] it,

00:07:56.692 --> 00:08:01.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘what my friend says
about this elder is true.

00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought of it that way before.’”

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before it didn’t bother you;
now it bothers you.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, everything the elder does

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:12.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be improper in your eyes.

00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:14.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, what is the antidote?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like it said in Proverbs:

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love”

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so cultivating love,
making allowances for others,

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:31.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forgiving them,
not harping about their transgressions,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but forgiving
as we pray and hope Jehovah will do for us.

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, the third reason Jehovah hates it:
It manifests pride.

00:08:39.402 --> 00:08:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Korah, Dathan, Abiram

00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:45.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—remember they murmured against Moses.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have had enough of you!

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:50.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The whole assembly is holy, all of them,

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Jehovah is in their midst.

00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why, then, should you exalt yourselves

00:08:54.183 --> 00:08:56.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
above the congregation of Jehovah?”

00:08:56.686 --> 00:09:00.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their murmuring was an outward expression

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:04.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an inward condition—pride.

00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:06.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know
how Jehovah reacted in that case.

00:09:06.696 --> 00:09:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, what’s the antidote?

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:11.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humility, lowliness of mind

00:09:11.334 --> 00:09:13.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not trying to tear others down

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:17.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our talking to elevate ourselves.

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:20.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But lowliness of mind will protect us.

00:09:20.543 --> 00:09:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve discussed that murmuring

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:28.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
breeds discontent,
incites hatred, manifests pride.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder Jehovah hates it.

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we said, if we cultivate contentment,

00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love, and we cultivate humility,

00:09:39.562 --> 00:09:44.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these will serve as antidotes
to our ever becoming murmurers.

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll be successful
in applying Philippians 2:14,

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:51.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says:
“Keep doing all things

00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
free from murmuring.”

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it didn’t say most things.

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep doing all things
free from murmuring,”

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:03.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll prove to Jehovah
that we’re assets in his organization.

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:06.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll want us in his organization now;

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:10.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll want us in his new world in the future.

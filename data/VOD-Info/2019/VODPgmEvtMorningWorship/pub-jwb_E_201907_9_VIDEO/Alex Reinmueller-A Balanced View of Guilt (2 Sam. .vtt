A brother feels guilty

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:06.756 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because he did things before his baptism.

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.758 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A parent feels guilty

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:11.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because his children left the truth.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A sister feels guilty

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because she divorced her unfaithful husband.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do all these people have in common?

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:23.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They suffer from inappropriate guilt.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a comedian joked,

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Religion is basically guilt with different holidays.”

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it
that religious people carry so much guilt?

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can anything good come from it?

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible, of course, associates guilt

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with laws, sin, and transgression.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:48.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles with me to Galatians 3:19,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the effect
the Mosaic Law had on the Israelites.

00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “Why, then, the Law?

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:02.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was added to make transgressions manifest.”

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Law reminded God’s people every day

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were sinners.

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:09.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Law was perfect.

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one could live up to it.

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:16.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the Israelites,
feeling guilty was inescapable.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why would Jehovah do that?

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why give them the Law
to make them feel guilty?

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there were at least three reasons.

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we should feel guilty
when we’ve done something wrong.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds us of Jehovah’s position
as Universal Sovereign

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:36.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of his righteous standards,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it confirms that our conscience is working.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we can all admit that there are times

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we may not have done
something wrong yet,

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we may be wanting to

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, at that point, guilt is our friend.

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:57.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some ways, it’s like physical pain.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Physical pain makes us aware
of a potential health problem,

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:06.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the emotional pain of guilt
alerts us to the fact

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there may be
potential moral or spiritual problems.

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, third,
when someone confesses his guilt,

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps both the wrongdoer and the victim.

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Confession brings the guilty person
relief through forgiveness,

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it makes the victim feel better

00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he sees that the guilty one
loves them enough to apologize.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately,

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can feel guilty even without being guilty.

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:41.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And inappropriate guilt
often leads people

00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:46.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to emotional distress
and sometimes even harsh self-criticism.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s consider three situations

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where inappropriate guilt can paralyze us

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also what we can do to get rid of it.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:03:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first situation is
what we might call “persistent guilt.”

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:05.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is guilt
for something you did and repented over

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even received forgiveness for—

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:10.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you can’t forgive yourself.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you continue to ruminate over the matter,

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it saps your joy and strength.

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:17.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you do?

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider the apostle Paul.

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:25.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times
when the things he did in the past upset him.

00:03:25.388 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he handle those feelings?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer, let’s read together

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:35.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians 15:9, 10.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we know,

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:43.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul (before he was baptized)
persecuted Christ’s brothers.

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even supported the stoning of Stephen.

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:49.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think
those memories made him feel?

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:53.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice what he says in verse 9:

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am the least of the apostles,

00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I am not worthy of being called an apostle,

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I persecuted the congregation of God.”

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:09.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you’re in a position
of responsibility like Paul was,

00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feelings of unworthiness like this
can be devastating.

00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan tries to make you doubt yourself

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:20.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether you still have
God’s approval in your life.

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:24.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he often does this
when you’re most vulnerable

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:26.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when you’re already crushed under the weight

00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:30.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your own failures and disappointments.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Paul didn’t let these feelings defeat him.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t give in to the pressure.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what he says next in verse 10:

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But by God’s undeserved kindness
I am what I am.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And his undeserved kindness
to me was not in vain,

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:51.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I labored more than all of them;

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yet it was not I,

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the undeserved kindness
of God that is with me.”

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:00.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul realized

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah accepted him for what he was,

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:07.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew that he couldn’t change
whatever happened in the past,

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how much he might want to.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He accepted God’s undeserved kindness,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he let Jehovah use him.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Paul,
we’ve repented over our past sins.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve confessed them to the extent necessary.

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can be sure, too,

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will be merciful with us.

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah promises
that he forgives in a large way.

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:40.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can take him at his word
and accept his forgiveness.

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we might refer to a second situation

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes people suffer as “compassion guilt.”

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is feeling guilty

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you didn’t do enough to help someone.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And caregivers often struggle
with feelings like this.

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when they’re doing all they can to help,

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:06.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they sometimes feel guilty
about not being able to do more.

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister who was caring
for her elderly parents said,

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:16.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Having to say ‘I can’t take care of you anymore’

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is extremely difficult.”

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help those in this situation?

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:28.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice what Ecclesiastes 7:16 says

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should all avoid:

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:34.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be overly righteous,

00:06:34.744 --> 00:06:37.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor show yourself excessively wise.

00:06:37.914 --> 00:06:42.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should you bring ruin to yourself?”

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way we could put this is:

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid becoming a perfectionist.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Conscientiousness
can easily deteriorate into perfectionism.

00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re trying to do more than we want to,

00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:00.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can do, or even should do,

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:03.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re only setting ourselves up

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:05.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for disappointment and failure.

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:10.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate, some people see caregiving

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:15.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a way to repay their parents
for all they did while they were growing up.

00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we see it that way,

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:20.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re always going to feel guilty

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we can never fully repay our parents.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acting out of guilt will only drain us over time

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make us less effective as a caregiver.

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do instead?

00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:36.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can share the load.

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:41.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Family, friends, neighbors,
and professionals can be of help.

00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:44.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to ask for help,

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:47.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have to ask directly for it.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hints seldom work.

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:54.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may surprise us who and how many

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are willing to pitch in
if we make our needs known.

00:07:59.095 --> 00:08:01.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, a third situation

00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s paralyzing for some
is “imagined guilt.”

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is guilt over something
you think you did but didn’t.

00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
Theresa’s daughter died in a car accident,

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she says, “I felt guilty

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had sent her out that night on an errand.”

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sister says,

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:25.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The guilt that you feel during a divorce,

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:28.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even if you’re not the guilty party,

00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be overwhelming.”

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can someone do in this situation?

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, it’s important
not to bottle up those emotions.

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:41.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share your feelings
with a friend who’ll really listen to you.

00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow them to reassure you

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that irrational feelings are common,

00:08:46.342 --> 00:08:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you’re grieving.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But second,
no matter how much we love someone,

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:57.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can’t control his or her life.

00:08:57.353 --> 00:09:02.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Ecclesiastes 9:11 says,

00:09:02.358 --> 00:09:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is true for all of us:

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:10.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have seen something further under the sun,

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the swift do not always win the race,

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:15.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor do the mighty win the battle,

00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:18.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor do the wise always have the food,

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor do the intelligent always have the riches,

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:24.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor do those with knowledge
always have success,

00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:28.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because time and unexpected events

00:09:28.517 --> 00:09:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overtake them all.”

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we are not to blame
for things we cannot control.

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you accuse yourself of wrongdoing,

00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:43.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make sure that wrongdoing actually took place.

00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:45.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk it over with a trusted friend,

00:09:45.234 --> 00:09:48.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and refocus your thoughts on the future.

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflecting on all kinds of “if onlys”

00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:57.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t change anything,
and it may slow down your recovery.

00:09:57.313 --> 00:10:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let inappropriate guilt control your life.

00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review, a guilty conscience

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can and should move us

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to confess our sins and to take positive action,

00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:14.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inappropriate guilt is dangerous.

00:10:14.497 --> 00:10:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can crush our spirit
and keep us from giving our best to Jehovah.

00:10:19.302 --> 00:10:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let guilt paralyze you.

00:10:22.271 --> 00:10:24.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Concentrate all your energies

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what you can do right now
and on what lies ahead.

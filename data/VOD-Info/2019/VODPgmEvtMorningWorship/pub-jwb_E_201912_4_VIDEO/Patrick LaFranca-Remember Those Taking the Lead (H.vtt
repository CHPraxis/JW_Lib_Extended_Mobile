00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:04.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today’s text
is a partial quote

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:06.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Hebrews 13:7.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we read the entire verse,

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then we’ll discuss its importance

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:14.397 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to those to whom Paul was writing

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:16.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but also to us today?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.968 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s Hebrews 13:7:

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:20.937 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Remember those who are taking 

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the lead among you,

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who have spoken the word of God to you,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:29.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and as you contemplate
how their conduct turns out,

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:31.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imitate their faith.”

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to whom was Paul writing?

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to the Hebrew or Jewish Christians

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:43.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who belonged
to the congregation in Jerusalem.

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it important for them

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to those taking the lead?

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider,

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote this around 61 C.E.,

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:58.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that was about five years before Jerusalem

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was surrounded by Roman armies

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then later destroyed.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, who were taking the lead

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:09.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Jerusalem congregation at that time?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The May 15, 1997,<i> </i><i>Watchtower, </i>

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 16 and 17,

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:21.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains that it appears
that the governing body,

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:26.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
composed of the remaining members
of the apostles and older men,

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:30.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was likely very active in Jerusalem

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up until 66 C.E.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So surely they would be
among ‘those taking the lead’

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to whom Paul referred.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what things
could the brothers remember

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the faith and the conduct
of the apostles and older men?

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, they could remember the words

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the example of the apostle Peter.

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:58.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though Peter was arrested and beaten,

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he, along with the rest of the apostles,

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
told the authorities:

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:09.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Peter remained active
for the rest of his life,

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraging the brothers.

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could remember the loyalty

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:20.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the courage of the apostle James,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who Herod Agrippa I

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:27.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put to death by the sword in 44 C.E.

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering the loyalty
and the courage of these brothers

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:37.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have been a benefit
to the brothers in the congregation,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially as the end
of the Jewish system drew near.

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:45.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now,
how can we apply Paul’s exhortation today?

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the <i>Watchtower </i> comments mention,

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:52.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one way is to remember
and imitate the example

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our faithful members
of the Governing Body.

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:01.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as members
of the Jerusalem congregation,

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:04.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we at Bethel
have an extraordinary privilege

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a unique opportunity to see the faith

00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and observe the conduct
of our brothers on the Governing Body.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:17.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, by means of JW Broadcasting®,

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:19.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers around the world

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:23.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually see members of the Governing Body,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they hear them speak the Word of God to them,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can observe their conduct.

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:32.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also we have the life stories

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of former members of the Governing Body

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who faithfully served Jehovah for decades

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they received their heavenly reward.

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just remember four of them

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they told us
about ‘how their conduct turned out.’

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is T. J. Sullivan.

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:58.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother Sullivan
faithfully served on the Governing Body

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until his death in 1974.

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his life story
in <i>The Watchtower </i> of August 15, 1965,

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sullivan related 
what happened at Madison Square Garden

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in June of 1939.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford was giving a talk

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a demon-controlled mob
tried to break up that meeting.

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:25.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A number of brothers were falsely arrested.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to his comments:

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brother Rutherford insisted on going

00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:32.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the police station immediately . . .

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:36.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was privileged to drive
along with him on that occasion.

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Driving through
from the Madison Square Garden

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the police station,

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we saw demonstrated
the mad fury of the mob

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the restraining power of our God

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to preserve his people.

00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the police station we had to struggle

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the mob to get in.”

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after assisting the brothers
and on leaving the police station,

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:59.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sullivan added:

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:04.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On our leaving,
the same demonic mob was still outside.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They tried to force their way
into the car and bar its progress.

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:11.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was necessary for some of us
to ride on the running boards

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the crowds
from tearing the doors open.”

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:17.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What courage!

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:22.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What boldness
Brothers Rutherford and Sullivan displayed!

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will we need to display
such courage in the days ahead?

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, let’s remember
Brother George Gangas,

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:32.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another former member
of the Governing Body.

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His life story appeared

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the October 15, 1966, <i>Watchtower.</i>

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:44.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever felt inadequate
for assignments you were given?

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gangas related what happened

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:49.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he gave his first six-minute talk.

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:52.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was gripped with fear
and could hardly finish.

00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he never quit.

00:05:55.038 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also set a wonderful example
in his love for the meetings.

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prayed to God
to not permit him to miss any meetings,

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for 45 years up to that point,
he had not.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“To me, meeting with the brothers

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is one of life’s greatest pleasures

00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and a source of encouragement.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:20.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I love to be at the Kingdom Hall
among the first,

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and leave among the last,
if possible.

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:28.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I feel an inward joy
when talking with God’s people.

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:33.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am among them
I feel at home with my family,

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:35.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a spiritual paradise.”

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gangas
finished his earthly course

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1994 at 98 years old.

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we remember

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:47.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Karl Klein.

00:06:47.723 --> 00:06:49.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He related that on one occasion,

00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford gave him a blunt reproof.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:58.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time he saw Karl,
he cheerily said, “Hello, Karl.”

00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:02.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of still feeling hurt,
Karl just muttered a greeting.

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:05.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Rutherford continued:

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:09.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Karl, watch out! The Devil’s after you!”

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Embarrassed, he replied,

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, there’s nothing, Brother Rutherford.”

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he knew better
and repeated his warning:

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s all right.

00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just watch out. The Devil’s after you.”

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:25.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we should remember
these words of Brother Klein

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:27.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they are Bible-based.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never do we want
to “allow place for the Devil”

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by harboring resentment.

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In January 2001 at the age of 95,

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Karl Klein
faithfully completed his earthly course.

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we remember Brother Dan Sydlik.

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sydlik’s life story appeared
in the June 1, 1985, <i>Watchtower. </i>

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were always encouraged

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Brother Sydlik
would start his morning worship

00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a hearty, “It’s good to be alive

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve the true and loving God, Jehovah.”

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

He wrote:
“Throughout life’s experiences, . . .

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there has been the ever-sustaining power

He added:
“Even at this moment,

00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sheer joy overwhelms me 

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when I read
the psalmist’s words [in Psalm 33]:

00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Happy the nation
that has Jehovah for its God,

Brother Sydlik
finished his earthly course in April 2006

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after having served at Bethel
for nearly 60 years.

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, brothers, we do well to remember

00:08:56.686 --> 00:09:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both the current and former members
of the Governing Body.

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As was the case with the Jewish Christians
to whom Paul wrote,

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too are approaching
the end of a system of things.

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we need to imitate the faith

00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers who take the lead among us.

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will help us endure to the end,

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:22.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether that end is the end of our life now

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the end of this wicked system of things.

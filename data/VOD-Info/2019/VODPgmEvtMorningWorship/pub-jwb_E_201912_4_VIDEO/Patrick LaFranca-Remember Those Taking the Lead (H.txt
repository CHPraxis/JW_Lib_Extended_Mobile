00:00:00 Well, today’s text is a partial quote
00:00:04 of Hebrews 13:7.
00:00:06 Why don’t we read the entire verse,
00:00:09 and then we’ll discuss its importance
00:00:11 to those to whom Paul was writing
00:00:14 but also to us today?
00:00:16 That’s Hebrews 13:7:
00:00:18 “Remember those who are taking
00:00:20 “the lead among you,
00:00:22 “who have spoken the word of God to you,
00:00:25 “and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out,
00:00:29 imitate their faith.”
00:00:33 Now, to whom was Paul writing?
00:00:36 Well, to the Hebrew or Jewish Christians
00:00:38 who belonged to the congregation in Jerusalem.
00:00:43 Was it important for them
00:00:46 to pay attention to those taking the lead?
00:00:49 Well, consider,
00:00:51 Paul wrote this around 61 C.E.,
00:00:55 so that was about five years before Jerusalem
00:00:58 was surrounded by Roman armies
00:01:01 and then later destroyed.
00:01:04 Now, who were taking the lead
00:01:06 in the Jerusalem congregation at that time?
00:01:10 The May 15, 1997, Watchtower,
00:01:14 pages 16 and 17,
00:01:16 explains that it appears that the governing body,
00:01:21 composed of the remaining members of the apostles and older men,
00:01:26 was likely very active in Jerusalem
00:01:30 right up until 66 C.E.
00:01:33 So surely they would be among ‘those taking the lead’
00:01:38 to whom Paul referred.
00:01:41 Now, what things could the brothers remember
00:01:43 about the faith and the conduct of the apostles and older men?
00:01:49 Certainly, they could remember the words
00:01:52 and the example of the apostle Peter.
00:01:55 Though Peter was arrested and beaten,
00:01:58 he, along with the rest of the apostles,
00:02:01 told the authorities:
00:02:04 “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”
00:02:09 And Peter remained active for the rest of his life,
00:02:12 encouraging the brothers.
00:02:14 They could remember the loyalty
00:02:17 and the courage of the apostle James,
00:02:20 who Herod Agrippa I
00:02:23 put to death by the sword in 44 C.E.
00:02:28 Remembering the loyalty and the courage of these brothers
00:02:33 would have been a benefit to the brothers in the congregation,
00:02:37 especially as the end of the Jewish system drew near.
00:02:41 Well, now, how can we apply Paul’s exhortation today?
00:02:46 As the Watchtower  comments mention,
00:02:49 one way is to remember and imitate the example
00:02:52 of our faithful members of the Governing Body.
00:02:56 And just as members of the Jerusalem congregation,
00:03:01 we at Bethel have an extraordinary privilege
00:03:04 and a unique opportunity to see the faith
00:03:08 and observe the conduct of our brothers on the Governing Body.
00:03:13 And today, by means of JW Broadcasting®,
00:03:17 our brothers around the world
00:03:19 actually see members of the Governing Body,
00:03:23 they hear them speak the Word of God to them,
00:03:27 and they can observe their conduct.
00:03:30 And also we have the life stories
00:03:32 of former members of the Governing Body
00:03:35 who faithfully served Jehovah for decades
00:03:39 until they received their heavenly reward.
00:03:42 Let’s just remember four of them
00:03:45 and what they told us about ‘how their conduct turned out.’
00:03:50 The first is T. J. Sullivan.
00:03:54 Now, Brother Sullivan faithfully served on the Governing Body
00:03:58 until his death in 1974.
00:04:02 In his life story in The Watchtower  of August 15, 1965,
00:04:07 Brother Sullivan related  what happened at Madison Square Garden
00:04:11 in June of 1939.
00:04:14 Brother Rutherford was giving a talk
00:04:16 when a demon-controlled mob tried to break up that meeting.
00:04:22 A number of brothers were falsely arrested.
00:04:25 Listen to his comments:
00:04:27 “Brother Rutherford insisted on going
00:04:29 “to the police station immediately . . .
00:04:32 “I was privileged to drive along with him on that occasion.
00:04:36 “Driving through from the Madison Square Garden
00:04:38 “to the police station,
00:04:40 “we saw demonstrated the mad fury of the mob
00:04:43 “and the restraining power of our God
00:04:45 “to preserve his people.
00:04:48 “At the police station we had to struggle
00:04:50 through the mob to get in.”
00:04:52 So after assisting the brothers and on leaving the police station,
00:04:56 Brother Sullivan added:
00:04:59 “On our leaving, the same demonic mob was still outside.
00:05:04 “They tried to force their way into the car and bar its progress.
00:05:07 “It was necessary for some of us to ride on the running boards
00:05:11 to keep the crowds from tearing the doors open.”
00:05:16 What courage!
00:05:17 What boldness Brothers Rutherford and Sullivan displayed!
00:05:22 Will we need to display such courage in the days ahead?
00:05:27 Well, now, let’s remember Brother George Gangas,
00:05:30 another former member of the Governing Body.
00:05:32 His life story appeared
00:05:34 in the October 15, 1966, Watchtower.
00:05:39 Have you ever felt inadequate for assignments you were given?
00:05:44 Brother Gangas related what happened
00:05:46 when he gave his first six-minute talk.
00:05:49 He was gripped with fear and could hardly finish.
00:05:52 But he never quit.
00:05:55 He also set a wonderful example in his love for the meetings.
00:05:59 He prayed to God to not permit him to miss any meetings,
00:06:04 and for 45 years up to that point, he had not.
00:06:08 He said: “To me, meeting with the brothers
00:06:12 “is one of life’s greatest pleasures
00:06:14 “and a source of encouragement.
00:06:17 “I love to be at the Kingdom Hall among the first,
00:06:20 “and leave among the last, if possible.
00:06:23 “I feel an inward joy when talking with God’s people.
00:06:28 “When I am among them I feel at home with my family,
00:06:33 in a spiritual paradise.”
00:06:35 Brother Gangas finished his earthly course
00:06:38 in 1994 at 98 years old.
00:06:43 Next, we remember
00:06:45 Brother Karl Klein.
00:06:47 He related that on one occasion,
00:06:49 Brother Rutherford gave him a blunt reproof.
00:06:53 The next time he saw Karl, he cheerily said, “Hello, Karl.”
00:06:58 But because of still feeling hurt, Karl just muttered a greeting.
00:07:03 Brother Rutherford continued:
00:07:05 “Karl, watch out! The Devil’s after you!”
00:07:09 Embarrassed, he replied,
00:07:11 “Oh, there’s nothing, Brother Rutherford.”
00:07:13 But he knew better and repeated his warning:
00:07:16 “That’s all right.
00:07:17 Just watch out. The Devil’s after you.”
00:07:21 Yes, we should remember these words of Brother Klein
00:07:25 because they are Bible-based.
00:07:27 Never do we want to “allow place for the Devil”
00:07:30 by harboring resentment.
00:07:33 In January 2001 at the age of 95,
00:07:36 Karl Klein faithfully completed his earthly course.
00:07:40 Next, we remember Brother Dan Sydlik.
00:07:44 Brother Sydlik’s life story appeared in the June 1, 1985, Watchtower.
00:07:49 We were always encouraged
00:07:52 when Brother Sydlik would start his morning worship
00:07:55 with a hearty, “It’s good to be alive
00:07:58 to serve the true and loving God, Jehovah.”
00:08:02 His story reveals why Brother Sydlik loved life,
00:08:07 loved God’s people, loved Jehovah.
00:08:10 He wrote: “Throughout life’s experiences, . . .
00:08:13 there has been the ever-sustaining power of God’s friendship.”
00:08:17 He added: “Even at this moment,
00:08:21 “sheer joy overwhelms me
00:08:23 “when I read the psalmist’s words [in Psalm 33]:
00:08:28 “‘Happy the nation that has Jehovah for its God,
00:08:33 “‘the people that he chose as his estate!
00:08:36 “‘. . . Let your friendship be over us, Jehovah,
00:08:40 as we rest our expectations on you.’”
00:08:44 Brother Sydlik finished his earthly course in April 2006
00:08:48 after having served at Bethel for nearly 60 years.
00:08:54 Yes, brothers, we do well to remember
00:08:56 both the current and former members of the Governing Body.
00:09:00 As was the case with the Jewish Christians to whom Paul wrote,
00:09:04 we too are approaching the end of a system of things.
00:09:10 And so we need to imitate the faith
00:09:14 of our brothers who take the lead among us.
00:09:16 And that will help us endure to the end,
00:09:19 whether that end is the end of our life now
00:09:22 or the end of this wicked system of things.

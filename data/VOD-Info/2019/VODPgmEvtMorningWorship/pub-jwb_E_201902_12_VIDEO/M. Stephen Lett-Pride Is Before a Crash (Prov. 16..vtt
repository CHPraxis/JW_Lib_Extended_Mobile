00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.420 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are many reasons

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
why all of us want to cultivate humility,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but what would you say is the foremost reason?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s get the answer from James 4:6

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.066 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the “b” part.

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:21.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“God opposes the haughty ones,

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he gives undeserved kindness

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:27.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the humble ones.”

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we don’t have humility,
Jehovah is going to oppose us.

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:36.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do,
he’s going to give us undeserved kindness.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, that’s the main reason,

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though there are many others,

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to cultivate humility.

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:46.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you know, once humble

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not necessarily mean always humble.

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains many examples
of ones who started out humble,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but somewhere along the way,
they lost their humility.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you probably can think
of modern-day examples

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones who lost their humility.

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in some cases,
perhaps they regained it.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in other cases,
pride proved to be

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their ultimate downfall.

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:13.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now think about this:

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:18.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a case of one who loses his humility,

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:21.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it just happen automatically?

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, isn’t it true that in most cases

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:28.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some situation develops in that person’s life

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that proves to be a catalyst

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:34.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that causes that person to lose his humility?

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:36.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this being the case,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us discuss five situations

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:42.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could develop in our lives

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and test our humility,

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we’re not careful,
cause us to lose it.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
when we receive privileges

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or added responsibilities.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this regard,
let’s think for a moment about Hagar.

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Insight book suggests

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she perhaps became
the maidservant to Sarah

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:09.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during a time of great famine in Egypt.

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in that circumstance,

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:14.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would’ve been
very appreciative, very humble.

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now when she became
the secondary wife of Abraham

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found out she was pregnant,
then what happened?

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Genesis 16:4 says:

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:28.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When she realized that she was pregnant,

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:31.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she began to despise her mistress.”

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:34.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, with her new honored status,

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:36.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she lost her humility;

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appropriately,
Jehovah’s angel gave her some counsel.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angel said:
“Return to your mistress

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humble yourself under her hand.”

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Hagar well illustrates

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a person who has had a good heart

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can lose their humility

00:02:55.358 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon receiving privileges or authority

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an honored position.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s take
the second humility-testing situation:

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we receive success,

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:14.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or achieve success, in some endeavor.

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s think about Uzziah in this regard.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2 Chronicles 26,

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just scan down through verses 3 to 5,

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it shows that he started out very humble.

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He “was 16 years old when he became king,”

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in verse 4, “continued to do
what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.”

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of verse 5:

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During the time he was searching for Jehovah,

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the true God made him prosper.”

00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he started out well; he ruled well.

00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was humble,
and Jehovah blessed him for many years.

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:51.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now look over at verse 16,

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:55.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll notice
that it starts out with the word “however.”

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the Bible uses that word “however,”

00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it means something changed.

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:05.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, as soon as he was strong,

00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:09.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his heart became haughty to his own ruin.”

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:11.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, as you know, 
he even tried to go into the temple

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offer incense.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean,
‘he became strong’?

00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:18.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Insight book explains

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:21.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he
“became famous for his military successes.”

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So apparently these successes,

00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these achievements, went to his head

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point that he thought
he could go into the temple

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and usurp the duties of a priest.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:37.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He forgot that Jehovah
gave him those victories.

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:39.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a lesson for us, isn’t it?

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we happen to achieve
success in some endeavor,

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:47.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we never forget
that the qualities and abilities

00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:50.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enable us to achieve that success

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came from Jehovah.

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s get
our third humility-testing situation:

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re given counsel.

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Uzziah also well illustrates this point.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you still have your Bible
open there, in verses 17 and 18,

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Uzziah went
into the temple to offer the incense,

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you notice that it
describes how ‘Azariah the priest

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:22.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and 80 other [and notice, it calls them]
courageous priests

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went in there after him.’

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They confronted him.

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:28.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tried to give him counsel:
‘You’re out of order.

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:32.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What you’re trying to do,
only priests are to do.

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d better go out of this sanctuary.’

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they tried to give him counsel,
didn’t they?

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did Uzziah react?

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:44.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, verse 19 tells us

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he “became enraged” at them.

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:50.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m the king.’

00:05:52.402 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His pride became even bigger,

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah struck him with leprosy.

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about this:
Jehovah didn’t strike him

00:06:01.477 --> 00:06:04.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he presumptuously first went
into the temple.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But only when he
pridefully rejected the counsel,

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah struck him.

00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a good lesson for us, isn’t it?

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:16.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to be very careful
that we never become prideful

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we receive counsel.

00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:21.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And especially do we have to be on guard

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we think we have
more authority, perhaps more experience,

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or more seniority
than the one giving us the counsel.

00:06:29.038 --> 00:06:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s get our fourth humility-testing situation:

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we happen to come into material prosperity.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we get an inheritance,
or somehow we come into material prosperity.

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened to the Israelites

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they entered
the “land flowing with milk and honey”?

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:53.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible tells us,
and Jehovah is speaking at Hosea 13:6.

00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says:
“They were satisfied with their pastures,

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:58.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they were satisfied

00:06:58.534 --> 00:07:02.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and their heart became proud.

00:07:02.038 --> 00:07:04.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they forgot me.”

00:07:04.407 --> 00:07:06.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a sobering lesson, isn’t it?

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we happen to come into material prosperity,

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we never want to allow that situation

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:15.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause us to lose our humility

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter what our material situation.

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:23.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we
must always humbly depend upon Jehovah

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not material things.

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:31.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s get our fifth, 
our last one, humility-testing situation

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:36.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and it was talked about earlier
by one of our commenters):

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:38.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we receive praise.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall the account in Acts chapter 12

00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Herod put on his royal raiment,

00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:48.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sat down on the judgment seat,

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:51.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he began to give a public discourse,

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the people shouted:

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A god’s voice, and not a man’s [voice]”?

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened?

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:02.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An angel struck him dead;

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he died; worms ate him up.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he didn’t give glory to Jehovah.

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In stark contrast,
think about the account in Luke 18

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a ruler came up to Jesus
and called him “Good Teacher,”

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:22.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus said:
“Why do you call me good?

00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:25.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is good except one, God.”

00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can learn
from those examples, can’t we?

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:32.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we receive praise,
there are two ways we can react:

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Herod,
try to take the credit for ourselves;

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or like Jesus,
we can give the credit to Jehovah.

00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:44.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do that in words
or at least in our heart.

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:48.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Proverbs 27:21 says:

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A person is tested by the praise he receives.”

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:56.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one way he’s tested
is when his humility is tested.

00:08:56.052 --> 00:08:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Watchtower some years ago said this:

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praise [will] show the quality of a man’s heart.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:05.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wise men do not seek praise

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor are they puffed up by it.

00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Vain men seek it
and weak men are inflated by it.

00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If one can bear praise without injury,

00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:21.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“remembering that anything
and everything he has is actually from God,

00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one is sterling in the eyes of Jehovah.”

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there we have five situations

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can test our humility

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, if we’re not careful,
cause us to lose it.

00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have them?

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:41.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) When we receive
privileges or added responsibility,

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:45.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) when we achieve
success in some endeavor,

00:09:45.701 --> 00:09:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) when we receive counsel,

00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:53.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(4) if we happen to come
into material prosperity,

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (5) when we’re praised.

00:09:56.946 --> 00:10:01.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can probably think
of other situations that can test our humility.

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:05.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is,
If we meet these tests successfully

00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep our humility,
with Jehovah’s help,

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:13.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah will never oppose us.

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:16.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather,
we will continue to receive

00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undeserved kindness 
from his generous hand.

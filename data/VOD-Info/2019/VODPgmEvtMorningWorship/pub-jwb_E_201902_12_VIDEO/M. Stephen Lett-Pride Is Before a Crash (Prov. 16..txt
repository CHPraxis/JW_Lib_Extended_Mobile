00:00:01 Now, there are many reasons
00:00:03 why all of us want to cultivate humility,
00:00:06 but what would you say is the foremost reason?
00:00:10 Well, let’s get the answer from James 4:6
00:00:14 —the “b” part.
00:00:16 It says: “God opposes the haughty ones,
00:00:21 “but he gives undeserved kindness
00:00:25 to the humble ones.”
00:00:27 So if we don’t have humility, Jehovah is going to oppose us.
00:00:32 If we do, he’s going to give us undeserved kindness.
00:00:36 Obviously, that’s the main reason,
00:00:39 even though there are many others,
00:00:41 we want to cultivate humility.
00:00:43 But as you know, once humble
00:00:46 does not necessarily mean always humble.
00:00:49 The Bible contains many examples of ones who started out humble,
00:00:53 but somewhere along the way, they lost their humility.
00:00:57 And you probably can think of modern-day examples
00:01:00 of ones who lost their humility.
00:01:03 Now, in some cases, perhaps they regained it.
00:01:06 But in other cases, pride proved to be
00:01:09 their ultimate downfall.
00:01:11 But now think about this:
00:01:13 In a case of one who loses his humility,
00:01:18 does it just happen automatically?
00:01:21 Well, isn’t it true that in most cases
00:01:24 some situation develops in that person’s life
00:01:28 that proves to be a catalyst
00:01:30 that causes that person to lose his humility?
00:01:34 So this being the case,
00:01:36 let us discuss five situations
00:01:39 that could develop in our lives
00:01:42 and test our humility,
00:01:44 and if we’re not careful, cause us to lose it.
00:01:47 Number one: when we receive privileges
00:01:51 or added responsibilities.
00:01:54 In this regard, let’s think for a moment about Hagar.
00:01:58 Now, the Insight book suggests
00:02:01 that she perhaps became the maidservant to Sarah
00:02:05 during a time of great famine in Egypt.
00:02:09 So in that circumstance,
00:02:11 she would’ve been very appreciative, very humble.
00:02:14 But now when she became the secondary wife of Abraham
00:02:18 and found out she was pregnant, then what happened?
00:02:22 Well, Genesis 16:4 says:
00:02:24 “When she realized that she was pregnant,
00:02:28 she began to despise her mistress.”
00:02:31 Yes, with her new honored status,
00:02:34 she lost her humility;
00:02:36 and appropriately, Jehovah’s angel gave her some counsel.
00:02:40 The angel said: “Return to your mistress
00:02:43 and humble yourself under her hand.”
00:02:47 Well, Hagar well illustrates
00:02:50 that a person who has had a good heart
00:02:53 can lose their humility
00:02:55 upon receiving privileges or authority
00:03:00 —an honored position.
00:03:02 But now let’s take the second humility-testing situation:
00:03:06 when we receive success,
00:03:10 or achieve success, in some endeavor.
00:03:14 Now, let’s think about Uzziah in this regard.
00:03:16 In 2 Chronicles 26,
00:03:19 if you just scan down through verses 3 to 5,
00:03:22 it shows that he started out very humble.
00:03:25 He “was 16 years old when he became king,”
00:03:28 and in verse 4, “continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.”
00:03:32 At the end of verse 5:
00:03:34 “During the time he was searching for Jehovah,
00:03:37 the true God made him prosper.”
00:03:40 So he started out well; he ruled well.
00:03:43 He was humble, and Jehovah blessed him for many years.
00:03:48 But now look over at verse 16,
00:03:51 and you’ll notice that it starts out with the word “however.”
00:03:55 And when the Bible uses that word “however,”
00:03:58 it means something changed.
00:04:00 “However, as soon as he was strong,
00:04:05 his heart became haughty to his own ruin.”
00:04:09 And then, as you know,  he even tried to go into the temple
00:04:11 and offer incense.
00:04:13 Now, what does that mean, ‘he became strong’?
00:04:16 Well, the Insight book explains
00:04:18 that he “became famous for his military successes.”
00:04:21 So apparently these successes,
00:04:25 these achievements, went to his head
00:04:28 to the point that he thought he could go into the temple
00:04:30 and usurp the duties of a priest.
00:04:33 He forgot that Jehovah gave him those victories.
00:04:37 Now, that’s a lesson for us, isn’t it?
00:04:39 If we happen to achieve success in some endeavor,
00:04:42 may we never forget that the qualities and abilities
00:04:47 that enable us to achieve that success
00:04:50 came from Jehovah.
00:04:52 But now let’s get our third humility-testing situation:
00:04:56 when we’re given counsel.
00:04:59 Now, Uzziah also well illustrates this point.
00:05:03 If you still have your Bible open there, in verses 17 and 18,
00:05:08 when Uzziah went into the temple to offer the incense,
00:05:12 you notice that it describes how ‘Azariah the priest
00:05:17 ‘and 80 other [and notice, it calls them] courageous priests
00:05:22 went in there after him.’
00:05:24 They confronted him.
00:05:26 They tried to give him counsel: ‘You’re out of order.
00:05:28 ‘What you’re trying to do, only priests are to do.
00:05:32 You’d better go out of this sanctuary.’
00:05:35 Well, they tried to give him counsel, didn’t they?
00:05:38 But how did Uzziah react?
00:05:41 Well, verse 19 tells us
00:05:44 that he “became enraged” at them.
00:05:47 ‘Who are you to tell me what to do?
00:05:50 I’m the king.’
00:05:52 His pride became even bigger,
00:05:55 and Jehovah struck him with leprosy.
00:05:58 Now think about this: Jehovah didn’t strike him
00:06:01 when he presumptuously first went into the temple.
00:06:04 But only when he pridefully rejected the counsel,
00:06:08 then Jehovah struck him.
00:06:11 Now, that’s a good lesson for us, isn’t it?
00:06:13 We have to be very careful that we never become prideful
00:06:16 when we receive counsel.
00:06:18 And especially do we have to be on guard
00:06:21 if we think we have more authority, perhaps more experience,
00:06:25 or more seniority than the one giving us the counsel.
00:06:29 Let’s get our fourth humility-testing situation:
00:06:33 if we happen to come into material prosperity.
00:06:37 Maybe we get an inheritance, or somehow we come into material prosperity.
00:06:42 Well, what happened to the Israelites
00:06:45 when they entered the “land flowing with milk and honey”?
00:06:48 Well, the Bible tells us, and Jehovah is speaking at Hosea 13:6.
00:06:53 Jehovah says: “They were satisfied with their pastures,
00:06:56 “they were satisfied
00:06:58 “and their heart became proud.
00:07:02 And so they forgot me.”
00:07:04 Well, that’s a sobering lesson, isn’t it?
00:07:06 If we happen to come into material prosperity,
00:07:09 we never want to allow that situation
00:07:13 to cause us to lose our humility
00:07:15 —no matter what our material situation.
00:07:18 Then we must always humbly depend upon Jehovah
00:07:23 and not material things.
00:07:26 Well, let’s get our fifth,  our last one, humility-testing situation
00:07:32 (and it was talked about earlier by one of our commenters):
00:07:36 when we receive praise.
00:07:38 Do you recall the account in Acts chapter 12
00:07:41 when Herod put on his royal raiment,
00:07:45 he sat down on the judgment seat,
00:07:48 he began to give a public discourse,
00:07:51 and the people shouted:
00:07:53 “A god’s voice, and not a man’s [voice]”?
00:07:58 Well, what happened?
00:08:00 An angel struck him dead;
00:08:02 he died; worms ate him up.
00:08:05 Why?
00:08:07 Because he didn’t give glory to Jehovah.
00:08:10 In stark contrast, think about the account in Luke 18
00:08:14 when a ruler came up to Jesus and called him “Good Teacher,”
00:08:18 and Jesus said: “Why do you call me good?
00:08:22 Nobody is good except one, God.”
00:08:25 Well, we can learn from those examples, can’t we?
00:08:28 When we receive praise, there are two ways we can react:
00:08:32 Like Herod, try to take the credit for ourselves;
00:08:36 or like Jesus, we can give the credit to Jehovah.
00:08:40 We can do that in words or at least in our heart.
00:08:44 Now, Proverbs 27:21 says:
00:08:48 “A person is tested by the praise he receives.”
00:08:52 And one way he’s tested is when his humility is tested.
00:08:56 The Watchtower some years ago said this:
00:08:58 “Praise [will] show the quality of a man’s heart.
00:09:02 “Wise men do not seek praise
00:09:05 “nor are they puffed up by it.
00:09:08 “Vain men seek it and weak men are inflated by it.
00:09:13 “If one can bear praise without injury,
00:09:16 “remembering that anything and everything he has is actually from God,
00:09:21 that one is sterling in the eyes of Jehovah.”
00:09:26 Well, there we have five situations
00:09:28 that can test our humility
00:09:30 and, if we’re not careful, cause us to lose it.
00:09:34 Do you have them?
00:09:36 (1) When we receive privileges or added responsibility,
00:09:41 (2) when we achieve success in some endeavor,
00:09:45 (3) when we receive counsel,
00:09:49 (4) if we happen to come into material prosperity,
00:09:53 and (5) when we’re praised.
00:09:56 But you can probably think of other situations that can test our humility.
00:10:01 The point is, If we meet these tests successfully
00:10:05 and keep our humility, with Jehovah’s help,
00:10:09 then Jehovah will never oppose us.
00:10:13 Rather, we will continue to receive
00:10:16 undeserved kindness  from his generous hand.

00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:05.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, the God of love, hates.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:06.856 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s quite a statement, isn’t it?

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:08.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How can that be?

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:11.127 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at the first part of today’s text

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:13.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 97:10:

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:18.268 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.”

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our God expects us
to “hate what is bad” because he does that.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the reason for this is explained
in the first two verses of Psalm 97.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:31.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 1 begins:
“Jehovah has become King!”

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 2 concludes:
“Righteousness and justice

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:38.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the foundation of his throne.”

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the Scriptures,
righteousness refers to what is right

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to God’s standard of right and wrong.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here are
just a few examples in the Bible

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the things that Jehovah
says are wrong and that he hates.

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 11:5 it says:

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:59.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Jehovah] hates anyone who loves violence.”

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Isaiah 61:8 it says:

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:05.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, . . .
hate robbery and unrighteousness.”

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Malachi 2:16 it states:

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I hate divorce,’ says Jehovah.”

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:16.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The context is talking
about treacherous, unscriptural divorce.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:18.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there’s Proverbs chapter 6,

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:20.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s turn in our Bibles to that.

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:25.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs the 6th chapter starting with verse 16:

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are six things that Jehovah hates;

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, seven things that he detests:

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,

00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and hands that shed innocent blood,

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a heart plotting wicked schemes,

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:42.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and feet that run quickly to evil,

00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:45.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a false witness who lies with every breath,

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anyone
sowing contentions among brothers.”

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, 
the God of love hates,

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so does Jesus.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what was said of God’s Son

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews 1:9.

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:04.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 1:9:

00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:08.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You loved righteousness,
and you hated lawlessness.

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:10.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why God, your God,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“anointed you with the oil of exultation

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than your companions.”

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:18.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we desire Jehovah’s blessing,

00:02:18.488 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we also must hate what is bad

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, have an intense aversion,

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:28.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a strong abhorrence for what God hates.

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And having that godly hate
serves as a powerful protection for us

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:36.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to get involved in any bad practices.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But exactly what do these include?

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we just read in Proverbs

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:44.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven categories of hateful things.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:48.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re basic,
but they cover virtually all types of wrongs.

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haughty eyes and wicked schemes 
are sins committed in thought.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lying tongue
and a false witness are sinful words.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hands that shed blood
and feet that run to evil

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:05.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and someone who produces
contentions among brothers

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—why, those are all wicked deeds.

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:10.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And interestingly, the writer,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he increased the number
of things Jehovah hates from six to seven

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that suggests that this list
is not intended to be complete,

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:23.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because humans keep thinking up bad things.

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:27.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as an example,
consider the escalating trend toward the use

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of more and more explicit sex
and graphic violence

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that appear today
in advertising and entertainment

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from clothing ads to movies.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now how much of that can we be exposed to

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:45.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before it affects us mentally and morally?

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me think of the five-second rule.

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:49.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever heard of that?

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the so-called rule
that some people say applies

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to food that’s dropped on the floor.

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That it’s OK to eat it
if you pick it up in five seconds or less

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because bacteria
won’t have time to contaminate it.

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that really true?

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:09.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not according to research
done last year at Rutgers University.

00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:13.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was concluded that no matter how fast
you pick up food that falls on the floor,

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will pick up bacteria with it

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sometimes in less than one second.

00:04:18.908 --> 00:04:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
the longer the food sits on the floor,

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more bacteria it collects.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you eat food dropped on the floor,

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re taking a chance
no matter how long it sat there.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you should know
that a clean-looking floor

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not necessarily clean.

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:39.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if food falls on the floor,
when in doubt, throw it out.

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:46.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does this relate to our discussion
of hating the things that Jehovah hates?

00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how long does it take
for an immoral, violent, or satanic image

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:54.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to burn a thought into our mind?

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something we see 
on a billboard, in a magazine,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on television, at a movie, on the Internet

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Is there a five-second rule
for this sort of thing?

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we think
that as long as we look at it only briefly,

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will not contaminate us?

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s use five seconds as an example

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how long that is,
and you can judge for yourselves.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t take your eyes off the screen.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:30.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, do you think at lunch today
you’ll be able to remember that picture,

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a delicious looking chocolate ice-cream sundae

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with syrup and a cherry on top?

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, don’t expect to see it on the lunch line.

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s try four seconds.

00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about this image?

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:54.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will this cute baby’s face come back
to your mind tomorrow? next week?

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, watch the screen for three seconds.

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will this image stick in your mind?

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:06.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next month, next year,

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:10.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think you
will be able to remember Jesus on a white horse,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
riding off to the battle of Armageddon?

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you saw each picture
for only a few seconds,

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet scientists say the human brain

00:06:19.495 --> 00:06:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can process images in even less time

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in a split second, in the blink of an eye.

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So think how much processing our brain can do

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:33.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in several seconds or minutes or longer.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:37.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the pictures we just looked at
were all wholesome images.

00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if there had been
a pornographic picture from the Internet?

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sexually explicit
or graphically violent scene from a movie?

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some spiritistic gore in a video game?

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we gaze at something that Jehovah hates,

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re taking a chance
—no matter how long we look at it—

00:06:56.032 --> 00:06:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that graphic image
can come back to mind

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again and again to haunt us.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we may not be able to avoid
all of this 100 percent

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:08.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the wicked world that surrounds us,

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we certainly don’t have to linger
in looking at these things,

00:07:11.948 --> 00:07:14.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we do not want to seek them out.

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:19.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to realize
that what we might think is a clean movie

00:07:19.288 --> 00:07:21.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not necessarily clean.

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:24.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like food that has fallen on the floor,

00:07:24.627 --> 00:07:27.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when in doubt, we throw it out.

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:31.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to detest
the immorality, the violence,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spiritistic practices of Satan’s world.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, hate every practice

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:39.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that violates Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, even if we hate what is bad,

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may struggle because we live
in a world that caters to the flesh,

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have our own sinful nature to control.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:55.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we develop
the needed hatred for what is bad?

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we strengthen our desire

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to please Jehovah in everything we do.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we meditate on what it is that he loves

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what it is that he hates.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, we convince ourselves
of the badness of the things that he hates

to help us strengthen our powers of self-control.

“He is guarding

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:42.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and] he rescues them
from the hand of the wicked.”

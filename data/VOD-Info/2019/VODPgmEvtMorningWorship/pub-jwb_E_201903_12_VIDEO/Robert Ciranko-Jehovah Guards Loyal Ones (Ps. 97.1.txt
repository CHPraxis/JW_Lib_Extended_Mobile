00:00:01 Jehovah, the God of love, hates.
00:00:05 That’s quite a statement, isn’t it?
00:00:06 How can that be?
00:00:08 Well, look at the first part of today’s text
00:00:11 at Psalm 97:10:
00:00:13 “O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.”
00:00:18 Our God expects us to “hate what is bad” because he does that.
00:00:23 And the reason for this is explained in the first two verses of Psalm 97.
00:00:27 Verse 1 begins: “Jehovah has become King!”
00:00:31 Verse 2 concludes: “Righteousness and justice
00:00:35 are the foundation of his throne.”
00:00:38 And in the Scriptures, righteousness refers to what is right
00:00:41 according to God’s standard of right and wrong.
00:00:46 And here are just a few examples in the Bible
00:00:48 of the things that Jehovah says are wrong and that he hates.
00:00:52 At Psalm 11:5 it says:
00:00:55 “[Jehovah] hates anyone who loves violence.”
00:00:59 At Isaiah 61:8 it says:
00:01:01 “I, Jehovah, . . . hate robbery and unrighteousness.”
00:01:05 At Malachi 2:16 it states:
00:01:09 “‘I hate divorce,’ says Jehovah.”
00:01:12 The context is talking about treacherous, unscriptural divorce.
00:01:16 And then there’s Proverbs chapter 6,
00:01:18 let’s turn in our Bibles to that.
00:01:20 Proverbs the 6th chapter starting with verse 16:
00:01:27 “There are six things that Jehovah hates;
00:01:29 “yes, seven things that he detests:
00:01:32 “Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
00:01:35 “and hands that shed innocent blood,
00:01:37 “a heart plotting wicked schemes,
00:01:40 “and feet that run quickly to evil,
00:01:42 “a false witness who lies with every breath,
00:01:45 and anyone sowing contentions among brothers.”
00:01:50 So, yes,  the God of love hates,
00:01:53 and so does Jesus.
00:01:56 Look at what was said of God’s Son
00:01:58 at Hebrews 1:9.
00:02:01 Hebrews 1:9:
00:02:04 “You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness.
00:02:08 “That is why God, your God,
00:02:10 “anointed you with the oil of exultation
00:02:13 more than your companions.”
00:02:15 Well, if we desire Jehovah’s blessing,
00:02:18 then we also must hate what is bad
00:02:21 —that is, have an intense aversion,
00:02:24 a strong abhorrence for what God hates.
00:02:28 And having that godly hate serves as a powerful protection for us
00:02:32 not to get involved in any bad practices.
00:02:36 But exactly what do these include?
00:02:39 Well, we just read in Proverbs
00:02:41 seven categories of hateful things.
00:02:44 They’re basic, but they cover virtually all types of wrongs.
00:02:48 Haughty eyes and wicked schemes  are sins committed in thought.
00:02:53 A lying tongue and a false witness are sinful words.
00:02:57 Hands that shed blood and feet that run to evil
00:03:00 and someone who produces contentions among brothers
00:03:05 —why, those are all wicked deeds.
00:03:08 And interestingly, the writer,
00:03:10 when he increased the number of things Jehovah hates from six to seven
00:03:15 —that suggests that this list is not intended to be complete,
00:03:19 because humans keep thinking up bad things.
00:03:23 And as an example, consider the escalating trend toward the use
00:03:27 of more and more explicit sex and graphic violence
00:03:31 that appear today in advertising and entertainment
00:03:35 —from clothing ads to movies.
00:03:38 Now how much of that can we be exposed to
00:03:41 before it affects us mentally and morally?
00:03:45 It makes me think of the five-second rule.
00:03:47 Have you ever heard of that?
00:03:49 It’s the so-called rule that some people say applies
00:03:52 to food that’s dropped on the floor.
00:03:54 That it’s OK to eat it if you pick it up in five seconds or less
00:03:58 because bacteria won’t have time to contaminate it.
00:04:02 But is that really true?
00:04:04 Not according to research done last year at Rutgers University.
00:04:09 It was concluded that no matter how fast you pick up food that falls on the floor,
00:04:13 you will pick up bacteria with it
00:04:15 —sometimes in less than one second.
00:04:18 Of course, the longer the food sits on the floor,
00:04:21 the more bacteria it collects.
00:04:24 So if you eat food dropped on the floor,
00:04:26 you’re taking a chance no matter how long it sat there.
00:04:30 And you should know that a clean-looking floor
00:04:32 is not necessarily clean.
00:04:35 So if food falls on the floor, when in doubt, throw it out.
00:04:41 But how does this relate to our discussion of hating the things that Jehovah hates?
00:04:46 Well, how long does it take for an immoral, violent, or satanic image
00:04:50 to burn a thought into our mind?
00:04:54 Something we see  on a billboard, in a magazine,
00:04:57 on television, at a movie, on the Internet
00:05:00 —Is there a five-second rule for this sort of thing?
00:05:03 Should we think that as long as we look at it only briefly,
00:05:07 it will not contaminate us?
00:05:09 Well, let’s use five seconds as an example
00:05:12 and see how long that is, and you can judge for yourselves.
00:05:16 Don’t take your eyes off the screen.
00:05:26 Now, do you think at lunch today you’ll be able to remember that picture,
00:05:30 a delicious looking chocolate ice-cream sundae
00:05:33 with syrup and a cherry on top?
00:05:35 Well, don’t expect to see it on the lunch line.
00:05:39 Now, let’s try four seconds.
00:05:41 What about this image?
00:05:49 Will this cute baby’s face come back to your mind tomorrow? next week?
00:05:54 Now, watch the screen for three seconds.
00:05:56 Will this image stick in your mind?
00:06:04 Next month, next year,
00:06:06 do you think you will be able to remember Jesus on a white horse,
00:06:10 riding off to the battle of Armageddon?
00:06:13 Now, you saw each picture for only a few seconds,
00:06:17 and yet scientists say the human brain
00:06:19 can process images in even less time
00:06:22 —in a split second, in the blink of an eye.
00:06:26 So think how much processing our brain can do
00:06:29 in several seconds or minutes or longer.
00:06:33 Now, the pictures we just looked at were all wholesome images.
00:06:37 But what if there had been a pornographic picture from the Internet?
00:06:41 a sexually explicit or graphically violent scene from a movie?
00:06:46 or some spiritistic gore in a video game?
00:06:50 If we gaze at something that Jehovah hates,
00:06:52 we’re taking a chance —no matter how long we look at it—
00:06:56 and that graphic image can come back to mind
00:06:59 again and again to haunt us.
00:07:01 Now, we may not be able to avoid all of this 100 percent
00:07:05 because of the wicked world that surrounds us,
00:07:08 but we certainly don’t have to linger in looking at these things,
00:07:11 and we do not want to seek them out.
00:07:14 And we need to realize that what we might think is a clean movie
00:07:19 is not necessarily clean.
00:07:21 So like food that has fallen on the floor,
00:07:24 when in doubt, we throw it out.
00:07:27 So we need to detest the immorality, the violence,
00:07:31 the spiritistic practices of Satan’s world.
00:07:33 In other words, hate every practice
00:07:36 that violates Jehovah’s righteous standards.
00:07:39 Now, even if we hate what is bad,
00:07:42 we may struggle because we live in a world that caters to the flesh,
00:07:46 and we have our own sinful nature to control.
00:07:50 So how do we develop the needed hatred for what is bad?
00:07:55 First, we strengthen our desire
00:07:57 to please Jehovah in everything we do.
00:08:01 Then, we meditate on what it is that he loves
00:08:05 and what it is that he hates.
00:08:07 And finally, we convince ourselves of the badness of the things that he hates
00:08:11 by considering how disgusting the results are
00:08:15 for those who practice them.
00:08:18 And one more thing, if we struggle with this,
00:08:21 then we pray earnestly to Jehovah
00:08:23 to help us strengthen our powers of self-control.
00:08:28 Well, you can be sure that as our day’s text, Psalm 97:10,
00:08:32 says of those who imitate Jehovah and hate what is bad:
00:08:35 “He is guarding the lives of his loyal ones,
00:08:38 [and] he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.”

Philippians 2:3:

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“With humility consider others superior to you.”

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
These words, penned by the apostle Paul,

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.730 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
really reflect a message that Jesus

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.732 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
tried again and again

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get across to his apostles.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s look
at one account at Mark 10:42, 43

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mark 10:42.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But Jesus
called them to him and said to them:

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You know that those who appear
to be ruling the nations lord it over them

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and their great ones
wield authority over them.

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This must not be the way among you;

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but whoever wants to be great among you

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must be your minister.’”

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With humility consider others superior to you.”

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why was Jesus so concerned

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his disciples learn this lesson of humility?

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jesus knew that a lack of humility

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:05.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is contrary to Jehovah’s personality.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:08.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t have humility,
Jehovah’s holy spirit cannot flow.

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 138:6 says that Jehovah

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only knows the haughty “from a distance.”

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus also knew that lack of humility

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disrupts the peace of God’s people.

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without peace,
Jehovah’s spirit cannot flow either.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may think of 1 Corinthians 14:33

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that says that Jehovah “is a God . . . of peace.”

00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s of interest as we look at the accounts

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus recognized
that when his disciples lost their peace

00:01:37.547 --> 00:01:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when they were arguing,
when they were bickering among themselves—

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was because they were not applying
the principle in today’s text.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at another account.

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:51.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look back a page to Mark 9:33,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “And they came into Capernaum.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now when he was inside the house,
he put the question to them:

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What were you arguing about on the road?’”

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What were you arguing about?”

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at verse 34, they were quiet

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were arguing
about who was greater.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about this:
These were grown men.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really think
they were walking down the road saying,

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I’m greater than you are’;
‘no, I’m greater’; ‘no, I’m the greatest there is’?

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, but maybe not.
These were grown, mature men.

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:28.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus, in his wisdom of human nature
and being able to read hearts,

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew what they were arguing about
—the root of it.

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The topic didn’t matter.

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:36.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The real issue was that it was a lack of humility.

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:39.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what he says in verse 35.

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “So he sat down
and called the Twelve and said to them:

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:45.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If anyone wants to be first,

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he must be last of all and minister of all.’”

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:50.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have humility.

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider others superior to you.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 9:46, 47,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there was a dispute, that account says

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:02.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Jesus, knowing
the reasoning of their hearts,”

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
counseled them on humility.

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw right through the argument
—right through the issue—

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:10.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and isolated the real problem: 
lack of humility.

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you think about it,

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that that’s usually what is

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:20.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind petty arguments, disputes,
or disagreements we may have?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, if Jesus was among us, would he say:

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Come over here.
What were you arguing about in the office?

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were you arguing about in the room?’

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:31.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, whether it’s between marriage mates,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those of us working together here at Bethel,

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bodies of elders, publishers in the congregation,

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s the lesson for us?

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson is that
when there seems to be a lack of peace

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when there seems to be tension or arguing,

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first person we should look at is ourselves.

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I really arguing over who is greater?

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, an account that always comes
to mind when I think about this

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:58.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of Hagar,
Sarah’s Egyptian maidservant.

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you turn back to Genesis chapter 16,

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we’re familiar with this account)

00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah, or Sarai at the time,
was not able to become pregnant.

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hagar became pregnant,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as soon as Hagar became pregnant,
peace went out of the family.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was tension;
there was bickering; there was arguing.

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:19.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things escalated to the point 
of Sarai humiliating Hagar

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and chasing her away into the wilderness.

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:25.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may first read this and say:
‘Oh, poor Hagar, this young pregnant girl.

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarai is just jealous.
Sarai has got the problem.’

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:30.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that the case?

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:32.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t have all the facts of the matter,

00:04:32.255 --> 00:04:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is of interest to note what Jehovah,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his angel, told Hagar
when he met up with her in the wilderness.

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:41.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Genesis 16:9.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Jehovah’s angel then said to her:

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Return to your mistress

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:51.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humble yourself under her hand.’”

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:55.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Go back, and be humble;
and everything will be OK.’

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did you notice 
what may have been the obstacle to peace?

00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in verse 4—
Chapter 16, verse 4 says

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Hagar “began to despise her mistress”

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she, Hagar, 
found out that she was pregnant.

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:08.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Byington translation says

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:12.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Hagar began to ‘look down on her mistress.’

00:05:12.128 --> 00:05:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hagar began to feel that she was superior.

00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:15.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened?

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:17.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Sarah chased her away.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hagar reacted, and perhaps Sarah reacted.

00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps Sarah did not react well either.

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you notice who Jehovah held responsible
for the lack of peace in the family?

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hagar.

00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You go back 
and humble yourself under her hand.’

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And see, that’s a good account
that reminds us that sometimes

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the real underlying challenge
to peace may be me.

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, peace may have gone away
because of how people are reacting to me.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps I’m telegraphing
that I think my ways, my ideas,

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my way of doing things
are superior to others.

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is it so important
that we fight this imperfect tendency

00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we all have toward pride,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward lacking humility,
and feelings of superiority?

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, not only is it distasteful to Jehovah but,

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:07.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we’ve talked about, lack of humility

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disrupts the peace of God’s people.

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:14.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without peace, Jehovah’s spirit cannot flow.

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without Jehovah’s spirit, we’re on our own.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re on our own, we’re going to fail.

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:23.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a powerful quote
in the Kingdom Rules! book

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on page 120 in paragraph 9.

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we have it written
on one of the whiteboards in our office

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to remind us of this point.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says this: “Any structure of order

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:37.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that does not have peace as its foundation

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will sooner or later collapse.

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:45.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, godly peace
promotes the kind of order that lasts.”

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Powerful point, isn’t it?

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Any structure of order
that does not have peace as its foundation

00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will sooner or later collapse.”

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:57.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And see, that applies in the congregation,

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a family, in our department at Bethel,

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a construction site, wherever we are.

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:05.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know in our work,

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how challenging
or how complicated things get,

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:13.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what we’re dealing with,
the only time we really start to worry

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when we find that peace has gone away.

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe there’s tension
between ones in the office;

00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:20.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe there’s tension between
our department and another department.

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when we worry,
and we start working quickly

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:24.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what we can do to restore peace.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because when peace is present—

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:30.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how challenging
or how hard the topic is, it’s just work.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why we’re here: We love to work.

00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when peace is disturbed,
that’s when we’re in trouble.

00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how important is it to Jehovah
that we consider others superior to us?

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:44.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important is it to Jehovah
that we maintain peace?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does he feel about that?

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at a scripture at Psalm 35:27.

00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:59.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 35:27 says:

00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:04.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let those who take pleasure
in my righteousness shout joyfully;

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“may they constantly say:
‘May Jehovah be magnified,

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who takes pleasure
in the peace of his servant.’”

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah takes pleasure
in the peace of his servants.

00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:20.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes pleasure
when he sees us working together

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in unity and in peace,

00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that takes humility.

00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:30.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we work hard
to always apply the principle in today’s text.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider others superior to us.

00:08:34.363 --> 00:08:36.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we work hard
to maintain the peace

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all of us all around us,

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:42.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may Jehovah never have to say of us,

00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What were you arguing about on the road?’

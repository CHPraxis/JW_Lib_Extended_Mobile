The human voice
is a marvelous instrument,

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capable of great variety.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we vary our
volume, pitch, and pace

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to convey ideas clearly
and stir emotion,

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re using modulation.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is modulation
important when speaking?

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the same reason it’s important
when playing a musical instrument.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would music
sound without modulation?

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not very appealing, is it?

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s vary the volume.

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s also add changes in pace.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s add variations in pitch.

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the musician varied the volume,

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pace, and pitch,

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the result was something
pleasurable to listen to.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate the importance
of doing this when we speak,

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s listen as a speaker
presents fine information

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with little modulation.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After 40 years
of wandering in the wilderness,

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites are
on the verge of a momentous change.

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re about to take possession
of the Promised Land.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tents will be replaced by houses.

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:17.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Manna will be replaced
by meat and vegetables.

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, they will be able to worship Jehovah

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a free and spiritually clean people.

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, challenges awaited them.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Moses say shortly before his death

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:29.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage and prepare them?

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out
by reading Deuteronomy 31:7, 8.

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stopped the speaker
before he read the scripture

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:41.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and finished making the point

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:45.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was difficult to listen to.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch him try again, but this time,

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he varies his volume,

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:54.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pitch, and pace.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After 40 years
of wandering in the wilderness,

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites are
on the verge of a momentous change.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re about to take possession
of the Promised Land.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tents will be replaced by houses.

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:13.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Manna will be replaced
by meat and vegetables.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, they’ll be able to worship Jehovah

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a free and spiritually clean people.

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:23.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, challenges awaited them.

00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:27.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would Moses say
shortly before his death

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:31.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage and prepare them?

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out
by reading Deuteronomy 31:7, 8:

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moses then called Joshua and said to him

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:44.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before the eyes of all Israel:

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be courageous and strong,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you are the one
who will bring this people

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:53.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘into the land that Jehovah swore

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to their forefathers to give to them,

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:58.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you will give it
to them as an inheritance.

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:02.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah is the one marching before you,

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and he will continue with you.

00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘He will neither desert you nor abandon you.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:11.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid or be terrified.’”

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was much better, wasn’t it?

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how
the speaker built anticipation

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the scripture
by lowering his volume as he asked:

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:26.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What would Moses say
shortly before his death

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage and prepare them?”

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he increased his volume

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when reading Moses’ exhortation.

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we strive to read
and speak with modulation,

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:43.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll convey the ideas more clearly

00:04:43.387 --> 00:04:47.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stir the emotion of our listeners.

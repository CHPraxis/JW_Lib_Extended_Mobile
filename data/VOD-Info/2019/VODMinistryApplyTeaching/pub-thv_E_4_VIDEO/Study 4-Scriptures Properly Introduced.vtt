00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why give attention to the way you
introduce a scripture?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the promises of God,

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:22.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we find in his written Word,
have tremendous power.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 4:12 says:

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of God is alive and exerts power

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pierces even to the dividing
 of soul and spirit,

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of joints from the marrow,

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is able to discern thoughts
and intentions of the heart.”

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, God’s Word has the power
to reach a person’s heart,

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we should always use it
as the basis for our teaching.

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first,
we should ensure that our listeners

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are properly focused
on those inspired words.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might you do that?

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:03.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indicate what the text will reveal,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cite the Bible as God’s Word,

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say something that will make
the listeners want to read the verse.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following demonstration,

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see if the speaker accomplishes
any of those goals.

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Psalm 55:22.

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we have read this
many times before,

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read it again:

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Throw your burden on Jehovah,
and he will sustain you.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never will he allow
the righteous one to fall.”

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although a Kingdom Hall audience

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will likely turn to a scripture
because you invite them to,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this audience didn’t know why
the scripture was being read,

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor did the speaker give them any reason
to be especially interested in what it says.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might the speaker
properly introduce a Bible verse?

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a few ways to do this.

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, he could ask a question
that the scripture will answer.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch an example of that.

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a problem is so severe

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it seems you can think of nothing else,

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can you do?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is found at Psalm 55:22.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or the speaker could pose a problem
that the scripture will help to solve.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that your marriage mate
or a fellow believer

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:30.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has said or done something hurtful to you.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:34.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us how not to respond

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:17, 18.

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says.

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another good way
to introduce Bible accounts is

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:47.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by stating a principle
that the account will illustrate.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can avoid many problems
by following divine instructions.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:57.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to 2 Samuel 6:2-7

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what happened when David

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t follow the proper procedure

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for transporting the ark of the covenant.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:11.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else must we do
to introduce scriptures properly,

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:14.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when our audience
includes unbelievers?

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cite God’s Word as the authority.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watch the following demonstration,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can discern
how the publisher might improve

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in drawing attention to the scripture.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will crime and wickedness always exist?

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David gives us the answer here
at Psalm 37:10, 11.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publisher aroused interest
in what she was about to read

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:44.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by raising a question,

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:48.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she correctly
identified David as the writer.

00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:52.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it’s not wrong to mention
the name of the Bible writer,

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:57.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this case the householder
might have wondered, ‘Who is David?’

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even if she knew who David was,

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:04.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she might have viewed his words
as an ancient human opinion.

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how the sister
could introduce this scripture

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:11.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that inspires
more confidence in its reliability.

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:15.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will crime and wickedness always exist?

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:18.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word gives us the answer

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at Psalm 37:10, 11.

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:25.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So before reading a scripture,

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:28.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do more than simply tell your audience

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it can be found
and invite them to follow along.

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indicate the key point it will make,

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say something to make
your listeners want to read it.

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:41.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially when speaking to unbelievers,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
introduce the scripture in a way
that indicates its authority.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing these things,
you can prepare the minds of your listeners

00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the important words that you’ll read.

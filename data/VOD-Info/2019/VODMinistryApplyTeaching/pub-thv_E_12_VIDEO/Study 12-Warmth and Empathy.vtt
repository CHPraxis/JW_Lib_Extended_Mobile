The apostle Paul
wrote to Christians in Thessalonica:

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We became gentle in your midst,

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as when a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:31.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only the good news of God
but also our very selves,

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:37.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul cared,

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:41.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his fellow believers could sense
that by the way he spoke to them.

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made his teaching more effective.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, if our audience feels
that we genuinely care for them

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we’re not there simply to deliver
information or fulfill an assignment—

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll be more likely to listen and respond.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we show
genuine warmth and empathy?

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to think about our listeners.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, before going in the ministry,

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on specific problems that people
in the territory are concerned about.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are their beliefs?

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to imagine how they feel.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When preparing a talk,

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remind yourself of what
your brothers and sisters may be facing

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how you can encourage them.

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:31.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then use expressions that refresh,

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comfort, and invigorate your listeners.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful not to speak disparagingly
of people or their beliefs.

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When conversing with older people
or those in authority,

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use words that show respect.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a brother giving a public talk.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do his words show
empathy for his audience?

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The evolution theory is very popular today.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s hard to understand
how intelligent people

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could believe such an illogical theory.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:10.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many believe it simply
because so-called educated people do,

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including many scientists.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we help them
to examine matters for themselves

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how ridiculous evolution is?

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone in the audience
believed in evolution,

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:25.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would he feel?

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the speaker try again

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time with more empathy.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The evolution theory is very popular today.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do many people believe it?

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they were taught evolution in school

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were offered
no other plausible explanation.

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help people 
to examine the facts for themselves?

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:55.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the speaker didn’t insult people
because of their viewpoint.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
he aroused interest in additional facts

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are worthy of consideration.

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:06.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else can indicate warmth and empathy?

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tone—not just what you say

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how you say it.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:15.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A warm tone of voice

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:18.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with appropriate gestures
and facial expressions

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:21.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows sincere interest.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a publisher
in the house-to-house ministry.

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does she show
interest by the way she speaks?

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.
I can’t talk to you today.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just lost my mother, and I’m meeting
with the funeral director this afternoon.

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.
It’s so painful when a loved one dies.

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I lost my mother a few years ago,

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found some Bible verses
to be very comforting.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:52.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there was nothing wrong
with what our sister said,

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:56.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her delivery lacked warmth and empathy.

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:58.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give her a second chance.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:04.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry.
It’s so painful when a loved one dies.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I lost my mother a few years ago,

00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:11.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found some Bible verses
to be very comforting.

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:14.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are in this tract.

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe we can discuss
them briefly another time.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister said exactly the same thing,

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time she spoke with emotion,

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so her words were more effective.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:32.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we speak with genuine emotion,

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:35.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we show our listeners that we care.

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But be careful not to force
or exaggerate emotions.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re reading a scripture,

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to express the feelings
indicated in the passage,

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:48.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but don’t draw undue attention to yourself.

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by thinking about your listeners,

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:56.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
choosing your words carefully,
and showing your interest,

00:04:56.942 --> 00:05:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll refresh, comfort,
and invigorate your listeners.

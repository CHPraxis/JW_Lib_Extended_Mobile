When the apostle Paul was teaching Jews

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the synagogue in Thessalonica,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was accurate and convincing.

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:21.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account at Acts 17:2, 3 says

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“explaining and proving by references

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to rise from the dead.”

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of Paul’s teaching,

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the Jews became Christians.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help us to be accurate

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and convincing when we teach?

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must consult reliable sources,

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use those sources properly,

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reason on the evidence with our audience.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say you’re giving
a public talk about the last days,

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you read
the following quote regarding pestilence

00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the 1996 edition

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of The Encyclopedia
Americana:

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is estimated that more

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than 100 million cases

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of malaria occur each year.

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:09.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In some places,

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nearly the entire population

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is infected.”

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:16.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is The Encyclopedia
Americana

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:18.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a reliable source?

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the source up-to-date?

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When referring to a scientific discovery,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a news report, a person’s experience,

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other information as evidence,

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make sure that your sources are trustworthy

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and up-to-date.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, be sure to use sources properly.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t overstate or exaggerate facts and figures.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we must apply scriptures in harmony

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their context, the Bible’s overall message,

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the publications
of “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:02.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you can identify
a problem in the following scenario.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Babylon the Great is destroyed,

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people will continue to dwell in peace.

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:12.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens next?

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:15.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Ezekiel, chapters 38 and 39,

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find a thrilling prophecy

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding “Gog of the land of Magog.”

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will Gog of Magog do?

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:26.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice chapter 38 verse 11:

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will say:

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:35.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will invade the land of unprotected settlements.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will come against those living in security,

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘without disturbance,

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘all of them living in settlements

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:46.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.’”

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we can see, Gog of Magog,

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which represents Satan the Devil,

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will attack Jehovah’s people.

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, in turn, will provoke a reaction

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think about what this brother said?

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was his explanation of Gog of Magog

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in harmony with our recent publications?

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give him another chance.

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:19.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will come against those living in security,

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:21.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“without disturbance,

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all of them living in settlements

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.”

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Gog of Magog,

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which represents a coalition of nations,

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:35.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will attack Jehovah’s people.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, in turn, will provoke a reaction

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we reason with people on the facts

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re
not only accurate but also convincing?

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in on an informal setting.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So based on that,

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think humans evolved or were created?

00:03:57.424 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think God created simple organisms

00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let them evolve.

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t make any sense.

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s either one or the other.

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:10.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Creation is much more logical.

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:15.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How far will that conversation go?

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t force our view on others,

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can reason with them on the evidence.

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:23.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch another example.

00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:26.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So based on that,

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think humans evolved or were created?

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:30.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both.

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think God created simple organisms

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let them evolve.

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:36.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an interesting view.

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:40.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think
about the remarkable complexity of life,

00:04:40.551 --> 00:04:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find a Bible verse to be helpful.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here at Hebrews 3:4:

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Of course,
every house is constructed by someone,

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:55.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one who constructed all things is God.”

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would not assume
that something like a phone

00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:59.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could come about by chance, right?

00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:01.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!
That wouldn’t make sense.

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:02.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:06.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Complex design
is the product of an intelligent mind.

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:10.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if your listener poses a question

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:12.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you don’t know the answer,

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offer to research the topic and return later.

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:18.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By using trustworthy evidence to help

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:21.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our listeners arrive at the right conclusions,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be able to help them onto the road to life.

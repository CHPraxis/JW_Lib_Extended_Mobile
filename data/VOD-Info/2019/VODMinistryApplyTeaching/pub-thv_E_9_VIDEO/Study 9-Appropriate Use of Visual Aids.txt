00:00:10 How can you make important points of instruction
00:00:13 more vivid as you teach?
00:00:15 Use a visual aid.
00:00:17 That’s what Jehovah did when speaking with Abraham
00:00:20 as recorded at Genesis 15:5.
00:00:23 Jehovah brought Abraham outside and said:
00:00:26 “Look up, please, to the heavens and count the stars.”
00:00:31 Imagine Abraham looking up to the heavens on a clear night
00:00:34 and seeing thousands of stars twinkling like diamonds.
00:00:40 Jehovah then made the point of instruction clear when he said:
00:00:44 “So your offspring will become.”
00:00:47 Abraham understood,
00:00:49 and he remembered Jehovah’s promise for the rest of his life.
00:00:54 Well, how might we use visual aids in our teaching?
00:00:59 We can choose pictures, diagrams, maps, time lines,
00:01:03 or other items to highlight
00:01:05 not minor details but important concepts.
00:01:10 And whether we’re teaching in the field ministry or in the congregation,
00:01:14 we need to make sure that our listeners can “see” the visual aid.
00:01:20 As we watch the following example,
00:01:22 consider whether this use of a visual aid
00:01:25 is appropriate or inappropriate.
00:01:29 Rumors are like this balloon:
00:01:32 full of hot air,
00:01:34 floating through the room.
00:01:37 What should we do with rumors?
00:01:40 Deflate them
00:01:43 before they travel any further.
00:01:47 Was that an appropriate use of a visual aid?
00:01:50 Oh, it’ll be remembered but for all the wrong reasons.
00:01:54 Our objective in using visual aids
00:01:57 is not to shock or entertain the audience.
00:02:00 Let’s give the speaker another chance to make
00:02:03 appropriate use of a visual aid.
00:02:07 Why should we spend time getting to know our brothers and sisters?
00:02:12 Well, we could compare them to this beautiful rock
00:02:15 called a geode.
00:02:17 If we look past the surface imperfections
00:02:22 and take the time to get to know our brothers and sisters,
00:02:26 we may come to know their beautiful inner qualities,
00:02:31 “the secret person of the heart.”
00:02:34 Simple and clear.
00:02:38 Our publications also use visual aids.
00:02:41 How can we make good use of them in the ministry?
00:02:45 Let’s watch a brother conducting a Bible study.
00:02:48 Does he make good use of the artwork?
00:02:52 What will life be like in the coming Paradise?
00:02:55 In order to visualize what we just considered in paragraphs 17-23,
00:02:59 notice the artwork on page 37.
00:03:01 Nice, right?
00:03:03 Let’s move on to paragraph 24.
00:03:06 The publisher briefly called attention to the illustration.
00:03:10 But he could have made better use of it.
00:03:13 While we don’t need to focus on minor details in a picture,
00:03:17 we should try to highlight key aspects of the artwork.
00:03:21 Let’s watch him try again.
00:03:24 What will life be like in the coming Paradise?
00:03:28 In order to visualize what we’ll consider in paragraphs 17-23,
00:03:32 notice the artwork on page 37.
00:03:36 What aspects of this scene are different from life in today’s world?
00:03:40 Everybody is happy.
00:03:42 That’s right.
00:03:43 The whole earth will be a paradise.
00:03:45 What else?
00:03:47 Does anyone in this scene have glasses or a cane?
00:03:51 No.
00:03:52 Sickness and death will be gone too.
00:03:55 What about war and violence?
00:03:57 What do you see in the picture?
00:03:59 Everybody is getting along,
00:04:01 even people of different races.
00:04:03 Exactly!
00:04:05 There will even be peace between humans and the animals.
00:04:09 But you might be thinking,
00:04:11 ‘That’s just too good to be true.’
00:04:14 Well, let’s now consider the verses from the Bible
00:04:16 that provide the basis for this picture.
00:04:19 Would you please read paragraph 17?
00:04:22 In this case,
00:04:24 the publisher used the artwork to preview information to follow.
00:04:30 We can also use the artwork to review key points.
00:04:34 The important thing is for our listeners to remember the point of the visual aid.
00:04:40 Brothers who conduct the Watchtower Study
00:04:42 and the Congregation Bible Study
00:04:45 should make good use of the visual aids that appear in the lesson.
00:04:51 When we select visual aids that enhance our teaching
00:04:54 rather than detract from it, we’ll honor Jehovah
00:04:58 and make important points of instruction memorable to our audience.

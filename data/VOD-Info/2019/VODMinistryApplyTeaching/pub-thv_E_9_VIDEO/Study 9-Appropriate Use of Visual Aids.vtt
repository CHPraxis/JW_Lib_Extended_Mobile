How can you make
important points of instruction

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more vivid as you teach?

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use a visual aid.

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jehovah did
when speaking with Abraham

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:23.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Genesis 15:5.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah brought Abraham outside and said:

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look up, please,
to the heavens and count the stars.”

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Abraham looking up
to the heavens on a clear night

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing thousands of stars
twinkling like diamonds.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah then made
the point of instruction clear when he said:

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So your offspring will become.”

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham understood,

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he remembered
Jehovah’s promise for the rest of his life.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how might we use
visual aids in our teaching?

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can choose pictures,
diagrams, maps, time lines,

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other items to highlight

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not minor details
but important concepts.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whether we’re teaching
in the field ministry or in the congregation,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to make sure
that our listeners can “see” the visual aid.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:22.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we watch the following example,

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider whether this use of a visual aid

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is appropriate or inappropriate.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rumors are like this balloon:

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full of hot air,

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
floating through the room.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we do with rumors?

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:43.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deflate them

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they travel any further.

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that an appropriate use of a visual aid?

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:54.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’ll be remembered
but for all the wrong reasons.

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our objective in using visual aids

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not to shock or entertain the audience.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give the speaker
another chance to make

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appropriate use of a visual aid.

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we spend time
getting to know our brothers and sisters?

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we could compare them
to this beautiful rock

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:17.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called a geode.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look past the surface imperfections

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take the time to get to know
our brothers and sisters,

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may come to know
their beautiful inner qualities,

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the secret person of the heart.”

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:36.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simple and clear.

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:41.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications also use visual aids.

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we make
good use of them in the ministry?

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a brother
conducting a Bible study.

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he make good use of the artwork?

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will life be like
in the coming Paradise?

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:59.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to visualize what we
just considered in paragraphs 17-23,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the artwork on page 37.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice, right?

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:05.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s move on to paragraph 24.

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publisher briefly
called attention to the illustration.

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:13.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he could have made better use of it.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:17.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we don’t need to focus
on minor details in a picture,

00:03:17.593 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should try to highlight
key aspects of the artwork.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch him try again.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will life be like
in the coming Paradise?

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to visualize what we’ll
consider in paragraphs 17-23,

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the artwork on page 37.

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What aspects of this scene
are different from life in today’s world?

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody is happy.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole earth will be a paradise.

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else?

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does anyone in this scene
have glasses or a cane?

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sickness and death will be gone too.

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about war and violence?

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you see in the picture?

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody is getting along,

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:03.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even people of different races.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:09.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will even be peace
between humans and the animals.

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you might be thinking,

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s just too good to be true.’

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s now consider
the verses from the Bible

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that provide the basis for this picture.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you please read paragraph 17?

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publisher used the artwork
to preview information to follow.

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also use the artwork
to review key points.

00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:39.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The important thing is for our listeners
to remember the point of the visual aid.

00:04:40.717 --> 00:04:42.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers who conduct the Watchtower Study

00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:45.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Congregation Bible Study

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:49.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should make good use of the visual aids
that appear in the lesson.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we select visual aids
that enhance our teaching

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:58.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than detract from it,
we’ll honor Jehovah

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make important points of instruction
memorable to our audience.

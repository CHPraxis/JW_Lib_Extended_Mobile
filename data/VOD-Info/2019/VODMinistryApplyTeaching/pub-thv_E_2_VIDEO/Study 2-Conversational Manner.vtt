Speaking in a conversational manner

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means talking in a natural, sincere way

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that conveys how you feel.

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While this might sound simple,

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be a challenge when you’re nervous.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These four steps can help:

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray,

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepare carefully,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak from the heart,

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look at your listeners.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is important when we give talks

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we share in the ministry;

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see why as we watch

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these examples of public witnessing.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take whatever you want.
There’s no charge.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that’s OK.
Maybe another time.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could the brother’s manner
have been more conversational?

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he could have tried
to make eye contact.

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about his posture,
gestures, and facial expressions?

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a better example.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re welcome to take whatever you like.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think
we’ll ever see an end to suffering?

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not really sure.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have just a moment,
I’d like to show you what the Bible has to say.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A friendly manner opened the way
to a conversation.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can also help when we’re giving a talk.

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should try to speak in our own words.

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s observe these examples.

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:55.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was nailed
to the stake in 33 C.E.,

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it hardly looked possible
that he could have a kingdom at all.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in his preaching of the Kingdom of God,

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had not been
a proclaimer of erroneous news.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the third day after his death,
the Founder of the Kingdom made sure

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the disciples of Jesus
would not be offering up prayer

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a government that was not possible.

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:20.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah resurrected the One
who was to represent Him

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:24.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the prayed-for Kingdom
and clothed him with immortality.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you understand
the words of the speaker?

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most likely.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it spiritual food?

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:35.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he using conversational manner?

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not really.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could he have had
more eye contact with his audience?

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the speaker present
the information in his own words.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus preached about God’s Kingdom

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taught his followers to pray for it.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he died in 33 C.E.,

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may have wondered
if the Kingdom really would come.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any doubts they had
were erased three days later

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah resurrected his Son,

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the future King of his Kingdom.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:25.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A natural, sincere delivery
is more appealing.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It holds people’s attention,
puts them at ease,

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes them more receptive
to what you have to say.

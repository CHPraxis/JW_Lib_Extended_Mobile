00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:14.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Illustrations are powerful teaching tools.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They help to explain complex ideas.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also stimulate thinking
and can break down prejudice.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Illustrations stir emotions
and appeal to the heart.

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also memory aids.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no wonder, then,
that Jesus made good use of them.

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three things
that will make your illustrations effective:

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Select simple illustrations,

00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
choose them with your listeners in mind,

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use them to teach the points
that are truly important.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:56.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to the following illustration,
and see if it’s effective.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Furthermore,
the world is passing away and so is its desire,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who does the will of God remains forever.”

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the world is passing away

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and life in this system of things is temporary,

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shouldn’t that affect
how we use our time and energy?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, imagine you’re going
on a seven-day, European cruise.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ports of call are Lisbon, Gibraltar,

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Barcelona, Monte Carlo, Florence, and Rome.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the ship will have many activities,
you’ve chosen an inside cabin.

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:38.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the room is nicely decorated,

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not exactly your taste.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you don’t like
the brightly colored carpet and walls

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are common on many cruise ships.

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the bedspread and curtains
are not what you would’ve chosen.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a refrigerator in the room, but it’s small.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you spend time redecorating the room

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe put down a new carpet,

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paint the room a different color,

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hang new curtains,
or purchase a larger refrigerator?

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your stay is only temporary.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, 
our stay in this system of things is only temporary.

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it make sense
that we would spend time and energy

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our life as comfortable as possible?

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although this illustration made a good point,

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:32.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was it as effective as it could have been?

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it simple?

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, was it necessary for the audience
to know the reason for the trip,

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how long the cruise was,
or the cities where the ship was stopping?

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:44.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These details
actually complicated the illustration.

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:50.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s something else:

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the speaker have his listeners in mind?

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably few
in his audience have taken a cruise,

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it would be hard
for them to identify with the situation.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:05.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore,
the point of the illustration could be lost,

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or their minds
might be diverted to the speaker

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than his message.

00:03:11.962 --> 00:03:16.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might the speaker have illustrated
the same point more effectively?

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch him try again.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Furthermore,
 the world is passing away and so is its desire,

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who does the will of God remains forever.”

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the world is passing away

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our life in this system of things is temporary,

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:40.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shouldn’t that affect
how we use our time and energy?

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:43.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
imagine that you’re visiting relatives

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in another village for a few days.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:47.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They kindly give you a room.

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,
the bed is not as comfortable as yours.

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The walls could use a few more pictures,
and there’s no window.

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you purchase a larger bed for your stay

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some pictures for the walls?

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would you take time to install a window?

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:10.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re only staying a few days.

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might relocate
the chairs and tables and a few simple things

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our surroundings
more comfortable during our temporary stay,

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we would not go to great effort or expense

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to redecorate the entire room.

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:27.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In like manner,

00:04:27.454 --> 00:04:32.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we keep matters simple during
our temporary residency in this old system,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:36.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving our main focus to Kingdom interests.

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:40.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ illustrations were simple.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example:

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Kingdom of the heavens
is like leaven that a woman took

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:49.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and mixed with three large measures of flour

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the whole mass was fermented.”

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just one sentence about baking bread,

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a situation familiar to his audience.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This simplicity
made Jesus’ illustrations appeal to the heart.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:07.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also used illustrations

00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:11.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach main points, not minor details.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So use illustrations selectively.

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were to use an illustration
to teach a minor detail,

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:21.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your audience may remember the illustration

00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:23.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not the point of instruction.

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:26.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you find appropriate illustrations?

00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:28.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be observant.

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the world around you,

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
study our Christian publications,

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:36.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to skilled teachers.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:41.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some experienced teachers
save illustrations in a file to use later.

00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to teach like Jesus,

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:49.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enhance your teaching with simple
illustrations that appeal to your listeners

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that teach main points.

“I’m not interested.”

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:16.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had someone
tell you that in the ministry?

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people may simply want us to go away.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others, however, may end the conversation

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:26.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they can’t see how our message
affects them personally.

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to present information

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help our listeners

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:34.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then show them how to apply
what they just heard.

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, imagine that a natural disaster

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has recently affected part of your territory.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might you include 
this in your presentation?

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch an example.

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.
It’s good to meet you.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad to see that this neighborhood

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wasn’t affected by
the recent heavy rains and mudslide.

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t too bad here, but we did have
a few trees fall behind the house.

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I don’t want
to take a lot of your time.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re calling to talk about hope
for loved ones who’ve died.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think we’ll ever see them again?

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, but I’m not really interested.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What just happened?

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say that the publisher made clear

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the practical value of his information?

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although he mentioned the recent storm,

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he failed to notice
its effect on the householder.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he learned how the householder felt,

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t tailor his presentation
to the man’s needs.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, all of “the good news
of the Kingdom” is valuable,

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some aspects may appeal to people more

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at specific times in their life.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moreover, if we ignore topics
that are on people’s minds,

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:51.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they might think we’re inconsiderate or rude.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the example we just watched,

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Bible account
might have made the person think?

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch again.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My heart goes out to those
who’ve lost their homes

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the recent heavy rains and mudslide.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:08.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too!

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been helping a family member
try to recover some personal belongings.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just happy that no one was hurt.

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a relief, for sure.

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s nice to see the community
coming together to help one another.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that the Bible promises a time
when we’ll no longer experience

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devastation from so-called natural disasters?

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?
What do you mean?

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about the power
Jesus displayed when he lived on the earth.

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says here at Mark 4:39:

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that he got up and rebuked the wind

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and said to the sea: ‘Hush! Be quiet!’

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:48.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the wind abated.”

00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:53.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publisher used a local topic of interest

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Bible account
that the householder could relate to.

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also make practical application
of our material when giving a talk.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when teaching
an audience what to do,

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:08.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be careful not to burden them with guilt.

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:11.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, strengthen their love and faith

00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and express confidence in their good motives.

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re preparing a public talk,

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider the needs of newly interested ones.

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself, ‘How can I help

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘this audience to draw close to Jehovah

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overcome obstacles
that could hinder them from making progress?’

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:32.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a brief excerpt
from a public talk.

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:24, 25 says:

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let us consider one another
so as to incite to love and fine works,

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:47.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not forsaking our meeting together,
as some have the custom,

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:49.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but encouraging one another,

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the more so as you see
the day drawing near.”

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if it’s your custom

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to miss meetings here at the Kingdom Hall,

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:01.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to change.

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:05.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows
when you’re here and when you’re not.

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Armageddon is coming, 

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:10.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you don’t want
to miss out on everlasting life.

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that encouraging?

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it motivating to those attending
their first congregation meeting?

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:24.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the speaker clearly showed
what the audience needed to do,

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:27.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how might he have strengthened 
their motivation?

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:24, 25 says:

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:36.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let us consider one another
 so as to incite

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:39.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to love and fine works,

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:43.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not forsaking our meeting together,
as some have the custom,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but encouraging one another,

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:50.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the more so as you see 
the day drawing near.”

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within these verses we find important reasons

00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:57.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend congregation meetings regularly.

00:04:57.734 --> 00:05:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, we receive encouragement.

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:02.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who doesn’t need that?

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:08.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is true “all the more so” 
since we’re living in critical times

00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah’s day is “drawing near.”

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moreover, attending congregation meetings

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:20.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us the opportunity
to ‘incite others to love and fine works.’

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, even your presence here is motivating.

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:26.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:30.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you’ve shown that no matter
what else is happening in your life,

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:33.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is nothing more important to you

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:38.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than praising and honoring Jehovah
here with the congregation.

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:42.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just seeing you here
fills us with strength.

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:48.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By making the practical value
of our message clear to our listeners,

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:52.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we help them to understand
how the information affects their lives,

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we motivate them to action.

00:00:11 “I’m not interested.”
00:00:13 Have you ever had someone tell you that in the ministry?
00:00:16 Some people may simply want us to go away.
00:00:19 Others, however, may end the conversation
00:00:22 if they can’t see how our message affects them personally.
00:00:26 So we need to present information
00:00:28 that will help our listeners
00:00:30 and then show them how to apply what they just heard.
00:00:34 For instance, imagine that a natural disaster
00:00:37 has recently affected part of your territory.
00:00:40 How might you include  this in your presentation?
00:00:44 Let’s watch an example.
00:00:47 Hello. It’s good to meet you.
00:00:49 I’m glad to see that this neighborhood
00:00:51 wasn’t affected by the recent heavy rains and mudslide.
00:00:54 Yeah.
00:00:55 It wasn’t too bad here, but we did have a few trees fall behind the house.
00:00:58 Well, I don’t want to take a lot of your time.
00:01:01 We’re calling to talk about hope for loved ones who’ve died.
00:01:04 Do you think we’ll ever see them again?
00:01:06 Thanks, but I’m not really interested.
00:01:09 What just happened?
00:01:12 Would you say that the publisher made clear
00:01:15 the practical value of his information?
00:01:18 Although he mentioned the recent storm,
00:01:21 he failed to notice its effect on the householder.
00:01:24 And when he learned how the householder felt,
00:01:27 he didn’t tailor his presentation to the man’s needs.
00:01:31 True, all of “the good news of the Kingdom” is valuable,
00:01:36 but some aspects may appeal to people more
00:01:39 at specific times in their life.
00:01:42 Moreover, if we ignore topics that are on people’s minds,
00:01:47 they might think we’re inconsiderate or rude.
00:01:51 In the example we just watched,
00:01:54 what Bible account might have made the person think?
00:01:59 Let’s watch again.
00:02:02 My heart goes out to those who’ve lost their homes
00:02:04 in the recent heavy rains and mudslide.
00:02:06 Me too!
00:02:08 We’ve been helping a family member try to recover some personal belongings.
00:02:11 We’re just happy that no one was hurt.
00:02:13 That’s a relief, for sure.
00:02:15 And it’s nice to see the community coming together to help one another.
00:02:19 Did you know that the Bible promises a time when we’ll no longer experience
00:02:23 devastation from so-called natural disasters?
00:02:26 Really? What do you mean?
00:02:28 Well, think about the power Jesus displayed when he lived on the earth.
00:02:33 Notice what it says here at Mark 4:39:
00:02:38 “With that he got up and rebuked the wind
00:02:42 “and said to the sea: ‘Hush! Be quiet!’
00:02:45 And the wind abated.”
00:02:49 The publisher used a local topic of interest
00:02:53 and a Bible account that the householder could relate to.
00:02:57 We can also make practical application of our material when giving a talk.
00:03:02 However, when teaching an audience what to do,
00:03:05 be careful not to burden them with guilt.
00:03:08 Instead, strengthen their love and faith
00:03:11 and express confidence in their good motives.
00:03:15 If you’re preparing a public talk,
00:03:17 consider the needs of newly interested ones.
00:03:20 Ask yourself, ‘How can I help
00:03:23 ‘this audience to draw close to Jehovah
00:03:25 and overcome obstacles that could hinder them from making progress?’
00:03:29 Let’s watch a brief excerpt from a public talk.
00:03:34 Hebrews 10:24, 25 says:
00:03:37 “And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works,
00:03:42 “not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom,
00:03:47 “but encouraging one another,
00:03:49 and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.”
00:03:55 So if it’s your custom
00:03:57 to miss meetings here at the Kingdom Hall,
00:03:59 you need to change.
00:04:01 Jehovah knows when you’re here and when you’re not.
00:04:05 Armageddon is coming,
00:04:07 and you don’t want to miss out on everlasting life.
00:04:12 Was that encouraging?
00:04:14 Was it motivating to those attending their first congregation meeting?
00:04:19 Although the speaker clearly showed what the audience needed to do,
00:04:24 how might he have strengthened  their motivation?
00:04:29 Hebrews 10:24, 25 says:
00:04:32 “And let us consider one another  so as to incite
00:04:36 “to love and fine works,
00:04:39 “not forsaking our meeting together, as some have the custom,
00:04:43 “but encouraging one another,
00:04:45 and all the more so as you see  the day drawing near.”
00:04:50 Within these verses we find important reasons
00:04:54 to attend congregation meetings regularly.
00:04:57 For instance, we receive encouragement.
00:05:00 Who doesn’t need that?
00:05:03 This is true “all the more so”  since we’re living in critical times
00:05:08 and Jehovah’s day is “drawing near.”
00:05:11 Moreover, attending congregation meetings
00:05:15 gives us the opportunity to ‘incite others to love and fine works.’
00:05:20 Yes, even your presence here is motivating.
00:05:24 How so?
00:05:26 Because you’ve shown that no matter what else is happening in your life,
00:05:30 there is nothing more important to you
00:05:33 than praising and honoring Jehovah here with the congregation.
00:05:38 So just seeing you here fills us with strength.
00:05:44 By making the practical value of our message clear to our listeners,
00:05:48 we help them to understand how the information affects their lives,
00:05:52 and we motivate them to action.

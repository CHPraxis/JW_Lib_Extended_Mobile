00:00:10 Our audience needs to see the connection
00:00:13 between the scriptures that we read and the point we’re making.
00:00:16 We can accomplish this when we introduce a scripture
00:00:20 in a way that draws attention to the main point
00:00:23 and then emphasize key words as we read the text.
00:00:27 But that’s not always enough
00:00:29 for the audience to grasp the application of the scripture.
00:00:33 Therefore, after reading the text,
00:00:35 it’s important to offer an explanation,
00:00:38 even if the scripture is familiar to the audience.
00:00:41 We can make the application clear by
00:00:45 isolating key words,
00:00:47 by explaining how those words
00:00:49 relate to our reason for reading the text,
00:00:52 and by not complicating the application with irrelevant details.
00:00:56 To illustrate, see if you can discern
00:00:59 where the following speaker succeeds
00:01:02 and where he fails in making scripture application clear.
00:01:07 Today, many churches baptize people
00:01:10 by sprinkling water on them.
00:01:12 Is this how baptisms should be done?
00:01:16 Let’s read how Jesus was baptized
00:01:18 according to Mark 1:9, 10.
00:01:22 Look for the answer to this question:
00:01:25 When Jesus was baptized, was he sprinkled with water?
00:01:31 “In the course of those days,
00:01:33 “Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
00:01:37 “And immediately  on coming up out of the water,
00:01:42 “he saw the heavens being parted
00:01:45 and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him.”
00:01:50 Another popular practice in Christendom is infant baptism.
00:01:55 Wait!
00:01:57 The speaker just moved on to the next point.
00:02:00 He had a good introduction, and he read with proper emphasis,
00:02:04 but he took no time to make the application.
00:02:08 He didn’t give the audience time to reflect
00:02:11 on the meaning of what they just read.
00:02:14 Let’s give him another chance.
00:02:18 “And immediately on coming up out of the water,
00:02:22 “he saw the heavens being parted
00:02:24 and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him.”
00:02:29 Notice that verse 10 says that Jesus
00:02:32 came “up out of the water.”
00:02:35 That means that he had been
00:02:37 completely immersed in the river.
00:02:40 So Jesus was not merely sprinkled with water, was he?
00:02:45 Because Christians try to follow Jesus’ steps closely,
00:02:49 wouldn’t it be reasonable that Christian baptism
00:02:52 would entail complete immersion and not mere sprinkling?
00:02:59 Another popular practice in Christendom is infant baptism.
00:03:04 Notice that the speaker did not comment
00:03:07 on unrelated details of the verses he read.
00:03:10 For example, he didn’t elaborate on the end of verse 10
00:03:14 because it didn’t contribute to the main point.
00:03:18 Whether you’re teaching from the platform or in the ministry,
00:03:22 help your listeners to see clearly the connection between the scripture you read
00:03:27 and the point you’re making.

The challenge of serving
in a foreign country can sometimes be that

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’ve made that move
and you’ve learned a foreign language,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can feel like you’ve done enough.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was brought up by a Witness mother,

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I studied the Bible since I was small.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I had
Bible knowledge to some extent.

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I have enjoyed

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the traveling work for 18 years.

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we get older, trials that we never experienced

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were young
have come up one after another.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I got married and had children,

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a hard time explaining

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the backgrounds
of some Bible characters or Biblical history

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I studied the Bible with my children.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I realized

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I did not have enough Bible knowledge.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another challenge can be

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re dealing
with a foreign culture in the territory,

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you also have
many different cultures in the congregation.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I struggle
to fulfill various responsibilities

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a balanced way

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things such as caring for aged parents
and our own health issues—

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be a source of stress

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause tension between my wife and me.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study article
“Move Forward as a Spiritual Person!”

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:34.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in February 2018 was a big help.

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expressions:

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Once we have identified areas
for improvement, we need to take positive steps”

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that “it is a life-and-death matter”

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really touched my heart.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized
that I needed to scrutinize my life seriously

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make improvements
for my own future and that of my family.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article had a quote
from Brother Barr that said:

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:01.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many fail because they
are not diligent enough to grow mighty.”

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made me think,

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I mighty enough to overcome any challenges

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that might come up,
difficulties with brothers and sisters,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that pleases Jehovah?’

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To move ahead as a spiritual person,

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:16.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to get Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really look at Bible principles.

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:21.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that means letting go of my pride;

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:24.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when it comes back, letting go of it again

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really making
Jehovah’s thoughts my own thoughts.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:31.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a bad tendency to try to do everything

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by myself and to not delegate things to others.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked myself,
‘What decision will please Jehovah?’

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make sure of the more important things.”

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt the need to train

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
younger brothers in the congregation

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could delegate responsibilities to them.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article encouraged us
to look to Bible principles.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:02:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And two that really helped me

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:03.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were Proverbs 15:28 and Philippians 2:4

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it helped me to think

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what is in the person’s best interests

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I respond to them.

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:15.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took time when reading Bible accounts

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meditate on how I would feel

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:21.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I were one of those Bible characters.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can now explain things better
at my children’s study.

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very happy to see my children

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly enjoying Christian activities.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:40.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son started doing “play meetings” for fun.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter loves the ministry.

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She talks to people willingly,

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not because we as parents
are telling her to do so.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compared to how it was when I was a child,

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things are totally different now,

00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that really makes me happy.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By applying this principle,

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can lighten my load

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reduce my stress level.

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, that helps me to maintain joy,

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen our relationship as a couple,

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I feel I’ve become

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more approachable to those in the congregation.

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:23.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having the “mind of Christ”
has helped me in my assignment

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s helped me to form
really close friendships

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:28.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the brothers and sisters
in my congregation, and that’s brought me

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of joy in my service.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:35.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, when I don’t know
what to do (which often happens),

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have Jehovah’s principles to guide me,

00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that makes me feel safe and secure.

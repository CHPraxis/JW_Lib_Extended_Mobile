As a professor of finance,
I need to be well-informed.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a Christian,
I also need to be well-informed,

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as do all Christians.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult not to take sides in politics.

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very difficult
because we are aware of the issues.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always really liked soccer
ever since I was little.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lived in a poor area,
and soccer was what we used to do for fun.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a journalist
that I liked to keep up with.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would point out both the good
and the bad on all sides of politics.

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:49.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he spoke up and pointed out
only the bad side of a political party,

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not like that.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I live in the downtown area of the city.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is where
the largest political demonstrations take place.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People from this area are really into politics.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have definite opinions.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though I always knew
that we must remain neutral,

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I secretly approved of the demonstrations.

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the outside,
I wasn’t jumping up and down or cheering,

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on the inside,
I was saying: ‘Come on! Let’s win!’

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:23.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was all about the desire, the crowd,

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:27.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the pride of your team
having the most victories or the most trophies.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to rationalize saying:

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was created in Jehovah’s image,
and Jehovah is a just God.”

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was speaking was my sense of justice.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought neutrality was shown through actions

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not through what I felt.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The April 2016 Watchtower

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has interesting information regarding neutrality.

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being neutral means that you
do not consider yourself better than others

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “in God’s sight, all people are equal.”

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After studying the article,
I realized that I needed to make changes;

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not being neutral.

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I read the article again.

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah;

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to him that I knew
it was as if he were speaking to me.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The magazine really touched me deeply.

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:15.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember reading the article
at least three times that evening.

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really surprised.

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized how far off I was

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from what God wanted me to be on the inside.

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second situation mentioned in the article

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to do with news reports and the media.

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article even suggested that we limit

00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:34.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our intake of news
that we watch related to politics.

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was another phrase
that really moved me.

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said:
‘Even if we don’t march with protesters,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might we be with them in spirit?’

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! I was with them. Yes!

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were several phrases in that article

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:50.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were written just for me.

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:54.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I cut back watching
so many news reports

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I had to—

00:02:55.863 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this helped me to have self-control
when I spoke to others at work.

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When workmates mentioned
something that was in the news,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have anything to say
since I hadn’t seen it.

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:08.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know about it.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A workmate would say:
“Did you see that so-and-so said this

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that someone else made a statement?”

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:16.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say:
“No, I didn’t see it,”

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was the end of the conversation.

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article mentions Romans 10:12

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jehovah
is “Lord over all” of us,

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:26.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘there is no difference
between Jew and Greek.’

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Jehovah,
it’s not important if my country

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:33.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has five or six titles
or if it won or lost the World Cup.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:36.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Jehovah, all people are equal.

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took a piece of paper,
just a simple piece of paper,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wrote on it the four key points
that the article talks about

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:48.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—four key points
that will help us to remain neutral.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I keep it in my purse;
that way I can always read it at work.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like watching soccer; it’s fun.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still watch it on TV.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still play soccer with my friends at Bethel,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’ve made an effort to change.

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little by little,
I’ve managed to put soccer in its proper place.

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:17.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This helps me to keep pride
and nationalism from getting the best of me.

00:04:17.402 --> 00:04:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned from this article
not to express opinions about politics.

00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:24.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That has to come from deep inside.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m convinced
that God’s Kingdom is the best solution

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:30.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that there’s nothing that comes even close,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remaining neutral will come naturally.

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:35.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can’t let my guard down.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy studying
articles from The Watchtower,

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially those
dealing with practical matters.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:44.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They help me see the Bible as if it were
a mirror that shows me where I can improve.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following counsel

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:50.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making the changes
suggested in the article

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:52.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped me to speak
with the conviction

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:57.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only the Kingdom
can solve mankind’s problems.

“The rest of it he makes into a god.

‘Save me, for you are my god.’”

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not right.

If we’re going to worship Jehovah,

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:34.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to go to the temple.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandfather said that—

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind what your grandfather said!

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be loyal to Jehovah

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Baal

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:43.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or any other god at the same time.

When the king does not search for Jehovah,

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone suffers.

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’re wrong?

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if Baal worship is important?

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to finish the cleansing work my grandfather started.

This will not go down as easily as they think.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s endangering himself,

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his family, and our entire nation.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, have I gone too far?

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if Josiah is right?

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right about what?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if there really is only one true God?

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long do we have to endure this?

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However long it takes.

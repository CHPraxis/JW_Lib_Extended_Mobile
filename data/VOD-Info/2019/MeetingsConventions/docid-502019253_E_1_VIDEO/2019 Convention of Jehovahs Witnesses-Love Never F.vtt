Love

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—is it gone?

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have we lost it?

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it the possession of the wealthy?

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the strong?

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is it somewhere else?

At the 2019 convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will learn what real love is,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where to find it,

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to show it

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have it shown in return.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God cares deeply about you.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wants you to know

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in this hate-filled world,

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love can be found.

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:52.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not lost.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that love will never fail.

for the spiritual needs of his people.

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:12.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has also given his people

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:16.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s needed to carry out any work

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has assigned them to do.

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:23.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In modern times, Jehovah has used

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
printed literature to provide spiritual food.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in recent years,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
digital media has become readily available.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you wondered what impact

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the increased use of electronic publications

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the emphasis on using
the new Teaching Toolbox

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has had on the amount
of literature being printed?

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the brotherhood benefited

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these adjustments?

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will become obvious

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a significant amount of money

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being saved each year.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has allowed the organization

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:13.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reallocate those funds

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:16.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to other critically needed areas,

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as disaster relief,

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help compensate

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for unavoidable rising operational costs

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at facilities around the world.

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied in the book of Isaiah,

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people enjoy a great variety

of spiritual food in this time of the end

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—JW Broadcasting®, jw.org®,

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible releases in one language after another.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:52.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah generously provides
all of the resources needed

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to prepare and serve

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this rich banquet to our worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while all of the silver
and gold belong to Jehovah,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he has not given his people unlimited resources.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he dignifies his people

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the privilege
of managing the resources

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has provided.

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is careful to constantly

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“make sure of the more important things”

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they direct the use of these resources

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in areas that will do the most good.

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:28.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have they made sure
of the more important things

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in providing printed publications
throughout the years?

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the 1870’s, printed publications

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have played an important role
in dispensing spiritual food.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through the years,
much of the organization’s resources

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been allocated for the machinery, buildings,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support of the brothers
that have cared for printing.

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:54.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the 20th century,
printeries sprang up in one country after another.

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the 1970’s, there were 37 printing branches

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 64 large printing presses

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, by the ’90’s, 28 bindery lines.

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around this time, a series
of significant technological improvements

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were made in the printing and binding industry.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taking advantage of these technologies,

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organization increased
their printing and binding capacity

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time reducing the number

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of printing branches and personnel.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, starting in 2003,

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:29.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the worldwide printing
and bindery capacity was upgraded

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the purchase of seven new,
high-speed MAN Roland web presses

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the installation
of a new, deluxe-cover bindery line.

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in less than four years,

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of printery personnel
had been reduced by 25 percent.

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:48.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, over time our needs change,

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both for the brotherhood and for the field.

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:55.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, new developments
prompt the organization

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reevaluate how resources can best be used.

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, significant adjustments

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:06.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the late ’80’s and early ’90’s
better equipped the organization

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:09.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support translation into new languages.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, in 2005, a higher priority

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given to Bible translation.

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would allow more language groups
to benefit from the New World Translation,

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially where it had become difficult
to obtain an acceptable Bible translation

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a reasonable cost.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:27.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More recently, there has been a change

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in how people consume information.

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, greater emphasis has been placed

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on digital media, including videos.

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the while,
demand for printed literature continued to grow,

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:43.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for the field ministry.

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, 85 percent
of our global printing work

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was dedicated to publications
used in the field ministry.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:53.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a growing need in translation,

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a growing need for digital publications,

00:04:56.984 --> 00:05:01.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and production of publications
for the field continued to increase.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the Governing Body
made sure of the more important things

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in view of these developments?

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:11.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a few recent decisions
and their impact.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2008, the public edition
of The Watchtower was introduced

00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we began to offer
only one issue in the field ministry each month.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2013, the Awake!
and the public edition of The Watchtower

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:30.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were reduced from 32 to 16 pages.

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This allowed for two magazines
to be printed at once.

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, in 2016 and again in 2018,

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:40.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decisions were made to reduce the number

00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:44.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of issues of the Awake!
and the public edition of The Watchtower.

00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:47.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These decisions allowed for more languages

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to begin translating the magazines.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also reduced
our magazine-printing workload by 63 percent

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:57.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the past ten years.

00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other recent adjustments include

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no longer distributing
hard copy releases at conventions,

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the simplified Teaching Toolbox,

00:06:06.053 --> 00:06:08.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eliminating specific monthly literature offers,

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:10.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the increased emphasis

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on using the Bible.

00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:14.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these decisions

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:16.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reduced the printing
of books used in the ministry

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:20.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by 25 percent over the past three years.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:23.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have been the results
of the reduction in printing needs?

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:27.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one, less space or buildings are needed

00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:29.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our global printing work.

00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:34.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, instead of reinvesting
in new printing equipment,

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:37.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
funds were able to be reallocated to other areas.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:39.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a few examples.

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:42.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2009, rather than invest

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in new presses for the Italy and Spain branches,

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was determined that their work
could now be absorbed

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:52.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the higher-capacity presses recently installed

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:55.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Britain and Central Europe.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2016, consideration needed to be given

00:06:58.647 --> 00:07:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the aging press in Australasia.

00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:05.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was determined
that the Japan branch could care for their needs,

00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:08.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoiding further investment.

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:12.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The original plans
for the new branch in Chelmsford, Britain

00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:15.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
included a new, large printery.

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the reduction in printing

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:20.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowed for Britain’s work to be absorbed

00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Central Europe and other printeries in 2018.

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has resulted in saving millions of dollars

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:28.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in new construction costs.

00:07:28.844 --> 00:07:31.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similar savings were also experienced

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by consolidating the printing of Argentina,

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
India, and the Philippines to other branches.

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:40.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, there are six bookbinding branches

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and three additional branches with web presses

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:46.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that print magazines, brochures, and tracts.

00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:49.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, as printing was consolidated,

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:51.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
staffing levels were also reduced.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, a total of 1,100 serve

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as full-time printery workers worldwide.

00:07:57.956 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This represents

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a further reduction
of 350 full-time workers over the past decade.

What have been some
of the notable benefits of these adjustments?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, the organization is now free

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:14.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do more for the brothers in other areas.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:16.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a few examples.

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:19.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additional resources are now available

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help support the growing number
of translation teams worldwide.

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:26.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of September 2018,

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:30.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of languages
in which we have produced literature

00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:34.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has increased from 488 in 2010

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to over 900 today.

00:08:37.412 --> 00:08:42.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2012
(before the introduction of 16-page magazines),

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:44.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the study edition of The Watchtower

00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:47.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was translated into 158 languages.

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:50.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, only six years later,

00:08:50.467 --> 00:08:55.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the language count
has more than doubled to 335 languages.

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:58.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially noteworthy is the increase

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:00.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the number of languages
that now have the New World Translation.

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:02.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first 40 years

00:09:02.646 --> 00:09:06.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after its initial release,
the New World Translation was made available,

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:10.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whole or in part, in 38 languages.

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:13.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in just the last 18 years,

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:18.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this number
has more than quadrupled to 177 languages!

00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:20.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of these language groups

00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:23.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not have a reliable secular translation

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their language.

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:28.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, even in languages
where there are only a few hundred publishers,

00:09:28.547 --> 00:09:31.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers are delighted
to enjoy the best translation

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Word in their mother tongue.

00:09:34.302 --> 00:09:36.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More resources can now be used

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop content on jw.org®
in nearly 1,000 languages.

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:44.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who have never read
our publications before

00:09:44.688 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are now receiving a witness

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:50.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to the extraordinary reach of jw.org®.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the impact of the website
on the brotherhood has been amazing.

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:57.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think, for example, of how the online Study Bible

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has deepened our knowledge of God’s Word

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:02.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—enriching our faith—

00:10:02.247 --> 00:10:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how JW Broadcasting®

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:07.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has unified our brotherhood

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:10.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just when we need it the most
in this time of the end.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is so important!

00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:15.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, the beneficial impact
of these recent decisions

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:17.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is readily evident.

00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:21.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is blessing his people
with a wide variety of spiritual food

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:23.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like never before in history.

00:10:23.685 --> 00:10:26.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a result of “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:30.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making sure of the more important things.

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:33.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a thrill to work
along with Jehovah’s organization

00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:36.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and witness his divine blessing upon it!

One afternoon
as we were going to our meeting,

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was robbed by a couple of thieves

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:12.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—young men.

00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right away, there at home,

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realized that the best thing to do
was to go to the meeting anyway.

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:22.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just had to go to the meeting.

00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:25.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t make any sense to stay at home crying

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:28.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeling all negative and frustrated.

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:32.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the Kingdom Hall you feel refreshed.

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:36.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a safe place and you feel at peace.

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your thoughts calm down,

00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:42.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those terrible feelings
caused by being a victim

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:46.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the bad things
that happen in this system dissipate.

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the third vehicle I’d had as a taxi driver.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a really big blow financially.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers found out
that I had lost my means of living.

00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:02.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I no longer had an income.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while I was wondering what to do,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began to attend to each of our needs.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David, my son
—he left to go on a Bible study

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with another brother from the congregation.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But less than half an hour later,

00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:28.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got a call from the brother who was with him.

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:32.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me the terrible news
that my son had been run over.

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,
when we got to where he was being treated,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were many brothers there already
—many brothers.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To this day,
I can’t figure out how they got there so quickly.

00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:43.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who called them?

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they find out?

00:01:45.937 --> 00:01:48.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our son’s accident was so distressing.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearts took a beating.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As my heart was aching,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was as if Jehovah took my heart in his hand

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:59.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caressed it:

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t you worry. Calm down.

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Everything will be all right.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just keep calm.

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’ve suffered a test,
but now you will see my hand in this.

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I won’t be coming down
to be with you personally,

00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but look at all that’s happening.’

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we saw Jehovah’s power.

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not saying that it was good that it happened,

00:02:23.104 --> 00:02:27.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is important to see
how Jehovah takes care of things.

00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:30.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a year passed by between the theft of my car

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my son’s accident.

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:35.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were always there for us

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:41.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a greeting, a hearty handshake,
a meaningful, “We’re right here, brother.”

00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:44.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And often there was
something in that handshake

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—money for things we needed at that moment.

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:49.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah,

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife, my son, and I feel very happy

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and amazed by all the good things

00:02:55.104 --> 00:02:57.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does for us each day.

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to take hold of Jehovah’s hand.

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:02.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I concentrate on that and pray every day

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to cope with whatever problems arise.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another important thing:
I know that I can count on my friends.

00:03:09.895 --> 00:03:12.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to face things alone.

00:03:26.187 --> 00:03:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a comfortable economic situation.

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 20 years I worked
as the supervisor of a firm

00:03:32.354 --> 00:03:35.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contracted by the oil industry.

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:37.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family of five

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:40.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—made up of my wife,
my three daughters, and myself—

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never had to worry about food.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One afternoon,
as I watched the news on television,

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that the company I worked for

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had come under new management.

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Monday, when I went to work,

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I arrived at my office
and found the new supervisor sitting in my chair

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I had occupied for 20 years.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw my résumé in his hand.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He congratulated me for being a hard worker

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was honest and productive,

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he said there was just one thing missing:

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to join a political party.

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I replied as tactfully as I could

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my wife and I were Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we were neutral in political matters.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mood quickly deteriorated.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Visibly angered,

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the supervisor’s facial expression
and tone of voice changed,

00:04:35.604 --> 00:04:39.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he threatened me,
saying that if I did not join the political party,

00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:42.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then that would be my last day at work.

00:04:42.437 --> 00:04:45.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not sign it or join the political party,

00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:48.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that would be like committing adultery

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeping quiet about it.

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:54.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would feel as if I had betrayed Jehovah.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could have signed it and kept my old job,

00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:02.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I knew my conscience
would bother me for the rest of my life.

00:05:03.354 --> 00:05:06.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never be able to go to the congregation

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:11.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serve as an elder
knowing that I had let Jehovah down.

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:14.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, I was unemployed.

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:18.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost 20 years of work
and the severance and seniority pay I was due.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and my daughters were waiting for me.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right then and there,

00:05:25.812 --> 00:05:30.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we prayed together 
and asked Jehovah to please provide for us,

00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to please not let us
be tempted beyond what we could bear.

00:05:34.187 --> 00:05:36.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that we were facing a huge test,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that we would prevail

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we had been obedient to Jehovah.

00:05:43.354 --> 00:05:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since losing my job,
I’ve done several different odd jobs

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:48.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like gardening and painting houses,

00:05:48.937 --> 00:05:52.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at present, I work with public transportation.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter, Genesaret, the second oldest,

00:05:55.812 --> 00:05:58.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paints pictures, and we sell them.

00:05:58.562 --> 00:06:01.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife makes food and homemade sweets,

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:04.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have learned other skills as well.

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have greatly simplified our life.

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:11.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I were even invited
to pioneer school in 2014.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our two older daughters
auxiliary pioneer from time to time,

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:20.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our youngest daughter,
who is 13, was baptized.

00:06:21.687 --> 00:06:24.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has never let us down.

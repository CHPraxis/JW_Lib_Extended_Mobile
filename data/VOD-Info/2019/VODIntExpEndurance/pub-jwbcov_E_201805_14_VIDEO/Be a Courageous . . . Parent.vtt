When our little daughter, Belen,
was nearly three years old,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the doctors discovered
that she had a brain tumor.

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her physical condition worsened,

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a father, I had to make decisions

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what kind of treatment
she would receive to best take care of her.

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that completely terrified me.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like having Goliath

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of me,
and I felt desperate for a moment.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that inside

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shouted to Jehovah to help me.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through that situation,

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned how to pray to Jehovah,

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah never left me.

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah guided me.

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped me make good decisions.

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only through prayer

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did I understand

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what we were facing
was too much for us to handle alone.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed Jehovah

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than ever.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a family, we focused on our spiritual routine.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The key to not being afraid of these problems

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to trust in the resurrection hope.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I were determined
to educate our girls with love

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also in a way that they would truly

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get to know Jehovah as they grew up.

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was evident that we were
leaning on Jehovah,

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they did the same.

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belen, when she
was going through difficult circumstances,

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would say to me: “Don’t worry, Mom.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah already!”

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me see that, OK,

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my daughter is seeing Jehovah as so real.

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many moments
where she strengthened me.

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though it’s true
that Belen fell asleep in death,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me she came out victorious

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I know she’s going

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to open her eyes in the new world,

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the four of us will be together again.

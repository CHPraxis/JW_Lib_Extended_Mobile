Since my dedication and baptism,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been serving in a territory

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where our work is under ban.

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:15.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was serving

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the full-time ministry,

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned
as a special pioneer to the territory

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where my future husband had been serving.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we got married, 
and now we are sharing

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this special avenue of service together.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:31.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are persecuted, put on probation,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and confronted by government officials.

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In difficult times, 
Jehovah personally assures me

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the words from Isaiah:

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.”

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last time 
government officials came to our place,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they took us to their office for questioning.

00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said they had no choice, 
and we went in their car.

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, I felt that Jehovah

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not only giving me
his holy spirit and wisdom

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also giving me
the physical strength to go.

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so thankful to him.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, on that day when
we were taken in the car,

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please help us
to be able to give a witness about you.”

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A government official even said these words:

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s very interesting for us to talk with you.

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When we talk with people of other faiths,

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we never have our questions fully answered.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you know 
the correct answers to our questions

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are capable of giving them.”

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 31:5 is a big help

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there Jehovah is described

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being “like swooping birds.”

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:50.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, Jehovah is above me.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this verse he also
promises that he will defend and save.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encounters with government officials
and discussions with them

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have brought many blessings for our brothers,

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:04.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our Bible students, and for us.

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it has been 
a good opportunity for policemen too,

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:11.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there are sincere ones
among them who have a lot of questions.

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have had good discussions,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I began to view them as my return visits.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:21.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have shared with our students
how Jehovah is giving us strength,

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he is blessing us 
when we are talking with government officials.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
they are able to stay strong in the faith.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After meeting with the police,
we never sit at home trembling in fear.

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:40.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the contrary, we try to share
in field service with our brothers and sisters

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more because it’s also
an encouragement for them.

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spend a lot of time sharing with them

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah glorifies his name.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In certain situations, 
through his words in the Psalms,

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah shows me that he is on my side,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I fully believe it.

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah indeed is on my side,

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has shown me 
that people can do nothing to me.

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:31.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We participated in the construction
when the Kingdom Hall was

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
built the first time.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was finished very nicely.

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we were involved in the construction

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the same Kingdom Hall the second time.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we were close
to the end of the construction

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:50.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and came to the construction site
and saw everything burned-out and ruined,

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cried.

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So almost every day,
unfriendly neighbors stopped us

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continued to say to us: “Stop your work.

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:05.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go out from our village.”

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those moments,
I just used to pray silently to Jehovah.

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a bit afraid since I still had
fresh in my mind all the memories,

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the difficulties,
and how the neighbors threw stones at us.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:28.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the words
in Isaiah 41:10 gave me strength:

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will fortify you, . . .
I will really hold on to you with my right hand.”

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:40.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading these words

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always gave us power
to continue in our service.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I reflected on the words in Nehemiah 2:17:

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,

00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:54.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that this disgrace will not continue.”

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:56.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants this Kingdom Hall to be.

00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is important to the people there,

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:03.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I wanted the praise for Jehovah, again.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was more than clear
that Jehovah was backing us.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We finished construction of that same

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:14.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kingdom Hall for the third time
from the floor to the roof in 45 days.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From a human standpoint,
this was not possible.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:21.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worked closely
with many elders and ministerial servants.

00:05:24.094 --> 00:05:28.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an enjoyable experience.

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt Jehovah’s hand.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah strengthened our spirit.

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:39.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged us, and we felt it.

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:43.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot be silent;
we have to praise God.

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:45.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see him.

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:46.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know him.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah poured out his holy spirit,

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:53.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we gained confidence that Jehovah

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:56.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always near and ready to help.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is like a loving Father
holding us by our hands.

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:03.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Endurance helped us to receive

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:08.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the blessings we are experiencing now.

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:12.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very grateful to Jehovah God
for all these blessings.

00:06:14.853 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realize more fully that

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:20.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his name,
Jehovah becomes anything he wants.

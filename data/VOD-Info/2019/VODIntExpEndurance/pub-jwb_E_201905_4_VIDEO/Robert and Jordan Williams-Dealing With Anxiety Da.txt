00:00:01 I’m so pleased to say that the sister who wrote that letter about her anxieties
00:00:05 is actually here with us in the studio to tell us more about her experience.
00:00:11 This is Jordan Williams and her husband, Robert.
00:00:14 Thank you so much
00:00:15 for coming here to share with us your battle with anxiety.
00:00:19 Can you elaborate on that, please?
00:00:22 I feel ashamed of my anxiety.
00:00:24 I feel like there’s something wrong with me, and I feel guilty about that.
00:00:29 I feel like I’m letting Jehovah down by feeling anxious
00:00:33 and that I’m even being disobedient to Jesus,
00:00:35 when he says: “Stop being anxious.”
00:00:37 But I just can’t.
00:00:39 Thank you for sharing that.
00:00:40 Robert, what do you do to help Jordan battle this anxiety?
00:00:46 It’s a monster —sometimes a very stubborn monster—
00:00:49 that won’t go away.
00:00:51 Remembering that it’s not her fault
00:00:54 helps me be more compassionate
00:00:57 and caring—listening when she’s explaining these anxieties
00:01:01 that I may not completely understand.
00:01:03 Jordan, are there other practical things that help you battle anxiety?
00:01:08 The single biggest help is walking with Jehovah every day.
00:01:12 I mean that literally.
00:01:13 I’ll wake up in the morning super anxious.
00:01:16 And I can’t breathe; and my chest is tight.
00:01:19 And I’ll get up, and I’ll read the chapter
00:01:22 of the Bible that the daily text comes from.
00:01:24 And then I’ll go on a walk and talk to Jehovah for an hour,
00:01:28 and I try to use the model prayer as an outline.
00:01:30 So I’ll talk to Jehovah about his name
00:01:33 and how I feel so privileged to have that name on me.
00:01:38 And I’ll talk to him about his Kingdom
00:01:40 that’s going to solve all of these problems, including anxiety.
00:01:44 And I’ll talk to him about his will
00:01:48 and specifically what his will is for me that day.
00:01:52 And most of the time,
00:01:54 those three things cover the things that were worrying me.
00:01:57 But if there is another thing, I’ll talk to him specifically about that.
00:02:01 What a nice walk you have with Jehovah.
00:02:03 Are there other things that help you deal and battle anxiety?
00:02:07 Personal study projects help a lot,
00:02:09 especially if they don’t have anything to do with anxiety.
00:02:11 If I do a study project on the spiritual suit of armor or the ransom,
00:02:16 it kind of distracts the “anxiety monster” so that my heart can calm down,
00:02:21 and then these pearls of wisdom will come from Jehovah, and they can get in.
00:02:25 And some of those pearls are actually just what I need to deal with my anxiety.
00:02:30 Are there specific things that help you?
00:02:33 Yes, I made an Anxiety tab in the Personal Study section
00:02:36 of my Study Bible on my tablet,
00:02:38 and I collect scriptures and comments
00:02:42 that really help with my anxiety.
00:02:44 For example, in 2014, there was a regional convention talk
00:02:49 about Matthew chapter 6 and six specific things that combat anxiety.
00:02:54 And it made me think of the twelve-step program  to overcoming addiction.
00:02:59 These are the six steps to overcome anxiety.
00:03:01 What are those six steps?
00:03:03 The first one is to help those in need,
00:03:06 and then pray a lot, to be forgiving,
00:03:09 not to be hypocritical, to store up treasures in heaven,
00:03:13 and then to focus on spiritual matters.
00:03:16 So when we got back from the convention,
00:03:18 she took those items and she wrote them down
00:03:20 and put them on magnets and put them on our refrigerator.
00:03:23 I try to do each one of those six things every day.
00:03:26 And when I accomplish one, I’ll turn the magnet
00:03:28 so that I can see what I still need to work on.
00:03:31 So when I come to the refrigerator in the morning,
00:03:34 if the magnets are turned, we know where she’s at.
00:03:36 If they’re not turned, we know we’re in trouble.
00:03:37 It’s a bad day.
00:03:38 It’s time to do something else.
00:03:39 Very good—nice barometer.
00:03:41 So, what can others do or say
00:03:43 that would be helpful to those going through anxiety?
00:03:46 For the friends, it’s really nice when they’re understanding
00:03:50 and nonjudgmental
00:03:52 and respect my privacy (that’s really helpful)
00:03:56 and when they don’t freeze me in time
00:03:59 or decide that ‘Oh, she’s anxious, and this is how she’s going to be all the time.’
00:04:03 That’s really helpful.
00:04:04 I even forget that Jehovah approves of me.
00:04:08 So reminding me of that
00:04:10 —reminding me that the things that I do to please him are successful
00:04:15 and maybe even reminding me of things that I have accomplished for Jehovah
00:04:19 in the past.
00:04:21 You know, you should tell Ron about your broken dish.
00:04:23 Oh, yeah.
00:04:25 Yes. I’d like to know about that.
00:04:27 So I just found out about this Japanese art called Kintsukuroi.
00:04:31 And it’s basically taking
00:04:33 a broken piece of pottery and fixing it by putting it back together
00:04:38 with gold or silver lacquer,
00:04:40 and the concept is that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken.
00:04:45 And that really resonates with me because I do feel broken by anxiety.
00:04:50 But Jehovah gave Jesus as a ransom,
00:04:53 and that ransom is just pure gold;
00:04:56 and He can take all the broken anxious little bits of me
00:05:00 and put me back together.
00:05:02 And maybe I’ll even be more useful to Jehovah for having been broken.
00:05:06 That’s very precious.
00:05:08 Thank you for sharing that.
00:05:10 Are there other things that help you deal with anxiety?
00:05:13 I’ve learned to recognize when anxiety is clouding my thinking,
00:05:16 and I’ll ask him, “Can I borrow your brain for a minute, please?”
00:05:19 So, what we did is we went and purchased a whiteboard and put it in my office.
00:05:24 And sometimes we’ll go to the whiteboard
00:05:26 and write out all the anxieties that she’s dealing with.
00:05:28 As we are writing them out,
00:05:30 sometimes we realize that those are yesterday’s anxieties
00:05:33 and that they’ve been cared for, so we can erase those from the board.
00:05:36 Some of them are for tomorrow,
00:05:39 and so we don’t want to borrow those and bring them to today.
00:05:42 They’re tomorrow’s anxieties.
00:05:43 And some anxieties can be grouped in little clusters,
00:05:46 and you can realize, ‘The root is here; let’s focus on that.’
00:05:50 I fight anxiety every single day.
00:05:54 And anxiety is constantly changing its tactics, so I have to be adaptable.
00:05:59 But Jehovah never leaves me to fight anxiety alone—ever.
00:06:04 I don’t understand what I’ve done to merit all of his attention,
00:06:09 but I do realize that I don’t need to understand why he loves me.
00:06:14 I trust him, and he never lies,
00:06:16 so I just need to accept it when he shows me that love.
00:06:19 We appreciate you sharing those personal feelings.
00:06:22 And again, we know that Jehovah and Jesus are so proud of you.
00:06:26 And we know that those who are listening in to this interview
00:06:29 will benefit so much from listening to your personal expressions.
00:06:33 Thank you very much.

I’m so pleased to say that the sister
who wrote that letter about her anxieties

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is actually here with us in the studio
to tell us more about her experience.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jordan Williams
and her husband, Robert.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:19.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for coming here
to share with us your battle with anxiety.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you elaborate on that, please?

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:24.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel ashamed of my anxiety.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:29.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like there’s something
wrong with me, and I feel guilty about that.

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:33.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like I’m
letting Jehovah down by feeling anxious

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:35.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I’m even being disobedient to Jesus,

00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he says: “Stop being anxious.”

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:39.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just can’t.

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:40.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Robert, what do you do
to help Jordan battle this anxiety?

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a monster
—sometimes a very stubborn monster—

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that won’t go away.

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:54.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering that it’s not her fault

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps me be more compassionate

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:01.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caring—listening
when she’s explaining these anxieties

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I may not completely understand.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:08.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jordan, are there other
practical things that help you battle anxiety?

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:11.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The single biggest help
is walking with Jehovah every day.

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:13.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean that literally.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll wake up in the morning super anxious.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can’t breathe; and my chest is tight.

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll get up, and I’ll read the chapter

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Bible that the daily text comes from.

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:28.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I’ll go on a walk
and talk to Jehovah for an hour,

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I try to use
the model prayer as an outline.

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll talk to Jehovah about his name

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I feel so privileged
to have that name on me.

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll talk to him about his Kingdom

00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to solve
all of these problems, including anxiety.

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll talk to him about his will

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:52.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and specifically what his will is for me that day.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of the time,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those three things
cover the things that were worrying me.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if there is another thing,
I’ll talk to him specifically about that.

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a nice walk you have with Jehovah.

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:07.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there other things
that help you deal and battle anxiety?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Personal study projects help a lot,

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if they
don’t have anything to do with anxiety.

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I do a study project
on the spiritual suit of armor or the ransom,

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:21.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it kind of distracts the “anxiety monster”
so that my heart can calm down,

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then these pearls of wisdom will
come from Jehovah, and they can get in.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:30.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of those pearls are actually
just what I need to deal with my anxiety.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there specific things that help you?

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:36.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I made an Anxiety tab
in the Personal Study section

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:38.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of my Study Bible on my tablet,

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I collect scriptures and comments

00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really help with my anxiety.

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in 2014,
there was a regional convention talk

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Matthew chapter 6
and six specific things that combat anxiety.

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it made me think
of the twelve-step program  to overcoming addiction.

00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the six steps to overcome anxiety.

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:03.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are those six steps?

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is to help those in need,

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then pray a lot, to be forgiving,

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be hypocritical,
to store up treasures in heaven,

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to focus on spiritual matters.

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we got back from the convention,

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took those items and she wrote them down

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put them on magnets
and put them on our refrigerator.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to do each one
of those six things every day.

00:03:26.656 --> 00:03:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I accomplish one, I’ll turn the magnet

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I can see what I still need to work on.

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:34.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I come
to the refrigerator in the morning,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if the magnets are turned,
we know where she’s at.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re not turned,
we know we’re in trouble.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a bad day.

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:39.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to do something else.

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good—nice barometer.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can others do or say

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be helpful
to those going through anxiety?

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:50.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the friends,
it’s really nice when they’re understanding

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nonjudgmental

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect my privacy (that’s really helpful)

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:59.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when they don’t freeze me in time

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:03.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or decide that ‘Oh, she’s anxious,
and this is how she’s going to be all the time.’

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s really helpful.

00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:08.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even forget that Jehovah approves of me.

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So reminding me of that

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:15.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—reminding me that the things
that I do to please him are successful

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:19.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even reminding me
of things that I have accomplished for Jehovah

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the past.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, you should
tell Ron about your broken dish.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.
I’d like to know about that.

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:31.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just found out
about this Japanese art called Kintsukuroi.

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:33.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s basically taking

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:38.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a broken piece of pottery
and fixing it by putting it back together

00:04:38.094 --> 00:04:40.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with gold or silver lacquer,

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:45.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the concept is that the piece
is more beautiful for having been broken.

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:50.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really resonates
with me because I do feel broken by anxiety.

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave Jesus as a ransom,

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:56.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that ransom is just pure gold;

00:04:56.112 --> 00:05:00.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He can take
all the broken anxious little bits of me

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put me back together.

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe I’ll even be more
useful to Jehovah for having been broken.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very precious.

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there other things
that help you deal with anxiety?

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve learned to recognize
when anxiety is clouding my thinking,

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:19.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll ask him,
“Can I borrow your brain for a minute, please?”

00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we did is we went
and purchased a whiteboard and put it in my office.

00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:26.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes we’ll go to the whiteboard

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:28.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and write out all
the anxieties that she’s dealing with.

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:30.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we are writing them out,

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes we realize that those
are yesterday’s anxieties

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they’ve been cared for,
so we can erase those from the board.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are for tomorrow,

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:42.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we don’t want
to borrow those and bring them to today.

00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re tomorrow’s anxieties.

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some anxieties
can be grouped in little clusters,

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can realize,
‘The root is here; let’s focus on that.’

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I fight anxiety every single day.

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And anxiety is constantly
changing its tactics, so I have to be adaptable.

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:04.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah never
leaves me to fight anxiety alone—ever.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t understand
what I’ve done to merit all of his attention,

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:14.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I do realize that I don’t
need to understand why he loves me.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trust him, and he never lies,

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I just need to accept it
when he shows me that love.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate
you sharing those personal feelings.

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, we know
that Jehovah and Jesus are so proud of you.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that those
who are listening in to this interview

00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:33.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will benefit so much
from listening to your personal expressions.

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:35.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

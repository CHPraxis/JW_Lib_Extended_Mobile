00:00:02 I first learned about the Bible
00:00:04 from a friend in my second year of high school.
00:00:07 I became convinced that the Bible’s record
00:00:10 of Jehovah God’s existence was the truth.
00:00:13 So I decided I wanted to serve him
00:00:16 for the rest of my life and decided not to go to college.
00:00:20 My family was very angry with my decision,
00:00:24 especially my uncle who was a doctor.
00:00:27 He burned my clothes and my identification card,
00:00:30 and then he beat me for many hours.
00:00:33 I had no choice but to run away.
00:00:36 I ended up in a city far away,
00:00:39 where I was able to find a Kingdom Hall.
00:00:41 The brothers and sisters there showed me warm hospitality.
00:00:44 I got baptized that year when I was 19.
00:00:48 In January of 1971, my wife and I were assigned to the circuit work
00:00:53 —and we were enjoying it—
00:00:55 when unexpectedly my wife became seriously ill.
00:00:59 She had to receive immediate medical attention.
00:01:01 Eventually, because of her condition,
00:01:03 we had to discontinue our service for a time.
00:01:06 We are so grateful to Jehovah, who supported us in ways
00:01:10 beyond our imagination during that difficult time.
00:01:15 In March 2015,
00:01:17 because of low blood pressure,
00:01:20 I fell and hit my head in the parking lot of our apartment.
00:01:23 Since we have no children, some might wonder who came to our aid.
00:01:28 But when we arrived at the emergency room,
00:01:31 brothers from many congregations were already there waiting for us
00:01:35 even before our ambulance arrived.
00:01:38 We are still truly grateful for their support.
00:01:41 We are convinced that Jehovah
00:01:44 has always been with us these past decades.
00:01:47 And we are certain
00:01:49 that no matter what the situation, he will always protect us
00:01:52 and guide us through any tribulation,
00:01:56 any hardship, or any difficulty that may arise.

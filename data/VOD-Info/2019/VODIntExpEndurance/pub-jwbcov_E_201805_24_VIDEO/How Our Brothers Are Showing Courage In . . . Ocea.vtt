00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Culture on my island is very strong.

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the head of the family
can choose the family’s religion

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also who they will marry.

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, many family members of a boy

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my father wanted me to marry

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to visit my father.

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their purpose was that they could request

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would be married.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I respectfully explained that I could not do that.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my father started beating me.

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first blow with the rod was very painful.

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah helped me by moving Mama to act

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if she would help him to beat me,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead, she didn’t actually beat me.

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For six months, he imprisoned me in the house,

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he assigned me various hard jobs to do.

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thing that was the most difficult for me

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:03.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not being with the brothers and sisters

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:06.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing spiritual activities for Jehovah.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what really strengthened me

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the gift of prayer.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would pray constantly

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talk to Jehovah through prayer.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I would do the meetings by myself,

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would make a schedule on Saturday night.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, on Sunday
when all my family went to church,

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would start by praying,

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
singing, reading the paragraphs,

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
raising my hand,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would answer the questions myself.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if I was with my brothers
and sisters at the meeting.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, I would wait to see my younger cousins

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every Sunday as they walked by

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I knew they would visit
my studies and return visits.

00:01:55.678 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just went to the kitchen to wait.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I waited for them and watched them go by,

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking forward to being able to see them,

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they didn’t see me.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:11.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only I saw them.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they passed by,

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that they went to preach
where the Bible students were.

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really felt strengthened, happy.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those trials that I had to endure,

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were times
that I was very scared, frightened.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really needed
the courage that Jehovah supplies.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why I begged Jehovah for courage,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and immediately Jehovah gave me courage

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I didn’t have to be afraid anymore.

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:47.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had peace,
and I was able to endure those trials.

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By helping me to endure that test,

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped me to experience
the blessings that I’m having today.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I am really happy!

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2013, we decided to make a move

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:13.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the United States to the Marshall Islands.

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.299 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We have a combined family

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.342 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of 9 children and 24 grandchildren.

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a middle income family,

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, you know,
you have everything at your disposal.

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:26.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big adjustment

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move where we knew
that we wouldn’t have those conveniences.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life here is very different from the United States.

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the houses
don’t have kitchens or indoor bathrooms,

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even in the house that we rented,

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no stove or refrigerator.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very apprehensive about making the move.

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a little bit harder
for older ones to learn a new language.

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so how
would I be able to conduct Bible studies?

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:57.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would I be able to,
as an elder, help out within the congregation?

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had one study who had a really fierce dog,

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really didn’t want to go back to that house.

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I went back to have the Bible study,

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t see the dog.

00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:11.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked her, “Where is the dog?”

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said,

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My uncle ate him.”

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Chronicles 15:7,

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:21.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says ‘do not be discouraged,
there exists a reward for your activity.’

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we busied
and asserted ourselves in the work.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so immediately we had,
like, ten Bible studies in two weeks.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the benefit of that
is we would go over chapter one,

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:36.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe ten times.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so through repetition
and through due diligence,

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:42.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really facilitated us

00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning the language and being able to use it

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study with people
and help them come to know Jehovah.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:50.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am a bit afraid of water.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, we are on an island,

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:56.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here I’m surrounded by water,
and I cannot swim.

00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:59.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a campaign recently
to preach to the outer islands,

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I had to think about the people.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:07.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think about their desire to learn

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:09.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more about God, their love for God,

00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:12.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their love and respect for the Bible,

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really motivates me
to keep going in spite of my fears.

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:20.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think
about going from door to door,

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:24.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every person will stop
—stop what they’re doing—

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to talk to you about God.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll accept the literature;
they want Bible studies.

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:31.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really a pioneer’s dream.

00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:33.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their desire,

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their love for the truth
and wanting to know about Jehovah,

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:41.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, that’s an additional blessing
that is encouraging and strengthening us.

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:43.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says, “It’s a pioneer’s dream.”

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:46.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say, “It’s a pioneer’s paradise.”

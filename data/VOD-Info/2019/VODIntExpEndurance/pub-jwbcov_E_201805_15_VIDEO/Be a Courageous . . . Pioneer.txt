00:00:02 After attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, I received an assignment
00:00:05 in another part of the country.
00:00:08 It is an area where it is costly to live, and the living expenses are high.
00:00:13 I was worried about how it would turn out
00:00:16 and if I could manage.
00:00:19 Not too long thereafter, I found a small room I could rent.
00:00:24 The housing conditions were not ideal, but it was OK.
00:00:27 I also received a small cleaning job,
00:00:30 but it was not quite enough for me to make ends meet.
00:00:33 I had to travel a long distance to get to work.
00:00:37 I was tired constantly,
00:00:40 so it was difficult to keep my focus on the ministry.
00:00:46 I had some savings when I moved, but it started to shrink.
00:00:51 My funds slowly dwindled.
00:00:56 By coincidence, I saw a job advertisement.
00:00:59 I handed in an application,
00:01:02 and one and a half hours later, they called me in for an interview.
00:01:07 They felt bad because they could only offer me a part-time position.
00:01:13 To compensate, they offered me a higher salary, which I didnâ€™t object to.
00:01:20 At the same time that I found a job, a couple came to me in the Kingdom Hall
00:01:24 and said that they had found an apartment for me.
00:01:27 So in a city where it is very difficult to find a place to live,
00:01:31 I suddenly had a small and cozy apartment.
00:01:35 Now everything has come together.
00:01:38 This means that I can focus on my ministry
00:01:41 and the congregation.
00:01:47 Jehovah knows just what we need.
00:01:49 And when we test him out,
00:01:51 he will bless our efforts.
00:01:54 I really feel safe leaving my life in his hands.

My name is Steing Dott.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1988 in Darwin,
Northern Territory.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was eight years old,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that life
was getting very difficult for me.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was diagnosed with ADHD,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obsessive-compulsive disorder,
Tourette syndrome.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on top of all of that,
I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mum said this affected the entire family

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I would repeatedly
yell out “Good night!”

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to each individual person in the family.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on top of that,
I used to constantly go

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the house,
checking the locks and the windows.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My school life was the hardest thing
I’ve ever had to deal with.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My school was approximately
500 meters from my home.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would take me
at least two hours to get to school

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because one of my obsessions was
that if there were cracks on the footpath

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if I stepped on one,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d have to go all the way back home
and start again.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I found life
to be a constant struggle,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as I got older,
it only got worse.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even at ten years old,
I decided that I wanted to end my life

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it would make
everyone in the family’s life a lot easier.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we decided
to use some medication,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which eased my problems a little bit.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite having medication,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life was still completely unbearable for me.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a constant struggle
every day within myself.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to wash my hands
hundreds of times a day.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t leave the home;

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t get a driver’s license;
I couldn’t even get a job.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A major turning point in my life

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was my mum’s unwavering faith in Jehovah.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She used to iron
my clothes for the meeting

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hang them on the doorknob,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though I wasn’t ready
to attend the meeting.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what she didn’t know
was that when my mum

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to the meeting with my sister,
I’d get a Bible,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d try and start to read it.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also began to pray to Jehovah.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one day, I thought,
‘I’m going to give this a shot.’

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I put my suit on, I got ready,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I went to the meeting.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to the Kingdom Hall,
I was absolutely terrified.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so nervous.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I got there, I saw an elder

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who used to come and visit me,
and he made me feel very relaxed.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the amazing welcome
by the brothers and sisters

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it made me feel like I was part
of Jehovah’s organization again.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture that really helped me

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was 1 Peter 5:7 because it says:

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“While you throw all your anxiety on him,
because he cares for you.”

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this made me feel like
I had a very powerful Friend,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah wanted me to throw
my anxieties on him because he loved me.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On September 4, 2010,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was my most important day of my life.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Adelaide Entertainment Centre.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now serve as a ministerial servant.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the privilege of giving public talks,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is something I never thought
I’d ever be able to do.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I completed pioneer school
after three attempts

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the pioneer school
environment made me feel

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like I was back at school
and made me have anxiety again.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the third time I completed it.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And none of this would ever have been
possible without Jehovah’s help.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the 6th of August 2016,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married my beautiful wife, Laura,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helps me serve Jehovah,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can serve
Jehovah every day together.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, like the apostle Paul,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still feel like I have
a war inside me sometimes.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But definitely,
Jehovah has never let me down.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never give up on serving Jehovah

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah
will never give up on you.

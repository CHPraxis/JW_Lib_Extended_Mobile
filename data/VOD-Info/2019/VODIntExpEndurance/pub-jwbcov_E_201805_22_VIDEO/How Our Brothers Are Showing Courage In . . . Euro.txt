00:00:06 I was born in the city of Gorlovka,
00:00:09 in the east of Ukraine.
00:00:13 Thinking about the day I was arrested, I did not think anything like that
00:00:16 could happen to me.
00:00:18 I was going to a field service meeting.
00:00:21 But as I was passing a train station,
00:00:23 I was asked by a military officer to show my documents.
00:00:29 I showed my passport.
00:00:31 Then suddenly, he said, “Open your bag!”
00:00:34 In the bag I had my Bible
00:00:36 and The Watchtower magazines.
00:00:38 They arrested me but not because
00:00:41 my documents were missing.
00:00:42 They simply said: “Believer, you are our prisoner.
00:00:47 Go to the basement.”
00:00:50 When I got there, the first thing I did
00:00:53 was silently pray to Jehovah.
00:00:55 This strengthened me a lot.
00:00:59 The smell was terrible—dirty, smoky.
00:01:02 It stunk!
00:01:04 There was no space, not even if everybody lay on their side.
00:01:09 Each day we were given
00:01:11 only a few pieces of bread and water.
00:01:16 One of the detainees
00:01:18 started to incite everyone to escape.
00:01:23 They took him out, and from behind the door
00:01:27 we could only hear the sound
00:01:29 of the beating and his cries of pain.
00:01:35 When he was led back, he was severely beaten.
00:01:42 Of course, all became silent,
00:01:45 and nobody complained anymore.
00:01:48 You could say that they kept us in a state of fear.
00:01:52 One detainee said,
00:01:54 “I would like to address God, but I don’t know how to pray.”
00:01:58 I volunteered and said, “I can pray.”
00:02:07 Then I sang song 134.
00:02:21 I preached a little to the detainees and to the guards.
00:02:27 Ten days passed, and then I was released.
00:02:31 They gave me my bag
00:02:33 and said, “You are free now.”
00:02:36 When they were releasing me,
00:02:38 one guard asked me to give him a magazine.
00:02:47 I felt joy that even the situation I found myself in
00:02:52 served for spreading the good news.
00:03:06 A while ago, we were discussing politics in social science class.
00:03:09 The teacher asked the class
00:03:11 who we would vote for.
00:03:13 I could see what was coming, so I offered a prayer to Jehovah.
00:03:17 And then she also stopped at my desk.
00:03:19 I simply answered
00:03:21 that I don’t vote.
00:03:23 The teacher looked at me all surprised
00:03:25 but didn’t really know what to say, so she just carried on.
00:03:29 So I felt very relieved and happy because I had said what I needed to say.
00:03:34 But instead of leaving it at that, she came back
00:03:37 and asked me why I don’t vote.
00:03:39 So I started to explain that governments
00:03:42 will never bring lasting peace, no matter how sincerely they try.
00:03:45 And that’s when I told them about God’s Kingdom.
00:03:48 Instead of being quiet, my classmates started asking question after question like:
00:03:53 “So when will God’s Kingdom come then?”
00:03:55 and “What is the Kingdom?”
00:03:57 I never expected they would ask  so many questions and be so interested.
00:04:02 So that was a really nice surprise for me as well.
00:04:06 And I was slightly starting to panic, for I wasn’t sure what to say
00:04:10 and how to explain it all properly.
00:04:12 And all of a sudden, the idea came to me to show the video.
00:04:17 So feeling a bit more confident, I told the class that I had a video
00:04:21 that would explain exactly what God’s Kingdom is.
00:04:26 All the students seemed enthusiastic and wanted to see it.
00:04:30 So I got up and walked to the computer, but it wasn’t working.
00:04:34 I was so disappointed, for I really had the feeling
00:04:38 that, apparently, I didn’t know how.
00:04:40 I found it hard to explain, but the video could.
00:04:42 And now there was no way to show them.
00:04:45 But some of my classmates didn’t give up so easily.
00:04:47 They asked me, “Isn’t there another way
00:04:49 we can still watch the video?”
00:04:51 They had really become interested.
00:04:53 So, then, I came up with the idea to add it to our school’s group app for the class.
00:04:57 And they liked it.
00:04:58 So I did that.
00:05:03 Almost at once I received a reply from a student,
00:05:06 who wasn’t in my social science class, asking,
00:05:08 “So when will God’s Kingdom come then?”
00:05:11 So here I am thinking, ‘How should I respond?’
00:05:15 When, before I could even reply,
00:05:17 another girl—also not in my social science class—answers,
00:05:21 “Well, you should have watched the whole video,
00:05:23 “for then you would have seen that you need
00:05:25 to read the Good News brochure.”
00:05:27 So in the end, I didn’t have to say or do anything.
00:05:30 People were responding for me.
00:05:32 And later on, I also heard two girls
00:05:34 talking about God’s Kingdom, even though I’d never spoken
00:05:37 to them about it nor sent them anything.
00:05:39 That was pretty special too.
00:05:42 I wouldn’t call myself a talkative person.
00:05:45 When in a crowd, I prefer to stay in the background and not say too much.
00:05:50 That is why I truly believe that Jehovah gives us courage.
00:05:54 Normally I probably would never have stood up.
00:05:57 But with Jehovah’s help, I did.

00:00:03 They said, “You’ve got to go to Alaska
00:00:07 —one of the greatest assignments that you can be provided from the branch.”
00:00:13 And then he popped up with the question,
00:00:14 he said, “Have you ever thought of going to Alaska?”
00:00:17 And we said, “Well, should we?”
00:00:19 No!
00:00:22 We definitely had to pray about it
00:00:25 and, Scripturally, look up some things.
00:00:27 And we talked to two couples that we knew that had served in Alaska.
00:00:32 You’re assigned to the people, and if you focus on that,
00:00:34 then you’ll find joy in your assignment no matter where it is.
00:00:37 I also like the spirit of Isaiah
00:00:40 where Jehovah asks: “Whom shall I send?”
00:00:42 And without a hesitation,
00:00:44 Isaiah pipes up: “Here I am! Send me!”
00:00:47 He was just willing to be sent.
00:00:49 And then there were the logistics of figuring out
00:00:52 how to simplify and how to actually get up there.
00:00:56 It definitely takes courage to take an assignment
00:00:59 where you’re out of your comfort zone.
00:01:02 We might have needed some courage for the assignment that we took,
00:01:05 but we were so impressed with the courage that the other brothers demonstrated.
00:01:09 There were a total  of 16 different special pioneers
00:01:12 that were assigned,
00:01:14 and 6 of them had never experienced a winter,
00:01:17 and they’re being sent into the harshest of climates
00:01:21 —the harshest of winters in northern Alaska.
00:01:24 When we saw these young men, without hesitation,
00:01:28 going to very unique places out of their comfort zone
00:01:32 —it inspired us.
00:01:34 And it wasn’t just a harsh climate,
00:01:36 but it was darkness, no congregation—
00:01:39 —isolation—
00:01:40 —none of their friends, none of their family there.
00:01:43 They would get a taxi cab to drive them
00:01:46 to the farthest part of their territory for that particular day,
00:01:50 drop them off, and then they would work from that location
00:01:54 back to their hotel.
00:01:57 I would say that one of the blessings that we enjoyed
00:01:59 was seeing how Jehovah opened up the language group.
00:02:03 Jehovah chose the right ones
00:02:05 to get the first tract translated into the Yupik language.
00:02:09 One of the sisters who was asked to translate
00:02:12 was intimidated because she did not know how to read or write the language.
00:02:15 Contemplating Noah gave her the courage
00:02:18 to fulfill her assignment because she, like Noah, “did just so.”
00:02:23 You know the scripture that says ‘the blessings of Jehovah,
00:02:26 that is what makes rich.’
00:02:28 That is so true.
00:02:30 We could have stayed in Jersey in our little apartment,
00:02:33 maybe even by now have a comfortable living.
00:02:36 But what really makes life worth living is the people and friends you have.
00:02:41 As it was once said, “You can’t outgive Jehovah.”
00:02:46 If anyone is considering going through a door
00:02:48 that Jehovah has opened up for them,
00:02:51 don’t hesitate.
00:02:53 You’ve got the support of Jehovah,
00:02:55 unseen angels, His spirit, and the brotherhood.
00:03:00 And the blessings are just waiting for you.
00:03:09 On one occasion, my son called me on the phone and said:
00:03:12 “Dad, come quickly!
00:03:15 They kidnapped John!”
00:03:19 During a midweek meeting,
00:03:21 three armed men showed up at the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:23 They threatened to harm the brothers,
00:03:25 their families, or the congregation
00:03:27 unless they received a considerable sum of money.
00:03:34 I got to the Kingdom Hall,
00:03:36 and when I opened the car door, a kidnapper was there waiting for me.
00:03:41 They took me  to an abandoned lot and left me there,
00:03:44 but they took my car.
00:03:47 It’s dangerous to preach in many parts of Mexico City,
00:03:50 since we’re in danger of being robbed at gunpoint.
00:03:53 For instance, I once witnessed a shooting.
00:03:56 My husband has been mugged.
00:03:59 These kinds of things don’t happen just in Mexico;
00:04:02 they happen all over the world.
00:04:05 At the meetings, we had as many as 20 attendants
00:04:09 at the doors of the Kingdom Hall so that the congregation would feel safe.
00:04:14 When the meeting starts, the doors are closed.
00:04:17 But we keep on the lookout, and if somebody wants to come in,
00:04:20 we make sure that they will not pose a threat to the congregation.
00:04:25 When we’re preaching from house to house,
00:04:27 we try to stay together as a group.
00:04:29 And we’re aware of our surroundings,
00:04:31 watching out for any dangers.
00:04:34 We’re always holding publications,
00:04:36 like a magazine or a Bible.
00:04:38 It helps us because people identify us as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:42 I try not to have any valuables on me, like a cell phone or jewelry.
00:04:47 It’s a very productive territory even though it is such a dangerous area.
00:04:51 A lot of people are coming to know Jehovah.
00:04:55 While I was in the car with the kidnapper,
00:04:57 he asked me what the difference is between Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christians.
00:05:02 I didn’t know I would have the opportunity to preach, but I did.
00:05:08 When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.
00:05:13 I greatly admire the sisters that go out in service
00:05:16 —the courage they show—
00:05:18 because even though their territories are difficult, dangerous,
00:05:22 they will not give up in this important work.
00:05:25 For them, giving up is not an option.
00:05:28 And I will never give up either.
00:05:32 Crime happens and will continue to happen.
00:05:36 But we’re determined to serve Jehovah, no matter what.
00:05:40 We should not be afraid of those who kill the body.
00:05:44 If we were to face this situation again,
00:05:46 the congregation would not stop preaching.
00:05:49 They love Jehovah so much.
00:05:51 And they truly understand that their neighbors
00:05:54 are also suffering from crime,
00:05:56 so they put forth much effort to share a message of hope.
00:05:59 No, I will not stop preaching.
00:06:02 This work must go on
00:06:04 whether there’s violence or not.

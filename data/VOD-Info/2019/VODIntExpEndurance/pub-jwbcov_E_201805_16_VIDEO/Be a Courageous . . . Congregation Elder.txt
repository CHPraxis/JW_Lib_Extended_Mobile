00:00:02 As a father, I never expected this to happen to my family.
00:00:14 One day, my son came home from work and told me that he had committed a sin.
00:00:20 I asked him if it was serious, and he said that it was.
00:00:24 When my son confessed,
00:00:26 I felt incredibly sad —this deep pain—
00:00:30 because I really wasn’t expecting this from him.
00:00:34 I was very aware that the greatest love we should have should be for Jehovah,
00:00:39 and that gave me the strength to encourage him to seek spiritual assistance.
00:00:44 I said that the wise thing for him to do
00:00:47 would be to seek Jehovah’s help through the elders, to talk to them about it.
00:00:54 Regardless of what would happen to my privileges,
00:00:59 I knew there would be other consequences.
00:01:02 I knew that no matter what, this was going to hurt my family.
00:01:09 Later, I regained my privileges.
00:01:12 As a father,
00:01:14 I am extremely happy to see my son serving Jehovah
00:01:17 wholeheartedly alongside his wife, who’s a pioneer.
00:01:21 What matters most for us as humans
00:01:25 is to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
00:01:28 And we’ve been richly blessed,
00:01:30 and that means that all that we went through was worth the effort.
00:01:33 We’re happy.
00:01:35 We’re glad to be serving Jehovah,
00:01:37 and he has blessed us with wonderful privileges of service.
00:01:42 As elders, we need to be courageous
00:01:44 to stand up to difficult situations, knowing what is right.
00:01:49 We know that Jehovah is aware and that he sees everything.
00:01:53 We need to protect Jehovah’s name,
00:01:55 which is so important because of Satan’s challenge against it.

As a father, I never expected
this to happen to my family.

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, my son came home from work
and told me that he had committed a sin.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him if it was serious,
and he said that it was.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my son confessed,

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt incredibly sad
—this deep pain—

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I really wasn’t expecting this from him.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very aware that the greatest love
we should have should be for Jehovah,

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that gave me the strength
to encourage him to seek spiritual assistance.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said that the wise thing for him to do

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:51.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be to seek Jehovah’s help
through the elders, to talk to them about it.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:59.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of what would happen
to my privileges,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew there would be other consequences.

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that no matter what,
this was going to hurt my family.

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, I regained my privileges.

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a father,

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am extremely happy
to see my son serving Jehovah

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wholeheartedly alongside
his wife, who’s a pioneer.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What matters most for us as humans

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:28.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve been richly blessed,

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that means that all that we went through
was worth the effort.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re glad to be serving Jehovah,

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has blessed us
with wonderful privileges of service.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As elders, we need to be courageous

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand up to difficult situations,
knowing what is right.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah is aware
and that he sees everything.

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to protect Jehovah’s name,

00:01:55.886 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is so important
because of Satan’s challenge against it.

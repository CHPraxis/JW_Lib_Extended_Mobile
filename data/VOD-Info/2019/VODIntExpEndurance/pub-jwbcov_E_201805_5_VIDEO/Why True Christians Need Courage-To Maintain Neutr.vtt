I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1975 in Zaire.

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zaire was under a dictatorship at that time.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:16.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was only one political party,

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone was supposed to join it.

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, a position at work also required

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a position in the political party.

00:00:24.587 --> 00:00:26.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I refused to have anything

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do with these political activities.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, they asked me
to be present for the flag salute.

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:35.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to go and explain

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all the workers who had assembled

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why I didn’t want to be there.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as I set off,
understandably, I prayed a lot.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until then, I would just stay out of sight,

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on that day,
everyone was very angry;

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I had to be present.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Saturday, a man from the party came.

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came to the office and started to yell,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who doesn’t want to participate
in political activities?”

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He carried on talking
and called everyone to come outside,

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so everyone went outside.

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stayed alone in the office.

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the way home,
I thought that maybe

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were going to arrest me,
but they did not.

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went home, myself included.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterwards, besides having to face
peer pressure nearly every day,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was demoted.

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One year
the children didn’t attend school

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we didn’t have enough money

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even for our day-to-day needs
it became difficult.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t neglect spiritual things.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:51.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always kept busy attending the meetings,

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
participating at the meetings,
in the ministry,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my personal study
and, even more so,

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:00.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my prayer to Jehovah.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has blessed me
because I’m still in the truth.

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All this time, he has blessed me.

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be neutral is the best way

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show that we support
Jehovah’s Kingdom

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—apart from the preaching work, obviously.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when the government
goes against our activity,

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:23.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we shouldn’t take this
as something bad or negative.

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can serve a purpose.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can render a witness.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a witness
in support of God’s Kingdom,

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the name of Jehovah, and his authority.

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understanding it in that way,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will rely on Jehovah.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never allows
something without reason.

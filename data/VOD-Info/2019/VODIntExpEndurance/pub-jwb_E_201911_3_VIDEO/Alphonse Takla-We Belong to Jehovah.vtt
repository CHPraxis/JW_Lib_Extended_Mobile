When we’re together
with a large group of Jehovah’s people

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:09.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry
and at our meetings and assemblies,

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:13.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we really feel Jehovah’s blessing, don’t we?

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if we’re isolated?

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we’re facing persecution?

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:23.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Alphonse Takla
experienced some years ago in Egypt.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how Jehovah proved to be with him.

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All was dark;

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was pitch-black dark.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Egypt was at war with Israel,

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:44.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were arresting the brothers,

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
charging us of practicing illegal activities

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:51.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a banned organization.

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that night, we were being transferred

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the concentration camp.

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t see much.

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What’s going on there?
What’s this place look like? Where is it?”

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The officer got two soldiers to escort us

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our cell where the brothers were.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that when people
are taken to the concentration camp,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spend years

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:30.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them never return back.

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was, you know, a teenager,

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked the characters in the Bible,

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:40.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Abraham,

00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:45.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses.

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:49.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that they were
champions of true worship.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At some stage, I felt jealous of them.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had this huge relationship with God,

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’d like to be part of that.

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I continued to read the Bible

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get closer to God.

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:06.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that Jehovah would look after me;

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:08.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not abandon his servant.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we tried to encourage them:

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brothers, keep in mind

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re here because we worship Jehovah.”

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sat together to discuss, you know,

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we were going to do

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep spiritually strong.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we thought that we needed to pray.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We picked out a scripture every day,
like a daily text,

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then after that, recited scriptures.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One would handle
a talk from the memory of heart

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then an open
discussion of Bible questions.

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:46.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that stage,
we didn’t have a Bible with us.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:54.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The officers wanted us to renounce our faith,

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they told me to lay on the ground,

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there they started to beat me.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole camp was around,

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one of the prisoners fainted.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to pray to Jehovah:

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, help me to be able to endure that!”

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very severe pain.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt his help
because after a few beatings,

00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my body felt numb.

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel much more pain.

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the prisoners said to me,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I get out of here alive,

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ll tell my children
that in the concentration camp,

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw the Christians that reminded me
 of the first-century Christians

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that they were happy even to die
without renouncing their faith.”

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the officers

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:48.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this nasty one
that used to beat us very, very severely—

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came one day and said,

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We need two of you to come out

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and write a report about what you believe.”

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we thought about it:
‘Is it wise to do that?

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe they will use it against us.’

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, we prayed to Jehovah
for help to make a decision here,

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:06.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to guide us on what to do.

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:08.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the end, we reached a point that,

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we may get out; we may not.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we might as well give them a witness.

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told the officer, “We need a Bible.”

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:21.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said, “What for?”

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:26.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to him, “Because we need
to quote from the Bible in this report.”

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he said,
“OK, do you have a Bible in the storeroom?”

00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:33.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Yes, I have a Bible.”

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:37.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “OK, go and get your Bible.”

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:43.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to my bag and picked up the Bible.

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he picked up the Bible from my hand,
opened it randomly, and started to read.

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Numbers.”

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looked at me.
“Who wrote this book?”

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to him, “Moses.”

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re a liar!” at the top of his voice.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept quiet,

00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he closed the book again

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:13.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and opened it again.

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re a liar!”
again at the top of his voice.

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:24.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was racing in my mind
where it is written in the Bible

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah told Moses to write any of this.

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:31.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He shut the book again,
and for a third time,

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opened it again,
and he started to read in a loud voice.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the officer looked at me
with a big surprise on his face.

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:53.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we wrote the report,

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him,
“Can we keep the Bible, please?”

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “OK, keep the Bible.”

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For three months, nearly every day,

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the officers came in and beat us

00:06:04.647 --> 00:06:06.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and expected us to compromise.

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never did that.

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:11.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I can say is that it was Jehovah’s hand.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was helping us to endure

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to continue to do his will

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not compromising
because we belong to him

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we rely on him.

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:29.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God will not abandon his servant.

00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Alphonse thrown into prison?

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t because he refused to say

00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:39.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a simple greeting
to the president of his country.

00:06:39.382 --> 00:06:42.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that phrase was a political slogan.

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:48.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alphonse was persecuted for his neutrality.

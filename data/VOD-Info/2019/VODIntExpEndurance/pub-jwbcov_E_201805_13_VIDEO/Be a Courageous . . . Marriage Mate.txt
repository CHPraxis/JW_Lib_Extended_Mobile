00:00:02 My husband did not recognize me for three days.
00:00:07 It was a very dark time.
00:00:12 We went to BSCC, Bible School for Christian Couples,
00:00:15 in January of 2014.
00:00:17 It definitely helped prepare us
00:00:19 for everything that would come our way
00:00:22 —the good and the bad.
00:00:23 We were assigned to Jackson, Alabama.
00:00:25 It was a great assignment.
00:00:27 Within a very short time, we were asked to apply for LDC.
00:00:32 We traveled quite a bit, looking at different Assembly Halls,
00:00:36 and then the focus went more toward Kingdom Halls.
00:00:41 Each field rep couple was assigned a state,
00:00:44 and we were assigned the state of Louisiana.
00:00:46 On a Sunday night, we had been invited to a dinner party.
00:00:51 Just a normal— We went to bed at night.
00:00:54 We basically woke up to a stroke.
00:00:56 I walked over to him,
00:00:58 and I could see that something was wrong, and so I called 911.
00:01:03 Once they assessed him, they brought me in.
00:01:06 They told me that they needed to Life Flight him
00:01:09 to a larger hospital in New Orleans.
00:01:11 Thankfully, though, they said that if you’re going to have a stroke,
00:01:14 this was the kind you’d want to have
00:01:17 because it is fully recoverable.
00:01:19 We made adjustments.
00:01:21 We adapted so that we could continue in the assignment.
00:01:25 Well, he went from being in a wheelchair
00:01:29 to using a walker.
00:01:30 And then later, he started using a cane,
00:01:34 and now he walks without assistance.
00:01:37 It’s not a pretty walk, but we’re working on that.
00:01:40 She really has a durability
00:01:44 that I think excels all.
00:01:46 Just the way that she
00:01:48 —no matter what the situation, how stressful the circumstance may be—
00:01:53 she understands it’s necessary for her to continue forward.

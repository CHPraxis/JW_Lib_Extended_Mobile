Phelicity was a bright, vibrant little girl.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was a beautiful kid
—she really was.

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She embraced the fact that she was ill.

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was confident and courageous,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that Jehovah would resurrect her.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Phelicity really enjoyed the privilege

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being invited to share
in the February broadcast of 2016.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly, just a few weeks later,
Phelicity passed away.

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you watch a child die in her mother’s arms,

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s the most saddening thing you’ll ever see.

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pain and the sting of death is so strong.

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:49.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after some time, as time goes by,

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sting starts to fade a little bit into,

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I just really miss that person.’

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simple things like setting the table

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s when you need courage.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s one less plate,
one less fork, one less knife,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one less seat.

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the day that Phelicity died,

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the account of Jairus’ daughter
actually helped Ben and I as parents.

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment,

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was told
that his daughter had died,

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know how he felt.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet Jesus said: ‘Do not fear.’

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His daughter wasn’t dead.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was just asleep.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Phelicity died,
we went to the very next meeting.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our friends
—they didn’t know what to say.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they did the most important thing ever
—they offered a warm embrace.

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends in our Kingdom Hall
are like family to us.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really protected us; they comforted us.

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, there would be cards.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hardest thing for us to do after Phelicity died

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to look at the resurrection hope
during our family worship.

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:59.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our children lost their sister and their friend.

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to see the benefit,

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when we heard
their private prayers at nighttime.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would make expressions
about the resurrection hope,

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they knew
that Phelicity was safe in Jehovah’s memory.

00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:17.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Phelicity often said that she felt 
the best when she was in the ministry

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she didn’t focus on her own illness.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since she’s died,
we can truly understand what she meant by that.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our experience with losing Phelicity

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has actually given us
the ability to comfort other people.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we’re in the field and we meet
people who have lost someone they love,

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel better equipped
emotionally and spiritually

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:40.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to strengthen others.

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expansion of our ministry
has been something that we’ve really enjoyed.

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It keeps our minds occupied
and keeps the hope more real to us.

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, there’s always a pain

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that won’t go away until we get Phelicity back.

00:02:57.698 --> 00:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we put it in its place.

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We allow it to energize our family
to do the things that Jehovah wants us to do.

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The resurrection hope is real;
it’s going to happen.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just have to be patient.

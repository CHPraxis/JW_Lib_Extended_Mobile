00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My first contact
with the Witnesses was in my 20’s.

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As my knowledge increased,
I made drastic changes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quit smoking
and stopped swearing and using drugs.

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also changed my violent behavior.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I completely gave up martial arts,

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I was baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an amazing day that I will never forget.

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after my baptism,

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became quite involved
in my work at the theater.

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The environment there
was very immoral, you know.

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:54.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even after several loving warnings

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from brothers in the congregation
advising me to look for another job,

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I chose not to follow their advice.

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d worked there for a long time,

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I thought, ‘I can handle it.’

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was wrong.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My conscience became dull,

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I committed a serious sin against Jehovah.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I left the truth,

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several offers came my way.

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became a manager at a nightclub
that was open until six in the morning.

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:30.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a lot of parties,
and it was a lot of drugs.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also resumed martial arts.

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came in contact with serious criminals

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gradually became friends
with the most influential person

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the criminal underworld in Oslo.

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually,
I was imprisoned for my violent behavior.

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Christian movement
visited the prison where I was,

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the inmates were invited
to an event where there would be cake served.

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounded very interesting.

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was tempted by a cake.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also played music.

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after a while, 
they started speaking in tongues,

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt very uncomfortable.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to be involved in that,
but I couldn’t get up.

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I was big and strong back then,

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I physically couldn’t stand up from my chair.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve experienced a lot in my life,

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at that moment,
I was genuinely scared.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I cried out to Jehovah,
and immediately I was released,

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was able to get up and leave.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This big man was now in a fetal position, crying.

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I called my wife
and asked her to bring me a Bible

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some literature.

00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:00.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to start studying again
and draw close to Jehovah.

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest challenge was prayer

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to start communicating with Jehovah again
after being so far away from him,

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing all these bad things.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it was a long way to go.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scripture I especially remember

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:25.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Isaiah 1:18, where He says:

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come, now,
and let us set matters straight between us.”

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That touched me deeply.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also says that if ‘your sins are red like scarlet,’

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:44.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make them “white as snow.”

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:48.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like he separated the darkness
and stretched out his hand

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pulled me out,
back into the light again.

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Six months after I was reinstated,

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife decided to dedicate her life

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah and was baptized.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has been a huge support during my return.

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very nervous at first,

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when I entered the Kingdom Hall,

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that feeling just disappeared.

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s spirit is here.

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way the brothers and sisters
acted toward each other

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was such a contrast to my former lifestyle.

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:39.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel deeply blessed by Jehovah.

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:45.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, you make mistakes once in a while,

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I feel confident that Jehovah is merciful.

Everyone gets sad now and then.

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you?

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some cases, you may know the cause;

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in other cases, you may not.

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:34.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if there doesn’t seem to be a cause,

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can you do when sadness

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holds you in its grip?

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, find someone to talk to about it,

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as a parent or close friend.

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the midst of his turmoil,

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job, a faithful man in Bible times, said:

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will speak out in my bitter distress!”

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:58.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When someone
knows what you’re going through,

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:00.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she can lower the rope

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pull you out of the pit.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another idea:

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not put your thoughts on paper?

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 3:21, the Bible tells us

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “safeguard practical wisdom

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thinking ability.”

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Writing about your feelings
can help you do that.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once they’re on paper,

00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:31.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can sort them out,

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:34.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the sadness can be less overpowering.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third suggestion:

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says
that if you pray about your concerns,

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will guard your hearts and thoughts.’

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t forget prayer.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last but certainly not least,

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reading the Bible can help

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially the book of Psalms.

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:02.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Filling your mind
with positive thoughts from the Bible

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have a positive effect on your feelings.

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if your feelings just won’t go away?

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’ve lost interest
in just about all activities

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you used to find exciting?

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:20.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you seem to have no appetite,

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:23.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have trouble sleeping,

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suffer
from intense feelings of worthlessness?

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If symptoms persist,

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not talk to your parents

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about getting a checkup?

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:36.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A physician can help determine

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if your sadness has a medical cause,

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as clinical depression.

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:44.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do suffer from clinical depression,

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:46.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:48.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With treatment,

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many sufferers have begun to feel better

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps even the best
they have felt in a long time.

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:59.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whether your sadness
is caused by depression or not,

00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:01.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with assistance and effort,

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:06.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can get out of the deep pit of sadness.

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:13.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feelings are temporary; they will pass.

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:16.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you can learn to deal with them now,

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be prepared to handle them as an adult.

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:24.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By taking things a day at a time

00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relying on the support of your parents

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trustworthy friends,

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can go from sad

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to glad.

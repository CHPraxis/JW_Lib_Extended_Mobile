Video games

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:11.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they can be a lot of fun

00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:15.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can seem like a great way to pass time.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like most forms of fun,

00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
playing video games can take over your life

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways you don’t want.

00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:26.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Ephesians 5:15, 16,

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:30.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says
to ‘make the best use of your time.’

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’re up when you should be sleeping,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then who’s in control?

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:36.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You or the game?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That doesn’t make you a winner.

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:43.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:
If you lose money,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may be able to get it back,

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:48.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s not true when you lose time.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a sense, then,
time is more valuable than money.

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:54.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t let yourself be robbed.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you find yourself skipping meals,

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:01.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not doing homework,

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:03.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and generally not taking care of yourself

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to get through endless levels

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your game?

00:01:07.104 --> 00:01:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you stop losing out
on those important parts of life?

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your gaming console in your bedroom?

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move it out so that you can get some sleep.

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:21.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, it might be good to take a break.

00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not stop playing for a week?

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Replace gaming with something active

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you know, actual exercise.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come to think of it,

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might want to do some of that every day.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ecclesiastes 3:4, the Bible says

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:38.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there’s “a time to laugh”

00:01:38.604 --> 00:01:40.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “a time to dance.”

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s OK to spend

00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:45.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some time playing video games,

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:48.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just not all the time.

00:01:48.687 --> 00:01:51.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something else
video games can rob you of:

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your sense of right and wrong.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that God
hates anyone ‘loving violence.’

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:02.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is, video games promote
lots of things the Bible condemns

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:04.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—violence,

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:06.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
immoral sex,

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spiritism.

00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:10.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it just a game?

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:12.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine you were doing that in real life

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you know,
all that stuff in the game you’re playing.

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of person would you be?

00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your choice in video games
may say a lot about who you are

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:25.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you think is right and wrong.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about online games
that connect you with other players?

00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:33.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know who’s on the other end?

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:37.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your game could be putting you

00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:39.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 with the wrong people.

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:46.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s definitely worth taking
a look at your gaming habits.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:49.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bottom line?

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:52.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Playing video games can be good recreation.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t let games rob you of your time

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:59.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or your sense of right and wrong.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of trying hard
to be a winner in a game,

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use your time and energy

00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:07.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a winner in real life.

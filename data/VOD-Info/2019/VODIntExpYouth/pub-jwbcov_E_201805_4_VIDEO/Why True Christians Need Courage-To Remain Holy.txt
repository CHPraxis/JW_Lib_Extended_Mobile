00:00:04 When I was 17 years old,
00:00:06 I was very shy and had low self-esteem.
00:00:09 Almost all my classmates had girlfriends
00:00:12 and looked like they were having fun.
00:00:14 This made me feel really lonely.
00:00:17 I had been baptized for four years.
00:00:20 At school, my classmates respected me
00:00:23 because of my conduct.
00:00:25 But something was about to happen
00:00:26 that could have changed my life forever.
00:00:30 There were a lot of girls at my school.
00:00:31 One girl in particular was really pretty.
00:00:35 Although we were not in the same class,
00:00:38 we would often see each other in the hall,
00:00:41 in the school cafeteria,
00:00:43 or during gym class.
00:00:45 I noticed that she would look at me.
00:00:47 One day, two girls handed me a letter from her.
00:00:52 The letter said:
00:00:54 “I think we would get along.
00:00:57 “I’m attracted to you.
00:00:58 “I like your personality,
00:01:00 “and that’s not all.
00:01:01 “I hope you make the right decision.
00:01:04 “We could really have fun together.
00:01:06 With love, yours truly.”
00:01:08 I felt dazed; I honestly didn’t know what to do.
00:01:13 My classmates urged me to accept her proposition immediately.
00:01:17 When I got home,
00:01:19 I was really confused.
00:01:21 My parents asked me what was going on,
00:01:24 but I couldn’t talk to them about it.
00:01:28 I wondered whether I would ever meet another girl as beautiful as she was.
00:01:33 During those days, it was as if I had lost my Christian identity.
00:01:38 I prayed a lot.
00:01:40 I had dedicated my life to Jehovah, and I couldn’t let him down.
00:01:44 So I opened up to my parents,
00:01:46 and they were patient with me.
00:01:49 We did some intensive study together, using the Young People Ask book.
00:01:53 Going through articles that applied to me helped me
00:01:57 overcome the problem.
00:01:59 I also spoke to a mature brother in the congregation
00:02:03 and decided to spend more time with him
00:02:05 as well as other brothers.
00:02:07 I mustered up courage.
00:02:08 I went to her and told her my decision.
00:02:13 I explained my Bible-based convictions
00:02:15 and said no.
00:02:18 It was a very wise decision.
00:02:20 I then had a clean conscience,
00:02:23 and I hadn’t brought reproach on Jehovah’s name.
00:02:26 I had safeguarded my relationship with him.
00:02:29 I learned that if we are determined to be loyal to Jehovah
00:02:33 and we have the courage to remain chaste, well,
00:02:36 we won’t have any regrets.
00:02:38 Until age 17, I had not understood this.
00:02:42 Jehovah has truly blessed me since then,
00:02:45 giving me the privilege of serving in the congregation in many ways
00:02:48 and giving me a lovely wife to serve him with.
00:02:51 I thank Jehovah for having helped me to make the right decision.

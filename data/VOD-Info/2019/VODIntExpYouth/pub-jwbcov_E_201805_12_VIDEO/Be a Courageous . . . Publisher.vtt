I thought that only those with an abundance

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of mature knowledge and experience
did special metropolitan public witnessing.

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought: ‘I can’t do it; I’m too young.’

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, I decided to send in the application.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received the invitation in the mail within a month.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suddenly felt really insecure and afraid.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I prayed to Jehovah, “I can’t do this yet.”

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I wouldn’t be able to participate
in this type of service feeling that way,

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:42.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I prayerfully did research
to find some material that would help me.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found an article about Moses.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an article that stressed

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even if we think
we aren’t able to carry out an assignment,

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s power we can.

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also heard a talk that used Jeremiah 20:7.

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:01.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was encouraged when he said,

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even though you might feel you can’t do something,

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if Jehovah gives you the power to do it,

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you can do it.”

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, Jehovah saw my potential

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave me the courage to perform this service,

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though I thought it was beyond my ability.

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am being shown
time and time again that Jehovah draws people

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are sincerely interested
in the Bible to the carts.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve even experienced helping people

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a request
for a Bible study by using my smartphone.

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really able to grow, thanks to this ministry,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:50.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gain more joy from Jehovah
than I ever thought possible.

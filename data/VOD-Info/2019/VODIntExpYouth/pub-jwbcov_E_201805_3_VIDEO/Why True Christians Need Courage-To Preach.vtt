When I was young, I had an internal struggle.

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:09.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was studying,
but I was just doing it for my mom.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like any typical kid,
I didn’t want to stand out or be different.

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I walked ten minutes to school,

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ten minutes to the Kingdom Hall,
lived right in my territory.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was like in a little bubble.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was common to just bump
into your classmates or people you know.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what their reaction would be.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you imagine people laughing at you.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was afraid of endangering the friendship.

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:40.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was raised
in a religiously divided household,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always knew I had a choice.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the same time,

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:49.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would feel bad if I didn’t defend my faith,
and my conscience would bother me.

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was always a struggle
—like, I knew what the right thing to do was,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I didn’t have the courage
to do the right thing.

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still clearly remember when I was 12,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just one day, out of the blue,
I picked up a magazine on my own

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read it from cover to cover for the first time.

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:06.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that left a deep impression.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just touched my heart that day.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I thought, ‘Oh, there must be 
other books that I’m missing out on.’

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just started reading other publications.

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers’ and sisters’ experiences
really touched my heart.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was always amazed

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the courage they had,
and I always wanted to imitate that.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom’s Bible teacher
started studying with me

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:30.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped me to meditate more 
on what I had learned.

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She introduced the Insight book to me,
and that tool really helped me

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dig deeper as I was doing personal study.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After doing it little by little,

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that studying is enjoyable

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially when you study just
for yourself

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deepen your faith in Jehovah—

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it gave me the courage that I needed.

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning of every school year,

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would introduce myself 
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:57.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would always pray,
especially the night before that.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then every year, it got easier and easier.

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took courage, but Jehovah helped me.

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When classmates asked
what I did over the weekend,

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would always mention spiritual activities.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they would tell me their problems,
and I would always try to think

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Bible principle or an article
that could help them.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, the class was given the assignment

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pick a topic for a persuasive speech.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to use that opportunity

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give a witness, and I chose the topic

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Evolution Versus Creation.”

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I defended my faith,

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:36.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more I realized
there was nothing to be afraid of.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, none of my classmates or teachers

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever had a bad reaction
like I imagined they would.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to regular auxiliary pioneer
throughout high school.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That definitely served
as a protection and kept me busy.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right after high school,
I was able to start regular pioneering.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One blessing
is being able to have a good conscience,

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing I didn’t try to hide who I am just to fit in.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:02.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy at first, but gradually I realized

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that having a relationship with Jehovah
is something to be proud of.

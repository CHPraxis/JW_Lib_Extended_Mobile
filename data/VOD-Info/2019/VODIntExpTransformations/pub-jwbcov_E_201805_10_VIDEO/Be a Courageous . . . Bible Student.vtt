In 1998, I started dating a girl,
and we dated for two years.

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time,
I also started studying the Bible.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our relationship was going well.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have any big issues;
we got along well; we rarely argued.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, how do you go
to someone when you’re dating

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everything is going well and say:

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Listen, I can see you don’t
feel the same as I do.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:28.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t want to date you anymore
because now I’m studying the Bible.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses”?

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really had to muster up a lot of courage

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tell her that.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are moments
when you start to ask yourself,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:38.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Did I really make the right decision?’

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And up to around the time
when I got baptized,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was still hoping
that she would learn the truth.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, unfortunately, that didn’t happen.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also involved in something else
that I really loved, which was sports.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was younger,
I was part of the track and field team,

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I participated in many
local 5K and 10K competitions.

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who trained with me at the time
went on to become professional athletes.

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:11.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even competed in the Olympics.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I had a decision to make.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wouldn’t be possible for me
to keep training for track and field

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:22.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while trying to serve Jehovah.

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I had to have enough courage
to speak to my coach.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that,
I gave up being an athlete.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back now,
it wasn’t easy to leave those things behind,

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what Jehovah has given me today

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:40.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is much more valuable
than anything I gave up.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have the privilege of serving

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Bethel together with my wife,
who also gives her all in Jehovah’s service.

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can honestly say that I am

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly happy serving
Jehovah with all my heart.

We always admired friends
who had sacrificed a lot for Jehovah

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moved to a place

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.617 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where the need is greater.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.703 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And it’s always been our dream

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:17.454 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to experience it ourselves.

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the same time,

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we felt that we wouldn’t be able
to do something like that.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we had the desire,

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we felt that only superhumans

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could make that kind
of change in their lives.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On JW Broadcasting® of August 2015,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw a very encouraging video
about the Williams family

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they moved to Ecuador.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thought

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in reality there wasn’t
anything standing in our way, 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so why couldn’t we do the same?

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we discussed it and decided on a date

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:54.825 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—late November 2017—

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:57.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then we prayed to Jehovah.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:03.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I read the <i>2016 Yearbook</i>,

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.920 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the story about Indonesia

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.796 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
really touched me.

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that there is
a great need in many Asian countries,

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thought maybe Thailand.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to simplify our lives even more,
so we moved to a smaller apartment.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the special convention in Helsinki,

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.569 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we met a couple who lives in Thailand,

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.571 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and they gave us a lot of advice

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:34.573 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and encouragement.

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:39.870 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We wrote a letter where we told a bit

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.872 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about ourselves and then gave it

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:43.874 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the service committee in our congregation.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:45.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They then sent the letter

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the branch in Thailand.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sold our car,
and we also had the opportunity

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move in with Benjamin’s parents.

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:25.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We received tremendous help from all

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, we needed to find

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a place to live,

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a car, and to know where to shop for food.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their love and encouragement
has been invaluable.

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We received a letter from the Thailand branch

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.735 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in response to the letter we wrote earlier.

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:53.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They gave us information

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:55.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the living expenses

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:58.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some pointers about the culture,

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:01.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food, and our spirituality
in the new environment.

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have felt more comfortable

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivated by knowing

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:10.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have followed
the directions from Jehovah.

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:12.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have always felt encouraged

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reading experiences
about brothers and sisters

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have made sacrifices for Jehovah

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they have been blessed.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to experience it for yourself is amazing.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:30.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a problem or an obstacle arose,

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was there

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ready to help us.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we are happy to enjoy the privilege

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:39.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving Jehovah here.

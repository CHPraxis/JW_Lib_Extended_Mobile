00:00:22 We came to support the preaching campaign in Bolivia.
00:00:24 We live far away from here.
00:00:26 We come from Brazil.
00:00:27 Do you want to know why we came here?
00:00:31 This is my dad, my mom, and me.
00:00:34 My wife and I try to encourage Lívia to have spiritual goals.
00:00:42 Many other brothers also came, like Henrique and Cynthia,
00:00:45 who have been in Bethel for almost ten years.
00:00:47 What motivated me
00:00:49 to come to the campaign was the opportunity
00:00:52 to enhance my preaching skills
00:00:54 and the quality of my ministry.
00:00:58 My name is Thainá.
00:01:00 I’m 22 years old.
00:01:02 I really want to be a pioneer
00:01:03 —to be in full-time service— but because of my circumstances,
00:01:07 I haven’t been able to start yet.
00:01:09 But I wanted to be here because I knew that for these ten days,
00:01:12 I’d be living the life of full-time service.
00:01:16 Acts 16:9 says: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.”
00:01:21 That really applies to Bolivia.
00:01:23 In this case, it’s, ‘Step over into Bolivia and help us.’
00:01:26 It’s a very productive ministry with people
00:01:29 who need Jehovah and who are willing to learn about him.
00:01:36 I am a very anxious and insecure person.
00:01:39 I really, really wanted to come,
00:01:41 but there was a point when I got really anxious
00:01:44 about how it would be here.
00:01:46 And there was that insecurity, you know, about being in another place
00:01:48 with a different language.
00:01:51 No, we didn’t have much money at all.
00:01:53 We had to make some adjustments.
00:01:55 We had to plan our budget very carefully.
00:01:59 My mom was going to have surgery,
00:02:01 and it was going to be on the day that we were coming here.
00:02:06 We prayed to Jehovah and left the matter in his hands.
00:02:09 We decided to trust in him.
00:02:11 And in the end, Mom’s surgery was postponed.
00:02:18 We had the opportunity
00:02:20 to meet many brothers and sisters.
00:02:25 Every day someone invited us
00:02:27 to come to have some coffee or lunch.
00:02:29 Some don’t have much.
00:02:31 But the little that they have, they offer with such love, and it’s so good to feel this.
00:02:38 ‘Jehovah is so good,’
00:02:41 as Psalm 34:8 says.
00:02:43 Jehovah has given us the privilege of being used by him to contact these people.
00:02:50 The campaign helped me to improve my preaching skills.
00:02:53 With Jehovah’s help, I had some great conversations.
00:02:59 This campaign has been good for us
00:03:01 in so many ways. . .
00:03:03 . . . new culture, new friends,
00:03:05 feeling the warmth, the love of all the brothers.
00:03:12 The campaign has had a real impact on our daughter.
00:03:15 During our conversations,
00:03:17 we can see that her desire
00:03:18 to set spiritual goals has increased.
00:03:25 I wanted to stay longer here in Bolivia.
00:03:28 If I could, I’d stay here much longer
00:03:31 because ten days was really short—too short.
00:03:44 The campaign is motivating me a lot
00:03:47 to start full-time service,
00:03:49 to continue pursuing my goals.
00:03:53 It’s helped me to develop some qualities,
00:03:56 such as controlling my anxiety, my insecurities,
00:03:59 and trusting more in Jehovah.
00:04:03 When I look back on this campaign,
00:04:05 I know I’m going to miss it a lot
00:04:08 —the feeling of being a “mini missionary” for ten days.
00:04:13 We are taking to Brazil a wonderful experience
00:04:15 —beyond what we imagined when we made the decision to come here.
00:04:23 I would like to tell my parents
00:04:25 that I am very grateful for being able to come here.

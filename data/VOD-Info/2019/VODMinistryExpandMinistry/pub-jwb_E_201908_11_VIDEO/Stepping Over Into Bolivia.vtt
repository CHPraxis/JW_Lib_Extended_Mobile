We came to support
the preaching campaign in Bolivia.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live far away from here.

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We come from Brazil.

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:29.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to know why we came here?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my dad, my mom, and me.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I try to encourage Lívia
to have spiritual goals.

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many other brothers also came,
like Henrique and Cynthia,

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been in Bethel for almost ten years.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What motivated me

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to the campaign was the opportunity

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enhance my preaching skills

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the quality of my ministry.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Thainá.

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m 22 years old.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really want to be a pioneer

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:07.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be in full-time service—
but because of my circumstances,

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I haven’t been able to start yet.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I wanted to be here
because I knew that for these ten days,

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d be living the life of full-time service.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 16:9 says:
“Step over into Macedonia and help us.”

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That really applies to Bolivia.

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case, it’s,
‘Step over into Bolivia and help us.’

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very productive ministry with people

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who need Jehovah
and who are willing to learn about him.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am a very anxious and insecure person.

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really, really wanted to come,

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was a point when I got really anxious

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:46.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how it would be here.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was that insecurity,
you know, about being in another place

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:51.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a different language.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we didn’t have much money at all.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to make some adjustments.

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to plan our budget very carefully.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:01.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom was going to have surgery,

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:06.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was going to be on the day
that we were coming here.

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prayed to Jehovah
and left the matter in his hands.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to trust in him.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the end,
Mom’s surgery was postponed.

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had the opportunity

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet many brothers and sisters.

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day someone invited us

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:29.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to have some coffee or lunch.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:31.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some don’t have much.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the little that they have, they offer
with such love, and it’s so good to feel this.

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah is so good,’

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Psalm 34:8 says.

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us the privilege
of being used by him to contact these people.

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The campaign helped me
to improve my preaching skills.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,
I had some great conversations.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:01.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This campaign has been good for us

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many ways. . .

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . new culture, new friends,

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feeling the warmth, the love of all the brothers.

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The campaign has had
a real impact on our daughter.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our conversations,

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that her desire

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set spiritual goals has increased.

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:28.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to stay longer here in Bolivia.

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I could, I’d stay here much longer

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:35.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because ten days was really short—too short.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The campaign is motivating me a lot

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start full-time service,

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue pursuing my goals.

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s helped me to develop some qualities,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as controlling my anxiety, my insecurities,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trusting more in Jehovah.

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:05.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look back on this campaign,

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I’m going to miss it a lot

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the feeling of being
a “mini missionary” for ten days.

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are taking to Brazil a wonderful experience

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:19.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beyond what we imagined
when we made the decision to come here.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would like to tell my parents

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I am very grateful
for being able to come here.

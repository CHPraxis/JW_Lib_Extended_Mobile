O God, you know my rest and waking,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:17.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I lie down and when I rise anew.

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:25.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You search my thoughts, my inmost inclination,

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:28.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words I speak, the ways I walk,

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know them too.

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:41.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You saw when I was made in secret,

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My very bones not hidden from your sight.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You saw my form; its parts were down in writing.

00:00:56.604 --> 00:01:01.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the wonder of your ways

00:01:01.104 --> 00:01:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise your might.

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:12.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your knowledge, God, is wondrous, awe-inspiring;

00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:20.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of this my soul is very well-aware.

00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:27.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I should fear that darkness might enfold me,

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:36.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your spirit, God, would find me, even there.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where could I hide from you, Jehovah,

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:51.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or be concealed, be hidden from your face?

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:58.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not in the Grave nor in the highest heaven,

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:03.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not in the dark nor in the sea;

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:08.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is no place.

00:00:06 ‎Lovingly Jehovah ‎Made provision through his Son
00:00:17 ‎For our sins to be forgiven ‎And for death to be undone.
00:00:28 ‎If we truly are repentant, ‎His forgiveness we can claim
00:00:40 ‎On the basis of Christ’s ransom, ‎Asking pardon in his name.
00:00:52 ‎We receive such mercy ‎When we act like God above
00:01:03 ‎And forgive each other freely, ‎Showing empathy and love.
00:01:14 ‎Putting up with one another, ‎Putting hurtfulness away;
00:01:26 ‎Showing honor to our brother, ‎Showing love’s surpassing way.
00:01:41 ‎Mercy is a virtue ‎That we all should cultivate.
00:01:52 ‎It will keep us from resentment, ‎From the bitterness of hate.
00:02:03 ‎When we imitate Jehovah, ‎Who is unsurpassed in love,
00:02:14 ‎We will truly be forgiving; ‎We will be like God above.

00:00:09 This is me and my fam’ly. We love being a fam’ly.
00:00:15 We love to do what fam’lies do. We can talk to each other.
00:00:23 We can talk to Jehovah. We know he cares a lot for me and you,
00:00:31 ’Cause he loves all kinds of people, And he loves your fam’ly too.
00:00:41 This is my family, And ev’ryone is special.
00:00:47 This is my family; We may be big or small,
00:00:53 But we are a family. Jehovah really loves my family.
00:01:06 We can do things together. We can do things forever
00:01:12 If we just listen and obey. We need someone to guide us.
00:01:20 We need someone beside us Who’ll be there ev’ry single day.
00:01:29 So Jehovah made the fam’ly, And I’m glad that I can say:
00:01:39 “This is my family, And ev’ryone is special.
00:01:44 “This is my family; We may be big or small,
00:01:50 But we are a family. Jehovah really loves my family.”

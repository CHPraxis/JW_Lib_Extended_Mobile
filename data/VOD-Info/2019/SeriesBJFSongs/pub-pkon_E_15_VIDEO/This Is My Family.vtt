This is me and my fam’ly.
We love being a fam’ly.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to do what fam’lies do.
We can talk to each other.

We can talk to Jehovah.
We know he cares a lot for me and you,

00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
’Cause he loves all kinds of people,
And he loves your fam’ly too.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:47.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my family,
And ev’ryone is special.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:53.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my family;
We may be big or small,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:02.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are a family.
Jehovah really loves my family.

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:12.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do things together.
We can do things forever

00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:20.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we just listen and obey.
We need someone to guide us.

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:28.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need someone beside us
Who’ll be there ev’ry single day.

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:39.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah made the fam’ly,
And I’m glad that I can say:

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is my family,
And ev’ryone is special.

00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:50.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is my family;
We may be big or small,

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:59.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are a family.
Jehovah really loves my family.”

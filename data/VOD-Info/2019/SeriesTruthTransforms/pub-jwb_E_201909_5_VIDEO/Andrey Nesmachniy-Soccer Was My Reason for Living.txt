00:00:05 Soccer was my reason for living.
00:00:09 I always dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player.
00:00:17 I thought that happiness came from fame,
00:00:23 a good career,
00:00:27 money.
00:00:29 When I was six, my parents signed me up for soccer.
00:00:36 I really loved playing soccer.
00:00:37 I spent all my time at the stadium, even late into the night.
00:00:42 When I was 12, I learned about Jehovah from my mom.
00:00:45 At that time,
00:00:46 she started studying the Bible.
00:00:48 And after about a year,
00:00:49 I began to preach from door to door.
00:00:52 When I was 17 years old, I finished school
00:00:55 and I received an invitation from the Dynamo Soccer Club in Kiev.
00:00:59 Oh, that was unforgettable!
00:01:03 Yes, my emotions were running high
00:01:05 because since childhood I had always dreamed of playing for Dynamo.
00:01:15 From that moment on, all my energy and all my time
00:01:17 were devoted to my career.
00:01:26 Every day we either trained or there was a game.
00:01:36 There was no time left for spiritual things.
00:01:42 Of course, being around people like that, I became just like them.
00:01:50 I led an immoral lifestyle
00:01:52 because huge amounts of money opened up many opportunities.
00:01:59 Going to nightclubs, the nightlife
00:02:02 —it was so immoral.
00:02:06 Everyone wants to be your friend and to meet you.
00:02:09 And, of course, this was tempting.
00:02:20 I also invested huge sums of money in real estate.
00:02:23 I wanted to create a foundation for the future and wealth for myself,
00:02:27 my family, and my relatives so that no one would be in need.
00:02:32 Yes, I was sure that this really was happiness.
00:02:36 This continued for nine years.
00:02:39 The turning point
00:02:41 was a conversation with management when an issue came up,
00:02:46 and they hurled insults at me.
00:02:49 At that moment, I felt worthless,
00:02:51 like a disposable cup
00:02:53 that you use and then crush
00:02:56 and throw away.
00:02:59 Besides, a new generation of soccer players was arriving
00:03:03 —many young guys.
00:03:05 I stopped being included in the starting lineup.
00:03:10 Also, the financial crisis began,
00:03:12 and real estate prices fell drastically.
00:03:15 I panicked; I didn’t know what to do.
00:03:19 And I started to think about the meaning of life:
00:03:22 ‘What really is the meaning of life?
00:03:25 ‘If it’s not a career, not money
00:03:27 —then what is it?’
00:03:30 And then I remembered everything that I learned
00:03:32 about Jehovah when I was a teenager.
00:03:35 I began to study the Bible again along with my wife.
00:03:40 After a year, I started preaching again, and in 2009,
00:03:43 I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:47 And this brought me so much joy and satisfaction.
00:03:52 These feelings can’t be compared to winning any medal or cup.
00:03:59 I realized that I couldn’t slave for two masters,
00:04:03 but I still had to play two more years for Dynamo Kyiv.
00:04:08 Although it was a difficult time,
00:04:11 I took advantage of this opportunity,
00:04:13 and I am thankful to Jehovah that a good witness
00:04:16 was given about his name.
00:04:18 There were some soccer players
00:04:21 who showed interest in the truth.
00:04:23 In 2011 when my contract ended,
00:04:27 I finished my professional career.
00:04:31 First Timothy chapter 6
00:04:33 encourages us “to place [our] hope, not on uncertain riches,
00:04:37 but on God,” and “to be rich in fine works.”
00:04:42 People ask me: “Do you regret it?”
00:04:45 “Maybe you’d like to come back; do you miss soccer?”
00:04:48 And I honestly and sincerely say no.
00:04:51 I don’t miss it, and I don’t want to go back
00:04:54 because my relationship with Jehovah—
00:04:57 Well, it can’t be compared to anything.
00:05:01 Everything that this world offers is all short-lived,
00:05:04 and it’s only an illusion.
00:05:07 People see only one side of the picture —the fame and the money.
00:05:11 The other side are the injuries and disappointments.
00:05:15 It’s very hard psychologically and emotionally;
00:05:18 you have no freedom.
00:05:22 That’s why it’s better to give the very best to the One
00:05:25 who appreciates it.
00:05:27 What you do for Jehovah will always bring you happiness,
00:05:31 joy, and satisfaction.

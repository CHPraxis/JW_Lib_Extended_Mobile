00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soccer was my reason for living.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always dreamed of becoming
a professional soccer player.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that happiness came from fame,

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good career,

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:29.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
money.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was six,
my parents signed me up for soccer.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really loved playing soccer.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent all my time at the stadium,
even late into the night.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 12,
I learned about Jehovah from my mom.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she started studying the Bible.

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after about a year,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to preach from door to door.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 17 years old,
I finished school

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I received an invitation
from the Dynamo Soccer Club in Kiev.

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that was unforgettable!

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my emotions were running high

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because since childhood
I had always dreamed of playing for Dynamo.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that moment on,
all my energy and all my time

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were devoted to my career.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day we either trained or there was a game.

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no time left for spiritual things.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:46.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, being around people like that,
I became just like them.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:52.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I led an immoral lifestyle

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because huge amounts of money
opened up many opportunities.

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going to nightclubs, the nightlife

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:04.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was so immoral.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone wants to be
your friend and to meet you.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, this was tempting.

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:23.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also invested huge sums
of money in real estate.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to create a foundation
for the future and wealth for myself,

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family, and my relatives
so that no one would be in need.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I was sure that this really was happiness.

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This continued for nine years.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The turning point

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a conversation with management
when an issue came up,

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:48.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they hurled insults at me.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, I felt worthless,

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a disposable cup

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you use and then crush

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and throw away.

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:03.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, a new generation
of soccer players was arriving

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many young guys.

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped being included in the starting lineup.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the financial crisis began,

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and real estate prices fell drastically.

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:19.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I panicked; I didn’t know what to do.

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:22.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I started to think about the meaning of life:

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What really is the meaning of life?

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If it’s not a career, not money

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—then what is it?’

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I remembered everything that I learned

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah when I was a teenager.

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to study
the Bible again along with my wife.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a year, I started preaching again,
and in 2009,

00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:51.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this brought me so much joy and satisfaction.

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These feelings can’t be compared
to winning any medal or cup.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:02.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I couldn’t slave for two masters,

00:04:03.722 --> 00:04:06.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still had to play
two more years for Dynamo Kyiv.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it was a difficult time,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took advantage of this opportunity,

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am thankful to Jehovah that a good witness

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:18.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given about his name.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were some soccer players

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:23.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who showed interest in the truth.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2011 when my contract ended,

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finished my professional career.

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy chapter 6

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:37.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourages us “to place [our] hope,
not on uncertain riches,

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:40.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on God,” and “to be rich in fine works.”

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People ask me: “Do you regret it?”

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:48.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maybe you’d like to come back;
do you miss soccer?”

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I honestly and sincerely say no.

00:04:51.854 --> 00:04:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t miss it, and I don’t want to go back

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:57.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because my relationship with Jehovah—

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it can’t be compared to anything.

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:04.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything that this world offers is all short-lived,

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:07.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s only an illusion.

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People see only one side of the picture
—the fame and the money.

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other side are
the injuries and disappointments.

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:18.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very hard psychologically and emotionally;

00:05:18.922 --> 00:05:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have no freedom.

00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:25.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it’s better
to give the very best to the One

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who appreciates it.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you do for Jehovah
will always bring you happiness,

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:34.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joy, and satisfaction.

00:00:03 My family are Hungarian Jews.
00:00:07 Most of them were killed in concentration camps.
00:00:11 That’s something that the Holocaust took from me
00:00:16 —it took the concept of family.
00:00:18 I needed explanations.
00:00:20 I needed to know why my family was murdered.
00:00:23 It made me really search at a very young age to see
00:00:27 if there was a real religion out there.
00:00:31 It was just a secular thing to be Jewish;
00:00:34 it was a cultural thing.
00:00:36 A friend of mine came up to me and said:
00:00:40 “I have to tell you something.
00:00:43 “I got this book from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:47 It is the most beautiful book I have ever read.”
00:00:50 I said, “Oh, I’ll read it.”
00:00:53 And it couldn’t have been a week later
00:00:56 that I got a knock on my door, and there were
00:00:59 two young women at the door who started to talk to me about the Bible.
00:01:06 Once I started having a study on a regular basis with Carolyn,
00:01:10 I enjoyed it more and more.
00:01:12 One day my father was home.
00:01:16 He just screamed at them
00:01:18 and basically threw them out of the house.
00:01:20 It just progressed after that.
00:01:23 There was just no peace at any time
00:01:26 and a lot of tears.
00:01:28 And I just couldn’t understand
00:01:30 why they weren’t even asking me:
00:01:33 “Well, what is it that you like about this religion?
00:01:36 “Who are these people?
00:01:37 Let us talk to—” No, nothing.
00:01:39 It was very, very hard.
00:01:42 Shortly after my baptism,
00:01:45 my mother came up to me, and she said:
00:01:48 “Your father and I are going out for the day.
00:01:51 You better not be here when we get home.”
00:01:54 I was 17 years old.
00:01:56 I didn’t know where I was going to go.
00:01:58 I didn’t know what I was going to do.
00:02:00 But I trusted in Jehovah.
00:02:02 And I picked up the phone, and I called my Carolyn.
00:02:06 In what seemed like minutes, there were brothers and sisters at the house.
00:02:10 They were putting my things into this truck and bringing it over to Carolyn’s house.
00:02:15 And she said, “You can live with me.”
00:02:20 Before I was baptized, I would drive back and forth
00:02:22 to school with a friend of mine.
00:02:25 Little by little, I was telling him what I was learning.
00:02:28 He said: “You know, I want to meet these people.
00:02:31 I have some questions.”
00:02:32 I had questions.
00:02:33 I asked them: “Why do we die?,
00:02:34 Why do we grow old?,” and so forth and so on.
00:02:37 And they went right to the Bible,
00:02:39 and when I left the house after that,
00:02:43 I said, “This is the truth!”
00:02:45 Growing up in my house, going to church every Sunday
00:02:49 was something that you had to do.
00:02:51 But when I became a teenager, then religion became less in my life,
00:02:55 and basketball became more.
00:02:56 Being a young man, you’d watch sports
00:02:59 and you’d see that sports players made a lot of money.
00:03:01 My teachers would tell my parents:
00:03:04 “He’s going to be a good basketball player.
00:03:05 “Take care of him.
00:03:06 “He could be worth, you know,
00:03:08 several hundred thousand dollars by the time he graduates.”
00:03:10 I received over 125 scholarships.
00:03:15 Now you’re talking about a free education
00:03:17 just because you can play basketball.
00:03:21 So I realized, you know, at an early age that playing
00:03:24 professional basketball could mean a lot,
00:03:26 not only for me but for my family.
00:03:29 So as far as God was concerned, I had a little interest in God
00:03:33 (like I would ask my mom questions),
00:03:35 but it wasn’t until Nancy brought me to the Witnesses
00:03:38 that really something just kicked in.
00:03:40 I was studying,
00:03:42 and my mom was downstairs in the basement.
00:03:45 I heard her crying, and I said, “What’s wrong?”
00:03:47 And she said, “I know you’re going to become one of those Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:03:51 So realizing in my mind
00:03:53 that I’m not going to become a basketball player
00:03:55 but that I’m going to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:03:57 because that’s more important
00:03:59 —that affected me many, many times.
00:04:02 When others found out
00:04:05 that I was going to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:04:07 people shied away.
00:04:09 People try to use you when they think
00:04:11 you can give them something or you’re going to be somebody big.
00:04:13 By going the direction of serving Jehovah completely,
00:04:16 you lost all the worldly people that you thought were your friends.
00:04:20 And so that was
00:04:23 in one summer that I started  the study with Brother Crespo,
00:04:26 and in six months, I was baptized.
00:04:29 And then we decided to get married.
00:04:34 The scripture that says
00:04:36 that ‘even if my own father and my mother would abandon me,’
00:04:39 that even ‘Jehovah would take me in,’
00:04:42 —it proved to be true in so many ways.
00:04:45 Once you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:04:49 you’re part of a family that will do anything for you.
00:04:52 We’ve had adversity over the years,
00:04:54 but Jehovah never said everything was going to be perfect.
00:04:57 What he says is that when you face these problems,
00:05:00 you will not face them alone.
00:05:02 And Jehovah has never let us down when it comes to that.

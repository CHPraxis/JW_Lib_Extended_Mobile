00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family are Hungarian Jews.

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of them were killed
in concentration camps.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something
that the Holocaust took from me

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it took the concept of family.

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed explanations.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to know why my family was murdered.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:27.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me really search
at a very young age to see

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was a real religion out there.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just a secular thing to be Jewish;

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a cultural thing.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A friend of mine came up to me and said:

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have to tell you something.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I got this book
from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the most beautiful book
I have ever read.”

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Oh, I’ll read it.”

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it couldn’t have been a week later

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I got a knock on my door, and there were

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two young women at the door
who started to talk to me about the Bible.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once I started having a study
on a regular basis with Carolyn,

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed it more and more.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day my father was home.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just screamed at them

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and basically threw them out of the house.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just progressed after that.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was just no peace at any time

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a lot of tears.

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just couldn’t understand

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why they weren’t even asking me:

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, what is it
that you like about this religion?

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who are these people?

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us talk to—” No, nothing.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very, very hard.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after my baptism,

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother came up to me, and she said:

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your father and I are going out for the day.

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You better not be here when we get home.”

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 17 years old.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know where I was going to go.

00:01:58.347 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what I was going to do.

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I trusted in Jehovah.

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I picked up the phone,
and I called my Carolyn.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what seemed like minutes,
there were brothers and sisters at the house.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were putting my things into this truck
and bringing it over to Carolyn’s house.

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said, “You can live with me.”

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I was baptized,
I would drive back and forth

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to school with a friend of mine.

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:28.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little by little,
I was telling him what I was learning.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “You know,
I want to meet these people.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:32.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have some questions.”

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:33.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had questions.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:34.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked them:
“Why do we die?,

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we grow old?,”
and so forth and so on.

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:39.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they went right to the Bible,

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I left the house after that,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “This is the truth!”

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in my house,
going to church every Sunday

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was something that you had to do.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I became a teenager,
then religion became less in my life,

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and basketball became more.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being a young man, you’d watch sports

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:01.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’d see
that sports players made a lot of money.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My teachers would tell my parents:

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:05.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s going to be a good basketball player.

00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take care of him.

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He could be worth, you know,

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several hundred thousand dollars
by the time he graduates.”

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received over 125 scholarships.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’re talking about a free education

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because you can play basketball.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:24.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I realized, you know,
at an early age that playing

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
professional basketball could mean a lot,

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for me but for my family.

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:33.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as far as God was concerned,
I had a little interest in God

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(like I would ask my mom questions),

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:38.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t until Nancy
brought me to the Witnesses

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really something just kicked in.

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was studying,

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mom was downstairs in the basement.

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard her crying,
and I said, “What’s wrong?”

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:51.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said, “I know you’re going to become
one of those Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:53.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So realizing in my mind

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m not going to become
a basketball player

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:57.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that I’m going to become
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:03:57.674 --> 00:03:59.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s more important

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that affected me many, many times.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others found out

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was going to become
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:09.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people shied away.

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People try to use you when they think

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can give them something
or you’re going to be somebody big.

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By going the direction
of serving Jehovah completely,

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you lost all the worldly people
that you thought were your friends.

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:23.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that was

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one summer that I started 
the study with Brother Crespo,

00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in six months, I was baptized.

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we decided to get married.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture that says

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘even if my own father
and my mother would abandon me,’

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:42.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even ‘Jehovah would take me in,’

00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:45.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it proved to be true in so many ways.

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:49.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:52.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re part of a family
that will do anything for you.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had adversity over the years,

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:57.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah never said
everything was going to be perfect.

00:04:57.484 --> 00:05:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he says is
that when you face these problems,

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not face them alone.

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:06.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has never let us down
when it comes to that.

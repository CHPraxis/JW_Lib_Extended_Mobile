00:00:01.985 --> 00:00:04.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet Juan Cayul from Chile.

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s of the Mapuche tribe

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:10.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a tribe which has faced
discrimination over the years.

00:00:10.193 --> 00:00:12.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the discrimination,

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some may be reluctant to use their language,

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:18.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mapudungún, in public.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This became a challenge for Juan,

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since he wanted to give
his best in the ministry for Jehovah.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mapudungún means ‘the speech of my land.’

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful and expressive language,

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s the language of my heart.

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 12 years old, I went to live

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my grandfather and my uncle’s family

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could study at a nearby school.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My cousins spoke Mapudungún a lot,

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:47.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made me really happy.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw that some of my classmates
didn’t understand their schoolwork,

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:57.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in math class,
I would try to help them out.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I started to think about becoming

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a math teacher so that I could really help others.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the head teacher told me
that because I was speaking

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mapudungún and because
I was helping my classmates,

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was going to lower my grades.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my father saw my grades, he was furious.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He accused me of being lazy and not studying.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He withdrew me from school,
and I went back home to Tromén.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dream of becoming a teacher

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was shattered.

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because my dad had suffered so much
as a victim of discrimination,

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told us that we
were not to speak Mapudungún.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think about everything that happened,

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes me very sad.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years later, I met Sylvia

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was Mapuche like me.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She proved to be a sensitive and loving person.

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spoke Mapudungún together,

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:08.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helped to relieve the bitterness

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt in my heart.

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:14.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time later, I learned about someone else

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who made me feel loved and valued—Jehovah.

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:20.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That changed my life.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All my pain disappeared

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once I got to know Jehovah.

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I studied the Bible

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Witnesses in Spanish.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when I started to preach and teach,

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:36.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used Spanish too.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:40.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I was out in service,
and as we approached a house

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:43.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an elderly Mapuche woman came to the door.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was scared.

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So straight away I greeted her in Mapudungún.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She invited us inside and spoke with us.

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:58.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the first time

00:02:58.328 --> 00:03:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had spoken about Jehovah in my mother tongue.

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On our way back, I was deep in thought,

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
praying to Jehovah
about how to help the Mapuche people.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many years passed

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I saw an answer to my prayers.

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day after the meeting, I received

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an invitation to be a speaker at the first assembly

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:27.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to include talks in Mapudungún.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t want to accept the assignment.

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:35.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt worthless because
of all the discrimination I had endured.

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed again and again to Jehovah

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:45.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and began to meditate a lot.

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was now giving me
an answer to my prayers.

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our true value.

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy, so very happy.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that Jehovah loved me

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cared for me
and that he would continue to help me.

00:04:27.483 --> 00:04:30.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a few years, not one,

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but several Mapudungún congregations were formed.

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now my wife and I,
as well as our two children,

00:04:37.126 --> 00:04:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serve in Mapudungún-language congregations.

00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:44.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been assisting with Mapudungún translation

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than seven years now.

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:51.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I tell the brothers and sisters
who work with me at the translation office

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about my childhood dream of becoming a teacher,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they tell me, “You’re our teacher now.”

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to say to my brothers
and sisters around the world:

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t put yourselves down.

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are precious; you are precious to Jehovah.

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will always help you.”

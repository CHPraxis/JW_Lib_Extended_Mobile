00:00:00 Our broadcast this month has the theme
00:00:03 “Cherish Your Privilege of Prayer.”
00:00:06 Do you think it’s appropriate
00:00:08 to label prayer as a miracle?
00:00:12 Miracles are described
00:00:13 in our New World Translation
00:00:15 “Glossary of Bible Terms”
00:00:17 as “actions or phenomena
00:00:21 “that surpass all powers
00:00:23 “known to humans and are attributed
00:00:26 to a supernatural agency.”
00:00:29 Does prayer fit that description?
00:00:33 The moment you say a prayer,
00:00:35 your innermost thoughts and feelings
00:00:38 are communicated instantly to the Creator
00:00:41 from wherever you are
00:00:43 —even if you pray silently.
00:00:46 That’s certainly beyond any power that humans know.
00:00:50 Therefore, the fact that a human
00:00:53 can call out to God in prayer
00:00:55 and be heard by him
00:00:57 is truly a miracle.
00:01:00 It’s only by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah
00:01:05 that we can approach his heavenly throne in prayer.
00:01:09 Today our lives are very complicated
00:01:13 and, in some cases, very troubled.
00:01:16 Whether young or old, there are times
00:01:20 we may feel overwhelmed with our problems.
00:01:23 At other times, we may simply feel alone and helpless.
00:01:28 What can we do?
00:01:31 The apostle Paul says that prayer will help.
00:01:35 Please open your Bible to Philippians 4:6
00:01:39 and listen to his spirit-inspired recommendations:
00:01:44 “Do not be anxious over anything,
00:01:48 “but in everything by prayer and supplication
00:01:51 “along with thanksgiving,
00:01:54 let your petitions be made known to God.”
00:01:57 So Paul is saying that in all circumstances of life,
00:02:01 prayer is essential.
00:02:03 While no one around us
00:02:06 can see the inner struggles we may be having,
00:02:10 Jehovah sees them.
00:02:12 What will he do?
00:02:14 Let’s read verse 7:
00:02:17 “And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding
00:02:21 “will guard your hearts and your mental powers
00:02:24 by means of Christ Jesus.”
00:02:27 This incomparable “peace of God”
00:02:30 is an unusual tranquillity
00:02:33 enjoyed by Jehovah’s dedicated servants,
00:02:37 even in the most trying circumstances.
00:02:40 Have you felt that inner peace
00:02:43 that results from intimate communication with Jehovah?
00:02:47 How much we benefit from prayer
00:02:51 is closely related to the strength
00:02:54 of our personal relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:58 A key factor in that relationship
00:03:01 is found at Psalm 37:3:
00:03:06 “Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;
00:03:09 reside in the earth, and act with faithfulness.”
00:03:14 Likely you’d agree that when we need to talk to someone about our worries,
00:03:18 we go to a trusted friend.
00:03:20 Why?
00:03:22 It’s because we’ve developed a relationship with him.
00:03:25 He knows us and our situation,
00:03:29 and we know we can count on him.
00:03:32 More than ever,
00:03:34 we need a close personal relationship with Jehovah.
00:03:38 For that to be possible, we must be convinced
00:03:43 that Jehovah knows who we are and that he understands us
00:03:48 —our situation, our worries,
00:03:51 our concerns, and our needs.
00:03:54 Notice what Jehovah promises
00:03:57 in verses 4 and 5:
00:04:00 “Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,
00:04:03 “and he will grant you the desires of your heart.
00:04:06 “Commit your way to Jehovah;
00:04:09 rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.”
00:04:14 Jehovah does know who we are.
00:04:17 He understands us better than anyone else,
00:04:21 even better than we understand ourselves.
00:04:24 He invites us to trust him,
00:04:27 and he promises to act in our behalf.
00:04:30 The miracle of prayer lets us experience
00:04:34 Jehovah’s love in a truly intimate way.
00:04:38 Our Father personally takes the time to listen to us;
00:04:43 he has not delegated that to anyone else.
00:04:46 However, you might be wondering,
00:04:49 ‛Why would the Creator of the universe want to listen to me?’
00:04:54 The inspired answer at 1 Peter 5:7 says:
00:04:59 “Because he cares for you.”
00:05:02 Your determination to keep doing
00:05:05 the best you can to serve him
00:05:08 in spite of all the problems you face
00:05:11 endears you to him.
00:05:13 He feels for you and is eager to help.
00:05:18 How does that make you feel?
00:05:21 At Psalm 116:1, it says:
00:05:26 “I love Jehovah
00:05:28 “because he hears my voice,
00:05:30 my pleas for help.”
00:05:32 Even though we can’t see him listening to us,
00:05:36 it’s as if we feel
00:05:38 Jehovah’s loving arms around us when we pray.
00:05:42 As a result, the more we pray,
00:05:46 the more our love and trust in him grows.
00:05:49 What else will help us
00:05:51 to build our love and trust in our God, Jehovah?
00:05:55 It’s more than recognizing that he hears our prayers.
00:05:59 We must be convinced
00:06:01 that he answers our prayers.
00:06:05 What evidence do we have that Jehovah answers prayers?
00:06:09 Let’s look at some specific answers to prayers,
00:06:13 both past and present.
00:06:15 Open your Bible to 2 Chronicles chapter 20.
00:06:19 When Judah was threatened by the combined forces
00:06:24 of Ammon and Moab and the mountainous region of Seir,
00:06:28 King Jehoshaphat humbly prayed for Jehovah’s help.
00:06:33 In verse 12, he prayed:
00:06:37 “O our God, will you not execute judgment on them?
00:06:42 “For we are powerless
00:06:44 “before this large crowd that is coming against us;
00:06:47 “and we do not know what we should do,
00:06:50 but our eyes are toward you.”
00:06:54 What was Jehovah’s answer?
00:06:56 There was no voice from heaven.
00:06:59 Jehovah caused a prophet to speak up.
00:07:02 Verse 15 says:
00:07:05 “Here is what Jehovah says to you,
00:07:08 “‘Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd,
00:07:12 for the battle is not yours but God’s.’”
00:07:16 Then verse 17 continues:
00:07:19 “You will not need to fight this battle.
00:07:22 “Take your position, stand still,
00:07:25 and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.”
00:07:30 Did you note the formula?
00:07:32 Jehovah’s dedicated servant is facing a serious problem.
00:07:36 He prays specifically,
00:07:40 and then he remains attentive to the answer.
00:07:44 The answer may have seemed strange to Jehoshaphat.
00:07:49 Jehovah didn’t provide a battle plan.
00:07:52 As strategies go, just walking out
00:07:56 to meet the enemy doesn’t sound like a very good one.
00:07:59 But Jehoshaphat discerned
00:08:02 that this was the answer from Jehovah,
00:08:04 and he let it direct his actions.
00:08:07 What happened?
00:08:09 Jehovah fought for Judah
00:08:12 by striking confusion into the ranks of the enemy
00:08:16 so that they slaughtered one another.
00:08:18 Jehoshaphat’s prayer was answered
00:08:21 in a mighty way.
00:08:24 We have examples in the first century
00:08:27 of collective prayers being answered.
00:08:30 One occasion was when King Herod
00:08:33 was out to gain the favor of the Jews,
00:08:36 so he had the apostle Peter imprisoned
00:08:40 and placed under heavy guard.
00:08:42 What would the congregation do?
00:08:44 Acts 12:5 gives us the answer:
00:08:49 “So Peter was being kept in the prison,
00:08:52 but the congregation was intensely praying to God for him.”
00:08:57 Did Jehovah answer their prayers in behalf of Peter?
00:09:01 The account in verses 7-11 tells us
00:09:06 that an angel of Jehovah led Peter out of jail
00:09:10 and delivered him to safety.
00:09:13 Imagine how these events must have drawn
00:09:18 the Christians in Jerusalem closer to Jehovah
00:09:21 when they saw that he had answered their prayers.
00:09:25 What about today?
00:09:28 Consider the example of our brothers in South Korea.
00:09:32 Over the years, more than 19,000 of our brothers
00:09:37 have been imprisoned as conscientious objectors
00:09:41 to military service.
00:09:43 Did you personally pray in behalf of these brothers
00:09:47 that they might endure in their faith
00:09:50 or that they might be released from prison
00:09:53 if it was Jehovah’s will?
00:09:55 We’re sure that you did.
00:09:57 In fact, many of you prayed for these brothers by name,
00:10:02 just as the congregation in the first century
00:10:05 prayed in behalf of Peter.
00:10:07 With what result?
00:10:09 In 2018, a series of court rulings in South Korea
00:10:14 finally recognized conscientious objection
00:10:18 to military service for religious reasons
00:10:21 as a fundamental human right,
00:10:25 and our brothers were gradually released
00:10:28 from their prison bonds.
00:10:30 What do you think?
00:10:32 Did Jehovah hear our prayers
00:10:35 in behalf of these dear brothers?
00:10:37 As a worldwide brotherhood,
00:10:40 there can be no doubt
00:10:43 that our incessant prayers to Jehovah
00:10:46 were a major factor in these marvelous developments,
00:10:51 and we praise and thank Jehovah
00:10:54 that he’s heard our prayers.
00:10:57 What does this review of how Jehovah answered the prayers
00:11:01 of his servants in the past and present do for us?
00:11:04 Doesn’t it build confidence that Jehovah
00:11:08 is listening to and acting on the prayers of his people?
00:11:12 The apostle John had that confidence.
00:11:16 He wrote at 1 John 5:14:
00:11:21 “And this is the confidence that we have toward him,
00:11:25 “that no matter what we ask according to his will,
00:11:28 he hears us.”
00:11:31 But now the question is:
00:11:33 When was the last time that Jehovah answered
00:11:36 one of your personal prayers?
00:11:39 We spend much time on learning
00:11:42 how to pray and what to pray for,
00:11:45 but do we put forth enough effort
00:11:48 in identifying the answers to our prayers?
00:11:52 For us to have the closeness to Jehovah,
00:11:56 we must be certain that he’s listening
00:11:59 and responding to our personal prayers.
00:12:02 It may not always be readily discernible
00:12:06 just how some prayers are answered.
00:12:09 So, what can we do?
00:12:11 Take time to meditate on Jehovah’s response
00:12:15 to your prayerful requests.
00:12:18 If you’re married,
00:12:20 freely discuss matters that you have prayed for in common
00:12:24 and how Jehovah may be answering those prayers.
00:12:28 Be observant and alert to things that are happening around you,
00:12:33 and learn to connect these things
00:12:36 with the answers to your prayers.
00:12:39 Make your prayers more specific,
00:12:42 and you’ll become more keenly aware of Jehovah’s answers
00:12:46 —even though they may be subtle.
00:12:50 Identifying your answered prayers
00:12:54 will make Jehovah more real to you.
00:12:58 This process of identifying answers to our prayers
00:13:02 should be learned early on in one’s spiritual development.
00:13:07 We cannot take it for granted that our children
00:13:12 or our Bible students will connect the answers
00:13:16 they receive to the prayers they’ve offered.
00:13:19 One Witness said,
00:13:21 “I find that people feel closer to God
00:13:25 “if I help them to recognize
00:13:27 answers to their prayers.”
00:13:30 What if we can’t identify
00:13:33 the answer to one of our prayers?
00:13:36 Does that mean it wasn’t according to Jehovah’s will?
00:13:40 Not necessarily.
00:13:43 There are two important factors that might be involved.
00:13:47 One is that Jehovah knows
00:13:50 the best time and way
00:13:53 to answer our prayers.
00:13:56 He takes all matters into consideration.
00:14:00 The answer may not come
00:14:02 according to our timetable, but it will come.
00:14:07 So we must be patient
00:14:09 and keep looking for the answer.
00:14:12 The second factor that Jehovah considers
00:14:16 is the issue raised by Satan
00:14:19 regarding man’s integrity.
00:14:21 Listen again to the challenge Satan makes
00:14:25 as recorded at Job 1:10, 11:
00:14:31 “Have you not put up a protective hedge
00:14:33 “around him and his house and everything he has?
00:14:37 “You have blessed the work of his hands,
00:14:39 “and his livestock has spread out in the land.
00:14:43 “But, for a change, stretch out your hand
00:14:46 “and strike everything he has,
00:14:48 and he will surely curse you to your very face.”
00:14:52 Jehovah permitted this issue
00:14:55 to be raised out of love for his intelligent creatures.
00:14:59 He permitted Job to undergo a test
00:15:02 by Satan before the entire universe.
00:15:06 Jehovah gives his creatures the privilege
00:15:10 of proving the Devil a liar and of removing the slander
00:15:14 not only from God’s name
00:15:16 but also from their own.
00:15:19 So Jehovah, seeing the entire issue,
00:15:23 may allow his servants to endure trials.
00:15:26 But that doesn’t mean
00:15:29 he’s not answering the prayer of the afflicted.
00:15:32 When we are under trial, we may have prayed for relief,
00:15:37 but we may have also prayed:
00:15:40 “Let your name be sanctified.”
00:15:43 We must remain convinced that Jehovah
00:15:47 will not simply answer a prayer;
00:15:49 he will provide the best answer.
00:15:53 Isn’t it true that when we maintain our integrity,
00:15:58 even through serious illness,
00:16:01 it can be a tremendous witness to others?
00:16:04 That was the case with Jerod Septer.
00:16:11 God’s Word says:
00:16:14 “Remember, then, your Grand Creator
00:16:16 “in the days of your youth,
00:16:18 before the days of distress come.”
00:16:22 And “the days of distress”
00:16:24 —they arrived early on Jerod at 11.
00:16:28 Jerod was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.
00:16:34 We started trying to figure out how we could get him
00:16:37 the treatment that he needed, of course, but in no way would we accept
00:16:40 a blood transfusion, and neither would Jerod.
00:16:43 When Jerod was in the hospital, Child Protective Services
00:16:48 did investigate us.
00:16:49 They were concerned there was negligence.
00:16:51 It was just adding to the pain.
00:16:54 The way it turned out, they backed completely away from that.
00:16:58 They realized that we hadn’t been negligent.
00:17:00 So as we faced different situations, we’d pray at the time,
00:17:04 not to have miraculous answers,
00:17:07 but for Jehovah to open our eyes and to be able to find things.
00:17:12 And it seemed as though he was really directing us,
00:17:15 so that we could take care of ourselves spiritually
00:17:18 through this situation as well as take care of Jerod’s medical needs.
00:17:23 I remember
00:17:25 many times falling on my knees
00:17:28 and praying and thinking: ‘This is it.
00:17:31 I’m tested beyond what I can bear.’
00:17:34 And Jehovah would strengthen me.
00:17:36 And someone would come,
00:17:38 or they would say something.
00:17:41 And they fed us.
00:17:43 The brother made a schedule, and he said,
00:17:46 “You’re going to feed these friends.”
00:17:48 And the brother’s instructions were:
00:17:50 “You don’t bring it and just drop off the food.
00:17:52 You stay with those friends.”
00:17:54 It made me cry
00:17:57 —the love and the care that we experienced.
00:17:59 One time, I remember
00:18:01 the hallways of this hospital
00:18:03 —1,500 miles (2,400 km) away from our home—
00:18:06 started filling up with people.
00:18:09 To me, that was answering prayers too.
00:18:13 It was hard for us to get out of the hospital,
00:18:16 so they recorded talks.
00:18:18 They would look us in the eye, and they’d say:
00:18:20 “Now, you need to listen to this.
00:18:22 It will keep you strong.”
00:18:25 Jerod was worried about us, and he made it clear
00:18:28 that he was going to be fine.
00:18:31 He just didn’t know if we were going to be.
00:18:33 He died
00:18:36 in June of 1992.
00:18:40 He was at home.
00:18:42 And the last thing he said to us was,
00:18:45 “Work hard so we can all be together again.”
00:18:57 It’s numbing
00:18:59 because it’s almost like you’re living a nightmare
00:19:03 because you never think that those things will happen to you,
00:19:10 but it did.
00:19:12 I didn’t want people to see me cry.
00:19:15 I didn’t want pity, and I didn’t—
00:19:20 Because of that
00:19:22 —those negative feelings— my imagination ran wild.
00:19:29 What helped me, I know,
00:19:31 was Gary putting into my heart and mind
00:19:35 that this is a fight.
00:19:37 It’s been a challenge for all mankind.
00:19:40 ‘If you make it hard on them, they won’t love you’
00:19:42 —Satan said that about Jehovah and individuals.
00:19:46 So I would be giving in to that.
00:19:50 The strong feelings I had
00:19:52 and my sorrow almost made me stop.
00:19:56 I prayed a lot to go back to the Kingdom Hall.
00:19:59 The congregation cried; they lost a little boy.
00:20:04 It wasn’t just Gary and Beth.
00:20:06 They lost a little boy.
00:20:08 They cried,
00:20:12 and I didn’t feel alone.
00:20:15 And then we hugged; we cried together.
00:20:20 It really benefited us to get right back
00:20:23 into spiritual focus and to get our minds off ourselves.
00:20:26 And I could’ve given in to my pain and thought,
00:20:29 ‘Well, I’m too heartbroken.’
00:20:31 It made me have more joy
00:20:33 because I realized that now they have a hope.
00:20:37 People around us were vital
00:20:40 —the support system Jehovah has—
00:20:42 and his Word, his spirit.
00:20:45 Jehovah answered those prayers.
00:20:47 Our goal was really to stay
00:20:50 in the full-time ministry (maybe doing something else),
00:20:53 but we never, ever thought we would be in the circuit work.
00:20:57 But to have our daughter working with her husband in the circuit work
00:21:01 —it’s almost hard to believe that it’s happening.
00:21:05 We look forward to seeing Jerod again, having him back with us.
00:21:08 So I’m waiting, and I know I’m not going to be disappointed.
00:21:13 How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth
00:21:17 are able to take vacation time to travel occasionally
00:21:20 to see their daughter and her husband,
00:21:23 who are also serving in the traveling work.
00:21:26 And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jerod
00:21:31 felt Jehovah’s loving support as they prayed
00:21:35 throughout this heart-wrenching trial?
00:21:38 They asked for wisdom
00:21:40 when seeking medical treatment for Jerod.
00:21:43 Jehovah put his arms around them and listened
00:21:47 when they felt overwhelmed with grief and negative feelings.
00:21:51 He strengthened Jerod’s hope in the resurrection
00:21:55 and helped Brother and Sister Septer
00:21:58 stay spiritually strong.
00:22:00 Can there be any doubt
00:22:03 that Jehovah was answering their prayers?
00:22:06 Doesn’t that strengthen our conviction
00:22:09 that Jehovah will also answer Jerod’s prayer
00:22:13 that they all will be together again?
00:22:16 No, Jehovah didn’t miraculously cure Jerod.
00:22:21 But through his endurance and strong faith,
00:22:25 Jerod gave a witness to the universe
00:22:29 that even a child that trusts in Jehovah
00:22:33 can prove his loyalty to death.
00:22:36 Now, other situations
00:22:39 may turn out differently and not end up in death.
00:22:43 If an individual feels that relief
00:22:47 was because of Jehovah’s intervention,
00:22:50 he should certainly give thanks.
00:22:53 However, we must recognize that Jehovah knows
00:22:57 the best way to handle matters
00:22:59 so that it results in honor to his name
00:23:03 and to the lasting good of his servants.
00:23:07 Finally, it’s worth mentioning that the Bible
00:23:11 often connects our remaining spiritually alert
00:23:15 with our need to pray.
00:23:17 At Matthew 26:41,
00:23:21 Jesus said:
00:23:23 “Keep on the watch and pray continually.”
00:23:27 At 1 Peter 4:7,
00:23:30 Peter wrote:
00:23:33 “But the end of all things has drawn close.
00:23:36 “Therefore, be sound in mind,
00:23:39 and be vigilant with a view to prayers.”
00:23:44 Indeed, our prayers are so important.
00:23:47 Our personal prayers will help us
00:23:50 to remain spiritually alert and active in God’s service
00:23:55 as we await the great tribulation
00:23:57 that lies just ahead of us.
00:24:00 So in summary, our prayers to Jehovah
00:24:04 reveal the closeness of our relationship with him
00:24:08 and the degree of our dependence upon him.
00:24:12 They show the trueness of our faith,
00:24:15 the depth of our devotion,
00:24:18 and the genuineness of our appreciation.
00:24:22 Our prayers also help us to remain spiritually alert
00:24:26 as we endure these last days
00:24:29 before the great tribulation.
00:24:32 We’ll be drawn even closer to Jehovah
00:24:35 when we learn to recognize his answers to our prayers.
00:24:40 Yes, we can be assured that Jehovah
00:24:44 will not fail in giving us the desires of our heart
00:24:47 as we continue rendering him sacred service.
00:24:52 May we all cherish our marvelous,
00:24:55 miraculous privilege of prayer.

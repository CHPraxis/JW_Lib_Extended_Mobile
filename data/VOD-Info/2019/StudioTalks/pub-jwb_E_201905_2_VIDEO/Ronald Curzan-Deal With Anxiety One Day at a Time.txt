00:00:01 Do you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed
00:00:04 when life’s problems cause you anxiety?
00:00:07 Just trying to provide the necessities
00:00:10 for one’s family can lead to anxiety.
00:00:13 At the same time,
00:00:15 you might be dealing with a chronic or life-threatening illness,
00:00:19 caring for a sick or elderly relative,
00:00:22 grieving the death of a loved one,
00:00:25 loneliness, a natural disaster,
00:00:29 or maybe you’re struggling with the devastating effects
00:00:33 of past or present abuse.
00:00:36 Now, you firmly believe that God’s Kingdom will fix these problems,
00:00:41 but that’s in the future.
00:00:43 What about today?
00:00:46 Perhaps you feel like David,
00:00:49 who prayed at Psalm 13:2:
00:00:51 “How long will I have anxious concern,
00:00:54 with grief in my heart each day?”
00:00:58 A sister who has struggled with anxiety for many years wrote this:
00:01:05 “Anxiety robs me of sleep,  impacts my health,
00:01:10 affects the way I treat others, and makes me want to give up.”
00:01:15 She added: “Anxiety is like a monster
00:01:19 “that lives in my body somewhere between my heart and my belly.
00:01:24 “I cannot wait for Jehovah to kill that monster in the new world.
00:01:28 “But until then, the monster snarls and tears at my insides
00:01:33 and tries to take over my life.”
00:01:37 Can you identify with her feelings?
00:01:40 We often hear a person say concerning anxiety:
00:01:44 “I’m just trying to take it one day at a time.”
00:01:48 But one brother put it this way:
00:01:50 “I try to take it one day at a time,
00:01:53 but sometimes several days attack me at once.”
00:01:58 For so many of us, anxiety is a daily struggle.
00:02:04 If you battle with anxiety,
00:02:06 please know this: You are not alone.
00:02:10 Do not give up the fight.
00:02:13 Jehovah and Jesus are aware of the anxieties
00:02:17 that weigh on your mind and that are deep in your heart.
00:02:21 The Governing Body knows that living in this system of things
00:02:26 is especially “hard to deal with.”
00:02:28 So the theme chosen for this program is
00:02:32 “Deal With Anxiety One Day at a Time.”
00:02:37 First, what is anxiety?
00:02:41 In the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:02:43 the word “anxious” occurs 19 times.
00:02:47 The first occurrence is in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.
00:02:51 Now, Jesus knew that people worried about how to provide for their family.
00:02:55 So at Matthew 6:25,
00:02:59 he gave this wise counsel:
00:03:02 “On this account I say to you:
00:03:05 “Stop being anxious about your lives
00:03:07 “as to what you will eat or what you will drink,
00:03:11 “or about your bodies as to what you will wear.
00:03:14 “Does not life mean more than food
00:03:17 and the body than clothing?”
00:03:20 The Study Bible note for verse 25
00:03:24 says that “the Greek term for ‘anxious’
00:03:27 “can refer to worry that divides a person’s mind
00:03:31 and distracts him, robbing him of joy.”
00:03:34 At Luke 12:29,
00:03:37 Jesus says to “stop being in anxious suspense”
00:03:41 or to “stop worrying.”
00:03:43 The study note here says
00:03:45 that the Greek word for “anxious suspense” was used
00:03:49 to refer “to ships being tossed at sea.”
00:03:52 It says that Jesus used it “figuratively
00:03:56 “for being anxious or unsettled,
00:03:59 “as if tossed about or wavering
00:04:02 because of doubt and anxiety.”
00:04:05 By saying “stop being anxious,”
00:04:08 Jesus recognizes that anxiety is already in progress.
00:04:13 He is very aware of our imperfect nature.
00:04:17 He knows that we tend to bring our worries from yesterday
00:04:21 (the would-haves, could-haves, and should-haves)
00:04:24 and our imagined worries about tomorrow
00:04:27 (the what-ifs) to today.
00:04:31 But ask yourself,
00:04:33 ‘How often have I worried myself sick about what might happen tomorrow,
00:04:38 only to find that tomorrow wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared it would be?’
00:04:44 Jesus also knows that anxiety can have real,
00:04:48 sometimes painful, consequences.
00:04:51 It can stop us from making spiritual progress.
00:04:55 Overthinking and overanalyzing our problems
00:04:59 can literally shut us down.
00:05:02 How, though, can we “stop being anxious”?
00:05:05 What’s the antidote?
00:05:08 Let’s consider four practical things we can do.
00:05:12 First, rely on Jehovah
00:05:15 and take one day at a time.
00:05:19 This is exactly what Jesus prescribed for us
00:05:22 at Matthew 6:33, 34:
00:05:27 “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom
00:05:31 “and his righteousness,
00:05:33 “and all these other things will be added to you.
00:05:36 “So never be anxious about the next day,
00:05:40 “for the next day will have its own anxieties.
00:05:44 Each day has enough of its own troubles.”
00:05:48 Verse 34 has a study note
00:05:51 telling us that “undue anxiety about what may happen in the future
00:05:55 “can adversely affect a person’s relationship with God,
00:05:59 causing him to rely on his own wisdom rather than on God’s.”
00:06:04 So, what’s the lesson?
00:06:06 Instead of relying on ourselves,
00:06:09 rely on Jehovah, and take one day at a time.
00:06:14 A cross-reference to Matthew 6:34
00:06:17 takes us to Exodus 16:4.
00:06:20 In this account,
00:06:22 Jehovah provided the Israelites with enough manna
00:06:25 for every day of their 40-year trek.
00:06:29 Could Jehovah have provided
00:06:31 a week’s worth of manna? a month’s worth? a year’s worth?
00:06:36 Of course.
00:06:38 So why did he only provide enough for each day?
00:06:42 Well, think about it.
00:06:44 When they stepped out of their tents each morning,
00:06:47 there was no question whether there would be manna on the ground or not,
00:06:52 and there was no question where it came from.
00:06:56 Jehovah never failed to provide for their needs,
00:07:00 not even for one day.
00:07:02 They also knew from the past that Jehovah
00:07:06 always provided for those who were loyal to him.
00:07:10 We too can look back at how Jehovah provided for his servants.
00:07:14 We can have complete confidence that Jehovah knows exactly
00:07:18 what we need when we need it
00:07:21 —for today, tomorrow, and for all eternity.
00:07:26 Even if we have such confidence,
00:07:29 why do we sometimes continue to feel anxious?
00:07:32 The simple answer:
00:07:35 We’re imperfect people trying our best
00:07:37 to serve Jehovah in Satan’s wicked world.
00:07:41 Daily challenges cause anxiety that can make us forget to rely on Jehovah
00:07:46 and take one day at a time.
00:07:48 So we need to add our second way to deal with anxiety:
00:07:53 Pour your heart out
00:07:55 to Jehovah in earnest prayer.
00:07:58 Read with me the reassuring words
00:08:00 at Philippians 4:6, 7:
00:08:03 “Do not be anxious over anything,
00:08:07 “but in everything by prayer
00:08:10 “and supplication along with thanksgiving,
00:08:13 “let your petitions be made known to God;
00:08:17 “and the peace of God that surpasses
00:08:20 “all understanding will guard your hearts
00:08:23 and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”
00:08:27 Paul doesn’t simply tell us not to be anxious,
00:08:31 but he tells us how.
00:08:33 He said “by prayer and supplication,”
00:08:37 which is earnest and specific prayer.
00:08:41 With what benefit?
00:08:43 The “peace of God . . . will guard your hearts.”
00:08:49 “Guard” was a military expression referring to troops
00:08:52 assigned to protect a city.
00:08:54 The inhabitants could sleep soundly
00:08:57 knowing that soldiers were guarding them at night.
00:09:01 In a similar way, when we have “the peace of God,”
00:09:05 our hearts and minds can rest.
00:09:08 This can prevent us from being overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.
00:09:13 How reassuring are the words of the psalmist
00:09:17 at Psalm 4:8:
00:09:20 “I will lie down and sleep in peace,
00:09:24 “for you alone, O Jehovah,
00:09:26 make me dwell in security.”
00:09:29 So when we feel trapped, like there’s no way out of our worries,
00:09:34 the peace from God gives us hope
00:09:38 that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.
00:09:41 What, though, must you do?
00:09:44 Turn your worries into deep, heartfelt prayers.
00:09:49 In fact, at 1 Peter 5:7,
00:09:53 Jehovah invites you to “throw all your anxiety on him,
00:09:56 “[and leave it with him]
00:09:58 because he cares for you.”
00:10:02 Jehovah is the one person who truly understands how you feel.
00:10:07 He knows every moment of your life
00:10:10 —why you feel or react a certain way.
00:10:13 He loves and values you personally
00:10:17 despite your imperfections, your anxieties,
00:10:20 your cares and worries.
00:10:23 He not only has the power to help you, he wants to.
00:10:29 Knowing this should move you to pray specifically,
00:10:33 expressing your deepest emotions
00:10:36 and pleading that he grant you peace of mind and heart.
00:10:41 To the extent you do so,
00:10:44 1 Peter 5:10 promises
00:10:46 that “he will make you firm,
00:10:49 “he will make you strong,
00:10:51 he will firmly ground you.”
00:10:56 Never underestimate the power of prayer!
00:11:00 Jehovah is always ready to help you
00:11:02 —one day at a time.
00:11:06 Our third way to deal with anxiety
00:11:09 is to read and meditate on God’s Word.
00:11:14 Let Jehovah speak to you.
00:11:16 Allow Jehovah’s thoughts to become your thoughts.
00:11:21 At Psalm 94:19,
00:11:24 notice how the psalmist admitted his own anxiety:
00:11:29 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:11:32 you comforted and soothed me.”
00:11:37 Yes, even servants of God can feel overwhelmed by anxieties
00:11:41 or, as one translation says, “burdened with worries.”
00:11:46 That in itself is comforting
00:11:48 that an inspired Bible writer struggled with anxieties.
00:11:52 But Jehovah “comforted and soothed” him,
00:11:57 calming his troubled heart.
00:12:00 God can do the same for us
00:12:02 through his inspired Word, the Bible.
00:12:05 Remember, the Bible is how Jehovah speaks to us.
00:12:09 Rather than allowing our emotions to run wild,
00:12:13 we can learn to focus our mind on upbuilding things,
00:12:18 such as what the apostle Paul listed at Philippians 4:8:
00:12:23 “Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,
00:12:28 “whatever things are of serious concern,
00:12:31 “whatever things are righteous,
00:12:33 “whatever things are chaste,
00:12:35 “whatever things are lovable,
00:12:37 “whatever things are well-spoken-of,
00:12:40 “whatever things are virtuous,
00:12:42 “and whatever things are praiseworthy,
00:12:45 continue considering these things.”
00:12:49 The footnote to verse 8 shows that “considering”
00:12:53 involves “thinking about” or “meditating on.”
00:12:57 We can and should meditate on positive things from the Bible,
00:13:02 replacing negative things that may enter our mind and cause anxiety.
00:13:07 Ask Jehovah to help you to find passages
00:13:11 in his Word that will soothe your heart.
00:13:15 Ask others what scriptures have calmed their heart during anxious moments.
00:13:20 Make your own personal list.
00:13:23 Then set aside time to read
00:13:25 and meditate on those passages.
00:13:28 Meditation is the doorway to your heart.
00:13:33 Meditation lets God’s thoughts affect you
00:13:36 on the deepest possible level.
00:13:39 Imagine that Jehovah is speaking directly to you,
00:13:43 because he is.
00:13:45 Never underestimate the power of God’s Word
00:13:49 —of letting Jehovah speak to you.
00:13:52 Our fourth way to deal with anxiety
00:13:56 is to share your feelings with a trusted friend.
00:14:00 Proverbs 12:25 says:
00:14:04 “Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down
00:14:08 “[or, as the footnote says, ‘depresses him’],
00:14:11 but a good word cheers it up.”
00:14:14 “A good word” can come from a fellow believer
00:14:17 who is motivated by God’s spirit and guided by his Word.
00:14:22 When the apostle Paul was alone in prison,
00:14:25 he prayed for encouragement
00:14:27 and Jehovah provided what he needed to cheer him up.
00:14:31 With a heart full of appreciation,
00:14:34 he said at Colossians 4:11
00:14:36 that “my fellow workers  . . . have become
00:14:39 a source of great comfort to me,”
00:14:41 or “a strengthening aid.”
00:14:44 What can you do if you feel weighed down or imprisoned by anxiety?
00:14:49 Like Paul, pray for encouragement.
00:14:54 Pray for someone you can talk to,
00:14:56 someone you can trust with your feelings.
00:14:59 The answer to your prayer may be an elder
00:15:02 or a mature Christian brother or sister.
00:15:06 But what if it’s difficult for you
00:15:08 to open up to others and confide in them?
00:15:12 Try the advice in the March 1, 1997, Watchtower article
00:15:17 “Are You Afraid to Trust Others?”
00:15:20 When confiding in someone
00:15:22 it says: “Reveal your concerns gradually.
00:15:26 “If he [or she] responds in an appropriate,
00:15:29 “sympathetic, and discreet way,
00:15:31 you might then try disclosing more.”
00:15:35 Even if it takes some effort,
00:15:38 never underestimate the power of our brotherhood.
00:15:42 Jehovah can use a fellow worshipper
00:15:45 to ease your mind of “anxious concern.”
00:15:48 Even at times when there’s no one to talk to,
00:15:51 we can let the experiences,
00:15:54 upbuilding music,
00:15:56 and talks on JW Broadcasting® be like
00:15:59 an encouraging hug from a trusted friend.
00:16:03 Yes, when we make the effort, we give Jehovah something to bless.
00:16:08 Jehovah can help us conquer the seemingly unconquerable.
00:16:13 That may not mean that we’ll completely eliminate anxiety,
00:16:17 but we can learn to take control.
00:16:20 How?
00:16:22 Remember our four ways:
00:16:24 First, rely on Jehovah
00:16:27 and take one day at time;
00:16:30 second, pour out your heart
00:16:33 to Jehovah in earnest, specific prayer;
00:16:37 third, read and meditate on God’s Word
00:16:40 —let Jehovah speak to you;
00:16:43 and fourth, share your feelings with a trusted friend.
00:16:47 With Jehovah’s help,
00:16:49 you can deal with anxiety one day at a time.

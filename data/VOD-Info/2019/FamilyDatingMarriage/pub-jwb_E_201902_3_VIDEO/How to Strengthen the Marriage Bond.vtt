My name is Kiara,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s my husband, Shaan.

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our son Akil moved out recently

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help where the need is greater.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t realize
just how much he made us laugh.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss that.

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just more quiet now.

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:40.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt we were growing apart.

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried talking to him.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t go well.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since Akil left,

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things have been off
between Kiara and I.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is so serious now.

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish she would just lighten up

00:02:19.243 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and laugh more,

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like when Akil was still here.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As much as I hated to admit it,

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it felt like we were growing apart.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Akil noticed.

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyway, can I ask you guys a question?

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you both doing OK?

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you don’t look OK.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we’re OK.
OK?

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:50.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re doing wonderful, right?

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we’re doing good.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is good.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t fooling anyone

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except maybe ourselves.

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:07.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for the first time,

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we both revealed to each other

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how we had been really feeling.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew we were headed down
a dangerous path.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to do something
—fast.

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read aloud the scripture

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:10:

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:36.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought about Abraham and Sarah.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:42.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t perfect,

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:46.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they worked hard
to show honor to each other

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:50.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by listening and by caring.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Kiara, “I know I can do better.”

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I wanted to

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:09.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I love her so much.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Shaan,
“Let’s both try to do better.”

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we did.

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:05.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few months later,
we decided to pioneer together.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it seemed we had
a lot to talk about.

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I was seeing 
a whole new side of Kiara.

00:05:16.378 --> 00:05:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Abraham and Sarah,
our marriage wasn’t perfect.

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:23.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are going to be stressful times.

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:28.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by working hard
to apply Bible principles,

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:30.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we got through that rough patch

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:35.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it drew us even closer together.

00:00:34 From 1999 to the present,
00:00:36 we have greatly diminished
00:00:38 the number of products
00:00:39 that we transfuse.
00:00:41 Can we do better? Absolutely!
00:00:43 There are many centers that still transfuse too much.
00:00:47 Our surgeons got incredibly fantastic
00:00:50 about doing procedures differently
00:00:53 —using advanced technology to do procedures
00:00:55 that now don’t require a blood transfusion.
00:00:57 All of this has benefited
00:00:58 the vast majority of patients
00:01:00 in not just the individuals of religious beliefs
00:01:03 who don’t want to be transfused
00:01:05 but also in patients who we recognize
00:01:07 that transfusion may not be the right answer to their problem.
00:01:10 In 2008, we were using 18,000 red cells per year,
00:01:14 and now we are just sneaking under 10,000;
00:01:17 so that’s a dramatic reduction in the amount of blood that was transfused.
00:01:20 We can easily identify anemia before the start of the surgery,
00:01:24 ensure that it is well treated without blood products right from the start,
00:01:29 and afterward potentially go through the surgery without transfusion.
00:01:40 The key to managing Witness patients
00:01:43 who are pregnant is planning.
00:01:44 It’s crucial, you know.
00:01:46 And you can’t really take care of any patient,
00:01:49 but particularly a Witness patient,  without a plan.
00:01:53 You know,  they have pregnancies like anyone else,
00:01:55 so they’re not particularly at risk.
00:01:58 On my birthing record, I put it in big;
00:02:02 and it’s on the top of the paper.
00:02:04 And I want people to understand that these are the wishes of the patient
00:02:08 —be aware of it, be sensitive to it,
00:02:11 and be prepared to deal very quickly
00:02:16 if there is any concern of blood loss
00:02:18 or developing, or evolving, postpartum hemorrhage
00:02:21 or hemorrhage at any point in the delivery process.
00:02:23 So when blood is not an option, obviously we have to get more creative.
00:02:28 If we have a Jehovah’s Witness patient  that’s coming in to deliver—
00:02:31 Often, we’re sent patients that are very complex.
00:02:34 They may have some risk factors
00:02:37 for having a major postpartum hemorrhage identified before they deliver.
00:02:41 We have a case conference with everybody involved in the care of that patient,
00:02:45 and we come up with a strategy
00:02:47 —what we do before, what we do during delivery,
00:02:49 and what we’re going to do after.
00:02:51 And it’s a multifaceted, multidisciplinary
00:02:54 team approach to managing those patients.
00:02:57 We just have everything ready to go.
00:02:59 We embrace the idea that we should respectfully treat
00:03:02 the wishes of the Jehovah’s Witness patients.
00:03:10 There’s actually a bit of controversy about whether or not
00:03:12 patient blood management improves patient outcomes;
00:03:15 but there are some pretty large studies from the United States in cardiac surgery,
00:03:20 particularly, showing that the outcomes
00:03:23 are at least as good and possibly better with patient blood management.
00:03:26 So certainly there’s no harm in trying to use a blood-avoidance strategy.
00:03:31 I have not found there to be any difference
00:03:33 in the outcome of Witness patients and non-Witness patients.
00:03:37 There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of surgery on a Witness patient.
00:03:42 My experience is that the end results are the same.
00:03:47 Just the other day,
00:03:49 I was doing a fairly complex patient
00:03:54 —a complex operation on a Jehovah’s Witness patient.
00:03:57 And something that has not been really described very frequently
00:04:01 is where we actually cool a patient down
00:04:03 —we actually exsanguinate the patient into a moving circuit
00:04:06 in order to see the operative field in a very clear area.
00:04:11 I mean, that’s a pretty massive shifting of volume,
00:04:15 and we were able to do it in a bloodless manner in terms of transfusion.
00:04:18 So I think we embrace the fact
00:04:21 that there are many complex cases that we can do.
00:04:23 I’ve only had positive experiences; I haven’t had negative experiences.
00:04:28 I think the biggest part is communication.

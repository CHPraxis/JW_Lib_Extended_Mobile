From 1999 to the present,

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we have greatly diminished

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:39.476 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the number of products

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.312 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we transfuse.

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we do better?
Absolutely!

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:47.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many centers
that still transfuse too much.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:50.487 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our surgeons got incredibly fantastic

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about doing procedures differently

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—using advanced technology to do procedures

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that now don’t require a blood transfusion.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:58.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
All of this has benefited

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:00.998 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the vast majority of patients

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:03.626 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in not just the individuals of religious beliefs

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:05.336 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who don’t want to be transfused

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in patients who we recognize

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that transfusion may not be
the right answer to their problem.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2008,
we were using 18,000 red cells per year,

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we are just sneaking under 10,000;

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that’s a dramatic reduction
in the amount of blood that was transfused.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can easily identify anemia
before the start of the surgery,

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensure that it is well treated
without blood products right from the start,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and afterward potentially go
through the surgery without transfusion.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.040 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The key to managing Witness patients

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who are pregnant is planning.

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s crucial, you know.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can’t really take care of any patient,

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but particularly a Witness patient, 
without a plan.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.636 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You know, 
they have pregnancies like anyone else,

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so they’re not particularly at risk.

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On my birthing record, I put it in big;

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s on the top of the paper.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want people to understand
that these are the wishes of the patient

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—be aware of it, be sensitive to it,

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be prepared to deal very quickly

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there is any concern of blood loss

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:21.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or developing, or evolving,
postpartum hemorrhage

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or hemorrhage
at any point in the delivery process.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when blood is not an option,
obviously we have to get more creative.

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:31.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have a Jehovah’s Witness patient 
that’s coming in to deliver—

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, we’re sent patients
that are very complex.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have some risk factors

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:41.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for having a major postpartum hemorrhage
identified before they deliver.

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a case conference with everybody
involved in the care of that patient,

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we come up with a strategy

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what we do before,
what we do during delivery,

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we’re going to do after.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:54.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a multifaceted, multidisciplinary

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
team approach to managing those patients.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:02:59.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just have everything ready to go.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We embrace the idea
that we should respectfully treat

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wishes of the Jehovah’s Witness patients.

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s actually a bit
of controversy about whether or not

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
patient blood management
improves patient outcomes;

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there are some pretty large studies
from the United States in cardiac surgery,

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly, showing that the outcomes

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are at least as good and possibly better
with patient blood management.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So certainly there’s no harm
in trying to use a blood-avoidance strategy.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:33.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have not found there to be any difference

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the outcome
of Witness patients and non-Witness patients.

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is absolutely no reason
to be afraid of surgery on a Witness patient.

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:47.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My experience
is that the end results are the same.

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:49.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just the other day,

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:54.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was doing a fairly complex patient

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a complex operation
on a Jehovah’s Witness patient.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something that
has not been really described very frequently

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is where we actually cool a patient down

00:04:03.263 --> 00:04:06.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we actually exsanguinate
the patient into a moving circuit

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:11.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to see
the operative field in a very clear area.

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean,
that’s a pretty massive shifting of volume,

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:18.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were able to do it
in a bloodless manner in terms of transfusion.

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:21.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I think we embrace the fact

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are
many complex cases that we can do.

00:04:23.742 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve only had positive experiences;
I haven’t had negative experiences.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the biggest part is communication.

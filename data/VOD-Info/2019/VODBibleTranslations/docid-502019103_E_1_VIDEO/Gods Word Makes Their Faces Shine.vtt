January 21, 2017, became a special day

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for deaf people in Japan.

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:13.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses released
the book of Matthew

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Japanese Sign Language.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though, was behind these smiles?

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I used to read the Japanese Bible,

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t understand it,

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I forced myself to read—not much of a joy.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right, it was hard to understand
and explain to people.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible, written in a language
we do not know, will not move our heart.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having no sign-language Bible

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:49.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a huge disadvantage
when it came to cultivating a longing for God.

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When making shepherding calls,
reasoning on a scripture

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a deaf person was difficult if that scripture

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wasn’t translated into sign language.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a Bible in American Sign Language,

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I was envious and wanted to see the Bible

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Japanese Sign Language so much.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, approval was given for Bible translation

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Japanese Sign Language.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed that the translation team

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered a prayer
before they started each day’s work.

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, when faced
with difficult translation problems,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they relied on Jehovah’s holy spirit
through prayers

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could exercise good judgment.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was impressive.

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are various processes
needed for God’s Word

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to jump off the page
and reach the heart of deaf people.

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They considered carefully
 how to express scriptures

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that deaf people would understand.

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:53.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example:
“the lilies of the field” at Matthew 6:28.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t able to understand
Matthew chapter 6 until now.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always thought,
‘“Birds of heaven” and “lilies of the field,”

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do they have to do
with “seeking first the Kingdom”?’

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translators individually read and research

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the source text
to fully understand what they’ll translate.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the team meets to discuss the text

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explore ideas
for translating certain concepts.

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the translation is complete,

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the assigned brother signs the translation
to prepare the prompt video.

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then studio recording takes place,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referencing the prompt video.

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The recorded movie is carefully edited

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepared for delivery.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case,

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the signer pretends to be a flower

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weaves his own petals

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:53.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sews them on his face.

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he asks,

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Flowers don’t do that, do they?”

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word coming off the pages

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has reached the heart of deaf people.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood for the first time
that Jehovah is kindly teaching us,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you seek the Kingdom first,
I’ll give you everything you need.

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t worry.’

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:23.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was watching it
on the train on my way to work.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘Wow, this is so good!’

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was absorbed in the video,
and I missed my train station.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I changed trains, but again,

00:03:37.404 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was watching the video
and missed my station again!

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Matthew is that interesting.

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans have beneficial feelings

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are created in God’s image.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:04:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of Satan’s system of things,
these feelings are driven away.

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when you show God’s Word
to people or read it yourself,

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
innate beneficial feelings
well up in our hearts.

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I strongly feel that God’s Word
has the power to do that.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:19.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child grows up
listening to what their father says,

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:23.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can be closer to my Father,
Jehovah, by watching him

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak to me
in my native tongue, sign language.

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:29.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comments from deaf brothers show

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the sign-language Bible
talks to their heart directly.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:36.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I imagine that Jehovah loves our brothers,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his face is shining.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the faces of our brothers
are also shining.

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now by means of having God’s living Word

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the language of their heart,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our deaf brothers and sisters

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are seeing Jehovah’s face shining.

00:00:01 In January 2018,
00:00:03 a historic event was held in Denmark.
00:00:06 Over 51,000 viewers
00:00:09 were tied in live from 500 different locations
00:00:12 all over Scandinavia.
00:00:14 The New World Translation of the Bible
00:00:17 was simultaneously released in three languages:
00:00:21 Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish.
00:00:27 It’s easy to read, and it carefully
00:00:29 conveys the original message.
00:00:32 What is most outstanding with the New World Translation
00:00:35 is that it has restored God’s name according to the original text.
00:00:39 This is done out of respect for the author of the Bible,
00:00:43 who says at Isaiah 42:8:
00:00:45 “I am Jehovah. That is my name.”
00:00:50 Unfortunately, too few Scandinavians
00:00:52 know God’s name,
00:00:54 though it can be found in various places
00:00:56 with either Hebrew
00:00:58 or Latin characters.
00:01:03 It is pronounced in slightly different ways.
00:01:10 What’s the history
00:01:12 of the divine name in Scandinavia?
00:01:16 Before the 16th century,
00:01:19 the name was almost unknown
00:01:22 because the Christian churches mostly used
00:01:24 the Latin translation of the Bible called the Vulgate.
00:01:29 Ordinary people didn’t understand Latin.
00:01:31 Moreover, God’s name was replaced
00:01:34 with titles such as “Lord.”
00:01:37 In the 16th century,
00:01:39 some brave and skilled men translated the Bible
00:01:42 from the original languages where, remarkably,
00:01:45 they discovered God’s name written almost 7,000 times!
00:01:51 Sadly, these translators followed the long history
00:01:54 of replacing God’s name with titles,
00:01:57 although several of them retained God’s name at least a few times.
00:02:07 This burning desire to translate the Bible soon came to Scandinavia
00:02:11 and also the knowledge of the divine name.
00:02:16 The first complete Danish Bible
00:02:18 was released in 1550
00:02:20 by King Christian III.
00:02:22 In 1604,
00:02:23 a Danish theologian named Hans Poulsen Resen
00:02:26 met with King Christian IV
00:02:29 and pointed out some faults in the Danish Bible translation.
00:02:32 He was granted approval to translate
00:02:34 the Bible directly from the Hebrew
00:02:36 and Greek texts into Danish.
00:02:38 Interestingly, it contained God’s name in a marginal note.
00:02:43 The first Swedish translation
00:02:45 was released in 1541.
00:02:48 King Gustav II Adolf released
00:02:50 a revised version in 1618.
00:02:53 In a note on Exodus 6:3, it says:
00:02:56 “God reveals his name JEHOVAH, LORD.”
00:03:00 The first Scandinavian Bibles were mostly meant for church use.
00:03:04 But now, people could at least listen to God’s Word in their own language.
00:03:10 Even though God’s name was rarely used
00:03:12 in these early Scandinavian Bible translations,
00:03:15 the name was discovered
00:03:17 and started to be used in other contexts —for example, on coins.
00:03:22 God’s name was also used
00:03:25 in official royal mottos
00:03:26 of Swedish kings.
00:03:28 One of the mottos can even be found
00:03:30 on the front page of the Swedish law book
00:03:32 from 1608.
00:03:35 King Charles IX also instituted a Royal Order
00:03:39 called the Order of Jehovah.
00:03:43 Finally, a few translators took the important step
00:03:46 and reinstated Jehovah’s name
00:03:48 thousands of times in the Bible text.
00:03:52 The Danish priest Kalkar stated,
00:03:54 ‘Why the expression “Jehovah” is used instead of “Lord”
00:03:57 doesn’t even need to be defended.’
00:04:00 Some translators have shown
00:04:02 the same respect for Jehovah’s name to this day.
00:04:06 The Bible contains
00:04:08 many other names that we feel free to use,
00:04:10 so why shouldn’t we use the name of the only true God, Jehovah?
00:04:18 Because this translation uses his name,
00:04:21 it’s much easier to get to know the person
00:04:23 behind the name.
00:04:26 If I didn’t know God’s name,
00:04:28 it would have been difficult for me to have a personal
00:04:31 and close relationship with him.
00:04:34 This translation will be perfect for us to use
00:04:36 when we teach our children.
00:04:39 I really look forward to using it to teach
00:04:41 others about God.
00:04:43 It’s amazing!
00:04:45 Thank you, Jehovah!
00:04:58 In one of the most secular areas in the world,
00:05:02 God’s statement at Exodus 3:15 still proves to be true:
00:05:06 “Jehovah . . . is my name forever,
00:05:09 and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation.”

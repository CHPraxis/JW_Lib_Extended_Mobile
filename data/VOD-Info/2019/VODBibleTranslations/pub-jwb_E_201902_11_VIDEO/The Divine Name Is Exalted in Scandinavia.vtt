In January 2018,

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:06.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a historic event was held in Denmark.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 51,000 viewers

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were tied in live
from 500 different locations

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all over Scandinavia.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The New World Translation of the Bible

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was simultaneously released
in three languages:

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s easy to read, and it carefully

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveys the original message.

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is most outstanding
with the New World Translation

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it has restored God’s name
according to the original text.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is done out of respect
for the author of the Bible,

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who says at Isaiah 42:8:

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“I am Jehovah. That is my name.”

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:52.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately, too few Scandinavians

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:54.033 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
know God’s name,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
though it can be found in various places

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with either Hebrew

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:01.332 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or Latin characters.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:06.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is pronounced in slightly different ways.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What’s the history

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.637 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the divine name in Scandinavia?

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before the 16th century,

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:22.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the name was almost unknown

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Christian churches
mostly used

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Latin translation
of the Bible called the Vulgate.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ordinary people didn’t understand Latin.

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:34.531 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Moreover, God’s name was replaced

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.617 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with titles such as “Lord.”

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 16th century,

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some brave and skilled men
translated the Bible

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the original languages where,
remarkably,

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they discovered God’s name
written almost 7,000 times!

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, these translators
followed the long history

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of replacing God’s name with titles,

00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although several of them
retained God’s name at least a few times.

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This burning desire to translate
the Bible soon came to Scandinavia

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:15.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the knowledge of the divine name.

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first complete Danish Bible

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was released in 1550

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by King Christian III.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1604,

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Danish theologian
named Hans Poulsen Resen

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
met with King Christian IV

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pointed out some faults
in the Danish Bible translation.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was granted approval to translate

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.844 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible directly from the Hebrew

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:38.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Greek texts into Danish.

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:42.933 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, it contained
God’s name in a marginal note.

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first Swedish translation

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was released in 1541.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.941 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
King Gustav II Adolf released

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a revised version in 1618.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:56.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In a note on Exodus 6:3, it says:

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.241 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“God reveals his name JEHOVAH, LORD.”

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first Scandinavian Bibles
were mostly meant for church use.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, people could at least listen
to God’s Word in their own language.

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:12.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though God’s name was rarely used

00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in these early
Scandinavian Bible translations,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the name was discovered

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to be used in other contexts
—for example, on coins.

00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.100 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
God’s name was also used

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.477 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in official royal mottos

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:28.479 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Swedish kings.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.522 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the mottos can even be found

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the front page of the Swedish law book

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 1608.

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Charles IX also instituted a Royal Order

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called the Order of Jehovah.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:46.330 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Finally, a few translators took the important step

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.499 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and reinstated Jehovah’s name

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
thousands of times in the Bible text.

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.421 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Danish priest Kalkar stated,

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.549 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Why the expression “Jehovah”
is used instead of “Lord”

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.343 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t even need to be defended.’

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:02.846 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some translators have shown

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:05.390 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the same respect
for Jehovah’s name to this day.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.143 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many other names that we feel free to use,

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so why shouldn’t we use the name
of the only true God, Jehovah?

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:21.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this translation uses his name,

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:23.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s much easier to get to know the person

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind the name.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:28.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I didn’t know God’s name,

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would have been difficult
for me to have a personal

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:34.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and close relationship with him.

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:36.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This translation will be perfect for us to use

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we teach our children.

00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:41.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really look forward to using it to teach

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others about God.

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing!

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah!

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:02.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one of the most secular areas
in the world,

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:06.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s statement at Exodus 3:15
still proves to be true:

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah . . . is my name forever,

00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:14.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is how I am to be remembered
from generation to generation.”

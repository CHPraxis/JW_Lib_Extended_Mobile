A special event took place
on December 16, 2017,

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was a milestone in the history
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around 8,000 Witnesses

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended at a sports arena in Rome.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers were also tied in from all
the Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout Italy
and Italian-speaking Switzerland.

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first part of the program

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowed the audience to relive the history

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures </i>in Italy.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 1950’s and 1960’s,

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was difficult to obtain
a copy of the Bible.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People could only purchase them

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the few religious bookstores
existing then.

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those years,

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:58.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many who were interested
in God’s Word flooded into the congregations.

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to provide them with Bibles,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
large quantities of various editions

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were bought
and then distributed at cost.

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, those editions
were not always available.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when, in January 1967,
it was announced

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures</i>

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Italian would be printed,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was great excitement
among the brothers,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could finally all use
the same translation of God’s Word.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been
constant improvements made

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:31.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the <i>New World Translation</i>
through the years,

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has been made available
in various formats and editions.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On December 16, 2017,

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Samuel Herd,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented the new revised edition
of the <i>New World Translation </i>in Italian.

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By now you may be thinking,

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What about the
<i>New World Translation</i>

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our language?’

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will it ever be revised
like the <i>New World Translation </i>in English?’

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think is in this package?

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:53.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so moved

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it brought me to tears.

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:58.866 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was near some elderly ones

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.367 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when the Bible was released.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:01.869 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just thinking about their

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endurance through the years

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now to be holding
a new revised edition of the Bible

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it really touched me
to see their joy when they received it.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:12.921 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was really moving and very touching

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:14.965 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to see the brothers open their Bibles

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:16.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leaf through them.

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had been waiting for years.

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:22.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like a little child.

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so excited

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:27.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like when you know
your dad is going to give you a present.

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know it’s coming,
but you don’t know when.

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it arrives,
you just jump for joy.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:37.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Mattia,
and this Bible is my present from Jehovah.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t wait to read the Bible
all over again from the beginning.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:01.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will definitely make
daily Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:09.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really felt Jehovah’s tender care for me.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All 284,258

00:04:15.984 --> 00:04:18.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending the event in Rome

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or tied in from other locations
received a copy

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:26.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the much-awaited gift
—an expression of the deep love of Jehovah,

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:28.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Author of the Holy Bible.

00:00:03 In 2013, our English-printed Bibles
00:00:07 were revised and, shortly thereafter,
00:00:09 the Braille Bibles were approved
00:00:11 to be revised in English and Portuguese.
00:00:14 We knew it was going to be a large job.
00:00:17 We were having problems
00:00:18 with the pages either tearing
00:00:20 or coming completely out of the Bible.
00:00:22 We tried changing the paper to see if that would be a simple solution,
00:00:25 and we had a brother who is blind come in and help us.
00:00:30 We were able to test the paper in the machine and actually walk it
00:00:33 right over to the brother, and he gave us immediate feedback
00:00:36 on adjustments to the machine
00:00:39 or if it wasn’t working at all.
00:00:42 During our testing, we tried about 25 different types of paper,
00:00:47 but we ended up coming back to the idea
00:00:50 that the binding was the best way to find a durable solution.
00:00:54 The result is that the durability
00:00:56 is 400 percent stronger than it was before.
00:00:59 You can pick up an entire book
00:01:01 by holding just one page.
00:01:05 In the Literature Production Office,
00:01:06 we have ones who receive
00:01:07 the requests for the Braille Bibles,
00:01:09 we have ones who will review these requests
00:01:12 as they come into the system, and then we have
00:01:14 a separate set of brothers who make sure that all the materials are here on time.
00:01:18 We get our orders from the office,
00:01:20 and then the office
00:01:22 will tell us how many to make
00:01:23 —maybe the specific volume number.
00:01:25 Braille Bibles come
00:01:27 from the Wallkill printery on the Braille production floor.
00:01:30 Right at the end of the machine, we have a Braille paper roll.
00:01:34 We make sure that there’s nothing wrong with that roll,
00:01:36 and then it gets fed into the machine
00:01:39 where it creates Braille on both sides of the page.
00:01:41 And after that, it gets cut and punched.
00:01:43 We gather it and do some quality inspection.
00:01:46 We’ll bind it together; we’ll rivet each section into a binder
00:01:50 that has been prelabeled with a volume number,
00:01:53 do an inspection on it, pop it in a box, and then send it out the door.
00:01:57 To produce the English Bible in Braille takes about four and a half hours,
00:02:01 which then breaks out into 28 volumes,
00:02:04 and the Portuguese Bible  in Braille takes closer
00:02:06 to five and a half hours, and that breaks out into 32 volumes.
00:02:11 We did not start production with Genesis,
00:02:13 because we wanted the brothers and sisters to be able to receive the volume
00:02:16 that would be on the congregation Bible reading schedule
00:02:18 at our midweek meetings.
00:02:21 So as we receive the files for each volume,
00:02:24 it’s being printed and sent out to our brothers and sisters.
00:02:28 It’s important to me to be able to read God’s Word
00:02:32 rather than just listening
00:02:34 because I am a visual person.
00:02:36 So the eyesight is gone, but I’m still visual.
00:02:39 I learn better from reading than I do from listening.
00:02:44 In my mind when I’m listening,
00:02:45 my mind wanders,
00:02:46 but when I’m reading, I can stop
00:02:48 and meditate on what I’m studying.
00:02:51 That helps me with my relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:54 It has helped me a lot,
00:02:55 because a lot of things
00:02:57 I don’t have to look up
00:02:58 because it’s in plain English.
00:03:00 They have so many things  in this new Bible
00:03:02 that I can use, like the outline.
00:03:06 I can get that outline and find something fast.
00:03:09 It has the appendix, the word index,
00:03:11 and the glossary.
00:03:13 During the time of the Memorial,
00:03:15 I was able to read the events of the last week of Jesus’ life.
00:03:20 I really enjoy reading with one hand
00:03:24 and pulling the other hand down
00:03:27 and reading the footnotes.
00:03:31 I can participate more in the midweek meeting.
00:03:33 For instance, in the section “Digging for Spiritual Gems,”
00:03:38 the brothers always get someone from the audience to read the scriptures.
00:03:42 So once I got the new Bible,
00:03:45 I could raise my hand and volunteer to read,
00:03:47 and so the whole meeting opened up.
00:03:51 The revised edition
00:03:53 helps me be more effective at the meeting,
00:03:57 and it helps me to find
00:04:01 exactly what I need.
00:04:03 Before the revision, when he’d have a part on the meeting,
00:04:06 he would have to get his Brailler out and have me dictate one sentence at a time
00:04:11 so he could type it all out —what he was going to use in his part.
00:04:13 So this is nice because he has
00:04:17 the right wording that all the friends have.
00:04:19 I like to carry it from house to house,
00:04:21 so I can only take the one volume because they’re huge.
00:04:25 But whatever the initial call is, I can take that scripture
00:04:29 and see if the householder will let me read a scripture for them.
00:04:33 It means so much to be able to read the Scriptures and to do personal study.
00:04:38 I am very thankful for all the work our brothers have done up in Wallkill.
00:04:43 I really appreciate the effort
00:04:46 that they’ve all gone through, because that’s a lot of work.
00:04:50 In Jehovah’s organization, they care for everyone.
00:04:55 I was so thankful that they had the Braille Bible for the blind.
00:04:59 That’s what draws me closer to Jehovah
00:05:02 —being able to study his Word and look the scriptures up.
00:05:06 The new Bible is personal to me.
00:05:09 I feel like it was a personal answer to a prayer.
00:05:12 Jehovah supplied it because that’s the main thing I wanted to read,
00:05:16 and I am so thankful to Jehovah.

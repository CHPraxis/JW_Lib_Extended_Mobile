00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:07.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2013, our English-printed Bibles

00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:09.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were revised and, shortly thereafter,

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.740 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Braille Bibles were approved

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be revised in English and Portuguese.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew it was going to be a large job.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were having problems

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.040 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the pages either tearing

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.376 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or coming completely out of the Bible.

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tried changing the paper
to see if that would be a simple solution,

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a brother
who is blind come in and help us.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to test the paper
in the machine and actually walk it

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right over to the brother,
and he gave us immediate feedback

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on adjustments to the machine

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if it wasn’t working at all.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our testing,
we tried about 25 different types of paper,

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we ended up coming back to the idea

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the binding was
the best way to find a durable solution.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result is that the durability

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 400 percent stronger than it was before.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can pick up an entire book

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by holding just one page.

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:06.462 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the Literature Production Office,

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:07.713 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we have ones who receive

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:09.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the requests for the Braille Bibles,

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have ones
who will review these requests

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they come into the system,
and then we have

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a separate set of brothers who make sure
that all the materials are here on time.

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get our orders from the office,

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:22.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then the office

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:23.687 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will tell us how many to make

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:25.814 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—maybe the specific volume number.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Braille Bibles come

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Wallkill printery
on the Braille production floor.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right at the end of the machine,
we have a Braille paper roll.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We make sure
that there’s nothing wrong with that roll,

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it gets fed into the machine

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it creates Braille
on both sides of the page.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that,
it gets cut and punched.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gather it
and do some quality inspection.

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:50.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll bind it together;
we’ll rivet each section into a binder

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has been prelabeled
with a volume number,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do an inspection on it,
pop it in a box, and then send it out the door.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To produce the English Bible in Braille
takes about four and a half hours,

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which then breaks out into 28 volumes,

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Portuguese Bible 
in Braille takes closer

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to five and a half hours,
and that breaks out into 32 volumes.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did not start production with Genesis,

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we wanted the brothers
and sisters to be able to receive the volume

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be
on the congregation Bible reading schedule

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our midweek meetings.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we receive
the files for each volume,

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s being printed and sent out
to our brothers and sisters.

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:32.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important to me
to be able to read God’s Word

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
rather than just listening

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.760 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I am a visual person.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the eyesight is gone, but I’m still visual.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learn better from reading
than I do from listening.

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:45.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In my mind when I’m listening,

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:46.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my mind wanders,

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:48.897 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but when I’m reading, I can stop

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on what I’m studying.

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:54.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helps me
with my relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It has helped me a lot,

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:57.156 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because a lot of things

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:58.365 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to look up

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.034 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because it’s in plain English.

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have so many things
 in this new Bible

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I can use, like the outline.

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can get that outline
and find something fast.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has the appendix,
the word index,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the glossary.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the time of the Memorial,

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to read the events
of the last week of Jesus’ life.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:24.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy reading with one hand

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pulling the other hand down

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reading the footnotes.

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can participate more
in the midweek meeting.

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:38.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, in the section
“Digging for Spiritual Gems,”

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers always get someone
from the audience to read the scriptures.

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:45.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once I got the new Bible,

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:47.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could raise my hand
and volunteer to read,

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so the whole meeting opened up.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The revised edition

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps me be more effective at the meeting,

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:01.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps me to find

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly what I need.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before the revision,
when he’d have a part on the meeting,

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would have to get his Brailler out
and have me dictate one sentence at a time

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he could type it all out
—what he was going to use in his part.

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is nice because he has

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right wording
that all the friends have.

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:21.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to carry it from house to house,

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:25.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I can only take
the one volume because they’re huge.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever the initial call is,
I can take that scripture

00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if the householder
will let me read a scripture for them.

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:38.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means so much to be able to read
the Scriptures and to do personal study.

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:42.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very thankful for all the work
our brothers have done up in Wallkill.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciate the effort

00:04:46.265 --> 00:04:50.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve all gone through,
because that’s a lot of work.

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:55.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Jehovah’s organization,
they care for everyone.

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:59.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so thankful
that they had the Braille Bible for the blind.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what draws me closer to Jehovah

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—being able to study his Word
and look the scriptures up.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:09.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new Bible is personal to me.

00:05:09.663 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like it was
a personal answer to a prayer.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah supplied it because that’s
the main thing I wanted to read,

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:21.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am so thankful to Jehovah.

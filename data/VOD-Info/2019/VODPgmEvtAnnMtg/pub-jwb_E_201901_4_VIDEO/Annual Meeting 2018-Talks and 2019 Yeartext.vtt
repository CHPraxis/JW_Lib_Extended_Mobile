00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, continuing down this path
that Brother Morris started us on,

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:11.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sanderson
is going to develop the theme,

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Ready?”

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll find out
what we’re supposed to be ready for

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this talk by Brother Sanderson.

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to begin his part,
please look at the monitors.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:27.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a short video clip
at the beginning of his part.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you just saw occurred

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kostroma region in Russia.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The home of a very young couple was raided.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why?

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply because they wanted to worship

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only true and living God, Jehovah.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:12.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is this of interest

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all of us who are here today?

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why is it that we all need to be ready?

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Daniel chapter 11

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foretold of a rivalry between two kings

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“the king of the north”
and “the king of the south.”

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This rivalry has stretched out

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over thousands of years,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it continues down to our day.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king of the north
has manifested a hatred

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God’s people.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in the 20th century,

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and particularly during
the time of the second world war

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Nazi Germany

00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:53.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was acting then as the king of the north,

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:56.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we remember
that there was a high concentration

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of anointed Christians in the area

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were being ruled
over by Nazi Germany.

00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how did the king
of the north treat them?

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were cruelly persecuted,

00:02:08.478 --> 00:02:11.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sent to concentration camps,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result of this, as foretold

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Daniel 11:31,

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution from that
German king of the north

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resulted in the removal

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Daniel 11:31 calls

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the constant feature”

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, the public preaching activity

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s people was suspended

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a period of time.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened
when the second world war ended?

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:44.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new king of the north emerged.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who was that?

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, it was
the Soviet Union and its allies.

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:53.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they too
cruelly persecuted God’s people.

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They banned our worship of Jehovah,

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they imprisoned many in work camps,

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they exiled our brothers to Siberia.

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time,

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:10.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Daniel 11:34 says,

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a little help” was given.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was
that little help that was given?

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:21.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as the Soviet Union collapsed,

00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bans were lifted
across the former territories

00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Soviet Union
as well as in other lands

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:31.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that formerly had been
a part of the Eastern bloc

00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:33.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind the Iron Curtain.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened then?

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we well know, the preaching work

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:41.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opened up in that whole region of the earth,

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hundreds of thousands

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of honesthearted ones

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flocked to Jehovah’s organization.

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers,
where do we find ourselves now?

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as Brother Morris
so beautifully explained,

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after prayerful consideration,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body believes that Russia

00:04:03.393 --> 00:04:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its allies today
represent the king of the north.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that “pushing” that we are seeing

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the king
of the north and the king of the south

00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:16.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—through these trade wars
and cyber espionage

00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:20.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even through Russia’s seizure
of neighboring territories,

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Crimea—

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demonstrate that we are living

00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:29.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when this prophecy
is undergoing fulfillment.

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:31.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is there anything more

00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body can say at this time

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Daniel chapter 11?

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider together the words

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:43.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Daniel 11:41.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:47.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “He will also enter

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:51.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the land of the Decoration.”

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:53.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s stop there.

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have long held

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the land of the Decoration”

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:03.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the spiritual estate of Jehovah’s people.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what have we seen

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the last approximately 18 months
in the country of Russia?

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch.

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On April 20, 2017,

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia’s Supreme Court 
ruled to terminate the activity

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all legal entities 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to confiscate their property.

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:29.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 25, 2017,

00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dennis Christensen 
was the first brother to be arrested

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
following the Supreme Court ban.

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has been in detention since then.

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After over 20 court sessions,

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his trial continues.

00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On July 17, 2017,

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:53.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court rejected 
our appeal against the ban.

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On December 14, 2017,

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities broke 
into the Assembly Hall in St. Petersburg

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:04.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took control of the property.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Legal proceedings to seize hundreds 
of Kingdom Halls have begun.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:12.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The branch property 
is now officially registered

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the name of the Russian Federation.

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On December 20, 2017,

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Leningrad Regional Court 
upheld an earlier ruling

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that declared 
the New World Translation “extremist.”

00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it just continues.

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at these faces.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the faces of some
of the 71 brothers and sisters

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:45.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are presently
under criminal investigation in Russia

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—21 are presently imprisoned

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 15 more are under house arrest.

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers, what can we say

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about all of these events
that have taken place

00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a short period of time?

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, truly, if you’re a student
of the history of God’s organization,

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:12.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can say these events
are unprecedented in our history.

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:15.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve never seen a country or a territory

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:19.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 175,000 Witnesses of Jehovah

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go under ban.

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:25.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve not seen such
a large branch seized by a government,

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as all of our Kingdom Halls

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and even declaring
the New World Translation “extremist.”

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:35.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, then, based on all of these events,

00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can we say?

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body believes

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these and other actions
of Russia and its allies

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:46.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constitute a part of the fulfillment

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north entering

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:52.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the land of the Decoration.

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what can we expect?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would not be surprising

00:07:57.293 --> 00:08:01.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if Russia and its allies
continue to persecute God’s people

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that that persecution
spreads to other lands.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:09.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already, just a little more than one week ago,

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:12.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on September 26, 2018,

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court
of the “Donetsk People’s Republic,”

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:20.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(that’s one
of the breakaway republics from Ukraine)

00:08:20.283 --> 00:08:23.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
declared the religious association

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be “extremist.”

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers,
this raises a very important question.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:37.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the attack of Gog of Magog has begun?

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re not ready to tell you.

00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:46.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay attention.

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The annual meeting is not yet over.

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of this meeting, you will have

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answer to that important question.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:59.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s come back to our question:
Are you ready?

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:04.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we want
to be ready when persecution comes.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And quite frankly, brothers,

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:09.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when ban or opposition comes

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:12.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a level like we have seen in Russia,

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are things that we need to know

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to be ready.

00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider four.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first:

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must follow direction
from Jehovah’s organization.

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:17 says:

00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be obedient to those . . .
taking the lead among you.”

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:33.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why?

00:09:33.756 --> 00:09:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah
will use his appointed channel

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide us
with the direction that we need,

00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:43.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can maintain our spirituality.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:46.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers, it is vital

00:09:46.302 --> 00:09:49.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we adhere to that direction closely

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:53.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to preserve our spirituality

00:09:53.042 --> 00:09:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the spirituality of others
who may worship with us.

00:09:57.213 --> 00:09:59.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the second:

00:09:59.215 --> 00:10:01.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t panic,

00:10:01.717 --> 00:10:04.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust in Jehovah,

00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t ban yourself.

00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:11.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does Deuteronomy 7:21

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell us about our opposers?

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:17.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Do not be struck

00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with terror because of them,

00:10:19.468 --> 00:10:21.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jehovah your God is with you,

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:26.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great and awe-inspiring God.”

00:10:26.242 --> 00:10:28.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, our opposers

00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:31.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would love for us to panic.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would love for us to hear the report

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that 21 of our brothers are in prison

00:10:36.352 --> 00:10:39.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result, become terrified.

00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:42.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would like
for us to stop meeting together

00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to stop preaching the good news.

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, we could actually ban ourselves.

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does Isaiah 28:16 say?

00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:57.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “No one

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:00.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exercising faith will panic.”

00:11:00.976 --> 00:11:05.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, we must not panic.

00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:08.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s true, there are 21

00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:10.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters in Russia

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are in prison at the present time.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, on the other hand,

00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about how many tens of thousands

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers who are not in prison.

00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:26.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, that’s what
we need to focus our minds on.

00:11:26.535 --> 00:11:29.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what if we do face arrest

00:11:29.538 --> 00:11:32.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or imprisonment
because we faithfully serve

00:11:32.808 --> 00:11:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God, Jehovah?

00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:37.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we must remember

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will be there to support us.

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:44.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I would just love
to be able to tell you more,

00:11:44.987 --> 00:11:47.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our brothers in prison in Russia,

00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:51.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many other places,
are doing just fine.

00:11:51.093 --> 00:11:53.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why are they doing fine?

00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah God is with them!

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no prison wall

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be built so high, so wide,

00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or so strong that it can cut us off

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:08.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:12:29.198 --> 00:12:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three:

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Protect your spiritual food.

00:12:34.603 --> 00:12:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, have a secure place in mind

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hide your Bible
and other precious spiritual food,

00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether in printed or in electronic form.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re worshipping Jehovah right now

00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a country where the work is under ban,

00:12:50.386 --> 00:12:53.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not leave your spiritual food

00:12:53.722 --> 00:12:57.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it can easily
be discovered and taken away.

00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:01.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number four:

00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Peter 1:22,

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:08.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us
to “love one another intensely from the heart.”

00:13:08.604 --> 00:13:10.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our brothers in countries

00:13:10.606 --> 00:13:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the work
is under ban are doing just that.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many court hearings in Russia,

00:13:15.644 --> 00:13:18.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers have risked
their safety to be in the courtroom

00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:21.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support their brothers.

00:13:21.016 --> 00:13:23.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the brothers were charged

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when they emerged from the courtroom,

00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:29.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did those brothers
who were there to support them do?

00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just watch.

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:22.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you determined, brothers and sisters,

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:25.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be like our brothers and sisters in Russia

00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:28.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to stand together
as one and support one another

00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the challenging times
that will be coming in the future?

00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then remember these practical steps:

00:14:48.237 --> 00:14:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Follow direction,

00:14:50.606 --> 00:14:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t panic, trust in Jehovah,

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t ban yourself.

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Protect your spiritual food,

00:14:59.014 --> 00:15:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support your brothers and sisters.

00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stand together with them as one.

00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:07.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we are all determined

00:15:07.222 --> 00:15:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do these practical things right now,

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:13.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, my dear brothers and sisters,
you are ready.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Sanderson,

00:15:33.882 --> 00:15:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for lighting that fire under us in a good way.

00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also,
thank you so much for removing the veil

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:49.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning ‘the king of the north
entering the land of the Decoration.’

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’d like to say, if at all possible,

00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:56.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not go to the restroom during this next talk.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:02.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do,

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to really miss something.

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Brother Geoffrey Jackson

00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:12.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to give us the powerful talk now:

00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:17.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They Will Have to Know That I Am Jehovah.”

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:23.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re all thinking
of that very important question:

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:28.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has the attack
of Gog of Magog already started?

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:34.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer is no, not yet.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that?

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:39.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you turn with me again 
to Daniel chapter 11

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:43.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I’m sure many of us
will be turning there in the next few weeks,

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:45.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking over and over again

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the significance
of these explanations—

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:51.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice
that what is happening now

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is part of the fulfillment

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:57.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Daniel 11:40-43.

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:00.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ll also notice

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:04.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it continues on with verses 44 and 45.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:07.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these two verses
apply to something

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:11.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will occur
after the start of the great tribulation.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:16.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we have understood
up to now and continue to understand,

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:20.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the attack of Gog of Magog
does not occur

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:23.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the outbreak
of the great tribulation.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:26.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it doesn’t even start

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:29.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as the great tribulation commences

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:34.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, it is toward the end
of the great tribulation.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:38.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we know
about the attack of Gog of Magog?

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:41.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will lead up to that?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider
this visual time line to help us.

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:53.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the centuries, Babylon the Great

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the world empire of false religion—

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has committed spiritual immorality

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “the kings of the earth.”

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:06.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the near future, 
these religious leaders

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could very well have 
a part in causing people

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:13.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to say that they have attained 
a measure of “peace and security.”

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens next?

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:20.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will put it 
into the hearts of the nations

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:23.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to empower the United Nations 
to attack Babylon the Great.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:31.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The great tribulation starts at this point.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:34.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, this will not be the attack

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Gog of Magog on God’s people.

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:44.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that 
the days of this initial attack

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:47.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be cut short 
“on account of the chosen ones,”

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, 
Jesus’ spirit-anointed brothers still on earth.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During all these events, Jehovah’s people

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:01.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue to enjoy 
the spiritual prosperity

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:04.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have experienced 
ever since pure worship

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:07.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was reestablished in 1919.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever respite 
we may experience at that time

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:15.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will only be the calm before the storm

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the final storm.

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:28.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual prosperity 
will not go unnoticed.

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can it?

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:34.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All other religious organizations 
will have been destroyed.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be the only ones on this planet

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:40.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are openly serving God.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:46.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog of Magog
—a coalition of all the nations,

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:50.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, a combination 
of “the king of the north,”

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the south,” 
and all other nations—

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:56.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will make plans to attack God’s people.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:20:00.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, we will stand out as different

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:03.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will appear to be defenseless.

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:08.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, 
Gog “will devise an evil plan”

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:12.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a futile attempt 
to wipe out pure worship from the earth.

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:20.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in his rage,

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:23.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog will not take into consideration

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one vital fact.

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His attack on God’s people

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:33.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an attack on Jehovah himself.

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:36.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a mistake that will be!

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:41.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog will enrage the Sovereign 
of the universe, Almighty God.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will start the battle of Armageddon.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During “the war 
of the great day of God the Almighty,”

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:53.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use his heavenly forces.

00:20:55.887 --> 00:21:00.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Included among these 
will be all of the 144,000,

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who by that time

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have received their heavenly reward.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, in a spectacular way,

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:12.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will no doubt unleash both natural

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:15.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and supernatural forces

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect his loyal servants 
and eliminate his enemies.

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That destruction of the wicked

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will usher in the Thousand Year Reign 
of Jesus Christ.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the final test 
at the end of the thousand years,

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will be the situation?

00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:43.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All creation in heaven and on earth

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:45.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be completely united

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:48.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the pure worship 
of our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:54.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hallelujah! 
What a time that will be!

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:18.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to the time

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:22.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re there
and you’ll say, “This is it!”

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:28.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the meantime,
as we think to the future and we realize

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:32.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Gog of Magog
will attack God’s people

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this coalition
of all the nations of the earth:

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:38.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south—

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should we dread anything?

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:42.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we be fearful about that?

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to the book of Ezekiel,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel chapter 38,

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:49.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read
for ourselves the reassurance

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:53.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we get
from these words in Ezekiel 38.

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:56.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with verses 18 and 19:

00:22:56.975 --> 00:23:01.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘On that day, the day
when Gog invades the land of Israel,’

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:06.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,
‘my great rage will flare up.

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:11.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘In my zeal,
in the fire of my fury, I will speak;

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and in that day
there will be a great earthquake

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:17.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the land of Israel.’”

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:20.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verses 21 to 23:

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:24.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will call for a sword against him
on all my mountains,’

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:30.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Every man’s sword
will be against his own brother.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will bring my judgment against him

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:35.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘with pestilence and bloodshed;

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will rain down
a torrential downpour

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and hailstones and fire

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and sulfur on him and on his troops

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:46.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and on the many peoples with him.

00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:50.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will certainly
magnify myself

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and sanctify myself

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:56.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and make myself known
before the eyes of many nations;

00:23:56.935 --> 00:24:01.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will have to know 
that I am Jehovah.’”

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:04.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t those words reassuring?

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:08.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah will turn his rage

00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:10.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Gog of Magog

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:13.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he upholds his name

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:16.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and protects his name people.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:18.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have nothing to dread.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the past few years,
you’ve probably noticed

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:24.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at a number
of the annual meetings,

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had some clarifications

00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:29.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to the prophecy of Ezekiel.

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be nice if we had
all those clarifications

00:24:33.238 --> 00:24:35.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together in one location?

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:39.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ll be pleased
to know that ten years ago,

00:24:39.845 --> 00:24:42.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the year 2008,

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:45.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
commissioned the Writing Committee

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:49.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start preparing a book
on the prophecy of Ezekiel.

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:54.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, in the meantime,
the text of the book of Ezekiel

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:57.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was refined and revised

00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:01.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many, many things
have happened on the world scene.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we have to wait another ten years?

00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:07.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not even
going to go down that track with you.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:09.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be pleased to know

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:12.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that today we’re releasing
a brand new publication:

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pure Worship of Jehovah
—Restored at Last!

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you all seem
very excited about this;

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all you saw is the front cover.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we expect
when we open the pages

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this new publication?

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s take a sneak preview

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what you’ll find in this publication.

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:57.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, you’ll be happy to see

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it contains
all the recent clarifications

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:05.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve had with regard
to our understanding of the book of Ezekiel.

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:08.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can say

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:11.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are a few more
clarifications as well in this book,

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pure Worship of Jehovah
—Restored at Last!

00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:21.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On pages 238 to 240,

you will find a summary of clarifications.

00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:28.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no doubt most of us
will be turning there first

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:30.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read through those.

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:34.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Numerous charts and time lines
appear throughout the book.

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:38.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teaching boxes help us gain

a deeper understanding of Ezekiel

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his writings;

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:45.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these are designed to help us

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the overall background

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:50.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and setting of these prophecies.

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:55.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scattered throughout this book

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:58.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are beautiful illustrations

00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:00.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—illustrations that bring to life

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:02.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fascinating prophecies

00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:05.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Ezekiel was inspired to record—

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all for our benefit.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you meditate
on these instructive pieces of art,

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:15.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will no doubt start
to visualize for yourselves

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exciting visions

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:21.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the amazing things

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:25.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Ezekiel describes
in this prophetic book.

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:48.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lett will tell you
when you’ll receive your copies.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I know all of you are thinking
at this point: ‘OK, you can go now.

00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like to hear
when we’re going to get them.’

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:58.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before we finish this part,

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d like to mention

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:04.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the digital version
of this publication,

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:07.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a new feature.

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:10.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are 22 chapters in the book.

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:12.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the beginning of each chapter,

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:17.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a little video clip
that introduces the chapter.

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:19.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these video clips

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:22.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are presented by either members
of the Governing Body

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or helpers to the Governing Body.

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:27.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see
a little summary of some of those?

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:43.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pure Worship of Jehovah
—Restored At Last!

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:47.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What spiritual gems will we find in this book?

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:50.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be clarifications of understanding?

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:56.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will we see beautiful illustrations
of vivid prophetic visions?

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:28:57.969 --> 00:29:00.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The better you understand Bible principles,

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:04.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the greater will be
your desire to reject Satan’s traps

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:08.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to give Jehovah exclusive, pure worship.

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:13.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do the faces of a man, a lion, a bull,

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:18.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an eagle especially reflect
Jehovah’s strength and mightiness?

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:21.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the chariot
that Ezekiel saw represent,

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how do we know that?

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:28.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What promises of restoration
did Jehovah make through Ezekiel,

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:33.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how have they been fulfilled
on true Christians during the last days?

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:36.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn from Ezekiel’s prophecy

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:38.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jerusalem’s destruction?

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:41.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Ezekiel’s vision of the man

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:45.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the secretary’s inkhorn
highlight Jehovah’s mercy?

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lies ahead for false religion,

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:51.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what action should we take now?

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:57.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah asked the prophet Ezekiel
to do some strange things.

00:29:57.128 --> 00:30:01.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they conveyed an important message
that has meaning for us today.

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:06.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you enjoy picturing yourself
and your loved ones in Paradise?

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A study of Ezekiel’s visionary river

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you to make
that picture even more vivid.

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:16.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that understanding Bible prophecy

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:21.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requires humility, hard work, and holy spirit.

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:24.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the rewards are worth the effort.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:27.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The material you’re
about to discuss will give you courage,

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:32.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will help you
to do your part in upholding pure worship.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The better you understand this material,

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stronger your determination will be

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give Jehovah pure worship.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our hope that what you’ve learned
from the Pure Worship book

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:49.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will strengthen your determination

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:53.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give Jehovah
what he so richly deserves

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:56.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your exclusive worship.

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:07.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this new publication

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:11.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enhance our appreciation for pure worship,

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may it continue to build within us

00:31:14.672 --> 00:31:18.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a feeling of urgency with regard
to the times in which we’re living,

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:21.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may it help us to have a longing

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:25.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the time when all creation
in heaven and on earth

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:27.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not only know Jehovah

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:30.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but love and worship him
for all eternity!

00:31:48.489 --> 00:31:51.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful part, Brother Jackson!

00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:53.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank you very much.

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:57.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thank you for removing the veil

00:31:57.398 --> 00:32:01.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Gog, a coalition of nations,

00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:05.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the king of the north
and the king of the south.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
regarding our wonderful publication

00:32:10.411 --> 00:32:12.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Brother Jackson told you about

00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:13.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and he put the pressure on me;

00:32:13.715 --> 00:32:15.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to give you
the right announcement this time,

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so here’s the right announcement—

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Pure Worship book in English

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:26.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be made available on jw.org,

00:32:26.094 --> 00:32:28.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and JW Library®

on Monday, October 8, 2018.

00:32:34.636 --> 00:32:36.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Monday is going to be a big day.

00:32:36.638 --> 00:32:39.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you will be making use

00:32:39.607 --> 00:32:42.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a hard copy of this publication,

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

including the main lobby of your complex

00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:59.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those watching
from their personal rooms.

00:32:59.627 --> 00:33:02.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additional printed copies

through the congregations,

including the large-print edition.

00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:12.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we move to our final talk,

00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:17.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother David Splane
is going to give us this comforting talk,

00:33:17.178 --> 00:33:22.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do Not Be Anxious, for I Am Your God.”

00:33:22.183 --> 00:33:25.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows
we need this comforting talk

00:33:25.687 --> 00:33:30.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the powerful preceding trilogy

00:33:30.224 --> 00:33:32.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we just heard.

00:33:32.226 --> 00:33:34.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Brother Splane, please.

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:39.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told some of the brothers that my job

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:43.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to cheer you up after the preceding talks.

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:50.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, bad things happen.

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They happen to us,

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:59.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they happen to those we love.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s the question:

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:05.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to remain calm

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:10.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it seems that our life
is being turned upside down?

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer is yes.

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:16.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s consider
four reasons why we say that.

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:19.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is simple
because all of these reasons

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:21.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are contained in one Bible verse

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:26.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 41:10—

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:30.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s Isaiah chapter 41.

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you can’t find Isaiah,

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:38.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try “Isaiah” 41:10

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:43.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—four reasons why we can be calm.

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:48.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:53.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:58.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can leave your Bibles open.

00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:09.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be returning to this book,

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to be staying
in Isaiah for the duration of this talk.

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:19.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, more than 100 years
after these words were written down,

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very bad thing happened.

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:28.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king of Babylon
invaded the city of Jerusalem.

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:32.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says of him
that he felt no compassion

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for young man or virgin, old or infirm.

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:40.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He burned down the house of the true God,

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:42.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tore down the wall of Jerusalem,

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:45.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
burned all its fortified towers with fire,

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:50.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and destroyed everything of value.

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:52.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there were survivors.

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:55.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bear in mind,
we’re not talking about our friends

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:58.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, Ezekiel, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were already in Babylon,
but there were survivors.

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:04.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you picture in your mind’s eye

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:07.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was happening to the survivors?

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:10.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just try to picture it.

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:14.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There they are bound in chains,

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:18.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being dragged through the rubble

00:36:18.142 --> 00:36:21.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the smoldering rubble—
of the holy city.

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see them?

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:27.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see them pass a widow

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:32.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is cradling
the lifeless body of her only son?

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:34.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now a soldier approaches,

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:38.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he orders the woman
to drop her son and to get on her feet.

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:43.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she can’t;
she just can’t let go of her son, her precious son.

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:49.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With one stroke, the soldier ends her life.

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:55.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those looking on
wonder what fate awaits them.

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:58.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can imagine
faithful ones among them

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:01.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
repeating the words of Jehovah,

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:06.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of Isaiah,
over and over again:

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do not be anxious.

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:11.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do not be anxious.

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:13.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I am your God.

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:16.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will fortify you.

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:20.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will hold on to you.’

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:24.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those same words
have been a source of great encouragement

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:26.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s people throughout the ages.

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:30.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they can be a source
of strength for us today.

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:34.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s take a closer look at Isaiah 41:10

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discuss the four reasons

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:39.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we needn’t be overly anxious

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when bad things happen.

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:44.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep your Bibles open to Isaiah,

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:46.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s look at the first reason.

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:49.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah say?

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:51.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am with you.”

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:55.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s the first word in that phrase?

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I.”

00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:01.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t say:
‘Don’t be anxious because you’re real smart.

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll figure something out.’

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:05.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:10.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needn’t be anxious if Jehovah is with us.

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:13.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we put our trust completely in Jehovah,

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:16.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s the very best way to calm our fears,

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:21.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s been repeated to us
during the program of this convention.

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:25.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, isn’t Jehovah
just interested in the big picture?

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:30.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah really interested
in you and your problems?

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:32.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He assures the Israelites that he is.

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:37.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just turn to Isaiah 43,

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:41.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what he says in verse 2

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:43.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(he’s speaking to you):

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:49.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you pass through the waters,

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:51.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will be with you,

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through the rivers,
they will not flood over you.

00:38:55.232 --> 00:38:57.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you walk through the fire,

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:59.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will not be scorched,

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:03.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will the flame singe you.”

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:07.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah doesn’t say
there won’t be challenges.

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:09.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be rivers,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah will not allow
those rivers to flood over us.

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be fire,

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:20.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah will not allow the flames

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to consume us.

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:26.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has the power over fire and water,

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah says that he will be with us.

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:31.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we will leave every trial

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we will go out of every trial—

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:37.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our integrity intact
with the help of Jehovah.

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:39.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah does something else.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can also help quiet our fears

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:47.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re not afraid
of the trials that beset us.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:52.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was evident
in the case of a sister named Yoshiko.

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:55.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctor gave her very bad news.

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:59.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had only a few months to live,

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah was with her.

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did He do?

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did He provide a miraculous cure?

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her daughter said:

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:13.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were impressed
with how calm Mom was.

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:18.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly saw
that Jehovah gave her inner peace.”

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:21.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure you could relate
many, many experiences

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:25.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah has given you
that same peace of God

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:27.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has helped you to endure trials.

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:30.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s note the second reason.

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:33.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to Isaiah 41:10,

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:37.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s note the second reason 
why we can remain calm.

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:40.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“Do not be anxious,

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:43.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I am your God.”

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:46.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this verse,
the word for “be anxious”

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:50.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveys the thought of looking
over your shoulder and expecting trouble

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:54.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or being in a constant state of alarm.

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:56.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is that really helpful?

00:40:56.353 --> 00:41:00.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me
of the American writer Mark Twain;

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:03.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, ‘I’m an old man

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:05.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and I have known many troubles,

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:08.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but most of them never happened.’

00:41:08.332 --> 00:41:10.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s really true, isn’t it?

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So often the things we expect to happen

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:15.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the things we worry about—
don’t happen at all.

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:22.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing is gained by trying to imagine
what form persecution might take

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:26.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how we might react under a certain trial.

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:27.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:29.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we know our God,

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:32.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know what Jehovah can do for us.

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:34.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know that?

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of his past record.

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:41.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen how he
has already intervened in our life.

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:44.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s done it before, and he can do it again.

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the song?

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You promised him in prayer to do his will;

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:53.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped you then, and he will help you still.”

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:55.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is so true.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about the first trial

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you encountered
when you were coming into the truth.

00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:01.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it was your relatives.

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were studying,

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:06.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you were wondering
how you were going to break the news

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:10.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your relatives that you
were studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:15.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you begged Jehovah
to give you just the right words

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:18.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you’d know
how to break the news.

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:21.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t go well.

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:25.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you felt as if you
were walking through fire.

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did the fire consume you?

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:30.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well no, look at you;
you’re here.

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:32.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped you.

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:37.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave you the peace of God,
and he helped you to endure.

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:40.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you have
a better relationship with your relatives

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:43.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as you don’t talk about the truth.

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:48.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He helped you then,
and he will help you still.

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:52.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, looking back,
you might not see that as a very difficult test

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:55.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because since that time,
you’ve been through a lot worse.

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:58.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was a test nevertheless,

00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:01.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you passed that test successfully.

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:04.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when you went
through much worse later,

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:06.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were able to encounter that test

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pass it because your faith was stronger.

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:13.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has built your faith little by little.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah
won’t always remove our problems.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have a problem

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:21.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s something
you can do about it,

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:24.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then pray for wisdom.

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:27.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If there’s nothing
you can do about the problem,

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray for peace.

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:31.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in any case, pray.

00:43:31.976 --> 00:43:34.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next best thing to solving a problem

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:38.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not to be worried about the problem.

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:40.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go back to verse 10

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:44.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider the third assurance
that we get from Jehovah.

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:47.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“I will fortify you,

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:51.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, I will help you.”

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that word “fortify” mean?

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means to make us stronger.

00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:00.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this morning, we’ve heard a lot

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be scary on some levels.

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:06.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we might catch ourselves saying,

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:11.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t think I’d do very well under persecution.’

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:14.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with that statement?

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:19.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t think I would do well

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:21.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under persecution.’

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:25.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is not in the picture,
and yet he should be.

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:28.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who says we have to face persecution alone?

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:33.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says that he is going to fortify us.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:37.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is going to give us the inner strength
that we didn’t know we had

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:42.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we don’t have it
if we’re not facing persecution.

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:44.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not be strong enough

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:47.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encounter persecution now
if you’re not going through it.

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:51.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the time comes
—and it will come—

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:54.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give you the strength you need.

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:57.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
‘I will fortify you.

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:00.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will make you strong.’

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:04.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider the last phrase in verse 10.

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:07.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says:
“I will really hold on to you

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:10.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:15.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, The Watchtower of July 2016
clarified this verse for us.

00:45:15.846 --> 00:45:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We used to often think of ourselves

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:22.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
walking hand in hand with Jehovah,

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:24.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s not really what he’s talking about.

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:26.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:29.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because of what he says in verse 13.

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:32.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“For I, Jehovah your God,

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:37.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
am grasping your right hand.”

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does he say at the end of verse 10?

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:45.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will really hold on to you
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:47.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were walking side by side with Jehovah,

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:50.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our right hand would be in his left hand

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:52.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our left hand would be in his right hand.

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he says,
‘No, I will hold on to you with my right hand,

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will hold on to your right hand.’

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:00.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is the picture?

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re down; and you can’t get up;

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah God extends his right hand.

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:09.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do you do?

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:13.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t just lie there.

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:18.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Extend your right hand;
allow Jehovah to help you to get up.

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:21.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’re battling depression right now.

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:25.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps you’ve lost
a cherished privilege of service,

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:28.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just can’t get over it.

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Extend your right hand,

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:33.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow Jehovah to help you.

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:37.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’ll use an elder
as his right-hand man.

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:39.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he’s going to use somebody to help you

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:42.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if only you are willing to accept

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:45.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that Jehovah will give.

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:47.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there they are:

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:52.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Four reasons why we can keep calm
no matter what the future holds.

00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says: “I am with you.”

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:58.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I am your God.”

00:46:58.282 --> 00:47:01.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you.”

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:04.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “I will really hold on to you
with my right hand.”

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:07.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful assurance that is!

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:10.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to have a whole year

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:13.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to consider these words in depth

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:17.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because part of this text,
as you have probably guessed,

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:23.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constitutes our yeartext for the year 2019.

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here it is:

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:30.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.”

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Splane,

00:47:48.682 --> 00:47:51.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that balsam of Gilead,

00:47:51.852 --> 00:47:55.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also we appreciate

00:47:55.055 --> 00:47:58.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that yeartext, Isaiah 41:10.

00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:03.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful scripture
we’ll focus on during 2019!

00:48:04.197 --> 00:48:07.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now I’ve been apportioned five minutes

00:48:07.701 --> 00:48:10.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some concluding comments.

00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:15.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we’re overtime,
I’m going to take my five minutes.

00:48:17.844 --> 00:48:22.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll probably hear about it later, though,
from the Governing Body brothers.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:34.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if I leave out of here
real quick after the program,

00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:36.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll know what the problem is.

00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:41.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Near the beginning of our program,

00:48:41.602 --> 00:48:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we focused just for a few minutes

00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:48.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on appreciating our spiritual paradise.

00:48:48.609 --> 00:48:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to substantiate
how truly paradisaic it is,

00:48:52.646 --> 00:48:57.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we made comparisons
between that original Paradise

00:48:57.217 --> 00:48:59.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our spiritual paradise.

00:48:59.386 --> 00:49:02.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed seven similarities.

00:49:02.623 --> 00:49:06.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just to review,
our spiritual paradise,

00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:09.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the garden of Eden,
exists on a land.

00:49:09.062 --> 00:49:12.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is filled with beautiful plants and trees.

00:49:12.432 --> 00:49:16.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has abundant food and refreshing water.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:20.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has many harmless animals.

00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:24.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It needs maintenance,
and it has boundaries.

00:49:24.945 --> 00:49:26.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just briefly,

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s discuss one more
—an eighth similarity.

00:49:31.118 --> 00:49:34.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual paradise

00:49:34.021 --> 00:49:36.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is expanding

00:49:36.423 --> 00:49:39.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to embrace more and more people.

00:49:39.926 --> 00:49:43.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Originally, Jehovah intended
the garden of Eden to expand—didn’t he?

00:49:43.864 --> 00:49:48.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah
told him in Genesis 1:28:

00:49:48.435 --> 00:49:51.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become fruitful and become many,

00:49:51.872 --> 00:49:55.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fill the earth and subdue it.”

00:49:55.342 --> 00:49:58.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Adam and Eve had children

00:49:58.645 --> 00:50:00.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as their children had children,

00:50:00.981 --> 00:50:04.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the garden of Eden would become
too small eventually—wouldn’t it?

00:50:04.184 --> 00:50:08.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would have to grow;
it would have to expand bigger and bigger.

00:50:08.822 --> 00:50:11.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, the east would meet the west;

00:50:11.825 --> 00:50:13.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the north would meet the south;

00:50:13.894 --> 00:50:17.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the planet Earth
would become the garden of Eden.

00:50:17.164 --> 00:50:21.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, we know that
that original procedure Jehovah had in mind,

00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:25.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say, was blocked
by the rebellion in the garden of Eden.

00:50:25.572 --> 00:50:28.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah’s original purpose

00:50:28.308 --> 00:50:31.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the earth to be a paradise
like the garden of Eden

00:50:31.278 --> 00:50:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
certainly will be accomplished.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here is the point:

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:39.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah intended
the garden of Eden to expand,

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:44.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he desires our spiritual paradise to expand

00:50:44.191 --> 00:50:46.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to embrace more and more people.

00:50:46.993 --> 00:50:49.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that definitely is happening
—isn’t it?—

00:50:49.229 --> 00:50:53.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as all of us focus on making disciples.

00:50:53.834 --> 00:50:56.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now our spiritual paradise

00:50:56.536 --> 00:51:00.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
embraces some eight
and a half million sheeplike individuals.

00:51:00.974 --> 00:51:05.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only Jehovah
knows how many more will come into it

00:51:05.178 --> 00:51:08.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation begins

00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:12.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as all of us do our best to make disciples.

00:51:12.018 --> 00:51:15.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah expects us to do that
—to do our very best

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:18.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to expand this spiritual paradise,

00:51:18.825 --> 00:51:22.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this wonderful,
beautiful place where we are.

00:51:22.295 --> 00:51:25.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will happen until,

00:51:25.398 --> 00:51:29.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know, the spiritual paradise
will go through the great tribulation.

00:51:29.336 --> 00:51:33.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then resurrected ones
and ones born in the new world

00:51:33.073 --> 00:51:35.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come into this spiritual paradise

00:51:35.208 --> 00:51:39.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they exercise faith in Jehovah’s provisions.

00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there will be many that’ll do that.

00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:43.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll come into this spiritual paradise.

00:51:43.216 --> 00:51:45.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will happen over and over again,

00:51:45.318 --> 00:51:49.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the spiritual paradise

00:51:49.322 --> 00:51:51.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will cover the entire planet.

00:51:51.758 --> 00:51:54.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this exquisite paradise

00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:56.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will actually be more beautiful,

00:51:56.763 --> 00:52:00.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more exquisite, than the literal Paradise

00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:02.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will coexist with it.

00:52:02.936 --> 00:52:05.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have eight similarities

00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:10.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the original Paradise
and our spiritual paradise.

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we never want to take it for granted.

00:52:12.312 --> 00:52:15.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we touched
on a little bit in the beginning,

00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:18.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we never want to allow Satan

00:52:18.585 --> 00:52:21.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what he did to Adam and Eve.

00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:24.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got them out
of their wonderful place, didn’t he?

00:52:24.424 --> 00:52:28.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he’s trying
to lure us out of the boundaries

00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:31.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our wonderful,
exquisite spiritual paradise,

00:52:31.998 --> 00:52:35.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are not going to let him do this.

00:52:35.268 --> 00:52:37.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re determined

00:52:37.437 --> 00:52:40.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going
to help others that are of honest heart

00:52:40.874 --> 00:52:43.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join us in this spiritual paradise.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this wonderful annual meeting

00:52:46.346 --> 00:52:49.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has truly helped us in this regard.

00:52:49.749 --> 00:52:53.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know all of us are so happy we were here.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:00:01 But now, let me ask you this:
00:00:03 Do you know what OPI stands for?
00:00:08 You’ll find that out and a lot more
00:00:12 in the following report,
00:00:14 which will be given by Brother Paul Gillies,
00:00:17 who serves as the overseer of OPI.
00:00:25 Ecclesiastes 12:10 says:
00:00:29 “The congregator sought to find
00:00:31 “delightful words and to record
00:00:33 accurate words of truth.”
00:00:36 In harmony with this principle,
00:00:38 the Office of Public Information, OPI,
00:00:42 at world headquarters has, over the years,
00:00:44 been assigned by the Governing Body
00:00:46 to convey accurate information
00:00:49 to the news media and academics.
00:00:51 But as Satan intensifies his slanderous attacks
00:00:55 on Jehovah’s people and opposers feed authorities
00:00:58 with twisted and distorted statements about us,
00:01:01 OPI’s assignment now includes
00:01:04 conveying accurate words of truth
00:01:07 to government officials.
00:01:09 So in this report, we’d like to explain to you
00:01:12 how and why this work is done
00:01:14 and also relate a few experiences.
00:01:18 There are Scriptural precedents  for contacting government officials.
00:01:22 Jehovah positioned his servants before rulers
00:01:26 in order to protect his people and to further his purposes.
00:01:31 Examples include Joseph before Pharaoh,
00:01:34 Nehemiah before King Artaxerxes,
00:01:37 Esther and Mordecai before King Ahasuerus,
00:01:40 and Paul before Felix.
00:01:44 Of course, we do not need the permission of governments
00:01:46 to meet and to preach.
00:01:48 But we do recognize that having religious freedom
00:01:51 and the cooperation of officials
00:01:54 is conducive to spreading the Kingdom message.
00:01:58 While remaining politically neutral,
00:02:01 we provide accurate information
00:02:03 to ‘kings and all those in high positions
00:02:06 so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life,’
00:02:10 as 1 Timothy 2:2 states.
00:02:13 Recently, brothers from OPI met with officials
00:02:16 to address specific issues hindering our work
00:02:18 in Azerbaijan, Belarus,
00:02:21 Russia, and Central Asia.
00:02:24 In July, a meeting was held with the prime minister
00:02:27 of one African country to explain
00:02:29 the reasons for our Christian neutrality.
00:02:33 Reports such as these
00:02:35 that document incidents of injustice
00:02:38 are provided to officials.
00:02:41 Many express appreciation for this information.
00:02:45 At a recent meeting  held in Congo (Kinshasa),
00:02:48 an embassy official commenting on the quality
00:02:51 of these reports stated,
00:02:53 “They remain objective and moderate
00:02:56 despite the seriousness of the facts.”
00:03:00 So if we don’t take the initiative
00:03:02 to provide accurate information,
00:03:04 government officials may receive misinformation
00:03:08 from opposers trying to influence them to act against us.
00:03:13 Now, while it takes time and effort
00:03:15 to counteract lies and misinformation,
00:03:18 we have often experienced the truthfulness
00:03:21 of what Proverbs 25:15 tells us:
00:03:24 “By patience a commander is won over,
00:03:28 and a gentle tongue can break a bone.”
00:03:32 Well, let’s now share with you some experiences
00:03:34 that demonstrate the benefit
00:03:36 of contacting both government officials
00:03:39 and the media.
00:03:41 Regarding Russia, OPI keeps various officials
00:03:46 around the world informed of the ongoing harassment
00:03:49 and unjust detentions of our brothers.
00:03:53 As a result, many of these authorities
00:03:55 have issued strongly worded statements
00:03:58 condemning the ban in Russia,
00:04:00 some of which you can find  on the jw.org “Newsroom.”
00:04:04 Meanwhile, OPI communicated with journalists about Russia,
00:04:09 one of whom wrote a very interesting article
00:04:11 for the international edition of Newsweek.
00:04:15 This article appeared on the front cover.
00:04:18 And this one outlet alone has published
00:04:21 about 30 articles about the oppression
00:04:24 of Jehovah’s Witnesses not just in Russia but other countries.
00:04:31 Each year in Uzbekistan,
00:04:33 our brothers experience police raids,
00:04:35 detentions, fines,
00:04:38 and sadly, in some occasions, severe beatings.
00:04:41 This is just for carrying out their Christian ministry.
00:04:45 Now, often the reason for that
00:04:47 is because we have been consistently
00:04:50 denied registration.
00:04:52 This photograph shows some brothers and sisters
00:04:55 who are maintaining their joy despite all of them
00:04:57 having been fined exorbitant amounts.
00:05:02 Now interestingly, on May 14, 2018,
00:05:05 the ambassador from Uzbekistan
00:05:08 to the United States said this in Washington D.C.,
00:05:13 “Jehovah’s Witnesses will be able to register much easier.”
00:05:18 So seizing this opportunity,
00:05:21 a delegation of brothers was approved
00:05:23 to travel to Uzbekistan last month
00:05:26 and held preliminary discussions
00:05:28 with government representatives.
00:05:31 If it be Jehovah’s will,
00:05:33 we certainly pray that these efforts will lead
00:05:35 to national registration
00:05:37 and some relief for our brothers
00:05:39 who have endured persecution.
00:05:43 Where appropriate, OPI also helps branches
00:05:47 to organize public events
00:05:49 in areas where our work is often misrepresented.
00:05:53 For instance, in Kazakhstan,
00:05:55 where there have been some obstacles,
00:05:57 local officials and communities
00:06:00 have recently demonstrated a willingness
00:06:02 to learn more about Jehovah’s people.
00:06:05 Therefore, the branch hosted a series of open house events
00:06:09 in Kingdom Halls in select locations.
00:06:13 A number of officials, media representatives,
00:06:15 and other professionals attended these events.
00:06:19 A government ministry wrote to the brothers stating,
00:06:23 “These events will provide the citizens of our country
00:06:26 “an opportunity to learn more about the activities
00:06:29 “and the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:06:32 in Kazakhstan and worldwide.”
00:06:37 In Sri Lanka,
00:06:39 the cardinal of the Catholic Church wrote to the president
00:06:42 and other representatives of the government
00:06:45 demanding that they cancel
00:06:48 the special convention that was scheduled for just last July.
00:06:53 Not only did the cardinal not get his way
00:06:56 but favorable government ministers actually invited the branch
00:07:00 to hold a press conference to publicize the convention.
00:07:04 After OPI prepared the Sri Lanka branch for the event,
00:07:07 approximately 45 media representatives
00:07:11 attended the press conference held at Bethel.
00:07:14 Some of the journalists who attended this press conference
00:07:17 also attended the special convention
00:07:19 and published positive news stories.
00:07:23 So instead of the clergy successfully influencing
00:07:26 government officials to cancel the convention,
00:07:30 these officials actually assisted us in publicizing it.
00:07:36 One of the tools that we use
00:07:38 for conveying accurate information
00:07:40 to the media and government officials
00:07:43 is the “Newsroom” section of jw.org.
00:07:47 However, seeing the need
00:07:50 for our brotherhood to have a source of reliable reports
00:07:53 about current events involving Jehovah’s people,
00:07:58 the majority of articles are now written
00:08:01 with you in mind.
00:08:04 Quite a few have expressed appreciation
00:08:06 for the “Imprisoned for Their Faith” feature,
00:08:09 which is now updated monthly
00:08:12 and allows us to mention
00:08:14 imprisoned brothers by name in our prayers.
00:08:18 Just as an example, these are the faces
00:08:21 of some of our young brothers in Turkmenistan
00:08:24 who have been imprisoned as conscientious objectors
00:08:27 during 2018.
00:08:31 Jesus foretold:
00:08:33 “You will be hated by all the nations
00:08:36 on account of my name.”
00:08:38 So we recognize that no amount of effort
00:08:41 to educate government officials
00:08:43 is going to change that.
00:08:47 Like Pharaoh, some of the world’s dictators
00:08:50 ‘harden their hearts’ against Jehovah.
00:08:53 However, Jesus also foretold:
00:08:56 “You will be brought before governors and kings
00:08:59 “for my sake, for a witness
00:09:02 to them and the nations.”
00:09:05 It’s not just OPI that is giving a witness to the governments,
00:09:10 it is every brother and sister that officials come in contact with.
00:09:15 We’ve often heard a government official say
00:09:18 that they know either a schoolmate, a former workmate,
00:09:21 or a relative who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:09:25 Additionally, each and every brother
00:09:28 in prison is giving a witness.
00:09:31 For example, on July 15, 2018,
00:09:35 during a press interview, the prime minister of Armenia
00:09:39 commented on his contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:09:42 when he was a political prisoner.
00:09:44 He said:
00:09:46 “There were prisoners, Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:09:49 “who were there for not serving in the army.
00:09:52 “These people were convinced
00:09:55 about their beliefs.”
00:09:57 Then he added, “You don’t have to agree with them,
00:10:01 but you could feel it was their conviction.”
00:10:05 So who knows if someone who observes your conduct
00:10:09 or who you talk to in field service or on public transport
00:10:13 may be the very person
00:10:16 who one day is in a government position
00:10:18 and knows something about Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:10:20 because of what you did or said.
00:10:24 Indeed, we couldn’t do the work at OPI
00:10:27 without you brothers and sisters
00:10:29 setting such a fine example.
00:10:32 Those who work in the Office of Public Information
00:10:36 under the direction of the Coordinators’ Committee
00:10:39 consider it a real privilege to support all of you
00:10:42 by communicating with government officials
00:10:45 and representatives of the media and academia
00:10:48 —by conveying our beliefs and practices
00:10:51 with “accurate words of truth.”
00:11:08 Thank you kindly, Brother Gillies,
00:11:11 for that thought-provoking update
00:11:14 on the important work being done
00:11:17 in the Office of Public Information.
00:11:21 Notice how quickly I learned the meaning of that acronym.
00:11:24 And if you remember from a previous annual meeting,
00:11:27 Brother Herd especially likes acronyms.
00:11:31 Brother Gillies, we know Britain misses having you,
00:11:35 but we’re very happy to have you
00:11:37 with us here at headquarters.
00:11:41 But you will have to learn how to correctly say, “schedule.”
00:11:51 But we love you anyway.
00:11:56 But now, let me ask you this:
00:11:59 Does it seem like
00:12:01 our brothers and sisters around the globe
00:12:05 are being pummeled with more and more natural disasters?
00:12:10 Well, you’ll find out.
00:12:12 Brother John Ekrann,
00:12:14 who serves as a helper
00:12:16 to the Coordinators’ Committee, will give us the facts.
00:12:19 You’ll find it very interesting.
00:12:21 Brother Ekrann, please.
00:12:24 Two thousand seventeen and 2018
00:12:26 were certainly record years for disasters.
00:12:29 Just look at a few of the headlines
00:12:32 from the news in 2017 and 2018.
00:12:35 There were earthquakes in Mexico,
00:12:38 plague in Madagascar,  food shortages in Venezuela
00:12:42 —disasters are going to get worse—
00:12:44 war in Congo, deadly Nipah virus in India,
00:12:49 a volcano erupts in Guatemala,
00:12:51 violence in Cameroon,
00:12:53 and Ebola in the DRC.
00:12:56 Now, we are not surprised
00:12:58 because we see the increased frequency
00:13:01 and intensity of disasters
00:13:03 as fulfillment of Bible prophecy.
00:13:06 If we look at Luke chapter 21
00:13:09 and look at verses 10 and 11,
00:13:14 Jesus said:
00:13:16 “Then he said to them: ‘Nation will rise against nation,
00:13:20 “‘and kingdom against kingdom.
00:13:22 “‘There will be great earthquakes,
00:13:24 “‘and in one place after another
00:13:26 food shortages and pestilences.’”
00:13:29 We are actually witnessing
00:13:31 and can see the fulfillment of Jesus’ words.
00:13:35 We are seeing ‘earthquakes
00:13:40 in one place after another’
00:13:43 —and truly great earthquakes as Jesus described.
00:13:50 Volcanoes dump huge amounts of ash and smoke into the air.
00:13:54 Tornadoes, hurricanes, and typhoon winds
00:13:59 destroy buildings and property.
00:14:01 Rain and flooding from these huge storms
00:14:03 cause rivers to overflow
00:14:06 and damage large areas of lands and property,
00:14:12 causing mud and debris to flow into buildings
00:14:14 like this expandable Kingdom Hall.
00:14:16 Wildfires engulf both forests
00:14:19 and communities in flames and smoke,
00:14:22 leaving only behind the charred remains
00:14:26 of what was once called home.
00:14:30 Now, when there is a disaster,
00:14:32 all of us are keenly interested to know,
00:14:34 ‘How are our brothers and sisters doing?’
00:14:37 The “JW News” section of jw.org
00:14:40 is regularly updated with news
00:14:43 of how our brothers and sisters are affected by a certain disaster.
00:14:50 Just here, we see some of the headlines
00:14:53 that are on “JW News” lately,
00:14:55 and we encourage you to read this section regularly
00:14:58 to stay up-to-date.
00:15:00 Now, to show you the size and scale
00:15:03 of disasters lately, look at this map
00:15:06 as we plot on it the disasters that have occurred
00:15:08 in just the last service year.
00:15:11 And do you notice the number of brothers
00:15:13 that are affected?
00:15:17 Did you notice close to half a million of our brothers
00:15:21 were directly affected by these disasters
00:15:24 in just the last couple of years?
00:15:26 Now, it’s sad to say that 22 of our brothers and sisters
00:15:30 died in these disasters
00:15:32 and 84 were seriously injured.
00:15:37 Tens of thousands of our brothers have had to find new homes.
00:15:41 And of these, 14,000 had to completely flee their homeland.
00:15:46 Now, we want all of you to know
00:15:49 that have been affected by many of these disasters
00:15:52 just in the last couple of years
00:15:55 that we love and pray for you.
00:15:57 You are not lost or forgotten.
00:16:01 Jehovah says at Isaiah 49:15:
00:16:04 “I would never forget you.”
00:16:07 Now, proof that Jehovah has not forgotten you
00:16:10 is the love of your brotherhood.
00:16:14 Now, Acts chapter 2 describes in the first century
00:16:16 how the brothers then took care of one another.
00:16:20 Acts chapter 2 describes how our brothers
00:16:23 were willing to sell properties and possessions
00:16:25 to help one another out.
00:16:27 And in Acts chapter 11, the brothers sent relief aid
00:16:31 to those who were facing a very great famine.
00:16:35 Well, how has our united brotherhood responded
00:16:38 to these disasters today?
00:16:40 Well, there’s a fine phrase in Philippians 1:27
00:16:44 that can show, really, how our brothers and sisters
00:16:48 —all of us— are helping one another.
00:16:50 Philippians 1:27, it says:
00:16:54 “Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ,
00:16:57 “so that whether I come and see you or I am absent,
00:17:00 “I may hear about you and learn
00:17:03 “that you are standing firm in one spirit,
00:17:05 “with one soul, (and here’s the phrase)
00:17:07 “striving side by side
00:17:10 for the faith of the good news.”
00:17:14 Well, one very big way
00:17:16 that we can ‘strive side by side’ in helping one another
00:17:19 is by our donations  to the worldwide work.
00:17:23 This chart gives you an idea
00:17:25 of the cost of disasters
00:17:27 and how they’ve jumped in 2018.
00:17:30 As you can see, we spent on an average
00:17:32 between five and seven million dollars
00:17:34 on disaster relief in past service years.
00:17:37 But look, though, what has happened in 2018.
00:17:41 Just in 2018, it has climbed
00:17:44 to over 33 million dollars.
00:17:48 Now, what will happen in 2019?
00:17:51 What will we see?
00:17:53 Well, it’s already off to a big start in September.
00:17:57 The Governing Body asked that I pass along to all of you
00:18:00 thanks and appreciation for your generous donations.
00:18:05 We would like to assure you
00:18:07 that your donations are being put to good use
00:18:09 in helping in one disaster after another.
00:18:14 Now, another way that we as a brotherhood
00:18:17 work side by side
00:18:19 is volunteering to assist in a disaster.
00:18:24 Thousands of our brothers and sisters
00:18:27 have willingly volunteered to reconstruct or repair Kingdom Halls
00:18:31 or our brothers’ and sisters’ homes.
00:18:35 Others carry and deliver food, water,
00:18:37 and many other items needed after a disaster
00:18:39 to help our brothers
00:18:42 by using any transportation means possible:
00:18:46 horses, boats, trucks.
00:18:49 Some volunteer with paint rollers and brushes.
00:18:52 Others show up with shovels to clean up after a disaster,
00:18:55 prepare meals for the workers,
00:18:59 put supply packages together,
00:19:01 and sort, bag,
00:19:04 and deliver them —all with a smile.
00:19:07 Just look at all these happy faces!
00:19:11 We want to thank all of you
00:19:13 that have worked so hard on disaster relief,
00:19:16 especially the last couple of years.
00:19:18 We also want to thank the departments at headquarters,
00:19:21 the Branch Committees, the branch departments,
00:19:25 the circuit overseers, LDCs, disaster relief committees,
00:19:29 and all of you elders worldwide
00:19:31 that have really pitched in and helped so much
00:19:34 with disaster relief efforts the past couple of years.
00:19:37 Thank you.
00:19:39 Well, how do our brothers and sisters feel
00:19:42 about your love and support?
00:19:44 Well, as you watch this next video,
00:19:47 I’m going to read to you a sentence or two
00:19:51 from different letters of appreciation
00:19:54 that our brothers have sent in following a disaster:
00:20:01 “Jehovah knows when we’re in need, and he spoils us
00:20:05 “by giving us even more than we ask for.
00:20:08 “Your deep concern as well as the spiritual, emotional,
00:20:13 “and material support you’ve provided and that we’re still receiving
00:20:17 “is a real soothing ointment that can help us to endure.
00:20:24 “When we see our belongings covered with mud brought outside
00:20:28 “and thrown as garbage,
00:20:30 “we feel very heartbroken.
00:20:32 “But the brothers and sisters saw them,
00:20:35 “not as a lump of garbage,
00:20:38 “but as a mass of our feelings.
00:20:41 “The day the construction brothers arrived at my home, I burst into tears.
00:20:45 “I’d like to clarify that I didn’t cry because I was going to get a new house
00:20:49 “but because I saw Jehovah’s hand in my life.
00:20:55 “The transformation was not limited to my house.
00:20:57 “This experience has changed me.
00:21:00 “I’ve not only seen but also felt Jehovah’s tender care.
00:21:06 “They not only repaired our house; they also repaired our heart.
00:21:09 “We were able to see Jehovah in this beautiful work
00:21:12 “of strengthening help.
00:21:15 “Even though we lost our possessions, being busy
00:21:18 “in the construction and preaching work helped us to maintain
00:21:20 “our emotional and spiritual balance.
00:21:23 “We felt a lump in our throats at being witnesses
00:21:28 to the tender care of our protective God.”
00:21:46 We can expect that disasters are going to intensify
00:21:50 as we get closer to the end of this system.
00:21:53 The study note on Mark 13:8
00:21:57 on the phrase “pangs of distress” says this:
00:22:00 ‘It may suggest that like birth pains the foretold troubles and suffering
00:22:05 ‘will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration
00:22:09 in the time period before a great tribulation.’
00:22:14 Who knows?
00:22:16 You may be next to need help from your brothers.
00:22:21 Be prepared, but at the same time,
00:22:24 don’t put trust in money or your belongings.
00:22:27 All can be gone instantly.
00:22:31 While nothing of our possessions will last forever,
00:22:34 the love of Jehovah and the love of our brothers will.
00:22:38 As we face increasing disasters,
00:22:41 let’s continue side by side
00:22:44 to help everyone
00:22:46 —each one of us— to survive this old system.
00:23:05 We appreciate very much, Brother Ekrann,
00:23:08 that enlightening report that you gave us.
00:23:13 Now, those were some necessary announcements
00:23:16 you needed to know about,
00:23:18 but we have two more
00:23:20 very exciting announcements.
00:23:23 And we thought it would be better if you were seated for these.
00:23:28 Here’s the first one:
00:23:30 The Governing Body has approved
00:23:33 a significant redesign
00:23:36 of the jw.org® website
00:23:39 to include the features
00:23:42 of JW Broadcasting®
00:23:44 and Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™.
00:23:48 Additionally, the JW Library® app
00:23:51 will be redesigned and will incorporate
00:23:54 the content and features
00:23:57 of Watchtower Library.
00:23:59 As a result, the overall appearance
00:24:02 of the new website and app will be unified
00:24:06 and become more user-friendly.
00:24:10 Planning and design work
00:24:12 have already begun
00:24:15 on this very large project.
00:24:17 You should see certain improvements within a few months.
00:24:21 Now this time, less than six months does apply.
00:24:24 But what do you think of that?
00:24:37 Here’s one more very exciting announcement
00:24:40 —especially for our field missionaries,
00:24:44 some of whom may be here in attendance,
00:24:47 you’ll be happy you were seated:
00:24:50 For nearly 75 years,
00:24:53 Gilead-trained missionaries
00:24:56 have been serving in the worldwide field,
00:24:59 opening up new territories
00:25:01 as well as strengthening the brotherhood.
00:25:04 The majority of these missionaries continue to serve
00:25:07 in field assignments and have gained valuable experience.
00:25:12 We are pleased to inform you
00:25:15 that the Governing Body has given approval
00:25:18 for all field missionaries
00:25:21 with an FMF enrollment
00:25:24 who have been serving
00:25:26 for at least five years to attend
00:25:30 the School of Kingdom Evangelizers—SKE.
00:25:34 This provision will reinforce
00:25:37 the spirituality of these dear ones.
00:25:39 They will be mixed into the SKE classes
00:25:43 along with new students
00:25:45 to allow others to benefit from their experience.
00:25:48 Approved missionaries will attend SKE
00:25:52 in the location of the school of the country
00:25:55 to which they are assigned.
00:26:13 We’re all very happy
00:26:15 for you hard-working field missionaries.
00:26:19 But now, Brother Herd has a couple more acronyms
00:26:22 as a result of this announcement
00:26:24 —the FMF enrollment
00:26:28 and SKE classes.
00:26:32 So Brother Herd, I hope you took note of that.
00:26:36 But now, for the next one hour and twenty minutes,
00:26:40 we’re going to get to enjoy
00:26:43 some very exciting, fast-moving,
00:26:46 enlightening talks
00:26:49 given by five different members of the Governing Body.
00:26:52 You notice, I highlighted that word “enlightening.”
00:26:55 Our leadoff speaker
00:26:57 is Brother Kenneth Cook
00:26:59 who will present the talk, “We Should Be Teachers.”
00:27:04 Brother Cook.
00:27:06 After a convention, we often say
00:27:09 that the teaching was better than ever.
00:27:13 But even the best teachers at this convention
00:27:16 or your convention or on today’s program
00:27:19 are no match for the Great Teacher.
00:27:22 Jesus was an exceptional teacher.
00:27:26 Imagine what it would have been like to hear Jesus teach.
00:27:29 What made him so effective?
00:27:32 We don’t have to guess.
00:27:34 Consider a few of the methods that he used in the Sermon on the Mount.
00:27:38 For example, his introduction
00:27:41 aroused interest and introduced his subject.
00:27:44 At Matthew chapter 5, for example,
00:27:48 and verse 3, Jesus simply said:
00:27:51 “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.”
00:27:55 That simple statement provided the interest for his listeners.
00:28:00 They would want to know, ‘How would this make me happy?’
00:28:04 He then added:
00:28:06 “. . . since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.”
00:28:10 And there is the subject
00:28:12 that he consistently used to mark his teaching.
00:28:16 Jesus also used effective questions to reason with his listeners.
00:28:21 He crafted simple but powerful illustrations.
00:28:24 And if birds and lilies were on hand,
00:28:28 perhaps he was actually using visual aids
00:28:31 during that Sermon on the Mount.
00:28:33 Finally, his conclusion was simple;
00:28:35 it was brief and motivating.
00:28:38 No wonder Jesus’ listeners were astounded!
00:28:42 Did Jesus expect us
00:28:44 to be merely astounded at his teaching, though?
00:28:47 No.
00:28:48 He commissioned his disciples to ‘go preaching and teaching.’
00:28:53 Paul later plainly told the Hebrew Christians:
00:28:56 “You should be teachers.”
00:28:58 Why was effective teaching so necessary then and now?
00:29:03 Because lives are involved.
00:29:06 Parents, Satan is waging war for the hearts of your children,
00:29:11 so it’s never been more important to inculcate the truth in them.
00:29:16 It means their life.
00:29:18 Elders, our fellow worshippers are battered by this system,
00:29:22 so it’s never been more important
00:29:24 to encourage and strengthen them to endure.
00:29:27 It means their life.
00:29:30 And publishers, that’s all of us here,
00:29:33 the end is rapidly drawing near,
00:29:36 so it’s never been more important to teach Bible truth
00:29:38 in a simple,  appealing, and motivating way.
00:29:42 It means life to those who listen to us.
00:29:47 Because teaching is so important,
00:29:50 Jehovah has motivated skilled teachers
00:29:52 to pass on their methods to others.
00:29:55 For this reason, the Bible tells us that Paul imparted to Timothy
00:30:00 not only what to teach
00:30:02 but also his methods, or how to teach.
00:30:07 Those methods, it says, were valid everywhere
00:30:11 in every congregation,
00:30:13 so Timothy passed those methods on to others.
00:30:17 Today, Jehovah’s organization
00:30:19 has endeavored to follow the same pattern.
00:30:22 Teaching teachers has a long history
00:30:26 in Jehovah’s organization.
00:30:28 Let’s look at some modern examples
00:30:30 of how Jehovah has trained us to be teachers.
00:30:34 In 1922, The School of the Prophets
00:30:37 was used by some groups of Bible students
00:30:40 to develop the art of public teaching and speaking.
00:30:44 One suggestion in the booklet
00:30:46 was to practice a figure-eight gesture,
00:30:49 yes, so that speakers would learn
00:30:52 to move their arms and hands in curves.
00:30:57 Those schools were later discontinued.
00:31:01 Nineteen forty-two
00:31:03 —even before the Theocratic Ministry School
00:31:06 was introduced to the congregations—
00:31:08 a series of articles in Consolation magazine
00:31:11 appeared until 1945 under the heading
00:31:14 “Presenting ‘This Gospel of the Kingdom.’”
00:31:17 The first article stated the series’ purpose.
00:31:20 It said: “To give helpful instruction and practical hints
00:31:25 “to such ones as would publish God’s kingdom
00:31:28 “after the example of Christ himself . . .
00:31:30 “Study and apply this instruction,
00:31:33 and note your improvement as a Kingdom publisher.”
00:31:37 Nineteen forty-three
00:31:39 —the booklet Course in Theocratic Ministry
00:31:42 featured 52 lessons,
00:31:44 one for each week of the year,
00:31:46 in conjunction with the newly formed
00:31:49 Theocratic Ministry School.
00:31:51 Nineteen forty-five
00:31:53 —the book  Theocratic Aid to Kingdom Publishers
00:31:57 expanded that course to 90 lessons.
00:32:01 Nineteen fifty-five
00:32:03 —the book Qualified to Be Ministers
00:32:06 was described in The Watchtower
00:32:08 as the “best yet” book
00:32:10 for the Theocratic Ministry School
00:32:12 until it was revised into an even better qualified book
00:32:16 in 1967.
00:32:19 Nineteen seventy-one
00:32:21 —the Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook was released.
00:32:24 And then in 2002, we received
00:32:28 Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education,
00:32:31 which included new study points, exercises,
00:32:35 and a counsel form right in the book.
00:32:39 Clearly, as needs change, Jehovah provides us
00:32:43 with new tools to improve our teaching.
00:32:47 Is it time for a new tool to improve our skills as teachers?
00:32:53 Consider the following regarding our Ministry School textbook:
00:32:57 (1) Terminology:
00:33:00 The contents and even the title of that book
00:33:02 refer to the Theocratic Ministry School,
00:33:05 and that, as such, is no longer in place.
00:33:08 (2) Simplicity:
00:33:11 Many find it difficult to quickly find key ideas
00:33:15 in the book’s 53 study points.
00:33:18 An elder from Georgia, U.S.A., wrote,
00:33:20 “In the short time available to direct the congregation
00:33:24 “to specific locations in the book,
00:33:26 “it makes it very difficult for the brothers
00:33:29 to find where the chairman is.”
00:33:32 (3) Translation:
00:33:35 It isn’t easy to translate a book this big.
00:33:37 In fact, in over 200 languages around the globe,
00:33:40 congregations have the Meeting Workbook
00:33:44 but lack the Ministry School book.
00:33:47 For all of these reasons and more,
00:33:50 we are pleased to announce a release
00:33:52 that addresses those concerns
00:33:54 and that will help more of God’s people
00:33:56 to improve their teaching.
00:33:58 It is a 28-page brochure entitled
00:34:02 Apply Yourself to Reading and Teaching.
00:34:20 The chairman will let you know
00:34:22 how you can access a copy for your personal use
00:34:25 —no doubt in less than six months.
00:34:29 In addition, the instructions  for Our Christian Life and Ministry Meeting
00:34:34 will soon be revised and made available to the public.
00:34:38 Now this brochure will be used
00:34:40 at our midweek meetings worldwide
00:34:43 beginning January 7, 2019.
00:34:47 Don’t discard your Ministry School book, though.
00:34:50 Although we won’t be using it at our weekly meetings,
00:34:53 it is still a very valuable reference.
00:34:56 Would you like to know more about some
00:34:58 of this new brochure’s features?
00:35:07 We begin with brevity.
00:35:09 There are only 20 study points,
00:35:12 and each study point is only one page long.
00:35:15 Does this mean important points have been omitted?
00:35:17 No.
00:35:19 In many cases, similar points have been combined.
00:35:22 For example, “Study 5—Accurate Reading,”
00:35:25 incorporates key ideas from three points
00:35:27 in the Ministry School book.
00:35:29 They are accurate reading,
00:35:31 words clearly spoken,
00:35:33 and correct pronunciation.
00:35:36 After all, reading accurately includes pronouncing
00:35:39 each word correctly and clearly.
00:35:41 Oh, and by the way,
00:35:43 the brochure does not suggest using that figure-eight gesture,
00:35:46 so you don’t have to worry about that.
00:35:48 Another feature is clarity.
00:35:50 Each study features two or three main points
00:35:54 with simple, direct instructions,
00:35:56 and some study points also include practical tips
00:36:00 that relate to the main point.
00:36:02 In addition, you will find
00:36:04 that many of the study points
00:36:06 include a box entitled “In the Ministry.”
00:36:09 Why?
00:36:10 Because while most of the points in the brochure
00:36:13 apply both to the field ministry and to teaching from the platform,
00:36:17 suggestions that are specific to the field ministry
00:36:20 appear in this separate box.
00:36:23 Next is a feature that you will really find of interest:
00:36:27 “Record Your Progress.”
00:36:30 One of the last pages of the brochure
00:36:32 is for you to record the date you consider each study point.
00:36:36 More about that in a moment.
00:36:38 So there are some features.
00:36:40 But how will the new brochure address the three needs
00:36:43 that we mentioned earlier, namely terminology,
00:36:46 simplicity, and translation?
00:36:49 We begin with terminology.
00:36:52 The brochure uses updated expressions,
00:36:55 but it does not refer to specific meetings or meeting parts.
00:36:59 Therefore, it will not need to be frequently revised.
00:37:04 Next, simplicity: Fewer study points
00:37:08 and a simple easy-to-use layout
00:37:11 will allow the chairman to isolate main points quickly
00:37:15 and will help the audience
00:37:17 to follow along closely  with the chairman.
00:37:19 Also, and you elders are going to love this,
00:37:23 more is being done to simplify the work
00:37:26 of the chairman and the Life and Ministry Meeting overseer.
00:37:30 Beginning January 7, 2019,
00:37:33 the instructions in the Meeting Workbook for each student assignment
00:37:37 will include in parentheses the specific study point
00:37:41 that the student should work on.
00:37:43 As an example, for the week of January 7th,
00:37:47 all brothers worldwide who are assigned the Bible reading
00:37:51 will consider “Study 5—Accurate Reading.”
00:38:06 We thought you would like that.
00:38:08 Life and Ministry Meeting  overseers and chairmen
00:38:11 will no longer need to worry  about assigning study points
00:38:14 or keeping track  of what each student is working on.
00:38:17 Would you like to see a chairman use
00:38:19 the new brochure to assist a student?
00:38:26 Please watch.
00:38:30 “. . . and Abednego over the administration  of the province of Babylon,
00:38:34 but Daniel served in the king’s court.”
00:38:39 Thank you, Brother Gomez.
00:38:40 That was an excellent reading.
00:38:42 You were accurate, fluent,
00:38:44 and we could tell that you prepared well.
00:38:46 You were working  on study point number 10, “Modulation.”
00:38:50 The summary tells us that we have  two goals when modulating our voice.
00:38:54 One goal is to stir emotion.
00:38:56 You stirred our emotions  when you read Daniel 2:47:
00:39:00 “Truly your God is a God of gods.”
00:39:03 By raising your pitch, you conveyed  Nebuchadnezzar’s intensity and surprise.
00:39:08 That’s the way to do it.
00:39:10 A second goal is to convey ideas clearly.
00:39:15 One way to do it is to increase our volume.
00:39:17 For example, what is the main point of verse 44?
00:39:21 Isn’t it that Jehovah will set up a Kingdom?
00:39:25 So instead of emphasizing the word “kings,”
00:39:28 you might increase your volume when reading “God of heaven.”
00:39:32 “In the days of those kings  the God of heaven will set up a kingdom.”
00:39:38 So that’s something you might try when preparing to read a scripture.
00:39:41 Look for the main point in each verse,
00:39:43 and then try varying your pitch, pace, or volume to make that idea stand out.
00:39:47 Thank you, Brother Gomez. Well done!
00:39:50 For our next part, we’ll consider . . .
00:40:00 That was a very good example
00:40:02 of concise and helpful one-minute comments
00:40:06 and counsel by the chairman.
00:40:08 But where does the chairman write
00:40:10 whether the student completed the assigned point?
00:40:13 He doesn’t write anything.
00:40:16 But on the page “Record Your Progress” mentioned earlier,
00:40:20 who will write the dates that the student considered each point?
00:40:23 The student, not the chairman.
00:40:26 When should a student record a date on this page?
00:40:28 Well that’s up to you, the student.
00:40:31 Many will likely record the date
00:40:33 that they are assigned  to consider a specific point
00:40:35 for a student assignment.
00:40:37 Others, including elders, who may not handle
00:40:40 student assignments regularly, may want to consider
00:40:43 each of these points on their own.
00:40:46 Each brother and sister can decide when and how
00:40:49 to use this page to record their progress.
00:40:51 This “Record Your Progress” page is for your personal use.
00:40:56 Now, so far, we’ve looked at the need
00:40:58 for updated terminology and greater simplicity.
00:41:00 Now let’s consider that third point: translation.
00:41:04 You will be thrilled to know that the Governing Body
00:41:06 has already approved for this brochure
00:41:08 to be translated into over 350 languages
00:41:12 —more than twice the number of languages
00:41:14 that produce the current textbook.
00:41:17 But the same brevity that allows us
00:41:20 to expand the translation also means
00:41:23 that there are few real-life examples in the brochure
00:41:26 that show how to apply the study points.
00:41:29 So wouldn’t it be helpful to see how to put the study points into action,
00:41:34 both from the platform and in the field ministry?
00:41:37 Indeed it would.
00:41:39 For this reason, the Governing Body has approved the production of 20 videos
00:41:43 —one for each study point—
00:41:45 to depict the application of these points.
00:41:48 Let’s watch the video
00:41:49 for “Study 1—Effective Introduction.”
00:42:03 You’re at the Kingdom Hall about to give a public talk.
00:42:07 Will the audience listen to what you have to say?
00:42:11 Much depends on how you introduce your subject.
00:42:16 An effective introduction arouses interest,
00:42:19 identifies your subject,
00:42:21 and shows why the subject is important to your listeners.
00:42:26 Let’s give our brother an opportunity to introduce his subject.
00:42:32 As the meeting chairman mentioned,
00:42:34 we’re going to talk about death
00:42:37 and what it means to you and me.
00:42:40 Let’s read a scripture
00:42:42 at Ecclesiastes 9:5.
00:42:45 So, what do you think?
00:42:48 Did the speaker identify his subject?
00:42:51 Yes.
00:42:53 Did he arouse interest?
00:42:55 Not so much.
00:42:57 Did he show why the subject is important?
00:43:00 No.
00:43:02 So how might he approach the subject differently?
00:43:05 Let’s watch.
00:43:08 Throughout all of human history,
00:43:10 not one person has escaped death.
00:43:14 The lives of some people are cut short suddenly
00:43:17 by unexpected events or illness.
00:43:21 Have you ever lost a loved one in death?
00:43:24 If so, you know how painful that is.
00:43:27 Yet how can something that causes so much pain
00:43:31 be a normal, natural part of life?
00:43:35 The Bible is the key
00:43:37 to understanding why we die,
00:43:40 where we go when we die,
00:43:42 and how death will be reversed.
00:43:46 Let’s consider each of those points.
00:43:49 You can apply this principle
00:43:51 to any subject when giving a talk.
00:43:54 But how can you effectively introduce
00:43:56 a subject in the ministry?
00:43:59 Remember, of course, that in most cases
00:44:01 you’re a complete stranger to the householder.
00:44:03 Try not to startle the person.
00:44:05 Identify yourself early in the conversation.
00:44:09 To determine what a person might be interested in,
00:44:12 observe his activities or surroundings.
00:44:15 You might begin by asking a question
00:44:18 or making a brief comment about those things.
00:44:21 Let’s consider one example.
00:44:27 Hi, my name is Jill.
00:44:29 I’m here to talk about God’s purpose for the future.
00:44:32 The Bible says here—
00:44:34 Sorry, but I don’t have time to talk.
00:44:39 Was the introduction effective?
00:44:43 The householder didn’t want to continue the conversation,
00:44:45 so apparently the introduction didn’t arouse interest.
00:44:50 How might the publisher have handled the situation better?
00:44:58 Good morning.
00:44:59 You have a beautiful garden.
00:45:02 It must take a lot of work.
00:45:05 It sure does!
00:45:06 Well, your work is certainly paying off.
00:45:09 Thank you.
00:45:10 By the way, my name is Jill, and this is Tammy.
00:45:13 I’m Emily.
00:45:15 Emily, you work so hard to care for the garden you planted.
00:45:19 Do you think that God cares the same way
00:45:22 about this planet that he created?
00:45:27 Because the publisher took into account
00:45:30 the interests of the householder,
00:45:32 she increased the chances of starting a conversation
00:45:35 and sharing the Kingdom message.
00:45:38 This can also be done in urban areas
00:45:40 where people expect you to get right to the point.
00:45:42 In such settings, try to include a thought-provoking statement
00:45:46 or question in your introduction.
00:45:50 Effective introductions are the first step
00:45:53 toward productive conversations
00:45:56 and presentations of the good news.
00:46:16 Jesus foretold that the ‘preaching of the good news
00:46:19 of the Kingdom will stop when the end comes.’
00:46:21 So our work is urgent.
00:46:24 However, the work of teaching has only just begun.
00:46:27 Isaiah 26:9 says of Jehovah
00:46:30 that “when there are judgments from you for the earth,
00:46:34 the inhabitants of the land learn about righteousness.”
00:46:37 And that will certainly prove to be true in the new world.
00:46:40 The great crowd will soon be invited
00:46:42 to teach vast numbers of resurrected ones.
00:46:45 You may study with someone who lived 3,000 years ago or more.
00:46:50 Imagine how helpful it will be
00:46:53 to have learned how to explain unfamiliar terms
00:46:56 in “Study 17—Understandable to Others.”
00:47:00 Your student may have lived during the Middle Ages
00:47:02 when people were taught to fear the clergy
00:47:05 rather than to love God.
00:47:07 But you will have already learned from Study 19
00:47:09 how to “Reach the Heart” of your student.
00:47:12 And when you’re asked to summarize
00:47:14 all that Jehovah did for his people during the last days,
00:47:17 you’ll need to keep things simple,
00:47:19 something you learned in “Study 14—Main Points Made to Stand Out.”
00:47:24 Even today, however, we must be teachers.
00:47:28 So use this new brochure to ‘continue applying yourself
00:47:31 to reading and teaching.’
00:47:33 By doing this, the Bible tells us:
00:47:35 “You will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”
00:47:54 Thank you so much, Brother Cook,
00:47:56 and thank you also for joining us on the Governing Body.
00:48:00 To borrow words from Brother Sydlik:
00:48:03 “The Lord knew we needed your help.”
00:48:06 I’m still working on that too.
00:48:11 But we have the following announcement
00:48:13 regarding our wonderful new brochure
00:48:16 —and I double checked; I got the right announcement this time:
00:48:20 The Teaching brochure
00:48:22 in all available languages
00:48:25 will be released on jw.org,
00:48:28 Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™,
00:48:31 and JW Library®
00:48:33 on Monday October 8, 2018.
00:48:38 Now, in addition to that, if you will be making use
00:48:42 of a hard copy of this publication,
00:48:44 one copy of the printed edition
00:48:47 will be available after the program
00:48:50 at the various annual meeting locations,
00:48:53 including the main lobby of your complex
00:48:57 for those watching from their personal rooms.
00:49:01 Additional printed copies
00:49:03 may be requested through the congregations.
00:49:06 So Monday —in two days—
00:49:08 you get this one electronically.
00:49:11 But now, moving to our next talk.
00:49:14 We’re privileged to listen
00:49:16 to Brother Anthony Morris,
00:49:18 and he’s going to deliver the gripping talk,
00:49:23 “This Is It!”
00:49:26 I hope that I rendered justice
00:49:28 to announcing that title, Brother Morris.
00:49:31 I’ll talk to you later on.
00:49:45 It ruined my introduction, but that’s all right.
00:49:50 But I think all of you would agree
00:49:53 how much we enjoyed the museum video
00:49:57 and hearing Brother Fred Franz
00:49:59 —his voice— talking about after the assassination
00:50:03 of the archduke that the brothers said, ‘Aha!
00:50:07 ‘There it is! There it is!
00:50:10 What we’ve been waiting for.’
00:50:13 Well, that’s very stirring,
00:50:15 and then we would have critics saying,
00:50:17 ‘Yeah, but you people had other expectations
00:50:21 that were not realized,’ and etcetera, you know.
00:50:25 But it’s amazing that even the world
00:50:28 recognized that this was unique—1914.
00:50:33 See? In fact, I’ve had this for many years.
00:50:37 I want to show it to you.
00:50:38 It’s The New World Magazine.
00:50:41 And it was widely read at the time,
00:50:43 and I guess about 1931, they went out of business.
00:50:48 But here,  “End of All Kingdoms in 1914
00:50:53 —‘Millennial Dawners’ 25 Year Prophecy,”
00:50:56 widely read; other newspapers covered it.
00:50:59 They made comments here:
00:51:01 “The terrific war outbreak in Europe
00:51:04 “has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy.
00:51:07 “For a quarter of a century past,
00:51:10 “through preachers and through press,
00:51:12 “the ‘International Bible Students,’ best known as ‘Millennial Dawners,’
00:51:16 “have been proclaiming to the world that the Day of Wrath
00:51:19 “prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914.
00:51:23 “‘Look out for 1914!’
00:51:25 has been the cry of the hundreds of traveling evangelists.”
00:51:30 And I appreciate very much how
00:51:32 the Yearbook in 1975
00:51:34 considering our modern-day history
00:51:37 made this beautiful quote:
00:51:40 “Disappointments about going to heaven
00:51:42 “in 1914 really were very minor,
00:51:46 “compared with the great expectations realized
00:51:49 in connection with that year.”
00:51:51 And it’s amazing.
00:51:53 During the first six months of 1914, nothing happened.
00:51:55 They were being ridiculed.
00:51:57 And then the archduke is assassinated.
00:52:01 This one was particularly released
00:52:04 on August 30, 1914.
00:52:06 Millions died in World War I.
00:52:11 So it’s Brother Franz’s statement
00:52:14 that really gave the idea for the theme here:
00:52:18 “This Is It!”
00:52:20 The question arises, Will we have
00:52:24 one or more times —in the future or even now—
00:52:27 when we can say, “This is it”
00:52:30 and have that same exciting fervor
00:52:34 because of Bible prophecy?
00:52:37 Well, let’s begin with this one here.
00:52:41 Find Daniel chapter 11,
00:52:45 Daniel chapter 11.
00:52:51 And we’re going to read here verse 40,
00:52:54 or half of it:
00:52:59 “In the time of the end the king of the south
00:53:02 (here at Daniel 11:40) will engage with him in a pushing.”
00:53:08 So the Governing Body
00:53:12 has been prayerfully considering recent events.
00:53:17 And we know that in 1991,
00:53:21 the Soviet Union came to an end.
00:53:23 So who is “the king of the north”?
00:53:29 Well, after prayerfully considering it
00:53:31 and the matter of the pushing,
00:53:33 we’re assuring you that what we see,
00:53:38 after prayerfully considering it, is that it’s Russia
00:53:41 and its allies —the king of the north.
00:53:44 Now, here’s some reasoning.
00:53:46 The Soviet Union disbanded;
00:53:50 Russia came up from the rubble
00:53:52 of the Soviet Union, along with its allies.
00:53:56 And here are some of the facts.
00:54:00 Two things have become apparent.
00:54:03 Russia and its allies are continuing to engage
00:54:06 in a pushing with the king of the south.
00:54:09 We’ll get to that “pushing” point shortly.
00:54:13 And the second, they are taking the lead
00:54:16 in persecuting and opposing God’s people.
00:54:20 Now, notice what the pushing includes:
00:54:23 electronic espionage,
00:54:26 computer attacks,
00:54:29 trade wars
00:54:31 (and that’s what they call them),
00:54:33 and the hostile flooding into surrounding territory.
00:54:37 These are recurring features of the news headlines.
00:54:40 You’re aware of them.
00:54:42 So someone asks if the king of the north has been inactive.
00:54:45 Well, no.
00:54:47 It appears he’s never been this busy
00:54:50 with pushing the king of the south.
00:54:53 So this is it!
00:54:55 At this point, we’re confident to share with you that Russia
00:54:58 and its allies are the king of the north,
00:55:01 and they’re engaged in this pushing.
00:55:04 In fact, last month, they had the largest war games
00:55:07 —Russia did— since the Soviet Union
00:55:11 was in existence way back in the ’80’s.
00:55:14 And they had their allies with them in the war game.
00:55:17 So we’re confident this is it.
00:55:21 This is the king of the north,
00:55:23 and that’s what’s involved at this time
00:55:26 with the pushing— locking horns with each other.
00:55:29 So is there going to be another time
00:55:32 related to Bible prophecy where the faithful slave
00:55:35 will be able to say to you, “This is it”?
00:55:39 Well, one that we’re all very familiar with
00:55:42 —and especially this audience here in Newburgh,
00:55:46 you’ve been in the truth for decades—
00:55:48 notice the very familiar thoughts
00:55:52 from 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,
00:55:56 and we’re going to read verse 2
00:55:59 and verse 3,
00:56:03 5:2, 3: “For you yourselves know very well
00:56:06 “that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly
00:56:09 “as a thief in the night.
00:56:12 “Whenever it is that they are saying,
00:56:15 “‘Peace and security!’
00:56:18 “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,
00:56:21 “just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,
00:56:24 and they will by no means escape.”
00:56:29 Now, so that we have clear thinking
00:56:32 on the published comments regarding
00:56:36 these two verses that we read, we’ll take you back
00:56:38 to the September 15, 2012, Watchtower:
00:56:43 “As used here, ‘Jehovah’s day’
00:56:46 “refers to the period that will start with the destruction
00:56:50 “of false religion and will culminate
00:56:52 “in the war of Armageddon.
00:56:55 “However, just before that day of Jehovah begins,
00:56:59 “world leaders will be saying, ‘Peace and security!’
00:57:03 “This may refer to one event
00:57:06 “or to a series of events.
00:57:09 “Nations may think they are close
00:57:11 to solving some of their big problems.”
00:57:15 So here’s the question, and it’s understood
00:57:19 that it would be asked,
00:57:21 Will the faithful slave be able to at a certain time
00:57:24 say to the brotherhood: “This is it!
00:57:29 “This is what we’ve been waiting for.
00:57:31 This is the ‘peace and security’ prophecy”?
00:57:36 Well, keep this comment in mind
00:57:39 from The Watchtower, 2004, February 1, page 21:
00:57:45 “Since Bible prophecies are often fully understood
00:57:49 “only after they are fulfilled
00:57:51 or are in the process of fulfillment . . .”
00:57:55 Isn’t that interesting?
00:57:58 So keep that in mind.
00:57:59 We’ll come back to it, and that happens
00:58:02 to be the case when the prophecy is fulfilled.
00:58:04 “Oh, OK.”
00:58:06 But, see, we’ll come back
00:58:08 to that statement from The Watchtower shortly.
00:58:10 But just consider (especially those of you here,
00:58:14 many of you are aged,
00:58:16 and you’ll remember,
00:58:20 many of you who were in the truth at the time),
00:58:22 What about the year 1986?
00:58:25 The United Nations
00:58:27 was proclaiming prior
00:58:30 to January of 1986 that,
00:58:34 you know, ‘Get ready.’
00:58:36 They wanted the governments to put their arms down
00:58:39 for at least a year, the International Year of Peace.
00:58:43 Whoa!
00:58:45 And if you were in the truth back then, you were like, “OK.”
00:58:49 So they were all big.
00:58:51 In fact, the pope at that time
00:58:53 gathered all these religious leaders
00:58:56 over there to Assisi, Italy,
00:58:58 and they were all over there praying to who they pray to
00:59:02 and having this fervor
00:59:05 for peace for the earth.
00:59:07 Well, how did the faithful slave handle all that?
00:59:12 So this honors Jehovah’s faithful slave serving at that time.
00:59:17 Here’s what was published in the ’85 Watchtower,
00:59:20 October 1, page 18.
00:59:22 Now, this is some months before that all started in 1986.
00:59:27 Here’s what was stated:
00:59:29 “Christians cannot say in advance exactly
00:59:32 “when the great tribulation will strike. (Period.)
00:59:37 “Jehovah has not revealed ‘that day or the hour.’
00:59:41 “Thus when, for example, the United Nations
00:59:43 “declares the year 1986
00:59:46 “an ‘International Year of Peace,’
00:59:49 “Christians watch the event with interest.
00:59:51 “But they cannot say in advance
00:59:54 whether this will prove to be the fulfillment of Paul’s words.”
00:59:58 Nonetheless, we kept on the watch,
01:00:00 but God’s spirit was guiding his people,
01:00:03 particularly the faithful slave.
01:00:05 They were not only faithful, they were discreet.
01:00:08 And they did not say: “This is it!
01:00:11 “This is the fulfillment
01:00:13 of 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.” No.
01:00:16 But if you are still there,
01:00:18 go back to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5
01:00:22 —just something to keep in mind here—
01:00:25 sometimes we’ll read verses 2 and 3 and leave out verse 4.
01:00:31 He writes: “But you, brothers,
01:00:33 “you are not in darkness,
01:00:37 so that the day should overtake you as it would thieves.”
01:00:40 So thieves are doing their thievery
01:00:43 when it’s dark, but we’re sons of light.
01:00:46 So that’s not going to catch us,
01:00:49 the faithful ones worshipping the true God,
01:00:52 obedient to this earthly part of his organization.
01:00:56 So the question comes up—
01:00:58 If you go back to that quote
01:01:01 from the 2004 Watchtower,
01:01:05 ‘Prophecies are only fully understood only after they are fulfilled,’
01:01:08 but we also said, ‘or are in the process
01:01:12 of fulfillment.’
01:01:14 So will
01:01:18 the faithful slave be able to say
01:01:20 in the process of the fulfillment
01:01:23 of this prophecy from 1 Thessalonians: “This is it!
01:01:29 That’s what we’ve been waiting for”?
01:01:32 We’ll have to wait and see.
01:01:37 But there’s a word of caution here
01:01:39 we want to pass on to you because we’re all human.
01:01:43 We must keep on the watch, but please, just don’t be gullible.
01:01:48 You hear a world leader say something about peace.
01:01:51 And then you start e-mailing or something else
01:01:54 with a social network.
01:01:56 “This is it!”
01:02:01 Leave the channel to handle such matters.
01:02:05 If the faithful slave is moved by God’s spirit
01:02:08 to say that to the brotherhood,
01:02:11 and that’s His will, fine.
01:02:12 But please don’t be gullible.
01:02:15 Stick with the way Jehovah wants this to operate,
01:02:19 and he’ll bless your obedience.
01:02:21 Now, you’ll remember Jehovah’s day begins
01:02:25 as they’re saying, “Peace and security!”
01:02:28 Turn to Revelation chapter 17.
01:02:31 My, what stirring words!
01:02:34 They are familiar, but it does nourish our figurative hearts
01:02:38 when we read these,
01:02:42 chapter 17,
01:02:44 verses 15, 16, and 17:
01:02:49 “He said to me: ‘The waters that you saw, where the prostitute
01:02:52 “‘(the world empire of false religion) is sitting,
01:02:55 “‘mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.
01:02:58 “‘And the ten horns that you saw and the wild beast,
01:03:01 “‘these will hate the prostitute
01:03:03 “‘and will make her devastated and naked,
01:03:06 “‘and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire.
01:03:10 “‘For God put it into their hearts to carry out his thought,
01:03:14 “‘yes, to carry out their one thought
01:03:16 “‘by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,
01:03:18 until the words of God will have been accomplished.’”
01:03:22 Now, this is what’s going to happen.
01:03:25 And when you think about it, this is just mind-boggling.
01:03:29 They have no plans as such
01:03:31 —the governments— at this point.
01:03:35 So Jehovah forces
01:03:38 one part of Satan’s system
01:03:41 to destroy another part.
01:03:44 Only the Almighty God can do that.
01:03:47 So when they do destroy Babylon the Great
01:03:52 and all of this is taking place on the earth,
01:03:55 you brothers are not going to need a breaking news update.
01:04:01 Around the globe you’re going to say:
01:04:03 “This is it!
01:04:05 The great tribulation has started.”
01:04:09 And, frankly,
01:04:11 for those who worry sometimes,
01:04:14 during the great tribulation as these events unfold,
01:04:18 you’re not going to be terrified. No.
01:04:22 You’re going to stand up straight,
01:04:25 lift your heads up, and say:
01:04:29 “This is it!
01:04:31 Our deliverance is here.”
01:05:01 Thank you very much, Brother Morris,
01:05:05 for heightening our eagerness
01:05:08 for what lies ahead in the near future.
01:05:11 And thank you for removing the veil
01:05:14 from “the king of the north.”

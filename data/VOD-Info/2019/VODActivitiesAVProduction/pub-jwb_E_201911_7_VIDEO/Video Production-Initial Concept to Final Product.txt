00:00:06 Animated videos,
00:00:08 like those in the series Become Jehovah’s Friend,
00:00:12 have been helping young ones draw closer to their heavenly Father
00:00:14 for several years now.
00:00:17 Look, Mom, I’m rejoicing in the hope!
00:00:20 Wee!
00:00:25 But did you know
00:00:27 that what you see on the screen
00:00:29 might last just a few short minutes
00:00:34 but it may involve weeks of work
00:00:37 by a virtual army of volunteers?
00:00:42 With so much time and expense involved in making an animated video,
00:00:47 a lot of careful planning is required to avoid waste
00:00:50 and to keep the process running smoothly.
00:00:53 Let’s take a look at how the effective use
00:00:56 of preproduction tools help all of these brothers and sisters
00:01:00 work together to take a video
00:01:02 from initial concept to final production.
00:01:05 Under the direction of the Teaching Committee of the Governing Body,
00:01:10 the work begins long before the artists even get started.
00:01:13 They provide direction on the theme that needs to be taught.
00:01:18 Members of the animation team collaborate
00:01:21 to develop the featured characters as well as plot structure,
00:01:25 and they work closely with writers and storyboard artists
00:01:29 to develop the approved idea into a story line.
00:01:35 Once a complete script is ready,
00:01:36 the whole team gathers together for a table read.
00:01:40 This is the first time the team hears the whole script being read aloud.
00:01:45 Dialogue is meant to be heard.
00:01:47 So when we read it aloud at the table read,
00:01:49 we pick up on things
00:01:50 we didn’t see in the written script.
00:01:52 We’re able to tighten the story
00:01:54 and make it as clear as possible.
00:01:55 The script is reviewed by the research team for accuracy.
00:02:00 Then it’s revised, polished, and submitted
00:02:03 to the Teaching Committee for approval.
00:02:05 With an approved script in hand,
00:02:08 the director then works with an artist
00:02:10 to start turning words into pictures
00:02:15 —visualizing each scene on a storyboard.
00:02:18 First come the rough boards,
00:02:20 showing what will be included in each shot.
00:02:23 When it comes to the animation world, really,
00:02:26 everything you see on screen
00:02:27 has to be designed and created
00:02:30 —the characters, the furniture, the props,
00:02:33 the environment are all created by a designer.
00:02:37 The storyboard really helps us
00:02:39 figure out exactly what we need to create
00:02:41 so that we’re not creating too much or too little.
00:02:46 Once approved by the director,
00:02:48 the storyboard artist cleans up each of the boards.
00:02:53 Preliminary recordings of dialogue, music,
00:02:56 and sound effects are added.
00:03:01 These are then used by the director
00:03:03 and compositor to create an animatic.
00:03:08 An animatic is a rough draft of the entire video.
00:03:13 The animatic is very important for us.
00:03:15 That way the director
00:03:17 and, more importantly, the Teaching Committee
00:03:19 can see the entire video before we are actually making it.
00:03:22 And with that they can review it and give us the proper direction.
00:03:27 The finished animatic is submitted
00:03:29 to the Teaching Committee for review.
00:03:31 Based on direction from the committee,
00:03:34 the team makes sure that the teaching points come across clearly
00:03:38 and that the finished product is true to the spirit
00:03:41 and intent of the approved concept for the video.
00:03:46 Finally, using the approved animatic as a blueprint,
00:03:50 full production begins.
00:03:56 Really, everything in animation can be very time-consuming.
00:04:02 An animator working full-time here at Bethel
00:04:05 may be able to produce four to six seconds of animation in one week,
00:04:09 and that doesn’t even include other aspects
00:04:12 that are very important, such as modeling,
00:04:14 rigging, lighting, compositing, and many others.
00:04:18 From the examples shown here,
00:04:21 you can see just how closely the final version
00:04:25 of the video Make Jehovah Happy follows the animatic.
00:04:31 Preproduction tools such as storyboards and animatics
00:04:35 do more than save the organization time and money.
00:04:39 They enable the Teaching Committee
00:04:42 to carefully evaluate every project along the way
00:04:46 from the initial approved concept
00:04:48 to the final product
00:04:50 in order to keep providing videos
00:04:52 that help all of us honor our Friend, Jehovah.

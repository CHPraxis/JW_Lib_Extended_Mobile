00:00:04 Some of the electronic information
00:00:06 that had been translated and provided
00:00:09 for the brothers in sub-Saharan Africa
00:00:10 was essentially unavailable to them.
00:00:14 There are many areas in Mozambique
00:00:16 that do not have Internet access,
00:00:18 and in some parts
00:00:19 there is no cell phone coverage.
00:00:21 So we started investigating
00:00:23 what it would take to have a 24-hour-a-day,
00:00:26 7-day-a-week satellite channel
00:00:28 dedicated to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:32 When the announcement was made to our congregation
00:00:34 about the JW satellite channel,
00:00:36 our brothers and sisters were very happy about the announcement.
00:00:41 Our organization has a lot of experience
00:00:43 distributing video via the Internet,
00:00:45 but to distribute it on the satellite was entirely new,
00:00:48 so we had to do a lot of research.
00:00:50 We don’t have our own satellite up in space.
00:00:52 We rent a channel on a satellite that covers sub-Saharan Africa.
00:00:58 What is required from the brothers is
00:01:00 to have a satellite dish and a decoder.
00:01:03 This will allow them to view the channel with no additional cost.
00:01:14 The brothers that are invited
00:01:16 to come here are trained.
00:01:17 First, how to set up the dish.
00:01:20 Second, how to set up the decoder
00:01:23 and learn how to adjust the dish properly
00:01:26 so that it works well.
00:01:28 Then, we teach them how to record the programs
00:01:30 with the goal that they can watch it with the brothers and sisters in the congregation.
00:01:37 Our satellite channel is set up to transmit
00:01:39 one video track and 16 audio tracks.
00:01:42 This gives us the ability to broadcast our videos
00:01:45 in 16 languages.
00:01:47 We consulted with the Translation Services Department,
00:01:50 and so these are the 16 languages
00:01:52 that give us the greatest audience of our brothers in Africa.
00:01:57 We wrote new software that takes any new video that comes to JW Broadcasting®
00:02:01 and mixes the 16 languages of video together into a single video file
00:02:05 and delivers that to our satellite provider.
00:02:07 The Governing Body
00:02:09 lovingly approved for the rental cost of the satellite channel
00:02:13 to be covered from contributions to the worldwide work.
00:02:16 So there’s no expense to the brothers
00:02:19 in Africa to receive the program.
00:02:21 We broadcast over
00:02:23 a single satellite channel for most of our needs.
00:02:26 But occasionally, we use a second channel
00:02:29 when we broadcast live events, like conventions
00:02:32 or branch visits.
00:02:35 When the representative from world headquarters gives his talk
00:02:37 from Bethel, it is transmitted to us
00:02:39 live through the satellite.
00:02:41 This makes us feel like we
00:02:42 are right there at Bethel.
00:02:44 We are very happy.
00:02:46 The most recent live event
00:02:47 that we broadcasted originated in France.
00:02:50 It was the release of the revised edition of the New World Translation,
00:02:54 so this was very exciting.
00:02:56 And brothers and sisters  that attended conventions
00:02:59 in ten different branch territories in Africa
00:03:02 were able to tie in to this broadcast that originated in France,
00:03:05 using the satellite.
00:03:08 In our branch territory,
00:03:10 we are arranging for all new or remodeled Kingdom Halls
00:03:13 to have satellite equipment as part of the standard audio/video package.
00:03:20 We were very happy
00:03:21 when we received the satellite dish
00:03:23 because we could see that now
00:03:25 we are really close  to the brothers on the Governing Body.
00:03:29 The satellite channel is excellent!
00:03:31 This provision touches our hearts.
00:03:34 The deaf all over the country benefited from the special talk
00:03:38 as it was interpreted into Malawian Sign Language,
00:03:40 showing that Jehovah truly loves deaf people.
00:03:43 And this helps us to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.
00:03:58 We hope and pray that access to the JW satellite feed
00:04:02 becomes available to as many of our brothers and sisters
00:04:06 as possible in sub-Saharan Africa.

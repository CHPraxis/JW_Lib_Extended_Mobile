00:00:01 Yes, true friends who share our love for Jehovah are invaluable.
00:00:07 We’ll see that in this story from Japan.
00:00:10 Sisters Takako Sato and Hisako Wakui
00:00:14 have worked together as pioneers since 1957.
00:00:18 Let’s learn how their friendship
00:00:21 has helped them serve Jehovah with joy.
00:00:24 We are pioneer partners.
00:00:28 We’ve been working together
00:00:30 for over 60 years.
00:00:33 In 1956,
00:00:35 I was the only Jehovah’s Witness in Nagano prefecture.
00:00:40 It was lonesome,
00:00:42 but I applied for regular pioneer service.
00:00:45 Surprisingly,
00:00:47 I was appointed as a special pioneer.
00:00:51 I was so happy that I found myself
00:00:55 rolling around on the tatami-mat floor
00:00:58 with the appointment letter in my hand.
00:01:01 That was the way I expressed my joy and appreciation.
00:01:05 When I was invited to serve
00:01:07 as a special pioneer, I was sent to Nagano,
00:01:10 and that’s where I met Hisako.
00:01:13 Takako and I focused on our ministry.
00:01:18 When an isolated group was established,
00:01:21 since there were no brothers,
00:01:24 I would wear a head covering and conduct the meetings.
00:01:28 Sometimes the outlines were in English.
00:01:31 We didn’t understand anything.
00:01:35 But people were delighted to hear
00:01:37 even just the scriptures and went home satisfied,
00:01:41 and that strongly impressed on me the power of God’s Word.
00:01:49 We were assigned to a territory in the city after that.
00:01:53 We found so many not-at-homes,
00:01:57 but we were determined to meet people.
00:02:01 So we changed the times we preached,
00:02:03 and we talked to people on the street
00:02:05 who were going to work.
00:02:07 We cherished even small opportunities.
00:02:10 When we had a chance to meet a householder,
00:02:14 we always tried to have a conversation
00:02:17 that we could link to the next visit.
00:02:19 Before long, I had ten Bible studies.
00:02:25 Takako acts like she’s cheerful,
00:02:28 but she’s been fighting various illnesses.
00:02:33 At times, it was so bad
00:02:37 that I could not even go out in service.
00:02:40 I had a serious skin condition.
00:02:44 I could not bear
00:02:46 to look at the illustration of Job in the magazine,
00:02:50 and I covered it up with paper.
00:02:57 But Jehovah helped me to look to Job’s example.
00:03:01 I learned
00:03:02 that our endurance under trial
00:03:05 would become praise to God.
00:03:09 I have often had health problems.
00:03:14 Just at one of those times,
00:03:16 I received a letter from the branch.
00:03:19 It said:
00:03:21 “What you can accomplish now may be limited.
00:03:26 “However, think about all that you have done up to now
00:03:30 “to give praise to Jehovah
00:03:32 “and about the people you were able to help learn the truth,
00:03:37 and be joyful knowing that you have been used by Jehovah fully.”
00:03:44 I couldn’t stop crying
00:03:46 because I really felt the care and concern
00:03:50 from the organization and from Jehovah.
00:03:56 Hisako also took really good care of me
00:03:59 and prayed with me.
00:04:03 Our thinking and personalities are different,
00:04:06 but we made efforts to talk things out.
00:04:10 Our heartfelt desire to want to serve Jehovah full-time
00:04:15 has always been the same.
00:04:20 For 60 years, we’ve enjoyed
00:04:23 a truly wonderful life of service to Jehovah.
00:04:26 Jehovah has supported us in difficult times
00:04:30 through the Bible, the organization, and friends.
00:04:34 I have tasted the truthfulness of the words:
00:04:38 “When I am weak, then I am powerful.”
00:04:44 ‘When I said: “My foot is slipping,”
00:04:48 your kindness, O Jehovah, has supported me.’
00:04:52 I can say that too.
00:04:56 Although we don’t have energy or ability,
00:04:59 we’ve been able to enjoy full-time service together up until now.
00:05:05 I’m really content now.
00:05:07 It’s all thanks to Jehovah.
00:05:13 Like the apostle Paul, our sisters cultivated singleness
00:05:17 and focused on full-time service to Jehovah
00:05:21 for more than 60 years.
00:05:23 Yes, they face everyday challenges
00:05:26 and the extra ones that come with age,
00:05:29 but their heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah whole-souled
00:05:33 brings Takako and Hisako real joy and contentment.

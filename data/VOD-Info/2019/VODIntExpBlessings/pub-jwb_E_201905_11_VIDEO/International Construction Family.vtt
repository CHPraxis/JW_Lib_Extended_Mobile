00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Theocratic projects are largely built
by volunteers from all over the world,

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speaking different languages,
from different cultural backgrounds,

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with different work practices

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things that could divide and create barriers.

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the biggest challenges
for me has been the language

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—above all, the accents
and the way people speak.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ways of construction
are a bit different than what I’m used to.

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That can create a challenge.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be used to doing something one way.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then here we do it differently
because of different circumstances.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, we thought that with a similar language,

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things would be the same.

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even with a similar language,
we learned that there are differences

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in how we speak and the things that we say.

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you OK?

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:56.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that I think probably
got us when we first arrived was the greeting.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re used to just saying “hello,”

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a lot of times we would be greeted with . . .

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right?

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, are you OK?

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being asked that
several times in the same day,

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you begin to question
whether or not you actually are all right.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just how they say “hello” here.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, OK.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:13.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the culture where I’m from,
people are a bit more straightforward

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the point when they’re giving instructions,

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:16.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is not being rude.

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just the way we do it there.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here I learned that it’s nice to ask:

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How are you?
How’s your day?

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:23.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was your weekend?”

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then get to the point.

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something I got used to,
and I really like it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you get to know
the brothers that you work with.

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are different ways
of saying the same thing.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lauren, can I have the spanner, please?

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure!

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the differences
aren’t really all that big.

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since you don’t know it,
it becomes a challenge to understand at first.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it makes it a little more exciting

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a little fun!

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s that one.

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:45.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one?

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank you.
A wrench.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:50.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be a way of doing things at home

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m used to
or that I’ve been learning in school.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then here we do it differently.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just a matter of obedience,

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:58.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you do as you are instructed.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, you might question,

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:01.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are we doing it differently?”

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’re patient and you wait,

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you realize that you’ve just learned
another way of doing something.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, give me some guanti, please.

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:12.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that is really nice to see
is that when I try to learn the language,

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers help me
—and that’s a real blessing!

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taking our time to learn

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the culture has really helped us
to understand why things are different.

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, when you understand
why they’re different,

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:29.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t really bother you.

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:30.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You understand your brothers and sisters,

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it makes it easier
for you to love them and to be positive.

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:36.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We realized that we are the ones

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that have to adapt to the new culture

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the new nation.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to have Christ’s mentality.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came to serve, not to be served.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spiritual things keep us united

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:53.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to not see the negatives in other cultures,
accents, and work practices.

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there may be
deadlines and constraints,

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:01.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keeping our spirituality up
is of the utmost importance.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our overseers reminded us
of three nonnegotiable things:

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our meeting attendance,
the field ministry, and our family worship.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.172 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Spirituality is everything

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:15.257 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to overcoming challenges

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:18.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if you don’t have
a spiritual view of things, then you will struggle.

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What continues to be more evident
is that if we take care of our spirituality,

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:23.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah will take care of the rest.

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work will get done.

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The key to unity here on site is that everyone
is working on “the fruitage of the spirit.”

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:35.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient,
kind, loving, long-suffering.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They exhibit these qualities
that really pursue peace,

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:41.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it makes it easy; it makes it fun.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you realize: ‘You know what?
We are just working with family.’

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:44.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And of course, Jehovah’s spirit is clearly shown

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:47.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in everything that we do.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having all the different brothers and sisters
and the different cultures is special,

00:03:53.253 --> 00:03:55.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really does help you grow.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:58.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where I worked before,
differences were an issue.

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s beautiful to see, however,

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:06.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that here it doesn’t matter
where you are from or what job you are doing.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are all on the same level; we are all equal.

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes you think of Revelation 7:9

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:15.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the scripture talks about people
of every tribe and nation and tongue

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and we’re one family.

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of just reading about it,
when we’re here we experience it.

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:26.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Nimrod was building the tower of Babel,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used language to halt the project.

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, today, working on a project

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:36.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with so many different languages and cultures,

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:41.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is unifying them
to make his project successful!

00:00:03 Theocratic projects are largely built by volunteers from all over the world,
00:00:08 speaking different languages, from different cultural backgrounds,
00:00:12 with different work practices
00:00:14 —things that could divide and create barriers.
00:00:20 One of the biggest challenges for me has been the language
00:00:24 —above all, the accents and the way people speak.
00:00:29 The ways of construction are a bit different than what I’m used to.
00:00:31 That can create a challenge.
00:00:33 You might be used to doing something one way.
00:00:35 But then here we do it differently because of different circumstances.
00:00:40 Initially, we thought that with a similar language,
00:00:43 things would be the same.
00:00:45 But even with a similar language, we learned that there are differences
00:00:49 in how we speak and the things that we say.
00:00:51 Are you OK?
00:00:53 One of the things that I think probably got us when we first arrived was the greeting.
00:00:56 We’re used to just saying “hello,”
00:00:58 but a lot of times we would be greeted with . . .
00:01:00 All right?
00:01:01 Hey, are you OK?
00:01:02 After being asked that several times in the same day,
00:01:04 you begin to question whether or not you actually are all right.
00:01:06 That’s just how they say “hello” here.
00:01:08 Oh, OK.
00:01:09 In the culture where I’m from, people are a bit more straightforward
00:01:13 and to the point when they’re giving instructions,
00:01:15 which is not being rude.
00:01:16 It’s just the way we do it there.
00:01:18 Here I learned that it’s nice to ask:
00:01:21 “How are you? How’s your day?
00:01:22 How was your weekend?”
00:01:23 —and then get to the point.
00:01:25 It’s something I got used to, and I really like it
00:01:28 because you get to know the brothers that you work with.
00:01:31 There are different ways of saying the same thing.
00:01:33 Lauren, can I have the spanner, please?
00:01:35 Sure!
00:01:35 And the differences aren’t really all that big.
00:01:37 Since you don’t know it, it becomes a challenge to understand at first.
00:01:40 But it makes it a little more exciting
00:01:42 —a little fun!
00:01:44 Oh, it’s that one.
00:01:45 This one?
00:01:45 Oh, thank you. A wrench.
00:01:49 It might be a way of doing things at home
00:01:50 that I’m used to or that I’ve been learning in school.
00:01:53 But then here we do it differently.
00:01:55 It’s just a matter of obedience,
00:01:56 and you do as you are instructed.
00:01:58 At first, you might question,
00:02:00 “Why are we doing it differently?”
00:02:01 But if you’re patient and you wait,
00:02:03 then you realize that you’ve just learned another way of doing something.
00:02:06 Hey, give me some guanti, please.
00:02:08 Something that is really nice to see is that when I try to learn the language,
00:02:12 the brothers help me —and that’s a real blessing!
00:02:20 Taking our time to learn
00:02:22 about the culture has really helped us to understand why things are different.
00:02:25 And then, when you understand why they’re different,
00:02:27 it doesn’t really bother you.
00:02:29 You understand your brothers and sisters,
00:02:30 and it makes it easier for you to love them and to be positive.
00:02:34 We realized that we are the ones
00:02:36 that have to adapt to the new culture
00:02:38 —the new nation.
00:02:39 We have to have Christ’s mentality.
00:02:41 He came to serve, not to be served.
00:02:45 Spiritual things keep us united
00:02:49 —to not see the negatives in other cultures, accents, and work practices.
00:02:55 Although there may be deadlines and constraints,
00:02:58 keeping our spirituality up is of the utmost importance.
00:03:01 Our overseers reminded us of three nonnegotiable things:
00:03:06 our meeting attendance, the field ministry, and our family worship.
00:03:11 Spirituality is everything
00:03:13 when it comes to overcoming challenges
00:03:15 because if you don’t have a spiritual view of things, then you will struggle.
00:03:18 What continues to be more evident is that if we take care of our spirituality,
00:03:21 then Jehovah will take care of the rest.
00:03:23 The work will get done.
00:03:25 The key to unity here on site is that everyone is working on “the fruitage of the spirit.”
00:03:30 We need to be patient, kind, loving, long-suffering.
00:03:35 They exhibit these qualities that really pursue peace,
00:03:39 and it makes it easy; it makes it fun.
00:03:41 And you realize: ‘You know what? We are just working with family.’
00:03:43 And of course, Jehovah’s spirit is clearly shown
00:03:44 in everything that we do.
00:03:47 Having all the different brothers and sisters and the different cultures is special,
00:03:53 and it really does help you grow.
00:03:55 Where I worked before, differences were an issue.
00:03:58 It’s beautiful to see, however,
00:04:01 that here it doesn’t matter where you are from or what job you are doing.
00:04:06 We are all on the same level; we are all equal.
00:04:09 It makes you think of Revelation 7:9
00:04:12 where the scripture talks about people of every tribe and nation and tongue
00:04:15 —and we’re one family.
00:04:17 And instead of just reading about it, when we’re here we experience it.
00:04:24 When Nimrod was building the tower of Babel,
00:04:26 Jehovah used language to halt the project.
00:04:30 Yet, today, working on a project
00:04:33 with so many different languages and cultures,
00:04:36 Jehovah is unifying them to make his project successful!

First Corinthians 13:4, 7 tell us:

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Love is patient and kind”
and “bears all things,

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:14.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.”

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dramatization helped us
to see how love can adapt

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to changing needs and circumstances.

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:24.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But wouldn’t it be nice
to talk with some real-life examples

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who have developed such skills?

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have a special treat.

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A longtime faithful couple
has joined us in the studio

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—William and Angela Samuelson,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve at Patterson Bethel
in the United States.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:44.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course,
we’ve known each other for decades,

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:47.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know you as Bill and Angie,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that’s the way I’ll refer to you.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So nice that you
could be here and be interviewed.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s helped you both
maintain a happy marriage?

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:00.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we work as a team,
so we always check

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with each other
before making decisions,

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:06.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in areas
where we wouldn’t necessarily have to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it would be OK to go ahead.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just out of respect,

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:13.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we talk with each other
about any decisions that we make.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, Brother Morris,
we’ve been married 60 years now,

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve never really had
a real serious argument.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had some disagreements
but nothing ever serious.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever we have
those kind of words, why, we never use

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demeaning language or say
derogatory things about each other,

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that makes me very happy.

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:39.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s commendable.

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:43.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early in our marriage,
there was one occasion

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Angie was upset
with me about something

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:47.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it could’ve been anything—

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the conversation,
it obviously showed in her tone of voice.

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I explained to her
that she could say anything she wanted

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as she smiled
when she said it.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, she tried,
and we both had a good laugh.

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very hard
to stay mad when you’re smiling.

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:08.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smiling—very, very good advice.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:09.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about in the congregation?

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have you been able
to show each other honor there?

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we have assignments

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:20.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the platform,
either of us, we work together.

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angie is much better

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with grammar
and pronunciation than I am,

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I’ll check
with her to make sure

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:32.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m saying things
as correctly as possible.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she checks with me

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on prophetic significance, for example,

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or theocratic understanding
or procedure and timing.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and something
that’s very important

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when we do check
with each other, we’re not thin-skinned

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the advice
that we want to give each other.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll call it advice.

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that makes life a lot easier.

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:00.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t get angry
because we’ve been told

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to improve on something.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s excellent.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You also spent a long time

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the traveling work
before coming to Bethel.

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:12.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew you in the traveling work
—early ’70’s and then later

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were down South
and you were assigned down there.

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you learn
about showing honor

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that avenue of service?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you say,
we were in the traveling work

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:25.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 33 years, just over.

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:29.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for most of those years,
we would have other assignments.

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would be working with the district

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—now regional—
convention organization

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other assignments,

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it meant
that Angie would be alone

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation.

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never complained;

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor did she become unduly inquisitive
about my assignment,

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:50.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which sometimes would’ve been confidential.

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we had
an unexpected move that came up,

00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:56.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a change of assignment somewhere,

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angie would just pack
and be ready to go.

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:03.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.
That was my job—packing.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the field ministry, Brother Morris,

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would usually be
in separate car groups

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:11.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Bill would work with the brothers
and I would work with the sisters.

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:13.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really appreciated the fact

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he always made sure
I had a safe driver.

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:19.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It worked out most of the time.

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:23.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we had a territory
that was a little scary,

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, he made sure
that we were safe in the territory.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I appreciated that very much.

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation,

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you know, things
don’t always go the way we plan)

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brother scheduling the meals

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:40.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had scheduled two families

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the same noon meal for us.

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The one sister was deaf;

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she had always had
the traveling brother on a certain day;

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she didn’t hear
when she was told it wouldn’t be that day.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she had gone ahead
and prepared a meal.

00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
we had been assigned to another home,

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they served us a full course

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—or courses—
of an Italian meal.

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were eating, we found out

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the other sister was waiting for us.

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would’ve been highly offended
if somebody didn’t come.

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went to the Kingdom Hall

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and handled the meeting
for field service after the meal,

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Angie went to the sister.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sister would probably
still be mad at me if Angie hadn’t gone.

00:05:21.838 --> 00:05:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, was I sleepy
that afternoon after two big meals.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:29.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bet.
Well, you handled that very Christlike.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we mentioned,
your current assignment is here at Bethel.

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:36.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have you navigated
the unique challenges

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this form of service
while still honoring one another?

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you know,
we work in different departments,

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we respect that some things

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:50.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are confidential to that department.

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:53.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t make
the work of our department

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a major part of our conversation.

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could have an energy problem

00:05:58.574 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the day after working all day,

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:04.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so Bill is very considerate
about accepting too many social invitations.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:05.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:08.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we respect
each other’s limitations

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to physical

00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:13.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just energy in general.

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s certainly honoring each other.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Bill and Angie,

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those were practical
and encouraging comments.

00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really thank you so much

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:26.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking the time
and allowing us to interview you,

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we really appreciate
your good example all these decades.

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:31.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you.

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:32.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:06.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1943

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the eldest son of six siblings.

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father expected me
to become a judge or a prosecutor.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:23.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on October 24, 1959,
during my first year

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of high school.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I did personal study,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to the conclusion that rather than

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spending four years in higher education,

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be more beneficial
for me to pioneer,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while delving deeper
into the Bible through personal study.

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So instead of going to college,

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began regular pioneering in February 1962.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 11 months later, in January 1963,

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to serve as a special pioneer.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced
that I had chosen the best path.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why when I hear
of the successful careers

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my old classmates have had,
I don’t feel jealous at all.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, I think of how nice it would be

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they too learned
the Bible truths like I did.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to the traveling work in 1971.

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of adjustments
in our organization

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of my conscientious objection
to military service,

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to stop serving

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a traveling overseer 
on two separate occasions.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I received a new assignment

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a field instructor,

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoyed that work.

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we were reassigned once again
as special pioneers in September 2014.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a bit disappointed at first,

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I really enjoyed teaching
and I felt I could have continued

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a field instructor for another ten years.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hoping to bring glory to Jehovah,

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:52.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed earnestly to be able
to use the experience I had gained

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:57.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the years to bring glory
to God and to find interested ones.

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unexpectedly, I was blessed
with ten great Bible studies,

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that renewed my love of teaching.

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives each individual work
that is perfectly suited to them.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel that serving as special pioneers,

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we currently do, is a rewarding assignment
that brings us happiness.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back at all that has happened

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and counting all the years
we’ve been in special full-time service,

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realized that together
we have been serving

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than a hundred years.

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing I learned from this was

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if you adhere to theocratic direction,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many blessings are sure to follow.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as he promised,

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:47.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us
everything we ever needed and more.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:50.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us not just a hundredfold

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a hundred times a hundredfold

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—brothers and sisters
who are like family to us.

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:04.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got married on April 1, 1968.

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as of this year,
we have been married exactly 50 years.

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In June 2017,

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife was not feeling well
and we went for a health checkup.

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:17.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was diagnosed with stage IV bone cancer,

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:20.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it had spread all through her back.

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:24.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She felt very weak,
and we had a very difficult time.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave us
strength and wisdom to endure,

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now her condition is more stable.

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:33.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now our health
is not as good as it used to be,

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but thanks to the loving
infirm-special-pioneer arrangement,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are able
to keep serving Jehovah faithfully

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without it being a burden.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:43.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through economic troubles, health problems,

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the difficulties
that we encountered,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we always felt that Jehovah was with us.

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we really feel that Jehovah

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has securely wrapped us “in the bag of life”

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has watched over us throughout our lives,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he had promised

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:00.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1 Samuel 25:29.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These days, we pray to Jehovah
that we can serve him faithfully,

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
survive Armageddon together,

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy everlasting life in the new system

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:14.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an eternally-married couple.

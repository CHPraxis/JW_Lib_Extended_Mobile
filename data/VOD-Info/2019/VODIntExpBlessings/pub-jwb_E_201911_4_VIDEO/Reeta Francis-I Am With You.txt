00:00:05 My name is Reeta.
00:00:07 My son is Jackson, and my daughter is Sherina.
00:00:11 It’s just the three of us.
00:00:14 I have been working on a tea estate as a tea picker.
00:00:17 One day, I prayed to God very hard.
00:00:21 I said,
00:00:22 “Please help me to learn about the Bible.”
00:00:26 Within two days, Jehovah’s Witnesses came
00:00:29 and knocked on my door, and I agreed to study the Bible.
00:00:32 I couldn’t believe it.
00:00:34 I only prayed yesterday, asking God to help me to study the Bible.
00:00:39 Our meetings begin at 4:45 p.m.,
00:00:43 but we have to get ready by 12 o’clock
00:00:46 to attend the meetings.
00:00:47 So we prepare our bags on Wednesday night.
00:00:53 I carry two big bags on my shoulders
00:00:56 and walk for three and a half kilometers (2 mi) to get to the meetings on time.
00:01:02 We love seeing our brothers.
00:01:05 That’s why we always go to the meetings early.
00:01:13 I have been pioneering now for a year and six months.
00:01:22 There is no greater happiness than what comes from pioneering.
00:01:28 This is a onetime opportunity.
00:01:31 That is why we decided that we should give the best that we can to Jehovah.
00:01:39 Now I am so happy to be serving this way.
00:01:44 One time, I was not paid at all.
00:01:49 I didn’t even have a rupee.
00:01:56 On that day, my children and I ate well.
00:02:00 But after eating, we were very worried
00:02:04 about what we were going to do the following day.
00:02:07 So that night, I said a prayer with the kids
00:02:12 and we read the Bible.
00:02:17 Jesus said,
00:02:19 ‘Don’t worry about tomorrow.’
00:02:21 So I trusted that somehow
00:02:24 Jehovah would give us what we needed.
00:02:27 It was 10:30 at night.
00:02:30 I was fast asleep, and the phone rang.
00:02:34 Usually no one calls this late,
00:02:37 so I wondered, ‘Who could be calling me this late?’
00:02:43 I picked up the phone, and it was a brother on the line.
00:02:48 He said, “Sister, go to your bookshelf
00:02:52 and take the Greatest Man book.”
00:02:58 Then he asked me to turn to a page.
00:03:02 When I turned to that page,
00:03:03 there were 10,000 rupees (about $55, U.S.) between those pages.
00:03:07 We could not believe our eyes.
00:03:09 It was exactly what we needed for that month’s expenses.
00:03:13 A few days earlier, he and his wife had visited us
00:03:16 and secretly left the money in the book before leaving.
00:03:19 So I thanked Jehovah in prayer with the kids.
00:03:22 Jehovah already knew exactly what we needed
00:03:26 even before we realized it.
00:03:37 Honestly, every night I open the doors,
00:03:41 go outside, and look up at the night sky.
00:03:45 When I look up, I see many stars.
00:03:48 I daily meditate about his wisdom,
00:03:51 his power, what amazing things he is able to do.
00:03:58 This earth, this universe
00:04:01  —how amazingly well he cares for them!
00:04:05 He takes care of the smallest thing.
00:04:08 I completely rely on Jehovah,
00:04:13 and then I remember that Jehovah has the ability
00:04:18 to help us with his holy spirit.
00:04:21 He’s such a loving Father.
00:04:24 He’s always holding our hand tight,
00:04:29 and no one can separate us from him.
00:04:32 If anyone tries, they will fail.
00:04:39 He’s so generous with his love.
00:04:42 He’s so affectionate with us.
00:04:45 No one can take away the love Jehovah has for us.

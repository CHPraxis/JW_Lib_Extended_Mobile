My name is Reeta.

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son is Jackson,
and my daughter is Sherina.

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just the three of us.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been working
on a tea estate as a tea picker.

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I prayed to God very hard.

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said,

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please help me to learn about the Bible.”

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:29.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within two days,
Jehovah’s Witnesses came

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:32.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knocked on my door,
and I agreed to study the Bible.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe it.

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only prayed yesterday,
asking God to help me to study the Bible.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:43.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our meetings begin at 4:45 p.m.,

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to get ready by 12 o’clock

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the meetings.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we prepare our bags
on Wednesday night.

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I carry two big bags
on my shoulders

00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:00.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walk for three and a half kilometers (2 mi)
to get to the meetings on time.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love seeing our brothers.

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we always
go to the meetings early.

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been pioneering now
for a year and six months.

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no greater happiness
than what comes from pioneering.

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a onetime opportunity.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why we decided that we should
give the best that we can to Jehovah.

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am so happy to be serving this way.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I was not paid at all.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even have a rupee.

00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that day, my children and I ate well.

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after eating,
we were very worried

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what we were going
to do the following day.

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that night,
I said a prayer with the kids

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:14.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we read the Bible.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said,

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry about tomorrow.’

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:24.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I trusted that somehow

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would give us what we needed.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was 10:30 at night.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was fast asleep, and the phone rang.

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:37.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually no one calls this late,

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I wondered,
‘Who could be calling me this late?’

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:48.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I picked up the phone,
and it was a brother on the line.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “Sister,
go to your bookshelf

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take the Greatest Man book.”

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he asked me to turn to a page.

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I turned to that page,

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 10,000 rupees (about $55, U.S.)
between those pages.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could not believe our eyes.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was exactly what we needed
for that month’s expenses.

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few days earlier,
he and his wife had visited us

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and secretly left the money
in the book before leaving.

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thanked Jehovah in prayer with the kids.

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah already knew exactly what we needed

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before we realized it.

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, every night I open the doors,

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go outside, and look up at the night sky.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look up, I see many stars.

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I daily meditate about his wisdom,

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:55.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his power, what amazing things he is able to do.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This earth, this universe

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 —how amazingly well he cares for them!

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes care of the smallest thing.

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I completely rely on Jehovah,

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:18.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I remember
that Jehovah has the ability

00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:21.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us with his holy spirit.

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s such a loving Father.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always holding our hand tight,

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can separate us from him.

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:37.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone tries, they will fail.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s so generous with his love.

00:04:42.803 --> 00:04:45.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s so affectionate with us.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:50.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can take away
the love Jehovah has for us.

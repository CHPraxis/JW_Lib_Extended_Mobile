‎I’ve been involved 
‎in the international construction service

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for eight years in Congo, in Senegal,

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and now we’re here in the Philippines.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s such a wonderful, wonderful privilege

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Jehovah 
‎has given me through the years 

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to learn different skills

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that I never ever imagined
‎I would be able to do.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎A construction site 
‎is a very happy site.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Once you get there and you’re working
‎with your brothers and sisters,

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it’s just happiness and joy.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎To be able to see 
‎the love they have for Jehovah

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the love they have 
‎for their assignment,

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that has been a wonderful thing.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Everywhere you go, 
‎you can learn from a culture.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎There are strong points in each culture

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that you can learn 
‎and apply in your own life.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎There’ve been challenges 
‎and sacrifices we’ve made

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—for example,

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎leaving behind friends 
‎who had become very close.

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The congregation is our stronghold;
‎it stabilizes us. 

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Actually, without the congregation,

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we wouldn’t be able to do our assignment.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When we first came to the Philippines,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we were feeling kind of low

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and out of place.

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:10.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But then a family from our new hall

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎invited us over for a meal after service.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We ate some really good, tasty local dishes.

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:20.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They played music; we sang.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That just canceled 
‎the homesickness that we were feeling.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We support the local congregation

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by having a good service routine.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The construction work 
‎that we do is a physical work,

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so sometimes we can lose the focus.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But being out in service 
‎and being with your brothers and sisters

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎puts you back in focus.

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I really love being in international service
‎because I love people. 

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Working for hours 
‎with my brothers and sisters

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎just makes me very happy,
‎and at the end of the day,

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it’s always, always a very good day.

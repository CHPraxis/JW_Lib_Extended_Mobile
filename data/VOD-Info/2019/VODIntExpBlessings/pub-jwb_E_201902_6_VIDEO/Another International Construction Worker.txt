00:00:01 ‎I’ve been involved  ‎in the international construction service
00:00:04 ‎for eight years in Congo, in Senegal,
00:00:07 ‎and now we’re here in the Philippines.
00:00:09 ‎It’s such a wonderful, wonderful privilege
00:00:11 ‎that Jehovah  ‎has given me through the years
00:00:13 ‎to learn different skills
00:00:15 ‎that I never ever imagined ‎I would be able to do.
00:00:18 ‎A construction site  ‎is a very happy site.
00:00:21 ‎Once you get there and you’re working ‎with your brothers and sisters,
00:00:24 ‎it’s just happiness and joy.
00:00:27 ‎To be able to see  ‎the love they have for Jehovah
00:00:30 ‎and the love they have  ‎for their assignment,
00:00:33 ‎that has been a wonderful thing.
00:00:36 ‎Everywhere you go,  ‎you can learn from a culture.
00:00:39 ‎There are strong points in each culture
00:00:41 ‎that you can learn  ‎and apply in your own life.
00:00:44 ‎There’ve been challenges  ‎and sacrifices we’ve made
00:00:47 ‎—for example,
00:00:48 ‎leaving behind friends  ‎who had become very close.
00:00:53 ‎The congregation is our stronghold; ‎it stabilizes us.
00:00:56 ‎Actually, without the congregation,
00:00:59 ‎we wouldn’t be able to do our assignment.
00:01:02 ‎When we first came to the Philippines,
00:01:04 ‎we were feeling kind of low
00:01:06 ‎and out of place.
00:01:08 ‎But then a family from our new hall
00:01:10 ‎invited us over for a meal after service.
00:01:13 ‎We ate some really good, tasty local dishes.
00:01:17 ‎They played music; we sang.
00:01:20 ‎That just canceled  ‎the homesickness that we were feeling.
00:01:24 ‎We support the local congregation
00:01:27 ‎by having a good service routine.
00:01:29 ‎The construction work  ‎that we do is a physical work,
00:01:32 ‎so sometimes we can lose the focus.
00:01:36 ‎But being out in service  ‎and being with your brothers and sisters
00:01:39 ‎puts you back in focus.
00:01:42 ‎I really love being in international service ‎because I love people.
00:01:46 ‎Working for hours  ‎with my brothers and sisters
00:01:51 ‎just makes me very happy, ‎and at the end of the day,
00:01:53 ‎it’s always, always a very good day.

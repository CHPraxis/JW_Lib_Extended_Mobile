Since 1953, young brothers in Korea

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been imprisoned
for refusing military service.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 19,000 brothers

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:35.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have spent a total of 36,000 years in prison

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for refusing to compromise their faith.

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, on February 28, 2019,

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last of our imprisoned brothers
was released.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time in 66 years,

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in prison for refusing military service.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters around the world

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejoiced at this historic legal victory.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how was this possible?

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah’s powerful hand at work.

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He blessed
the young brothers and their families

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:11.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the faith and courage they showed.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His holy spirit strengthened them,

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he provided them
with support and encouragement

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through a globally united brotherhood.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s take a closer look

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the record of unwavering faith and courage

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the Korean brothers.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Korean War broke out in 1950,

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:39.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the issue of conscientious objection
to military service came to the fore.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Chong-il Park
was one of the first of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to refuse to compromise his faith.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1953, before the war was over,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received an enlistment notice.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the recruitment center,

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained that my sincere conscience

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would not allow me to join the military.

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:03.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took me
to a counterintelligence facility,

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:07.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I was interrogated and tortured.

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once they realized
the sincerity of my religious convictions,

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was transferred to the military police,

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where a military tribunal
gave me a three-year prison sentence.

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even after the armistice in 1953,

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Korean government
continued to punish conscientious objectors.

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1973,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the president’s special order
to achieve 100 percent enlistment,

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities raided Kingdom Halls

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the private homes of brothers
to forcefully enlist them.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the officials raided the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was giving a public talk on the podium.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the meeting, I said goodbye

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my family and fellow Witnesses

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and told them
that I would see them in Paradise.

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:55.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I was taken away to the military base.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers
who were forcefully taken with me

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were beaten mercilessly
and suffered all kinds of abuse.

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time passed,
the inhumane treatment

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers enlisted against their will
became even more severe.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Between 1975 and 1985,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five brothers died because of physical abuse.

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The government formally admitted
responsibility for this tragedy.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Choon-gil Lee
was one of the five brothers.

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Choon-gil Lee
was such a precious son to his mother.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:31.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a young age,
he had to be the head of his family.

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the records later found
by the Commission on Suspicious Deaths,

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lee had been hit in the stomach

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a rod until he lost consciousness.

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The officer thought he was pretending

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continued to beat him.

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:50.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After realizing how bad he was hurt,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the officer tried to revive Brother Lee
by splashing water on him,

00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:55.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he never woke up.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:04:00.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Chung, you also suffered
similar hardships back then.

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped you to endure?

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The yeartext that year was Psalm 91:2:

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:10.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah is my refuge and my stronghold.’

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:12.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It felt as if it had been chosen

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:15.692 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
especially for us Korean brothers.

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:17.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our families were suffering as well.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had no visitation rights
and were denied all contact with us,

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they didn’t know
whether we were dead or alive.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they could do
was calm their anxious hearts

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look to Jehovah
who reassured them with the promise,

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:36.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will be your refuge and your stronghold.’

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:39.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a great comfort to them.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
if we refused to enlist in the army,

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of us were imprisoned multiple times.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my case,

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:55.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was imprisoned in 1972 and again in 1975.

00:04:56.483 --> 00:05:00.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just the thought
of having to return to the same prison

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:02.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was emotionally devastating.

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While in prison the second time,

00:05:05.117 --> 00:05:08.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received a letter
from Brother Albert Schroeder,

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was a member
of the Governing Body at the time.

00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:15.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the letter with all the brothers
who were imprisoned with me.

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:18.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In it, he warmly encouraged us

00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:21.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling us that the Governing Body

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:24.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the brothers
around the world were praying for us.

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After reading this stirring letter,

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:31.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith in Jehovah grew stronger.

00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:35.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only were we reassured
that we were not alone

00:05:35.814 --> 00:05:40.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also gained greater strength
and courage to defend our faith.

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this time,

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was difficult
to get a fair hearing in court.

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:52.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1982,
we were tried in a military tribunal.

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The military policeman guarding us

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
threatened us
not to make a defense for ourselves.

00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:00.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the day of the trial,

00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:04.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the judicial officer
in charge of our defense said,

00:06:04.593 --> 00:06:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s cold, so please go easy on them.”

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:09.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was it.

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time,
the longest legal prison sentence

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:15.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was two years.

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, we received a three-year sentence

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:20.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without having a proper hearing

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even an explanation as to why it was long.

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:29.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the situation improve
for the brothers over time?

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was charged
with the maximum sentence of two years

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:35.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for insubordination at a military tribunal,

00:06:35.207 --> 00:06:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no way for me
to make a defense for myself.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, the situation hadn’t changed at all

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:44.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my oldest son
was tried in court years later.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was sentenced
in a military tribunal in the year 2000.

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:55.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I was told that if I tried
to make a defense during the trial,

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:57.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would face retaliation afterward.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, many brothers
were sentenced to three years in prison.

00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:05.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was even longer
than my father’s prison sentence.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there was a change.

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:11.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers had been tried
in military tribunals for decades,

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:15.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in 2001,
the cases were moved to civilian courts.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:19.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I refused to enlist in November 2001,
and so I was arrested.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to defend Jehovah’s name

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:24.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my stance
on Christian neutrality in court,

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:26.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I requested bail.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surprisingly, my request was granted.

00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:31.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the first time
anyone was released on bail

00:07:31.263 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the Military Service Act.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:35.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I walked out of the jail cell,

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:39.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that Jehovah had opened
the door for us to fight this legal battle.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In court,
we felt the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:45.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his disciples in Matthew chapter 10:

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you are to speak
will be given you in that hour.”

00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:52.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I claimed my innocence
in the courts for two years.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I received a guilty decision
in the initial and appeal trials,

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:58.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appealed to the Supreme Court.

00:07:58.373 --> 00:08:02.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately, my case was dismissed,
and I was imprisoned once again.

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But while I was in prison,
another door opened.

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:07.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the help of our brothers
and human rights groups,

00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:10.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I filed a complaint 
with the U.N. Human Rights Committee

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:13.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to raise awareness
in the international community.

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:17.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2006,
the U.N. Human Rights Committee

00:08:17.142 --> 00:08:20.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
declared that imprisoning
conscientious objectors

00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a violation of human rights

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:26.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it firmly stated
that the South Korean government

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:30.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is obligated to compensate
the complainant, Brother Yeo-bum Yoon.

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:35.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this time, the Governing Body
arranged for the brothers at the Korea branch

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:39.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work
with the World Headquarters Legal Department.

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:42.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was an important turning point

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:46.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the legal fight for the Korean brothers.

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:50.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
André and I felt
so privileged when we arrived

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver letters from the Governing Body

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our dear brothers in prison in Korea.

00:08:56.223 --> 00:08:58.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
there were almost a thousand of them.

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:03.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were
about 150 young brothers facing trial,

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:06.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so a legal package was compiled

00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:10.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the elders could prepare
the young brothers for their trial.

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:13.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember, Philip,
the meetings with the 10,000 elders?

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:14.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:20.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were just excited
at the prospect of this new strategy.

00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:24.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very fortunate.

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:29.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike my father, I had the opportunity
to clearly state my case in court.

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:32.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders in my congregation helped me

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:36.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go over the legal packet
provided by the branch

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:40.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a lot of other materials
to prepare me for the trial.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to their help,
I no longer felt afraid.

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:46.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was eager for the trial to start

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could courageously
and boldly convey my faith.

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:54.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I ended up serving time in prison,

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:58.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received hundreds of letters
from brothers and sisters around the world.

00:09:58.994 --> 00:10:02.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those letters really helped me
to endure with happiness.

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Close to 500 complaints were filed

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:07.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the United Nations
Human Rights Committee

00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:09.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on behalf of these brothers.

00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:12.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The committee ruled in favor
of the brothers every time!

00:10:12.757 --> 00:10:15.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, all of this
is in harmony with the principle,

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:19.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the admonition we find at 2 Kings 13:19

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:23.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, to strike
our arrows repeatedly on the ground.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These wonderful international decisions,

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:30.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the fine efforts
of our young brothers in court

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been prepared by the elders,

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:38.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sent shock waves
through the legal system in Korea.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:40.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has greatly blessed

00:10:40.368 --> 00:10:43.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the various efforts made not only in Korea

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also internationally.

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:50.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority of the brothers
made their defense without a lawyer,

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
skillfully using only the legal packet.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, local courts throughout Korea

00:10:56.092 --> 00:10:59.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rendered more than 100 not-guilty decisions.

00:10:59.804 --> 00:11:03.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did this affect
the Supreme Court’s decision?

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On June 28, 2018,

00:11:07.771 --> 00:11:11.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Constitutional Court of Korea
ruled that an individual’s right

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:14.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to refuse military service
according to his own conscience

00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be protected
by the Constitution of Korea.

00:11:17.113 --> 00:11:19.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore, it declared that the government

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:23.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must provide and implement
alternative service by 2020.

00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:26.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now it was the Supreme Court’s turn

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to respond to this historic decision
by the Constitutional Court.

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:32.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All attention was focused on whether or not

00:11:32.712 --> 00:11:35.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would protect the conscientious objectors

00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and declare our brothers not guilty.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Supreme Court
held a public hearing on August 30.

00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:44.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What preparations were made,
and what was the result?

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body
made some very loving arrangements

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:51.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the Legal Department
at world headquarters.

00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:54.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had 14 lawyers
from five branches around the world

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assist us to thoroughly prepare
for the public hearing.

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:02.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The public hearing
was broadcast live on the Internet.

00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:06.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, many brothers told us
that they were watching the hearing

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praying earnestly for us.

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:10.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to their support,

00:12:10.792 --> 00:12:15.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were able to respond appropriately
to the judges’ aggressive questions.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As stated at 1 Peter 3:15,

00:12:19.342 --> 00:12:22.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did so
with “a mild temper and deep respect.”

00:12:24.347 --> 00:12:27.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just two months
after the August 30 public hearing,

00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:31.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court announced
that the defendant was not guilty.

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:36.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, the highest court confirmed

00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:39.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s Witnesses were not criminals.

00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:43.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This historic ruling is the result

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:48.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the faithful endurance
of over 19,000 brothers,

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:52.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the tears
and the sacrifices of their families.

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:56.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe these momentous legal victories

00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:59.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were possible
because of their deep love for Jehovah

00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:03.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their long history of faith and courage.

00:13:04.804 --> 00:13:08.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Korean brothers suffered injustice

00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:12.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and went to prison
rather than violate their conscience.

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:17.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They remembered 1 Peter 2:20:

00:13:17.317 --> 00:13:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you endure suffering
because of doing good,

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:25.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is an agreeable thing to God.”

00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice that their courageous stand

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:31.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has finally been recognized

00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:36.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that this injustice has ended.

00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This historic legal victory
and the integrity of the Korean brothers

00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:43.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have certainly exalted Jehovah’s name

00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:45.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and upheld his sovereignty.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When all the imprisoned brothers
were finally released,

00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:52.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters
around the world rejoiced.

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:54.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt all of us are united

00:13:54.813 --> 00:13:57.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sincere thanks to our Father, Jehovah,

00:13:57.774 --> 00:13:59.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this wonderful triumph.

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave our Korean brothers

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:07.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the strength to endure
with faith and courage.

00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:10.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident that he will do the same

00:14:10.537 --> 00:14:13.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all our beloved brothers
and sisters around the world

00:14:13.915 --> 00:14:16.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are imprisoned because of their faith.

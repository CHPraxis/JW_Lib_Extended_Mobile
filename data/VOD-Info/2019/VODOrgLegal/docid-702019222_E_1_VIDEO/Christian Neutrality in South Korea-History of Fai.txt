00:00:23 Since 1953, young brothers in Korea
00:00:26 have been imprisoned for refusing military service.
00:00:29 More than 19,000 brothers
00:00:31 have spent a total of 36,000 years in prison
00:00:35 for refusing to compromise their faith.
00:00:38 However, on February 28, 2019,
00:00:42 the last of our imprisoned brothers was released.
00:00:45 For the first time in 66 years,
00:00:47 not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:49 is in prison for refusing military service.
00:00:52 Brothers and sisters around the world
00:00:54 rejoiced at this historic legal victory.
00:00:58 But how was this possible?
00:01:01 It was Jehovah’s powerful hand at work.
00:01:04 He blessed the young brothers and their families
00:01:08 for the faith and courage they showed.
00:01:13 His holy spirit strengthened them,
00:01:15 and he provided them with support and encouragement
00:01:19 through a globally united brotherhood.
00:01:22 Now, let’s take a closer look
00:01:24 at the record of unwavering faith and courage
00:01:27 among the Korean brothers.
00:01:31 When the Korean War broke out in 1950,
00:01:35 the issue of conscientious objection to military service came to the fore.
00:01:39 Brother Chong-il Park was one of the first of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:43 to refuse to compromise his faith.
00:01:46 In 1953, before the war was over,
00:01:49 I received an enlistment notice.
00:01:52 At the recruitment center,
00:01:55 I explained that my sincere conscience
00:01:57 would not allow me to join the military.
00:02:00 They took me to a counterintelligence facility,
00:02:03 where I was interrogated and tortured.
00:02:07 Once they realized the sincerity of my religious convictions,
00:02:10 I was transferred to the military police,
00:02:13 where a military tribunal gave me a three-year prison sentence.
00:02:20 Even after the armistice in 1953,
00:02:22 the Korean government continued to punish conscientious objectors.
00:02:27 In 1973,
00:02:29 under the president’s special order to achieve 100 percent enlistment,
00:02:33 authorities raided Kingdom Halls
00:02:35 and the private homes of brothers to forcefully enlist them.
00:02:40 When the officials raided the Kingdom Hall,
00:02:43 I was giving a public talk on the podium.
00:02:45 After the meeting, I said goodbye
00:02:47 to my family and fellow Witnesses
00:02:49 and told them that I would see them in Paradise.
00:02:52 Then I was taken away to the military base.
00:02:55 The brothers who were forcefully taken with me
00:02:58 were beaten mercilessly and suffered all kinds of abuse.
00:03:02 As time passed, the inhumane treatment
00:03:05 of our brothers enlisted against their will became even more severe.
00:03:09 Between 1975 and 1985,
00:03:13 five brothers died because of physical abuse.
00:03:17 The government formally admitted responsibility for this tragedy.
00:03:21 Brother Choon-gil Lee was one of the five brothers.
00:03:26 Brother Choon-gil Lee was such a precious son to his mother.
00:03:29 At a young age, he had to be the head of his family.
00:03:33 According to the records later found by the Commission on Suspicious Deaths,
00:03:37 Brother Lee had been hit in the stomach
00:03:39 with a rod until he lost consciousness.
00:03:43 The officer thought he was pretending
00:03:45 and continued to beat him.
00:03:48 After realizing how bad he was hurt,
00:03:50 the officer tried to revive Brother Lee by splashing water on him,
00:03:53 but he never woke up.
00:03:55 Brother Chung, you also suffered similar hardships back then.
00:04:00 What helped you to endure?
00:04:03 The yeartext that year was Psalm 91:2:
00:04:07 ‘Jehovah is my refuge and my stronghold.’
00:04:10 It felt as if it had been chosen
00:04:12 especially for us Korean brothers.
00:04:15 Our families were suffering as well.
00:04:19 They had no visitation rights and were denied all contact with us,
00:04:22 so they didn’t know whether we were dead or alive.
00:04:25 All they could do was calm their anxious hearts
00:04:29 and look to Jehovah who reassured them with the promise,
00:04:32 ‘I will be your refuge and your stronghold.’
00:04:36 This was a great comfort to them.
00:04:42 At that time, if we refused to enlist in the army,
00:04:46 some of us were imprisoned multiple times.
00:04:49 In my case,
00:04:51 I was imprisoned in 1972 and again in 1975.
00:04:56 Just the thought of having to return to the same prison
00:05:00 was emotionally devastating.
00:05:02 While in prison the second time,
00:05:05 I received a letter from Brother Albert Schroeder,
00:05:08 who was a member of the Governing Body at the time.
00:05:11 I read the letter with all the brothers who were imprisoned with me.
00:05:15 In it, he warmly encouraged us
00:05:18 by telling us that the Governing Body
00:05:21 and all of the brothers around the world were praying for us.
00:05:25 After reading this stirring letter,
00:05:28 our faith in Jehovah grew stronger.
00:05:31 Not only were we reassured that we were not alone
00:05:35 but we also gained greater strength and courage to defend our faith.
00:05:40 During this time,
00:05:42 it was difficult to get a fair hearing in court.
00:05:47 In 1982, we were tried in a military tribunal.
00:05:52 The military policeman guarding us
00:05:54 threatened us not to make a defense for ourselves.
00:05:58 On the day of the trial,
00:06:00 even the judicial officer in charge of our defense said,
00:06:04 “It’s cold, so please go easy on them.”
00:06:07 That was it.
00:06:10 At the time, the longest legal prison sentence
00:06:13 was two years.
00:06:15 Yet, we received a three-year sentence
00:06:18 without having a proper hearing
00:06:20 or even an explanation as to why it was long.
00:06:24 Did the situation improve for the brothers over time?
00:06:29 When I was charged with the maximum sentence of two years
00:06:32 for insubordination at a military tribunal,
00:06:35 there was no way for me to make a defense for myself.
00:06:38 Sadly, the situation hadn’t changed at all
00:06:41 when my oldest son was tried in court years later.
00:06:45 I was sentenced in a military tribunal in the year 2000.
00:06:52 In fact, I was told that if I tried to make a defense during the trial,
00:06:55 I would face retaliation afterward.
00:06:58 At that time, many brothers were sentenced to three years in prison.
00:07:01 This was even longer than my father’s prison sentence.
00:07:05 However, there was a change.
00:07:07 The brothers had been tried in military tribunals for decades,
00:07:11 but in 2001, the cases were moved to civilian courts.
00:07:15 I refused to enlist in November 2001, and so I was arrested.
00:07:19 I wanted to defend Jehovah’s name
00:07:22 and my stance on Christian neutrality in court,
00:07:24 so I requested bail.
00:07:26 Surprisingly, my request was granted.
00:07:28 It was the first time anyone was released on bail
00:07:31 under the Military Service Act.
00:07:33 As I walked out of the jail cell,
00:07:35 I realized that Jehovah had opened the door for us to fight this legal battle.
00:07:39 In court, we felt the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise
00:07:42 to his disciples in Matthew chapter 10:
00:07:45 “What you are to speak will be given you in that hour.”
00:07:48 I claimed my innocence in the courts for two years.
00:07:52 Although I received a guilty decision in the initial and appeal trials,
00:07:56 I appealed to the Supreme Court.
00:07:58 Unfortunately, my case was dismissed, and I was imprisoned once again.
00:08:02 But while I was in prison, another door opened.
00:08:04 With the help of our brothers and human rights groups,
00:08:07 I filed a complaint  with the U.N. Human Rights Committee
00:08:10 to raise awareness in the international community.
00:08:13 In 2006, the U.N. Human Rights Committee
00:08:17 declared that imprisoning conscientious objectors
00:08:20 was a violation of human rights
00:08:22 and it firmly stated that the South Korean government
00:08:26 is obligated to compensate the complainant, Brother Yeo-bum Yoon.
00:08:30 During this time, the Governing Body arranged for the brothers at the Korea branch
00:08:35 to work with the World Headquarters Legal Department.
00:08:39 This was an important turning point
00:08:42 in the legal fight for the Korean brothers.
00:08:47 André and I felt so privileged when we arrived
00:08:50 to deliver letters from the Governing Body
00:08:53 to our dear brothers in prison in Korea.
00:08:56 At that time, there were almost a thousand of them.
00:08:58 There were about 150 young brothers facing trial,
00:09:03 so a legal package was compiled
00:09:06 so that the elders could prepare the young brothers for their trial.
00:09:10 You remember, Philip, the meetings with the 10,000 elders?
00:09:13 I do.
00:09:15 They were just excited at the prospect of this new strategy.
00:09:21 I was very fortunate.
00:09:24 Unlike my father, I had the opportunity to clearly state my case in court.
00:09:29 The elders in my congregation helped me
00:09:32 to go over the legal packet provided by the branch
00:09:36 and a lot of other materials to prepare me for the trial.
00:09:40 Thanks to their help, I no longer felt afraid.
00:09:44 And I was eager for the trial to start
00:09:46 so that I could courageously and boldly convey my faith.
00:09:51 Although I ended up serving time in prison,
00:09:54 I received hundreds of letters from brothers and sisters around the world.
00:09:58 Those letters really helped me to endure with happiness.
00:10:03 Close to 500 complaints were filed
00:10:05 with the United Nations Human Rights Committee
00:10:07 on behalf of these brothers.
00:10:09 The committee ruled in favor of the brothers every time!
00:10:12 And, really, all of this is in harmony with the principle,
00:10:15 the admonition we find at 2 Kings 13:19
00:10:19 —that is, to strike our arrows repeatedly on the ground.
00:10:23 These wonderful international decisions,
00:10:27 along with the fine efforts of our young brothers in court
00:10:30 who had been prepared by the elders,
00:10:33 sent shock waves through the legal system in Korea.
00:10:38 Jehovah has greatly blessed
00:10:40 the various efforts made not only in Korea
00:10:43 but also internationally.
00:10:46 The majority of the brothers made their defense without a lawyer,
00:10:50 skillfully using only the legal packet.
00:10:53 As a result, local courts throughout Korea
00:10:56 rendered more than 100 not-guilty decisions.
00:10:59 How did this affect the Supreme Court’s decision?
00:11:05 On June 28, 2018,
00:11:07 the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled that an individual’s right
00:11:11 to refuse military service according to his own conscience
00:11:14 should be protected by the Constitution of Korea.
00:11:17 Furthermore, it declared that the government
00:11:19 must provide and implement alternative service by 2020.
00:11:23 So now it was the Supreme Court’s turn
00:11:26 to respond to this historic decision by the Constitutional Court.
00:11:29 All attention was focused on whether or not
00:11:32 it would protect the conscientious objectors
00:11:35 and declare our brothers not guilty.
00:11:37 The Supreme Court held a public hearing on August 30.
00:11:41 What preparations were made, and what was the result?
00:11:44 The Governing Body made some very loving arrangements
00:11:48 through the Legal Department at world headquarters.
00:11:51 They had 14 lawyers from five branches around the world
00:11:54 assist us to thoroughly prepare for the public hearing.
00:11:59 The public hearing was broadcast live on the Internet.
00:12:02 Later, many brothers told us that they were watching the hearing
00:12:06 and praying earnestly for us.
00:12:08 Thanks to their support,
00:12:10 we were able to respond appropriately to the judges’ aggressive questions.
00:12:15 As stated at 1 Peter 3:15,
00:12:19 we did so with “a mild temper and deep respect.”
00:12:24 Just two months after the August 30 public hearing,
00:12:27 the Supreme Court announced that the defendant was not guilty.
00:12:33 In effect, the highest court confirmed
00:12:36 that Jehovah’s Witnesses were not criminals.
00:12:40 This historic ruling is the result
00:12:43 of the faithful endurance of over 19,000 brothers,
00:12:48 along with the tears and the sacrifices of their families.
00:12:52 I believe these momentous legal victories
00:12:56 were possible because of their deep love for Jehovah
00:12:59 and their long history of faith and courage.
00:13:04 Our Korean brothers suffered injustice
00:13:08 and went to prison rather than violate their conscience.
00:13:12 They remembered 1 Peter 2:20:
00:13:17 “If you endure suffering because of doing good,
00:13:21 this is an agreeable thing to God.”
00:13:25 We rejoice that their courageous stand
00:13:29 has finally been recognized
00:13:31 and that this injustice has ended.
00:13:36 This historic legal victory and the integrity of the Korean brothers
00:13:40 have certainly exalted Jehovah’s name
00:13:43 and upheld his sovereignty.
00:13:45 When all the imprisoned brothers were finally released,
00:13:49 brothers and sisters around the world rejoiced.
00:13:52 No doubt all of us are united
00:13:54 in sincere thanks to our Father, Jehovah,
00:13:57 for this wonderful triumph.
00:13:59 Jehovah gave our Korean brothers
00:14:02 the strength to endure with faith and courage.
00:14:07 We are confident that he will do the same
00:14:10 for all our beloved brothers and sisters around the world
00:14:13 who are imprisoned because of their faith.

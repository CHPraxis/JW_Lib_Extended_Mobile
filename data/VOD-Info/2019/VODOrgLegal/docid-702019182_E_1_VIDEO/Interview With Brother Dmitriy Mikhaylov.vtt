00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work as a street cleaner;

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either that or I do some other kind of work,
like decorating

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or system administration.

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:18.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On April 20, they came to search

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the home of my wife and me.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was interrogated.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after a month, a court ruled

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put me in pretrial detention.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they lead me out of the courtroom
in handcuffs . . .

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and put me into the vehicle,

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yelena (my wife) was at the exit.

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From her words, I could sense

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:55.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she felt as though she was losing me.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took me to the detention center
in the city of Ivanovo.

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:11.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They moved me from cell to cell.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then they put me
into what is known as the pressure cell.

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:21.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told me I had to admit my guilt

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell them about my fellow worshippers

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—give them names, addresses,
what they do, etcetera.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, that would mean
losing my loyalty to God.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second thing was that it involved
my loyalty to my fellow worshippers.

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In essence, it was about showing love.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:48.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said that for me,
loyalty to Jehovah is above everything else,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so whatever happens,
I will remain loyal to God.

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told them openly, directly.

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They pressured me physically and emotionally
for several months.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:13.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought me a Bible
from the detention center’s library.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to fervent prayers,
I felt how Jehovah gave me

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
internal peace and calm.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It proves that Jehovah doesn’t just exist,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he thinks about us; he cares for us.

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:33.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah supported me
through a letter from my dear wife.

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In it was the thought
that trusting in Jehovah

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means seeing things the way he sees them.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prisoners who put pressure on me

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also expressed interest in spiritual things

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:54.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started asking questions
relating to my beliefs.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone told me
that if I am really a believer,

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:04.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should have objects to prove it,
such as a cross, which all believers wear.

00:03:04.246 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him that I could show him
the Bible’s viewpoint.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From what I read,
he made his own conclusions.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after some time,
this prisoner came up to me and showed me

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:20.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he wasn’t wearing a cross anymore.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you are in prison,

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ministry isn’t just about opportunities

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tell people
about the truth from the Bible.

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is more about Jehovah using it

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help you keep a positive outlook
and maintain joy.

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:41.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we concentrate
on what we had before,

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we suffer.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The quicker we accept the new circumstances,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the quicker our joy returns to us

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the opportunity to make good use

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the new circumstances.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:01.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The appeal instance court
ruled to release me.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was, of course,
quite an unexpected decision.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the exit, my dear wife

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:12.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other fellow worshippers
(brothers and sisters)

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:17.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just from my hometown
but from other cities too met me.

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:24.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yelena and I thought it would be good
to collect some essentials,

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we bought some things
and went to the detention center.

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:32.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And afterward, one of the prisoners

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote me a letter of thanks:

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:36.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I heard how everyone came to meet you.

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:40.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I tried to imagine how cool it is

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be loved, valued, and missed.

00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:46.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For some,
there’s not enough of that in life.

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take care of yourself, Dima!”

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The letters from my wife
were such a big support for me at that time.

00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be honest, I saw her letters

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:02.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if it were Jehovah using her
to speak to me.

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:06.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nobody loves us as strongly as God.

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:10.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can’t right now feel my love
to the full extent

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:12.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or the love of your family and friends.

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the main thing is
that you are in God’s hands,

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that is what’s more important.

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:22.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He loves you in a special way right now

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:26.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and very gently looks after you
and cares for your feelings.

00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:28.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By trusting in God,

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:33.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we can get a feeling of security,
stability, and calmness.

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:37.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our connection with God
must be unbreakable.

00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:39.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If our strength is in God,

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:41.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then we will overcome everything.

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our suffering is just temporary,

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:48.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and God will richly reward
all who are loyal to him.”

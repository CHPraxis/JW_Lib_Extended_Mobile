00:00:01 Well, I have the privilege of being part
00:00:03 of a delegation of brothers from 18 countries
00:00:06 who’ve been assigned by the Governing Body to attend
00:00:08 the Supreme Court hearing in Moscow on July 17.
00:00:12 The principal objective is to just show unity and support for our brothers.
00:00:18 I’m going to Russia in order to be of encouragement
00:00:21 to the local Russian brothers and sisters there.
00:00:24 I will encourage them to continue
00:00:28 to ‘obey Jehovah as ruler rather than men.’
00:00:34 Our intent is to try and visit many of the embassies
00:00:39 and speak to a variety of different high officials
00:00:41 about what’s happening right now
00:00:43 with our brothers in Russia.
00:00:46 And, really, when you think of it,
00:00:48 this is almost a way of saying that our international brotherhood
00:00:52 is all coming to the defense,
00:00:56 or to the aid, of our brothers in Russia.
00:00:58 And actually, when you think about it or when you meditate on it,
00:01:01 it really is a very, very beautiful thing.
00:01:05 Jehovah has everything under control.
00:01:09 And whatever the outcome may be,
00:01:13 there is no doubt that Jehovah
00:01:16 will continue to strengthen our brothers.

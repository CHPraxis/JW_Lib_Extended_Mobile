00:00:03 Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:06 This is my friend and cohost, Izak Marais.
00:00:11 Izak, what’s in store for this month’s program?
00:00:15 Thank you, Brother Lösch.
00:00:17 This month we’ll examine the many ways
00:00:20 Jehovah assures us that he is with us.
00:00:24 Our music video for this month shows how,
00:00:27 from the moment that we start to take steps
00:00:30 toward dedication and baptism,
00:00:32 Jehovah draws close to us.
00:00:35 Jehovah is also with us in the ministry.
00:00:37 In this report, we’ll see how he blessed
00:00:40 a special preaching effort in Europe.
00:00:45 And Jehovah is with us as we meet challenges of daily life,
00:00:48 as our Sister Reeta and her children learned.
00:00:53 That sounds exciting!
00:00:55 Let’s get started.
00:00:57 This is the November 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting.
00:01:20 Millions have benefited
00:01:22 from the animated series
00:01:24 Become Jehovah’s Friend
00:01:26 and many other Bible-based videos.
00:01:29 Have you enjoyed getting to know Caleb and Sophia?
00:01:33 When you’ve watched a video,
00:01:35 perhaps you’ve wondered:
00:01:37 ‘How does the Governing Body know that the video will turn out exactly right?
00:01:42 How can they see and hear the video before it exists?’
00:01:47 Let’s go behind the scenes and see how this works.
00:01:55 Animated videos,
00:01:57 like those in the series Become Jehovah’s Friend,
00:02:01 have been helping young ones draw closer to their heavenly Father
00:02:03 for several years now.
00:02:06 Look, Mom, I’m rejoicing in the hope!
00:02:08 Wee!
00:02:14 But did you know
00:02:16 that what you see on the screen
00:02:18 might last just a few short minutes
00:02:23 but it may involve weeks of work
00:02:26 by a virtual army of volunteers?
00:02:31 With so much time and expense involved in making an animated video,
00:02:35 a lot of careful planning is required to avoid waste
00:02:39 and to keep the process running smoothly.
00:02:42 Let’s take a look at how the effective use
00:02:45 of preproduction tools help all of these brothers and sisters
00:02:49 work together to take a video
00:02:51 from initial concept to final production.
00:02:54 Under the direction of the Teaching Committee of the Governing Body,
00:02:59 the work begins long before the artists even get started.
00:03:03 They provide direction on the theme that needs to be taught.
00:03:07 Members of the animation team collaborate
00:03:10 to develop the featured characters as well as plot structure,
00:03:14 and they work closely with writers and storyboard artists
00:03:18 to develop the approved idea into a story line.
00:03:23 Once a complete script is ready,
00:03:25 the whole team gathers together for a table read.
00:03:29 This is the first time the team hears the whole script being read aloud.
00:03:34 Dialogue is meant to be heard.
00:03:36 So when we read it aloud at the table read,
00:03:38 we pick up on things
00:03:39 we didn’t see in the written script.
00:03:41 We’re able to tighten the story
00:03:43 and make it as clear as possible.
00:03:44 The script is reviewed by the research team for accuracy.
00:03:49 Then it’s revised, polished, and submitted
00:03:52 to the Teaching Committee for approval.
00:03:54 With an approved script in hand,
00:03:57 the director then works with an artist
00:03:59 to start turning words into pictures
00:04:04 —visualizing each scene on a storyboard.
00:04:06 First come the rough boards,
00:04:09 showing what will be included in each shot.
00:04:12 When it comes to the animation world, really,
00:04:15 everything you see on screen
00:04:16 has to be designed and created
00:04:19 —the characters,
00:04:20 the furniture,
00:04:21 the props, the environment
00:04:23 are all created by a designer.
00:04:25 The storyboard really helps us
00:04:27 figure out exactly what we need to create
00:04:30 so that we’re not creating too much or too little.
00:04:35 Once approved by the director,
00:04:37 the storyboard artist cleans up each of the boards.
00:04:42 Preliminary recordings of dialogue, music,
00:04:45 and sound effects are added.
00:04:50 These are then used by the director
00:04:52 and compositor to create an animatic.
00:04:57 An animatic is a rough draft of the entire video.
00:05:01 The animatic is very important for us.
00:05:04 That way the director
00:05:06 and, more importantly, the Teaching Committee
00:05:08 can see the entire video before we are actually making it.
00:05:11 And with that they can review it and give us the proper direction.
00:05:16 The finished animatic is submitted
00:05:18 to the Teaching Committee for review.
00:05:20 Based on direction from the committee,
00:05:23 the team makes sure that the teaching points come across clearly
00:05:27 and that the finished product is true to the spirit
00:05:30 and intent of the approved concept for the video.
00:05:35 Finally, using the approved animatic as a blueprint,
00:05:39 full production begins.
00:05:45 Really, everything in animation can be very time-consuming.
00:05:50 An animator working full-time here at Bethel
00:05:53 may be able to produce four to six seconds of animation in one week,
00:05:58 and that doesn’t even include other aspects
00:06:01 that are very important, such as modeling,
00:06:03 rigging, lighting, compositing, and many others.
00:06:07 From the examples shown here,
00:06:10 you can see just how closely the final version
00:06:13 of the video Make Jehovah Happy  follows the animatic.
00:06:20 Preproduction tools such as storyboards and animatics
00:06:24 do more than save the organization time and money.
00:06:28 They enable the Teaching Committee
00:06:30 to carefully evaluate every project along the way
00:06:35 from the initial approved concept
00:06:37 to the final product
00:06:39 in order to keep providing videos
00:06:41 that help all of us honor our Friend, Jehovah.
00:06:50 Isn’t it amazing to see all the work
00:06:53 that goes into our videos?
00:06:56 Jehovah provides for his people
00:06:58 just what they need at the right time.
00:07:02 Truly, he is with his people.
00:07:06 Brother Lösch,
00:07:07 I know you have some thoughts on this.
00:07:11 I’d like to talk
00:07:12 about a very common expression
00:07:14 in the Bible.
00:07:16 The expression is:
00:07:17 “I am with you.”
00:07:20 Thirteen times it’s attributed to a statement from Jehovah.
00:07:25 Three times it’s something that Jesus said
00:07:29 to one or more of his disciples.
00:07:32 Of course, there are dozens of other times
00:07:35 that the same sentiment is expressed using similar wording.
00:07:41 Few things in the world equal the joy humans experience
00:07:45 than the birth of a child.
00:07:48 As children grow up,
00:07:50 they are sometimes exposed to situations
00:07:53 that tend to cause nervousness
00:07:55 or even fear.
00:07:57 So a parent may occasionally feel compelled
00:08:00 to reassure a child:
00:08:02 “Have no fear; I am with you.”
00:08:07 Jehovah loves his servants as if they were his children.
00:08:12 Likewise, at John 13:1,
00:08:15 Jesus’ feelings for his disciples are well expressed.
00:08:19 There it says:
00:08:21 “Jesus, having loved his own who were in the world,
00:08:25 loved them to the end.”
00:08:29 So when we face fears,
00:08:31 trials, or causes for anxiety,
00:08:34 both our heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus,
00:08:38 reassuringly say, “I am with you.”
00:08:43 Think of the righteous man Noah.
00:08:46 Genesis 6:9 says
00:08:48 that “Noah walked with the true God.”
00:08:51 There’s no doubt that Jehovah was with Noah.
00:08:55 He preserved him and his family through the Flood.
00:08:59 Afterward, Jehovah further proved he was with Noah.
00:09:04 In Genesis chapter 9, Jehovah said:
00:09:07 ‘I am now establishing my covenant with you:
00:09:10 ‘Never again will all flesh be destroyed
00:09:13 by the waters of a flood.’
00:09:16 Jehovah could have made that determination
00:09:19 and promised himself that he wouldn’t do that again,
00:09:23 but instead, he reached out to Noah
00:09:26 and reassured him that he was with him
00:09:30 by making the rainbow covenant with Noah and his offspring.
00:09:36 Using similar terminology,
00:09:39 Jehovah indicated that he was with Abraham,
00:09:42 Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
00:09:44 Moses, Joshua, and Gideon.
00:09:48 They were all individuals whom Jehovah was pleased with,
00:09:52 so he reassured them that he was with them.
00:09:57 How about for a group of people?
00:10:00 Is Jehovah moved to feel the same way
00:10:03 toward a large crowd of his servants collectively?
00:10:09 Please find with me Exodus 6:6, 7.
00:10:17 The whole nation of Israel
00:10:20 was experiencing severe trials
00:10:22 and suffering as slaves in Egypt.
00:10:25 Notice Jehovah’s reassurance to the vast number of people.
00:10:30 Verses 6 and 7 state:
00:10:33 “Therefore, say to the Israelites:
00:10:37 “‘I am Jehovah,
00:10:39 “‘and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians
00:10:43 “‘and rescue you from their slavery,
00:10:46 “‘and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm
00:10:50 “‘and with great judgments.
00:10:52 “‘And I will take you in as my people, and I will be your God,
00:10:55 “‘and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God
00:10:59 who is bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt.’”
00:11:03 If that great, mixed group of people would follow his leadings,
00:11:08 he said he’d ‘take them in’ and he ‘would be their God.’
00:11:12 What was he saying?
00:11:14 He was reassuring them:
00:11:16 “I will be with you,”
00:11:19 and he was.
00:11:21 For forty years in the wilderness, he was with them
00:11:24 —feeding them, providing water for them,
00:11:28 ensuring that their clothes and sandals would not wear out,
00:11:32 protecting them from poisonous snakes, and so forth.
00:11:36 And later, when entering the land of promise,
00:11:39 he protected them during enemy warfare.
00:11:44 Jehovah promised to be with and to support
00:11:48 the kings of Israel
00:11:50 as long as they heeded his commandments and direction.
00:11:55 King Solomon was told:
00:11:57 “Jehovah [your] God . . . will not desert you or abandon you,
00:12:02 but he will be with you.”
00:12:06 King Asa was informed:
00:12:08 “Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with him.”
00:12:15 When faced with overwhelming enemy forces,
00:12:18 King Jehoshaphat was told:
00:12:21 “Tomorrow go out against them, and Jehovah will be with you.”
00:12:27 Jehovah also proved to be with the many prophets
00:12:31 that he sent out in his name.
00:12:33 Just one example is Jeremiah.
00:12:36 Imagine if you had Jeremiah’s assignment.
00:12:40 Suppose you had been directed to deliver
00:12:42 a scathing denunciation and judgment
00:12:46 against wicked kings, corrupt priests, and false prophets.
00:12:50 How would you feel?
00:12:52 underqualified?
00:12:54 Would you feel like a little child
00:12:56 challenging a whole group of evil grown-ups?
00:13:01 Notice how Jeremiah felt as he expressed himself
00:13:05 at Jeremiah 1:6:
00:13:11 “But I said: ‘Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!
00:13:15 I do not know how to speak, for I am just a boy.’”
00:13:20 What were Jehovah’s reassuring words in reply?
00:13:25 Jeremiah 1:8, 9:
00:13:27 “‘Do not be afraid
00:13:29 “‘because of their appearance, for “I am with you to save you,”
00:13:34 “declares Jehovah.’
00:13:35 “Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth.
00:13:39 “And Jehovah said to me:  ‘I have put my words in your mouth.’”
00:13:44 If Jehovah put the words that you were to say “in your mouth,”
00:13:49 you’d no longer feel like a little child, would you?
00:13:53 We don’t think of Jeremiah as being an incredible superman;
00:13:58 he was a human like us.
00:14:01 It’s of interest that though Jeremiah lived in another time and place,
00:14:06 he faced situations similar to those we face.
00:14:11 We interact with different types of people
00:14:14 in our daily life, at work, and at school.
00:14:18 Some of them can be intimidating.
00:14:21 And like Jeremiah,
00:14:23 Jehovah has commissioned us to go to strangers and preach.
00:14:28 We share the good news of the Kingdom.
00:14:31 Some are interested; others are just plain apathetic.
00:14:36 But at times, we may come across someone who is angry
00:14:40 and may even be threatening.
00:14:43 This is the time to remember Jeremiah.
00:14:48 Though initially timid,
00:14:50 he courageously faced
00:14:52 the challenge of an intimidating response.
00:14:57 How did he rally to the occasion?
00:15:00 It was because Jehovah had reassured him:
00:15:04 “I am with you.”
00:15:07 He said: “I have put my words in your mouth.”
00:15:13 Does Jehovah do something similar for us?
00:15:17 Yes.
00:15:18 Long after Jeremiah and the other faithful ones
00:15:22 who are recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures came and went,
00:15:26 Jehovah has proved to be with true Christians,
00:15:29 both past and present.
00:15:33 Find with me John chapter 8.
00:15:40 Think of Jesus.
00:15:42 It’s true he was a perfect man,
00:15:45 but did Jehovah leave him all alone?
00:15:47 At John 8:16, what did Jesus himself say?
00:15:53 “And yet even if I do judge, my judgment is truthful,
00:15:58 “because I am not alone,
00:16:00 but the Father who sent me is with me.”
00:16:03 We might be thinking of that intimidating person in the ministry.
00:16:08 Even if you are facing the person without a fellow Witness standing beside you,
00:16:13 are you really all alone?
00:16:17 Jesus knew that at the most stressful
00:16:21 and emotionally draining time
00:16:23 during his human life,
00:16:25 his disciples would leave him all alone.
00:16:29 But was he really alone?
00:16:32 Let’s read the inspired account
00:16:35 at John 16:32.
00:16:37 Again, these are Jesus’ own words:
00:16:41 “Look! The hour is coming, indeed, it has come,
00:16:44 “when each one of you will be scattered to his own house
00:16:48 “and you will leave me alone.
00:16:51 “But I am not alone,
00:16:53 because the Father is with me.”
00:16:56 Jesus was not alone during his most anxious moments.
00:17:01 Jehovah was with him.
00:17:04 If you think you are alone
00:17:06 standing at the door of an irritated householder,
00:17:10 think again.
00:17:12 Jehovah is with you.
00:17:14 You have more with you
00:17:16 than if you had your whole congregation
00:17:19 standing in the person’s front yard.
00:17:24 Well, why did Jesus share
00:17:26 this precious insight with us?
00:17:30 Look at the next verse.
00:17:32 Jesus explains his reason for saying what he did.
00:17:36 John 16:33:
00:17:39 “I have said these things to you
00:17:41 “so that by means of me you may have peace.
00:17:45 “In the world you will have tribulation,
00:17:47 “but take courage!
00:17:49 I have conquered the world.”
00:17:52 We thank Jesus for addressing
00:17:55 our fears and concerns when giving a witness.
00:17:59 Instead of trembling with fear,
00:18:01 he shared his confidence in Jehovah’s support
00:18:05 so that we “may have peace.”
00:18:08 He acknowledged that we would face tribulation,
00:18:11 but he said that we could look at his example
00:18:14 and have courage to deal with the tribulation.
00:18:18 Why?
00:18:20 Jesus said in verse 32
00:18:22 that it was because ‘the Father was with him.’
00:18:26 Do you recall that Jehovah told Jeremiah:
00:18:30 “I have put my words in your mouth?”
00:18:33 Can Jehovah do the same for us
00:18:36 when we are opposed by unbelievers?
00:18:40 The Christian Greek Scriptures answer with a resounding yes!
00:18:46 Please follow along with the reading
00:18:49 of the book of Mark chapter 13,
00:18:53 and please notice that the setting Jesus describes
00:18:58 is in the ministry, preaching the good news.
00:19:02 Maybe you’ve had a good morning in service,
00:19:05 but then you take one more door.
00:19:08 The person is irate and even calls the police.
00:19:12 What should you do?
00:19:14 What will you say when the police arrive?
00:19:19 You don’t have to be overly concerned.
00:19:22 Why not?
00:19:24 Because similar to Jeremiah,
00:19:27 Jehovah will, in effect, put His words in your mouth.
00:19:31 Mark 13:10, 11 says:
00:19:36 “Also, in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.
00:19:41 “And when they are taking you to hand you over,
00:19:46 “do not be anxious beforehand about what to say;
00:19:50 “but whatever is given you in that hour, say this,
00:19:54 “for you are not the ones speaking,
00:19:58 but the holy spirit is.”
00:20:00 By this, do we mean that Jehovah
00:20:03 will miraculously put words in your mouth for you to say?
00:20:09 Not necessarily.
00:20:11 Did you notice verse 11 said
00:20:13 that “the holy spirit” is the one speaking?
00:20:18 You’ve been taught the basis for your faith from the Scriptures,
00:20:23 and you know the reason that you teach the Bible’s message.
00:20:27 That’s all stored in your mind.
00:20:31 So, what’s the holy spirit’s role
00:20:34 when we are in an intimidating situation
00:20:37 when sharing the good news?
00:20:41 Jehovah is with you.
00:20:44 He uses his holy spirit to bring to the surface
00:20:47 some of those precious gems that might be buried in your mind.
00:20:52 You may be amazed at what you remember
00:20:56 when put under pressure by the authorities
00:20:59 or even by outright opposers.
00:21:03 In this way, Jehovah is with you.
00:21:07 Add to the fact that Jesus is with you in the disciple-making work.
00:21:13 Let’s be reminded of this very encouraging thought
00:21:18 at Matthew 28:19, 20.
00:21:23 Jesus was discussing our commission
00:21:26 to preach, teach, and make disciples.
00:21:29 And how does he conclude the Bible book of Matthew?
00:21:33 Let’s read Matthew 28:19, 20:
00:21:39 “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations,
00:21:44 “baptizing them in the name of the Father
00:21:47 “and of the Son and of the holy spirit,
00:21:50 “teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.
00:21:55 “And look! I am with you all the days
00:21:58 until the conclusion of the system of things.”
00:22:02 Jesus said that he is with us now
00:22:05 when we are making disciples and teaching people the truth.
00:22:09 And he promises he’ll support us in this important work
00:22:14 until the end of this wicked system of things.
00:22:19 As prophesied, during this time of the conclusion of the system,
00:22:23 we are being persecuted in different areas of the world.
00:22:28 As the Scriptures show, Satan and his angels
00:22:32 are “misleading the entire inhabited earth.”
00:22:36 Recently, Jehovah’s people have been persecuted in Russia.
00:22:40 But will the persecution
00:22:42 succeed in eliminating
00:22:45 true worship in that area of the world?
00:22:48 No!
00:22:49 Why not?
00:22:51 It’s because Jehovah is with them.
00:22:55 He and Jesus promised: “I am with you.”
00:23:00 Russia did not learn from the past.
00:23:03 It will prove to be the same for them
00:23:05 as it was for Nazi Germany under Hitler.
00:23:09 Hitler thought his regime
00:23:11 could eradicate true worship and God’s people
00:23:14 from areas under their control.
00:23:16 But they made a big mistake.
00:23:19 While it is true that they murdered some 2,000 brothers,
00:23:23 in the end, their scheme ended up in failure.
00:23:27 Why?
00:23:28 Because God was with us, not with them.
00:23:34 “God with us”
00:23:37 —those words have decorated national emblems
00:23:40 and even the uniforms of soldiers of Prussia
00:23:43 and the Czarist Russian Empire.
00:23:46 These words were also on the belts of German troops
00:23:50 when they marched into Belgium in the year 1914 of our Common Era.
00:23:55 But they had it wrong!
00:23:57 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah was with us, not with them.
00:24:02 He’s with all of us now.
00:24:05 He’ll be with us during Armageddon.
00:24:08 He’ll be with us after Armageddon.
00:24:11 He’ll be with us at the end of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.
00:24:15 He’ll be with mankind at the end of 100,000 years.
00:24:20 He’ll be with humans at the end of 100 million years
00:24:25 and at the end of 100 million years times 100 million years.
00:24:30 Jehovah will be with mankind forever,
00:24:34 and so will Jesus!
00:24:36 They are both on record as saying:
00:24:38 “I am with you”!
00:24:42 Thank you very much, Brother Lösch.
00:24:46 Today, Jehovah is with his people everywhere.
00:24:49 We’re going to see examples of this next.
00:24:52 First is the experience of Adam and Nancy Solomon.
00:24:55 When they came into the truth,
00:24:57 they faced bitter opposition from their families.
00:25:01 Notice how Jehovah was with them during this stressful time.
00:25:08 My family are Hungarian Jews.
00:25:12 Most of them were killed in concentration camps.
00:25:16 That’s something that the Holocaust took from me
00:25:21 —it took the concept of family.
00:25:23 I needed explanations.
00:25:25 I needed to know why my family was murdered.
00:25:28 It made me really search at a very young age to see
00:25:32 if there was a real religion out there.
00:25:36 It was just a secular thing to be Jewish;
00:25:39 it was a cultural thing.
00:25:42 A friend of mine came up to me and said:
00:25:45 “I have to tell you something.
00:25:48 “I got this book from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:25:52 It is the most beautiful book I have ever read.”
00:25:55 I said, “Oh, I’ll read it.”
00:25:58 And it couldn’t have been a week later
00:26:01 that I got a knock on my door, and there were
00:26:04 two young women at the door who started to talk to me about the Bible.
00:26:11 Once I started having a study on a regular basis with Carolyn,
00:26:15 I enjoyed it more and more.
00:26:17 One day my father was home.
00:26:21 He just screamed at them
00:26:23 and basically threw them out of the house.
00:26:25 It just progressed after that.
00:26:28 There was just no peace at any time
00:26:31 and a lot of tears.
00:26:33 And I just couldn’t understand
00:26:35 why they weren’t even asking me:
00:26:38 “Well, what is it that you like about this religion?
00:26:41 “Who are these people?
00:26:42 Let us talk to—” No, nothing.
00:26:44 It was very, very hard.
00:26:47 Shortly after my baptism,
00:26:50 my mother came up to me, and she said:
00:26:53 “Your father and I are going out for the day.
00:26:56 You better not be here when we get home.”
00:26:59 I was 17 years old.
00:27:01 I didn’t know where I was going to go.
00:27:03 I didn’t know what I was going to do.
00:27:05 But I trusted in Jehovah.
00:27:07 And I picked up the phone, and I called my Carolyn.
00:27:11 In what seemed like minutes, there were brothers and sisters at the house.
00:27:15 They were putting my things into this truck and bringing it over to Carolyn’s house.
00:27:20 And she said, “You can live with me.”
00:27:25 Before I was baptized, I would drive back and forth
00:27:27 to school with a friend of mine.
00:27:30 Little by little, I was telling him what I was learning.
00:27:33 He said: “You know, I want to meet these people.
00:27:36 I have some questions.”
00:27:37 I had questions.
00:27:38 I asked them: “Why do we die?,
00:27:40 Why do we grow old?,” and so forth and so on.
00:27:42 And they went right to the Bible,
00:27:45 and when I left the house after that,
00:27:48 I said, “This is the truth!”
00:27:50 Growing up in my house, going to church every Sunday
00:27:54 was something that you had to do.
00:27:56 But when I became a teenager, then religion became less in my life,
00:28:00 and basketball became more.
00:28:01 Being a young man, you’d watch sports
00:28:04 and you’d see that sports players made a lot of money.
00:28:06 My teachers would tell my parents:
00:28:08 “He’s going to be a good basketball player.
00:28:10 “Take care of him.
00:28:11 “He could be worth, you know,
00:28:12 several hundred thousand dollars by the time he graduates.”
00:28:15 I received over 125 scholarships.
00:28:20 Now you’re talking about a free education
00:28:22 just because you can play basketball.
00:28:26 So I realized, you know, at an early age that playing
00:28:29 professional basketball could mean a lot,
00:28:31 not only for me but for my family.
00:28:34 So as far as God was concerned, I had a little interest in God
00:28:38 (like I would ask my mom questions),
00:28:40 but it wasn’t until Nancy brought me to the Witnesses
00:28:44 that really something just kicked in.
00:28:46 I was studying,
00:28:48 and my mom was downstairs in the basement.
00:28:50 I heard her crying, and I said, “What’s wrong?”
00:28:52 And she said, “I know you’re going to become one of those Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:28:56 So realizing in my mind
00:28:58 that I’m not going to become a basketball player
00:29:01 but that I’m going to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:29:02 because that’s more important
00:29:04 —that affected me many, many times.
00:29:08 When others found out
00:29:10 that I was going to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:29:12 people shied away.
00:29:14 People try to use you when they think
00:29:16 you can give them something or you’re going to be somebody big.
00:29:18 By going the direction of serving Jehovah completely,
00:29:21 you lost all the worldly people that you thought were your friends.
00:29:25 And so that was
00:29:28 in one summer that I started the study with Brother Crespo,
00:29:31 and in six months, I was baptized.
00:29:34 And then we decided to get married.
00:29:39 The scripture that says
00:29:41 that ‘even if my own father and my mother would abandon me,’
00:29:44 that even ‘Jehovah would take me in,’
00:29:47 —it proved to be true in so many ways.
00:29:51 Once you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:29:54 you’re part of a family that will do anything for you.
00:29:57 We’ve had adversity over the years,
00:29:59 but Jehovah never said everything was going to be perfect.
00:30:02 What he says is that when you face these problems,
00:30:05 you will not face them alone.
00:30:07 And Jehovah has never let us down when it comes to that.
00:30:12 When their families and friends abandoned them,
00:30:16 did you notice how Jehovah continued to be with Adam and Nancy?
00:30:22 Their spiritual family immediately stepped in to support them.
00:30:26 I appreciated what Nancy said:
00:30:29 ‘Jehovah never said everything will be perfect.
00:30:33 ‘He said that when you face problems,
00:30:36 you will not face them alone.’
00:30:38 She and Adam never felt alone.
00:30:43 Often, we ask Jehovah to be with us when we need something
00:30:48 —a spiritual need or a material need.
00:30:52 But as we’ll see in this next experience,
00:30:55 even before we know that we have a need,
00:30:58 Jehovah already knows what we need.
00:31:04 My name is Reeta.
00:31:06 My son is Jackson, and my daughter is Sherina.
00:31:10 It’s just the three of us.
00:31:13 I have been working on a tea estate as a tea picker.
00:31:16 One day, I prayed to God very hard.
00:31:19 I said,
00:31:21 “Please help me to learn about the Bible.”
00:31:24 Within two days, Jehovah’s Witnesses came
00:31:28 and knocked on my door, and I agreed to study the Bible.
00:31:31 I couldn’t believe it.
00:31:33 I only prayed yesterday, asking God to help me to study the Bible.
00:31:38 Our meetings begin at 4:45 p.m.,
00:31:41 but we have to get ready by 12 o’clock
00:31:45 to attend the meetings.
00:31:46 So we prepare our bags on Wednesday night.
00:31:52 I carry two big bags on my shoulders
00:31:55 and walk for three and a half kilometers (2 mi)
00:31:57 to get to the meetings on time.
00:32:01 We love seeing our brothers.
00:32:04 That’s why we always go to the meetings early.
00:32:12 I have been pioneering now for a year and six months.
00:32:21 There is no greater happiness than what comes from pioneering.
00:32:27 This is a onetime opportunity.
00:32:30 That is why we decided that we should give the best that we can to Jehovah.
00:32:38 Now I am so happy to be serving this way.
00:32:43 One time, I was not paid at all.
00:32:48 I didn’t even have a rupee.
00:32:54 On that day, my children and I ate well.
00:32:59 But after eating, we were very worried
00:33:03 about what we were going to do the following day.
00:33:06 So that night, I said a prayer with the kids
00:33:10 and we read the Bible.
00:33:15 Jesus said,
00:33:18 ‘Don’t worry about tomorrow.’
00:33:20 So I trusted that somehow
00:33:23 Jehovah would give us what we needed.
00:33:26 It was 10:30 at night.
00:33:28 I was fast asleep, and the phone rang.
00:33:33 Usually no one calls this late,
00:33:36 so I wondered, ‘Who could be calling me this late?’
00:33:42 I picked up the phone, and it was a brother on the line.
00:33:46 He said, “Sister, go to your bookshelf
00:33:51 and take the Greatest Man book.”
00:33:57 Then he asked me to turn to a page.
00:34:01 When I turned to that page,
00:34:02 there were 10,000 rupees (about $55, U.S.) between those pages.
00:34:06 We could not believe our eyes.
00:34:08 It was exactly what we needed for that month’s expenses.
00:34:12 A few days earlier, he and his wife had visited us
00:34:15 and secretly left the money in the book before leaving.
00:34:18 So I thanked Jehovah in prayer with the kids.
00:34:21 Jehovah already knew exactly what we needed
00:34:25 even before we realized it.
00:34:35 Honestly, every night I open the doors,
00:34:40 go outside, and look up at the night sky.
00:34:44 When I look up, I see many stars.
00:34:47 I daily meditate about his wisdom,
00:34:50 his power, what amazing things he is able to do.
00:34:57 This earth, this universe
00:35:00  —how amazingly well he cares for them!
00:35:04 He takes care of the smallest thing.
00:35:07 I completely rely on Jehovah,
00:35:11 and then I remember that Jehovah has the ability
00:35:16 to help us with his holy spirit.
00:35:20 He’s such a loving Father.
00:35:23 He’s always holding our hand tight,
00:35:28 and no one can separate us from him.
00:35:31 If anyone tries, they will fail.
00:35:38 He’s so generous with his love.
00:35:41 He’s so affectionate with us.
00:35:44 No one can take away the love Jehovah has for us.
00:35:51 Did you notice from Reeta’s experience
00:35:54 that Jehovah is with us in several ways?
00:35:58 Reeta really appreciates congregation meetings.
00:36:02 They love being with their brothers.
00:36:05 How about you?
00:36:06 Do you value the meetings
00:36:08 and the encouraging association you find there?
00:36:13 Reeta takes time to meditate on the wonders of creation,
00:36:18 and she does more than marvel at what she sees.
00:36:21 She notices how Jehovah’s love and care for her
00:36:25 is evident in all his works.
00:36:29 She knows that Jehovah has the power to create anything,
00:36:33 and he wants to use his power in her behalf.
00:36:37 It’s no surprise that Reeta is keenly aware
00:36:42 of Jehovah’s constant support in her pioneer ministry.
00:36:49 Jehovah proves to be with us in the ministry,
00:36:52 whether we’re preaching in our local community
00:36:55 or sharing in a special campaign.
00:36:57 Let’s go to Europe
00:36:59 and watch a report about a special campaign.
00:37:03 As with Reeta’s experience,
00:37:05 see if you can identify
00:37:07 how Jehovah was with the many thousands
00:37:11 who volunteered for this campaign.
00:37:15 In the Central Europe branch territory,
00:37:18 a special campaign was organized.
00:37:20 Actually, the School
00:37:22 for Branch Committee Members and Their Wives
00:37:24 triggered an evaluation of how much territory
00:37:27 in the countries we oversee is not really covered thoroughly.
00:37:32 So we asked our circuit overseers
00:37:34 to recommend to us which sections
00:37:37 of the congregation’s territory
00:37:39 could be listed as so-called “unassigned territory.”
00:37:42 All in all, we received over 11,000 territories
00:37:47 from the congregations, with approximately 3 million inhabitants.
00:37:52 So because of this grand scale, there was suddenly the idea,
00:37:55 ‘Why not organize a special preaching campaign
00:37:59 ‘to cover all these territories
00:38:01 on one single weekend?’
00:38:04 This was really exciting.
00:38:06 And after getting the Branch Committee’s approval,
00:38:08 the Service Department started to organize it.
00:38:12 To be honest, at first, we were not really sure
00:38:15 how the publishers would react to such a campaign.
00:38:18 But we fully trusted in Jehovah,
00:38:20 and the response was stunning.
00:38:22 Over 20,000 publishers participated
00:38:26 and were assigned to all these territories throughout Germany.
00:38:30 The campaign took place on one weekend in May 2017
00:38:34 and was especially successful in metropolitan areas,
00:38:37 as in Berlin, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf.
00:38:46 At one door, a man just arrived.
00:38:49 He wanted to open his shop where he sells Arabian specialties.
00:38:52 We were able to show him a video in Arabic.
00:38:56 Then he gave us his address and phone number.
00:38:59 He also agreed to have someone visit him again.
00:39:02 Yes, it’s really a privilege to join in such a campaign
00:39:06 and to see that every human is precious to Jehovah,
00:39:09 no matter where they live or where they come from.
00:39:12 Because of the need and the fantastic response in 2017,
00:39:16 it was decided to repeat such a campaign in May 2018.
00:39:21 And this time it was expanded to Switzerland,
00:39:24 Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein.
00:39:27 And now imagine,
00:39:29 over 32,000 publishers participated,
00:39:33 which is actually over 60 percent more
00:39:36 than in May 2017.
00:39:38 This was really faith-strengthening.
00:39:41 And, again, a lot of wonderful experiences were reported.
00:39:45 It’s incredible.
00:39:47 No matter where you are in Berlin,
00:39:49 you can see small groups of brothers everywhere.
00:39:52 That was really great.
00:39:54 In the ministry we met a woman, and she told us
00:39:56 that she had just prayed for a Bible study.
00:39:58 We are now more than ever convinced
00:40:00 that Jehovah leads all this work
00:40:02 through his angels.
00:40:04 Today, Sunday, we had a nice experience.
00:40:08 A woman called us from behind.
00:40:10 She had actually already passed us,
00:40:13 but she had the feeling she had to go back again
00:40:15 —she told us later.
00:40:20 After she had invited us to her home,
00:40:23 we exchanged our contact information
00:40:25 and we also filled in the online contact form.
00:40:30 Had we been in the territory just one minute later,
00:40:33 we would never have made the contact.
00:40:35 This must have been guided by the angels.
00:40:39 Yesterday morning while in the ministry,
00:40:41 a young man ran after us and asked us what we were doing.
00:40:44 We explained it to him.
00:40:46 He asked us why there is still so much evil in the world, then.
00:40:49 In the afternoon, we were able to call on him again.
00:40:51 We could start a Bible study right away
00:40:54 and arrange a return visit, which we will make today.
00:40:58 Being together with the friends is just so great.
00:41:01 You’re out and about with a large group.
00:41:03 You meet up again regularly
00:41:05 to change partners and to relate experiences.
00:41:08 It’s just great.
00:41:11 Thousands of videos were shown,
00:41:14 and a lot of Bible studies were started.
00:41:16 And what is very interesting is that a lot of publishers
00:41:19 felt motivated to expand their ministry after the campaign.
00:41:23 For sure, these preaching campaigns truly prove
00:41:26 that Jehovah and Jesus are directing the preaching work.
00:41:29 And the angels are helping us in reaching out to all people.
00:41:35 Yes, we really have a lot of reasons to be Jehovah’s happy people.
00:41:46 Jehovah truly proved to be
00:41:49 with all who volunteered to share in this campaign.
00:41:52 How else could the good news reach three million people
00:41:56 in such a well-organized way?
00:41:59 We’d like to thank the more than 32,000 brothers and sisters
00:42:04 who shared in this special work.
00:42:07 As Brother Lösch noted in his talk,
00:42:10 Jehovah is with us in the ministry.
00:42:14 There’s no doubt he is directing the global preaching work
00:42:18 through Jesus and his angels.
00:42:21 Did you notice how many people were contacted
00:42:24 soon after they prayed for a Bible study
00:42:26 or for a question to be answered?
00:42:29 Isn’t that interesting?
00:42:32 When we’re together with a large group of Jehovah’s people
00:42:36 in the ministry and at our meetings and assemblies,
00:42:40 we really feel Jehovah’s blessing, don’t we?
00:42:44 But what if we’re isolated?
00:42:46 What if we’re facing persecution?
00:42:49 This is what Alphonse Takla experienced some years ago in Egypt.
00:42:54 Let’s see how Jehovah proved to be with him.
00:43:03 All was dark;
00:43:05 everything was pitch-black dark.
00:43:10 Egypt was at war with Israel,
00:43:13 and they were arresting the brothers,
00:43:15 charging us of practicing illegal activities
00:43:19 as a banned organization.
00:43:22 On that night, we were being transferred
00:43:24 to the concentration camp.
00:43:29 We couldn’t see much.
00:43:34 “What’s going on there? What’s this place look like? Where is it?”
00:43:45 The officer got two soldiers to escort us
00:43:49 to our cell where the brothers were.
00:43:54 We knew that when people are taken to the concentration camp,
00:43:57 they spend years
00:44:00 and some of them never return back.
00:44:03 When I was, you know, a teenager,
00:44:06 I liked the characters in the Bible,
00:44:08 like Abraham,
00:44:11 Daniel,
00:44:14 Moses.
00:44:16 I thought that they were champions of true worship.
00:44:20 At some stage, I felt jealous of them.
00:44:23 They had this huge relationship with God,
00:44:27 so I’d like to be part of that.
00:44:30 I continued to read the Bible
00:44:33 to get closer to God.
00:44:35 I knew that Jehovah would look after me;
00:44:37 he would not abandon his servant.
00:44:40 So we tried to encourage them:
00:44:42 “Brothers, keep in mind
00:44:44 that we’re here because we worship Jehovah.”
00:44:48 We sat together to discuss, you know,
00:44:50 what we were going to do
00:44:53 to keep spiritually strong.
00:44:55 So we thought that we needed to pray.
00:44:58 We picked out a scripture every day, like a daily text,
00:45:02 and then after that, recited scriptures.
00:45:06 One would handle a talk from the memory of heart
00:45:10 and then an open discussion  of Bible questions.
00:45:14 At that stage, we didn’t have a Bible with us.
00:45:21 The officers wanted us to renounce our faith,
00:45:27 so they told me to lay on the ground,
00:45:30 and there they started to beat me.
00:45:33 The whole camp was around,
00:45:35 and one of the prisoners fainted.
00:45:38 I started to pray to Jehovah:
00:45:40 “Jehovah, help me to be able to endure that!”
00:45:43 It was very severe pain.
00:45:45 And I felt his help because after a few beatings,
00:45:48 my body felt numb.
00:45:50 I didn’t feel much more pain.
00:45:52 One of the prisoners said to me,
00:45:54 “If I get out of here alive,
00:45:57 “I’ll tell my children that in the concentration camp,
00:46:02 “I saw the Christians that reminded me  of the first-century Christians
00:46:07 —that they were happy even to die without renouncing their faith.”
00:46:12 One of the officers
00:46:14 —this nasty one that used to beat us very, very severely—
00:46:19 came one day and said,
00:46:21 “We need two of you to come out
00:46:23 and write a report about what you believe.”
00:46:27 So we thought about it: ‘Is it wise to do that?
00:46:30 Or maybe they will use it against us.’
00:46:32 You know, we prayed to Jehovah for help to make a decision here,
00:46:35 to guide us on what to do.
00:46:37 So in the end, we reached a point that,
00:46:40 well, we may get out; we may not.
00:46:43 So we might as well give them a witness.
00:46:48 I told the officer, “We need a Bible.”
00:46:51 And he said, “What for?”
00:46:52 I said to him, “Because we need to quote from the Bible in this report.”
00:46:58 So he said, “OK, do you have a Bible in the storeroom?”
00:47:02 I said, “Yes, I have a Bible.”
00:47:04 He said, “OK, go and get your Bible.”
00:47:11 I went to my bag and picked up the Bible.
00:47:23 So he picked up the Bible from my hand, opened it randomly, and started to read.
00:47:27 “Numbers.”
00:47:28 He looked at me. “Who wrote this book?”
00:47:31 I said to him, “Moses.”
00:47:33 “You’re a liar!” at the top of his voice.
00:47:37 So I kept quiet,
00:47:39 and he closed the book again
00:47:42 and opened it again.
00:47:49 “You’re a liar!” again at the top of his voice.
00:47:52 I was racing in my mind where it is written in the Bible
00:47:55 that Jehovah told Moses to write any of this.
00:48:00 He shut the book again, and for a third time,
00:48:02 opened it again, and he started to read in a loud voice.
00:48:13 So the officer looked at me with a big surprise on his face.
00:48:21 After we wrote the report,
00:48:24 I asked him, “Can we keep the Bible, please?”
00:48:26 He said, “OK, keep the Bible.”
00:48:30 For three months, nearly every day,
00:48:32 the officers came in and beat us
00:48:35 and expected us to compromise.
00:48:37 We never did that.
00:48:40 All I can say is that it was Jehovah’s hand.
00:48:42 Jehovah was helping us to endure
00:48:44 —to continue to do his will
00:48:47 by not compromising because we belong to him
00:48:49 and we rely on him.
00:48:55 God will not abandon his servant.
00:49:01 Why was Alphonse thrown into prison?
00:49:04 It wasn’t because he refused to say
00:49:07 a simple greeting to the president of his country.
00:49:10 No, that phrase was a political slogan.
00:49:13 Like many Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:49:16 Alphonse was persecuted for his neutrality.
00:49:20 What helped Alphonse to be loyal?
00:49:23 He prayed.
00:49:24 He prayed to maintain a strong spiritual routine,
00:49:27 he prayed when he had to make a decision,
00:49:30 and he prayed for help to endure brutal treatment.
00:49:35 Like Alphonse, do you depend on the power of prayer?
00:49:41 Alphonse and, earlier, Reeta
00:49:44 likened their relationship with Jehovah to holding His hand.
00:49:49 Reeta said, ‘Jehovah holds our hand tight.’
00:49:54 Alphonse said, “All I can say is that it was Jehovah’s hand.”
00:49:59 What a beautiful image!
00:50:02 That’s how close we can be to Jehovah.
00:50:06 This month’s music video reminds us of that.
00:50:11 Jehovah is always willing to hold our hand.
00:50:15 It’s entitled Jehovah’s Always by Our Side.
00:50:35 At times, I felt scared inside, Only looking for a place to hide.
00:50:41 The world made me feel different.  Now I hold my head up high.
00:50:49 He said he’d be my confidence, That he’d come to my defense.
00:50:55 His love I can’t deny,
00:51:00 ’Cause he gave me Courage when I was feeling weak,
00:51:06 Courage when I could not speak, Courage in my darkest night,
00:51:16 Courage to stand up tall, Courage to face it all,
00:51:23 Courage to trust him with my life. Jehovah’s always by my side.
00:51:31 He walks with me To help me see
00:51:38 His ways are always right. He’ll take my hand,
00:51:48 Help me understand It’s worth the sacrifice.
00:51:58 You are not alone. Even far away from home,
00:52:03 He’ll be your guide. He will pick you up
00:52:14 Even when you think you’ve had enough And make you strong and wise,
00:52:26 ’Cause he’ll give you Courage when you are feeling weak,
00:52:31 Courage when you cannot speak, Courage in your darkest nights,
00:52:40 Courage to stand up tall, Courage to face it all,
00:52:48 Courage to trust him with your life. Jehovah’s always by our side—
00:52:57 Always, always. Jehovah’s always by our side.
00:53:09 He walks with you and me To help us see
00:53:16 His ways are always right. Jehovah’s always by our side.
00:53:24 He’ll take our hand, Help us understand
00:53:30 It’s worth the sacrifice.
00:53:35 He gave me Courage when I was feeling weak,
00:53:40 Courage when I could not speak, Courage in my darkest night,
00:53:49 Courage to stand up tall, Courage to face it all,
00:53:57 Courage to trust him with my life. Jehovah’s always by our side—
00:54:06 Always, always. Jehovah’s always by our side—
00:54:20 Always, always. Jehovah’s always by our side.
00:54:39 What a beautiful song!
00:54:42 For many months on JW Broadcasting,
00:54:45 we’ve enjoyed a series of video dramatizations
00:54:49 about applying Bible principles in our lives.
00:54:53 We have learned that we can enjoy happier lives today
00:54:58 and live in a way that pleases God
00:55:00 when we apply Jehovah’s principles and standards.
00:55:04 Applying God’s principles also gives us a wonderful hope.
00:55:09 As our concluding video in this series shows,
00:55:13 focusing on our future hope
00:55:16 helps us to build the faith
00:55:18 to withstand trials we face today.
00:55:21 See if you remember these scenes.
00:55:34 Getting baptized
00:55:37 was the most important decision I ever made.
00:55:39 But it took some time to realize that
00:55:41 that was just the start of my Christian life.
00:55:44 Sometimes it was hard to show courage.
00:55:46 Why don’t you people get involved and make a real difference for once?
00:55:57 And it was hard for my son too.
00:55:59 No thanks.
00:56:00 I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, and I don’t celebrate birthdays.
00:56:03 What?
00:56:04 Hum?
00:56:05 That’s rude.
00:56:05 Come on, sign it!
00:56:06 I really liked Lucas,
00:56:08 and he was very sick.
00:56:11 I really wanted to sign his birthday card,
00:56:15 but Dad helped me to see how Jehovah felt about it,
00:56:19 and that helped me be brave.
00:56:22 I still didn’t sign the card,
00:56:25 but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.
00:56:35 My parents had always set a good example for me.
00:56:39 But after I moved to serve where the need was greater,
00:56:42 it seemed like my parents were growing apart.
00:56:46 Are you both doing OK?
00:56:48 Because you don’t look OK.
00:56:50 Of course, we’re OK.
00:56:51 OK? We’re doing wonderful, right?
00:56:53 Yeah, we’re doing good.
00:56:54 Everything is good.
00:56:56 I was really worried.
00:56:59 Later, they told me that what helped them
00:57:01 was their love for Jehovah.
00:57:04 They meditated on the example of Abraham and Sarah,
00:57:08 who showed honor to each other by listening and by caring.
00:57:12 That example really helped my parents.
00:57:15 And since then,
00:57:18 I’ve seen how it can help in any relationship.
00:57:23 I’m a long way from home, but showing love to others
00:57:28 —it helps me to stay happy in my assignment.
00:57:36 When our doctor told us that our baby
00:57:38 would likely be born with severe problems
00:57:41 and could even die,
00:57:44 it was more than I could bear.
00:57:49 And because my husband was not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:57:53 I needed God’s help more than ever
00:57:57 to calm my heart and help me explain why I could never have an abortion.
00:58:02 And even though it took me years
00:58:06 before I would agree to a Bible study
00:58:08 and even more years before I made enough changes to qualify for baptism,
00:58:14 the life we have now
00:58:16 —serving Jehovah together—
00:58:19 nothing could make me happier.
00:58:22 Nothing could make us happier.
00:58:26 Happiness really does come from serving Jehovah,
00:58:31 but serving him faithfully definitely takes courage.
00:58:36 It was so hard for me to turn down that girl at school.
00:58:41 And I felt so guilty for how involved I’d gotten with her.
00:58:47 My uncle used the Bible to help me get back on track
00:58:50 and to remind me of two other very important things:
00:58:54 that Jehovah was proud of me and that I was not alone.
00:59:00 James 1:2, 3 says:
00:59:03 “Consider it all joy, my brothers,
00:59:05 “when you meet with various trials,
00:59:07 “knowing as you do
00:59:09 “that this tested quality of your faith
00:59:12 produces endurance.”
00:59:16 I think about that scripture a lot
00:59:18 because soon I’ll probably be sent
00:59:20 to prison for refusing military service.
00:59:24 Being courageous with that classmate
00:59:26 helped me build the faith and courage that I need now.
00:59:30 I can give up anything for Jehovah.
00:59:33 I might live in a small cell for now,
00:59:37 but in Paradise, I’m going to travel everywhere.
00:59:42 Sometimes I get lonely, but that’s OK.
00:59:45 It’s a choice that I’ve made to stay in my assignment right now.
00:59:50 In the future, if I choose to get married,
00:59:53 I hope to have a marriage like my parents.
01:00:00 I really hope that Lucas is resurrected so I can show him around Paradise
01:00:04 and teach him more about Jehovah.
01:00:06 I showed him pictures,
01:00:08 but the real thing will be so much better.
01:00:12 Then I can hold my baby girl again.
01:00:20 Our program  has focused on the many ways
01:00:23 that Jehovah is with us.
01:00:26 He’s with us as we work toward dedication
01:00:30 and baptism.
01:00:32 He’s with us at our congregation meetings
01:00:36 and when we are with our spiritual family.
01:00:40 He’s with us as we successfully face
01:00:43 persecution and hardship.
01:00:46 And Jehovah is with us
01:00:48 when we share the good news of his Kingdom
01:00:51 with everyone we meet.
01:00:54 And, Brother Marais,
01:00:56 I appreciate that you were here with me
01:00:59 for this month’s program.
01:01:01 Thank you, Brother Lösch.
01:01:03 We end this month’s program
01:01:05 with a visit to our brothers and sisters in Tenerife.
01:01:09 Tenerife is the largest of the Canary Islands,
01:01:12 an archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa.
01:01:17 These islands were formed by volcanic eruptions.
01:01:21 The highest point
01:01:23 is the dormant Teide volcano on Tenerife.
01:01:29 Here the weather is mild and sunny throughout the year.
01:01:35 This has made the Canary Islands famous for their extensive banana plantations.
01:01:43 Tenerife is a popular tourist destination.
01:01:46 It’s home to nearly a million people,
01:01:49 but more than ten million visitors
01:01:52 come every year to enjoy the beaches,
01:01:56 the lush terrain,
01:01:58 and the food.
01:02:01 The island of Tenerife has 33 congregations
01:02:04 and more than 3,000 publishers,
01:02:09 492 of whom are regular pioneers.
01:02:14 Because of the influx of visitors from all over the world,
01:02:19 our brothers and sisters preach in over 15 languages,
01:02:23 including Russian,
01:02:27 German,
01:02:30 French,
01:02:32 Hindi,
01:02:35 and Romanian.
01:02:38 They preach everywhere
01:02:41 —in the cities as well as the rural and mountainous regions.
01:02:46 Our brothers and sisters in Tenerife
01:02:49 send you their warm Christian love and greetings.
01:02:55 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:02:58 this is JW Broadcasting.

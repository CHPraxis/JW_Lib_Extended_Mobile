00:00:01 Welcome to the June 2019 program of JW Broadcasting.
00:00:25 Earlier this year,
00:00:26 56 students from all over the world
00:00:29 gathered to attend
00:00:30 the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.
00:00:33 They enjoyed a 20-week course that gifted them
00:00:36 with an in-depth study of the Bible.
00:00:39 The aim of Gilead schooling
00:00:41 is to help strengthen the faith of each of the students
00:00:45 so that they in turn can strengthen the brothers in their respective assignments.
00:00:50 On March 9 of this year,
00:00:52 the graduation program for the 146th class
00:00:56 was held at the Watchtower Educational Center
00:00:59 in Patterson, New York.
00:01:01 You’ll now enjoy faith-strengthening talks
00:01:04 that were delivered during the first part
00:01:07 of the Gilead graduation program.
00:01:10 Well, we’re happy to be here today
00:01:12 for this graduation of the 146th class of Gilead,
00:01:17 and we welcome all who are tied in with us
00:01:20 at our Bethel complexes in the United States,
00:01:23 in Canada, in Puerto Rico,
00:01:26 and in a number of remote translation offices.
00:01:29 We especially welcome our Gilead students
00:01:32 who are about to graduate from this marvelous school.
00:01:36 And we welcome your dear family members
00:01:39 and friends who are joining you on this very, very special day.
00:01:44 You seem excited, and you should be.
00:01:47 We’re happy. We’re very, very happy for you.
00:01:50 Now, throughout your schooling, you’ve been asked to draw out principles
00:01:54 from many different Bible accounts, haven’t you?
00:01:58 With that in mind, here’s the theme of our introductory comments:
00:02:03 “Do You See the Point and Remember the Purpose?”
00:02:08 We’re going to illustrate what we mean
00:02:11 by looking at Luke 5:1-11.
00:02:15 This is the account where some of Jesus’ disciples
00:02:19 chose to leave everything behind and follow him.
00:02:23 Here’s the setting:
00:02:25 Some of Jesus’ disciples were fishermen
00:02:28 who had followed Jesus for a time,
00:02:31 but then they went back to their fishing business.
00:02:34 Jesus sought to reach their hearts
00:02:36 and move them to follow him fully.
00:02:39 So, what did he do?
00:02:41 He used a powerful object lesson
00:02:45 that provided a point and a purpose.
00:02:48 Let’s read it at Luke 5:1-11,
00:02:55 and look for the point, first of all, behind what Jesus did here.
00:03:00 It says: “On one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him
00:03:05 “and listening to the word of God,
00:03:07 “he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
00:03:10 “And he saw two boats docked at the lakeside,
00:03:13 “but the fishermen had got out of them and were washing off their nets.
00:03:17 “Going aboard one of the boats, which was Simon’s,
00:03:21 “he asked him to pull away a bit from land.
00:03:23 “Then he sat down, and he began teaching the crowds from the boat.
00:03:28 “When he stopped speaking, he said to Simon:
00:03:31 “‘Pull out to where it is deep, and let down your nets for a catch.’
00:03:36 “But in reply Simon said:
00:03:38 “‘Instructor, we toiled all night and caught nothing,
00:03:42 “but at your word I will lower the nets.’
00:03:45 “Well, when they did this, they caught a great number of fish.
00:03:49 “In fact, their nets began ripping apart.
00:03:52 “So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them,
00:03:56 “and they came and filled both boats, so that these began to sink.
00:04:01 “Seeing this, Simon Peter fell down at the knees of Jesus,
00:04:05 “saying: ‘Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinful man.’
00:04:09 “For both he and those with him were overwhelmed with astonishment
00:04:14 “at the catch of fish they had taken,
00:04:16 “and the same was true of both James and John, Zebedee’s sons,
00:04:21 “who were partners with Simon.
00:04:23 “But Jesus said to Simon:
00:04:25 “‘Stop being afraid.
00:04:27 “From now on you will be catching men alive.’
00:04:30 “So they brought the boats back to land
00:04:33 and abandoned everything and followed him.”
00:04:38 So, what was the point
00:04:41 behind this miracle here?
00:04:44 What was this?
00:04:46 Their needs would be cared for
00:04:48 if they trusted in Jesus and followed him.
00:04:52 Of course, to do this, they had to believe Jesus, didn’t they?
00:04:56 They had to listen to him.
00:04:57 This was not a trick.
00:04:59 With their own eyes, they could see that catch of fish
00:05:02 and then deduce that their needs would, in fact, be cared for by Jesus.
00:05:07 That was the point.
00:05:09 Did they get it?
00:05:10 Yes, they did.
00:05:12 With what result?
00:05:13 Well, it says that they were moved to abandon everything
00:05:16 and follow Jesus
00:05:19 —that is, everything related to the fishing business.
00:05:21 They gave it all up and followed him.
00:05:24 Almost instantly, their faith and trust in Jesus grew, didn’t it?
00:05:30 Now, let’s bring the point up to our day.
00:05:33 Soon you will go to your assignments.
00:05:36 Will you remember the point of your Gilead training?
00:05:40 Well, what is the point?
00:05:42 The point has been to build up your faith
00:05:45 and your trust in Jehovah
00:05:47 and thereby strengthen your relationship with him.
00:05:50 In turn, as you draw steadily closer to Jehovah,
00:05:54 you will be ready for whatever work
00:05:56 and whatever responsibility he chooses to place on you.
00:06:01 Jehovah, by means of his Son, will care for you.
00:06:04 He will help you to faithfully fulfill your assignments,
00:06:07 and you will add to his glory.
00:06:10 And in all that you do,
00:06:12 remember those disciples who were humble enough to get the point
00:06:16 —abandon everything and follow Jesus.
00:06:21 Now, for the second part of the question we mentioned at the beginning,
00:06:25 What was the purpose behind what Jesus did?
00:06:28 In other words, Jesus’ miracle on that day
00:06:32 carried what deeper meaning for them?
00:06:35 Well, looking back at Luke chapter 5,
00:06:38 what happened when the disciples listened to Jesus,
00:06:42 went out to where the water was deep,
00:06:44 and lowered their nets?
00:06:46 The catch was so great that it says
00:06:49 they filled two boats to the point of sinking.
00:06:52 The account doesn’t say what the disciples did with the fish,
00:06:56 but they made it to shore.
00:06:58 A man who could walk on water was not going to let them sink.
00:07:02 Now, we get, though, to the greater purpose behind Jesus’ miracle.
00:07:07 Do you recall what Jesus said to the disciples
00:07:11 after that catch of fish
00:07:13 and after the disciples became filled with astonishment?
00:07:17 He told them: “Stop being afraid.
00:07:21 From now on you will be catching men alive.”
00:07:25 You see, by means of that miracle,
00:07:28 Jesus illustrated something greater for them, didn’t he?
00:07:33 They would not only be cared for materially
00:07:35 (they got that point)
00:07:37 but, more importantly, they would also become
00:07:40 very successful fishers of men.
00:07:44 In other words, the first miracle
00:07:46 pointed to an even greater one yet to come.
00:07:50 If their large catch was meant to illustrate
00:07:54 how successful they would be as fishers of men,
00:07:58 then they could look back on that catch years later
00:08:02 and visualize those boats filled with fish
00:08:05 and be reminded that they had much work yet to do
00:08:08 in being fishers of men
00:08:11 —“catching men alive,” so to speak, and helping them to become disciples of Christ.
00:08:17 Your Gilead training will help you to continue supporting
00:08:22 this vital and never-to-be-repeated work,
00:08:24 which is the greater purpose behind your training.
00:08:28 So, then, whatever you’re given to do and wherever your training may take you,
00:08:33 never forget the point and the purpose behind the blessing
00:08:37 that you just experienced in being part of this class.
00:08:41 Trust in Jehovah and in his Son to help you at all times,
00:08:46 and use your Gilead training  to support this important work
00:08:50 in the branches and the territories where you will serve.
00:08:55 Well, we’ll say a little bit more about this
00:08:57 at the conclusion of our program today.
00:09:01 Now we’re going to enjoy a series of very encouraging talks
00:09:05 that will strengthen your faith, build up your trust,
00:09:08 (in fact, for all of us listening in)
00:09:11 and highlight God’s wonderful purpose
00:09:13 that we support.
00:09:15 To begin, we’re very happy to have with us
00:09:19 a member of the Governing Body, Brother David Splane,
00:09:21 who is going to present the talk
00:09:24 “If You Look for It, You Will Find It.”
00:09:43 If you look for it,
00:09:46 you will find it.
00:09:49 Look for what?
00:09:51 Look for the good in your brothers.
00:09:56 And when you find it,
00:09:58 don’t be afraid to acknowledge it.
00:10:02 Now, we all know that we should do that,
00:10:05 but we do have to fight the tendency
00:10:08 to view others a bit critically at times.
00:10:11 Sometimes we question their motives,
00:10:14 maybe because we’re just a little bit jealous.
00:10:20 Now, think about that brother in your congregation
00:10:23 who is just an excellent public speaker.
00:10:27 When he is scheduled to give a talk, the hall is full.
00:10:30 And everybody raves about his talks,
00:10:33 even your wife
00:10:37 —yours, not so much.
00:10:42 ‘The show-off; he doesn’t impress me.’
00:10:46 Or what about this:
00:10:48 You’re working in a department with one of those annoying people
00:10:52 who is very efficient.
00:10:56 He’s never late,
00:10:58 he never misses a day’s work,
00:11:00 he gets a tremendous amount done in a day,
00:11:04 and he almost never makes a mistake.
00:11:08 ‘That doesn’t impress me either.
00:11:10 Mr. Perfect, he’s trying to make the rest of us look bad.’
00:11:14 Well, there we go questioning  someone’s motives.
00:11:19 Now, can we look for the good in Mr. Perfect?
00:11:24 Can we, see, give him the benefit of the doubt?
00:11:28 Maybe his parents trained him
00:11:32 to offer the very best gift he could to Jehovah.
00:11:36 In other words, if he could do more,
00:11:38 he was expected to do more,
00:11:41 because he wanted his gift
00:11:43 to be the very best gift that he could possibly give.
00:11:46 Now, come to think of it, he never criticizes your gift to Jehovah.
00:11:50 He just wants to give his very best gift to Jehovah.
00:11:55 That’s the way he approached the pioneer ministry,
00:11:58 and that’s the way he approaches his Bethel service.
00:12:01 So, now, what do you do with Mr. Perfect?
00:12:04 Do you tell him to slow down?
00:12:06 “You’re making the rest of us look bad.”
00:12:09 Well, if he did that, he’d be giving a substandard gift to Jehovah,
00:12:14 and Jehovah expects and deserves the very best.
00:12:19 So, what do you do?
00:12:21 You acknowledge his gift.
00:12:24 “You really get a lot done in a day;
00:12:26 I wish I had your stamina.”
00:12:29 And what about Mr. Show-off, the outstanding speaker?
00:12:33 “Jehovah has given you a wonderful gift.
00:12:36 You use it well.”
00:12:39 Now, was that hard?
00:12:41 Elders occasionally have to evaluate brothers for privileges of service.
00:12:46 And while we’re not blind to the shortcomings of our brothers,
00:12:49 we try to keep the discussion mainly positive.
00:12:53 Now, sometimes we have to discuss a shortcoming—a negative.
00:12:57 But are we talking about one isolated incident,
00:13:01 or is it a pattern?
00:13:03 It’s true that if we make it a habit to look on the positive side,
00:13:07 we’ll be disappointed sometimes.
00:13:09 But it’s better to be disappointed occasionally
00:13:12 than to develop a cynical or resentful attitude
00:13:17 toward our brothers.
00:13:19 Let’s consider a Scriptural example
00:13:21 where questioning the motives of a brother
00:13:24 could have led to disaster.
00:13:27 It’s in 1 Samuel chapter 17
00:13:31 —and a little bit of background, a little bit of the setting—
00:13:35 Jesse has sent his youngest son, David,
00:13:40 to visit his three oldest brothers in the army,
00:13:43 and Israel is having a face-off with the Philistines.
00:13:47 And when he arrives, David hears Goliath
00:13:51 challenge any man of the house of Israel
00:13:53 to a battle to the death.
00:13:55 There are no volunteers.
00:13:58 David is a man of faith, and he can’t believe it.
00:14:02 He says: “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine
00:14:05 that he should taunt the battle line[s] of the living [true] God?”
00:14:09 Now, his oldest brother, Eliab, is listening,
00:14:12 and we pick up the account in verse 28.
00:14:15 So that’s 1 Samuel chapter 17,
00:14:18 and we’ll read verse 28:
00:14:20 “When his oldest brother Eliab heard him speak to the men,
00:14:25 “he became [very] angry with David and said:
00:14:27 “‘Why have you come down?
00:14:29 “‘And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?
00:14:32 “‘I well know your presumptuousness
00:14:35 “‘and the bad intentions of your heart;
00:14:38 you came down just to see the battle.’”
00:14:43 Now, what did we learn about Eliab’s personality from this verse?
00:14:51 Not much.
00:14:54 You recognize that as a trick question.
00:14:57 We just met the man, we don’t know very much about him,
00:15:01 and we certainly aren’t going to pass judgment on somebody
00:15:05 over one isolated incident, are we?
00:15:08 Now the question is this:
00:15:10 Was this a one-off for Eliab, or was he always like that?
00:15:15 Was this an isolated incident, or was it a pattern?
00:15:20 When analyzing the situation, ask yourself this,
00:15:24 ‘Was there ever an occasion
00:15:26 ‘when I got so frustrated with my fleshly brother
00:15:30 ‘that I said something awful,
00:15:33 something that I had to apologize for later?’
00:15:36 Well, did that make you a terrible person?
00:15:39 So the question is: Is this a one-off?
00:15:41 Is it isolated, or is it a pattern?
00:15:43 These are things that we really need to apply
00:15:45 when it comes to our relations with our brothers and sisters.
00:15:48 Don’t write somebody off on the basis of one incident.
00:15:53 Well, we can say that on this occasion, Eliab was wrong.
00:15:57 He questioned David’s motives, and he wasn’t nice about it.
00:16:02 But that’s not the worst of it.
00:16:04 Suppose that David had listened to Eliab saying,
00:16:07 ‘Slow down, you’re making the rest of us look bad.’
00:16:11 What might have happened?
00:16:13 Suppose David had said: ‘You’re right, Eliab.
00:16:16 ‘I am a bit arrogant.
00:16:18 Who do I think I am that I could fight this mighty man of war?’
00:16:22 Well, that could have had disastrous consequences for Israel,
00:16:26 at least temporarily.
00:16:28 So, what’s the lesson?
00:16:30 Don’t discourage anyone from giving their best to Jehovah,
00:16:35 even if their best is better than your best.
00:16:39 Now, let’s take another isolated incident from the life of Eliab
00:16:43 and say something positive about the man.
00:16:46 Let’s look for the good in Eliab.
00:16:49 First Samuel 22
00:16:54 —1 Samuel 22:1,
00:17:02 it says: “So David went from there,
00:17:05 “escaping to the cave of Adullam.
00:17:07 “[So David is running away from Saul.]
00:17:10 “When his brothers
00:17:13 “and his father’s entire house heard of it,
00:17:17 “they went down there to him
00:17:20 [his brothers, including Eliab].”
00:17:24 So, what’s the point?
00:17:26 Well, when he was needed, Eliab was there for him.
00:17:29 He could be counted on.
00:17:31 And later, one of David’s sons married one of Eliab’s daughters.
00:17:37 Oh, wait a minute, say that again.
00:17:40 David ran away from Saul?
00:17:44 He didn’t run away from Goliath, did he?
00:17:48 But he ran away from Saul.
00:17:50 Jehovah’s spirit must have indicated
00:17:53 when David should stand and fight
00:17:56 and when he should run and hide.
00:18:00 Sounds like material for another talk.
00:18:04 Well, it’ll help our blood pressure
00:18:07 if we can learn to give a positive spin
00:18:09 to potentially negative situations.
00:18:12 Maybe you’ve run into this.
00:18:14 You’re walking down the hallway following closely behind someone.
00:18:19 He goes through the door and lets the door slam right in your face.
00:18:25 Is he self-centered or just lost in thought?
00:18:30 How do you choose to characterize that incident?
00:18:34 Is the public speaker a show-off,
00:18:37 or on this occasion is he simply trying a bit too hard to be enthusiastic?
00:18:43 Is the brother being picky, or is he trying to be thorough?
00:18:48 standoffish and proud or just shy?
00:18:53 Now, one day, some of you brothers are going to have positions of responsibility,
00:18:57 and you’re going to be dealing with people.
00:19:00 And when that happens, remember this:
00:19:04 Many joys are denied those who keep looking for mistakes,
00:19:09 but the one who sees the good in others
00:19:13 will have “a feast constantly.”
00:19:16 Remember that!
00:19:18 And may Jehovah bless you richly.
00:19:20 We love you.
00:19:31 Well, we thank you very, very much for that encouraging talk, Brother Splane.
00:19:36 Now we have a member  of the U.S. Branch Committee
00:19:39 with us to deliver the talk
00:19:41 “He Causes to Become.”
00:19:43 Brother Troy Snyder will do this for us.
00:19:48 Well, as Gilead graduates, you’re being sent out
00:19:52 to strengthen and stabilize Jehovah’s precious sheep.
00:19:57 And you’re being sent out
00:20:00 on the threshold of the great tribulation.
00:20:04 Now, what one scripture will strengthen
00:20:09 and stabilize you so you can help others?
00:20:13 Well, here’s a clue:
00:20:15 What truth did Jehovah reveal to fortify the Israelites
00:20:19 right before they were to be delivered from Egypt?
00:20:23 Let’s turn our Bibles to Exodus chapter 3,
00:20:27 and let’s notice what truth Jehovah revealed.
00:20:29 You remember the account?
00:20:31 Moses was asking Jehovah,
00:20:34 ‘What can I tell the Israelites
00:20:37 so that they will have confidence in your deliverance?’
00:20:40 In essence, that’s what he was asking Jehovah.
00:20:42 Notice what Jehovah said to fortify them in verse 14:
00:20:46 “So God said to Moses:
00:20:48 “‘I Will Become What I Choose to Become.’
00:20:52 “And he added:  ‘This is what you are to say to the Israelites,
00:20:56 “I Will Become has sent me to you.”’”
00:21:01 That fortified the Israelites.
00:21:05 They understood that Jehovah was saying,
00:21:07 ‘I’ll be whatever is necessary to carry out my will.’
00:21:12 And according to Appendix A in our New World Translation,
00:21:17 it appears that the name also means
00:21:20 “He Causes to Become”
00:21:23 or “He Causes His Creation (you and me) to Become”
00:21:26 whatever is needed to carry out his will.
00:21:29 And doesn’t that harmonize with who Jehovah is?
00:21:32 We know him as the Creator, don’t we?
00:21:35 He’s created us.
00:21:36 He brought about this universe.
00:21:38 He is the God who causes to become.
00:21:42 You see, this truth —this extraordinary truth—
00:21:46 can strengthen and stabilize you
00:21:50 because it links you
00:21:53 to something that Jehovah is willing to give you.
00:21:57 Let’s look at what that is.
00:21:58 Let’s go to Jeremiah chapter 10.
00:22:05 You see, this aspect of Jehovah’s name
00:22:09 reveals something about his personality
00:22:12 and something that he’s willing to share with you.
00:22:14 Notice what it is in verse 6, Jeremiah 10:6.
00:22:17 It says: “No one is like you, O Jehovah.
00:22:21 “You are great,
00:22:23 “and your name
00:22:25 is great and mighty.”
00:22:29 Yes, Jehovah’s name is linked to his power.
00:22:33 That’s what it reveals about Jehovah.
00:22:35 And Jehovah is willing to use his power to strengthen us.
00:22:40 See, it was Jehovah’s power that caused the Red Sea to part.
00:22:43 It was Jehovah’s power that made the sun stand still when Joshua was in battle.
00:22:48 It was Jehovah’s power that caused a bird to feed Elijah.
00:22:53 It was Jehovah’s power
00:22:56 that took a tired prophet who was exhausted
00:22:59 and made him run faster than a racing chariot.
00:23:02 Isn’t that reassuring —to know that Jehovah is saying,
00:23:05 ‘I’m going to give you my power’?
00:23:08 Because oftentimes we’re exhausted
00:23:11 and we may feel like we’re unraveling.
00:23:14 But Jehovah is saying, ‘I love you so much
00:23:17 that I’m going to give you  the power you need to accomplish my will.’
00:23:23 You can see why Satan and Jehovah’s enemies
00:23:26 have tried to hide Jehovah’s name
00:23:28 —not just because it identified Him,
00:23:30 but because they wanted to obscure the power that that name has
00:23:33 and what it means to us and how it strengthens us.
00:23:37 But you know what else it also does?
00:23:40 It comforts us.
00:23:42 It can reassure our hearts.
00:23:46 It can allay our fears.
00:23:49 Notice how it did this with one of Jehovah’s servants.
00:23:52 Let’s go back over to Jeremiah chapter 1.
00:23:57 Remember Jeremiah?
00:23:59 He was commissioned with a very difficult assignment,
00:24:02 representing Jehovah.
00:24:04 And what did Jeremiah express to Jehovah?
00:24:07 He said: “I am but a boy.”
00:24:08 It was like he was saying: ‘Jehovah, I’m inexperienced.
00:24:11 ‘I know I have a spiritual foundation you’ve given me; you’ve trained me.
00:24:14 But I don’t know if I can handle this; I’m afraid.’
00:24:18 What did Jehovah say to him to fortify him?
00:24:20 What did Jehovah cause him to become?
00:24:22 Notice verse 18, Jeremiah 1:18.
00:24:28 It says: “For today I have made you a fortified city,
00:24:33 “an iron pillar,
00:24:35 “and copper walls against all the land,
00:24:39 “toward the kings of Judah and her princes,
00:24:42 toward her priests and the people of the land.”
00:24:45 “A fortified city”
00:24:47 —see, Jehovah says: ‘I will strengthen you.
00:24:49 ‘I’ll make you like that iron pillar.
00:24:51 I’ll give you that inner strength you need to carry out your assignment.’
00:24:56 But “copper walls”
00:24:58 —what was significant about copper walls?
00:25:02 Well, it might be how Jehovah created copper.
00:25:06 What can copper do?
00:25:08 Copper at very high temperature will not buckle,
00:25:13 will not warp, will not lose its strength.
00:25:17 See, it’s as if Jehovah is saying,
00:25:20 ‘Jeremiah, I will make it so you can take the heat.’
00:25:25 And that’s what Jehovah is doing for you.
00:25:27 He will make it
00:25:29 —make you— possible to handle any situation.
00:25:32 And you notice those were copper walls —they fortified him.
00:25:35 They surrounded the city.
00:25:37 It’s as if mentally, emotionally, spiritually,
00:25:40 and physically Jehovah would give him
00:25:42 whatever was needed to carry out his assignment.
00:25:47 Now, that fortified Jeremiah!
00:25:50 Could you imagine how Jeremiah may have drawn upon this
00:25:53 as he dealt with challenges?
00:25:56 For example, when he was persecuted,
00:25:58 he was put in stocks.
00:26:00 Now, that’s torture; that’s a form of torture.
00:26:04 Could you imagine Jeremiah’s prayer,
00:26:07 ‘Jehovah, cause me to become what I need to become
00:26:10 to stay faithful to you’?
00:26:13 Now, did Jehovah block the pain?
00:26:15 We don’t know.
00:26:16 But what we do know is
00:26:18 that Jeremiah stayed faithful.
00:26:20 This experience did not break his will,
00:26:23 did not break his spirit, nor did it break his integrity.
00:26:27 Or how about the time when Jeremiah
00:26:30 had to go in front of the temple
00:26:32 and in front of the priests and the leaders
00:26:34 and had to tell them that their precious temple
00:26:36 was going to be destroyed?
00:26:37 And he had to illustrate it
00:26:38 by slamming that clay vessel on the ground
00:26:41 and watching it shatter.
00:26:43 Could you imagine Jeremiah’s prayer?
00:26:45 ‘Jehovah, help me become
00:26:47 ‘what I need to to deliver this message.
00:26:49 ‘Give me the poise.
00:26:50 ‘Give me the courage.
00:26:51 Help me have that inner strength to do so.’
00:26:55 And Jehovah did.
00:26:57 Jehovah was with Jeremiah time and time again.
00:27:03 Yes, the very name of Jehovah
00:27:07 makes it clear that you will succeed.
00:27:10 You will be able to carry out his will.
00:27:14 And you’ve been doing that.
00:27:17 In your introductions to the family,
00:27:20 we heard how Jehovah was causing you to become.
00:27:24 For example, one of you talked about how as a young girl
00:27:28 you and your sister were asked to leave the family home
00:27:32 because of your relationship with Jehovah.
00:27:34 What happened?
00:27:36 Jehovah caused you and others around you
00:27:40 —your brothers and sisters—
00:27:41 to become what was necessary to keep you close to Jehovah.
00:27:46 One of you related how you were on a theocratic construction expansion project
00:27:50 and you were assigned to cut brick in the heat with all your gear on.
00:27:57 You said you maintained your joy.
00:27:59 Why?
00:28:00 Because Jehovah caused you to become.
00:28:04 One of you dear ones related to us
00:28:06 how you had thought your service to Jehovah had no value to him.
00:28:12 You had lost your joy.
00:28:14 But what happened?
00:28:16 Jehovah caused someone to encourage you,
00:28:20 to strengthen you.
00:28:22 And one of you related how Jehovah
00:28:24 helped you serve beyond the capacity of your heart.
00:28:30 Yes, Jehovah has caused all of you
00:28:33 to become what is necessary to carry out his will.
00:28:38 So whenever you feel discouraged, whenever you feel afraid,
00:28:41 whenever you feel unqualified,
00:28:44 pray to Jehovah.
00:28:46 Ask him to help you become what is necessary to carry out his will.
00:28:50 Ask him to help you do whatever you need
00:28:54 so you can glorify his name.
00:29:00 Consider: When did Jehovah reveal
00:29:04 this truth to the Israelites?
00:29:07 It was right before they were about to face challenges.
00:29:12 When did Jehovah reveal this truth to us?
00:29:17 It was really with the revision of the New World Translation.
00:29:22 It really helped bring it into focus —the power of his name—
00:29:25 really, right before we are to be ushered
00:29:27 into Jehovah’s new world.
00:29:31 So, what trials will you face?
00:29:33 What challenges will you experience?
00:29:37 What will the great tribulation bring?
00:29:40 It doesn’t matter
00:29:42 because you worship Jehovah.
00:29:44 That’s his name —the God who causes to become.
00:30:00 Well, we deeply appreciate that very fine talk, Brother Snyder.
00:30:05 Now we have Brother Donald Gordon,
00:30:07 who serves as a helper to the Publishing Committee,
00:30:10 with us to deliver the talk
00:30:12 “Live in Sync With Jehovah.”
00:30:17 Well, for the last five months you dear students
00:30:19 have been downloading a lot of wonderful information about Jehovah.
00:30:24 Now that the class has finished, the download is complete
00:30:28 —all synced up.
00:30:30 Well, it may seem that way for the moment.
00:30:33 Of course,  Jehovah did not create us like simple computers
00:30:37 where we just store away information in our memories.
00:30:40 We were created “in his image.”
00:30:43 So as we take in knowledge from Jehovah,
00:30:46 we have the ability to absorb it and then to reflect his image
00:30:51 —to think like him, to feel like him.
00:30:54 We begin to act like him.
00:30:58 So he has given us what we have here in his Word,
00:31:02 and he as well created us
00:31:04 in our human capacity to assimilate his Word
00:31:08 into the beautiful facets of his image,
00:31:11 and then we can truly be in sync with Jehovah.
00:31:16 But how does our being in sync with Jehovah
00:31:19 bring honor to him and joy to him?
00:31:23 Well, when we think of the various ones who are in sync with Jehovah,
00:31:27 no doubt the foremost example is Jesus Christ.
00:31:31 Everything he did, everything he said,
00:31:35 every thought he had was in full harmony with his Father.
00:31:40 Jesus said: “I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative.”
00:31:44 Sometimes it’s like a husband and wife
00:31:48 who’ve been married a number of years.
00:31:50 With just a glance, without a word, they know what the other one is thinking.
00:31:54 They’re in sync.
00:31:56 Or perhaps you’re thinking of two ice skaters
00:31:58 flowing across the ice as one, in unison.
00:32:03 Well, one example of Jehovah and Jesus
00:32:06 working in unison, in sync,
00:32:08 is when the woman with the flow of blood was cured
00:32:11 by just touching the fringe of Jesus’ garment
00:32:14 —one of our favorite miracles.
00:32:16 Recall that scene again, recorded here
00:32:19 at Mark 5:29, 30
00:32:24 —Mark 5:29.
00:32:27 The woman has made her way through the crowd;
00:32:29 she touches the garment, and then in verse 29:
00:32:32 “Immediately her flow of blood dried up,
00:32:35 “and she sensed in her body that she had been healed
00:32:39 “of the grievous sickness.
00:32:41 “Immediately Jesus realized in himself
00:32:45 “that power had gone out of him,
00:32:47 “and he turned around in the crowd and asked:
00:32:50 ‘Who touched my outer garments?’”
00:32:53 Well, that moment when that woman sensed that she was cured,
00:32:57 Jehovah and Jesus were working in complete harmony.
00:33:01 Actually, until that moment, Jesus may have been unaware
00:33:04 that Jehovah was watching this woman with a desire to heal her.
00:33:10 I suppose that Jehovah could have just cured the woman on his own,
00:33:14 as it were, without Jesus even knowing.
00:33:17 But no, he chose to work through his Son,
00:33:22 who he knew was working in harmony with him.
00:33:26 So when Jesus felt the power go out from him,
00:33:30 he naturally wanted to know who was cured
00:33:33 —‘Who did my Father see that I did not see?’—
00:33:36 because they were working together in harmony.
00:33:38 And then seeing this woman, realizing that actually she was unclean
00:33:42 and where she did not belong,
00:33:44 Jesus was still in complete agreement with his Father.
00:33:47 He was in sync with Jehovah’s view of this woman
00:33:50 and very happy to have been involved in the cure of her
00:33:54 —leaving us, of course,  with one of our favorite accounts of Jesus’ life.
00:34:00 Well, what’s a lesson for us?
00:34:03 Whether we are at our work assignments,
00:34:05 in our congregations, or out in the ministry,
00:34:08 we want to be in sync with how Jehovah views other people.
00:34:13 We often tend to view others through our own eyes.
00:34:17 This can be clouded by our own human concerns and viewpoints,
00:34:20 perhaps tainted by some misunderstandings
00:34:23 or misconceptions or wrong information
00:34:27 or perhaps our need to be a little more forgiving.
00:34:31 You see, if any of those feelings are tainting our judgment
00:34:35 or relationships even in a small way,
00:34:38 to that degree we are out of sync with Jehovah.
00:34:42 Jesus and Jehovah were focused on this woman’s faith:
00:34:46 “Your faith has made you well.
00:34:48 Go in peace.”
00:34:50 Well, let us in every situation
00:34:53 strive to see others as Jehovah sees them.
00:34:57 This brings honor to Jehovah
00:34:59 and allows him to use us in harmony with his will.
00:35:04 Now, there was another situation where being in sync with his Father
00:35:08 took more time and effort.
00:35:11 When Jesus chose his 12 apostles, he, of course,
00:35:14 wanted to be in harmony with his Father,
00:35:17 but this did not happen with just a glance.
00:35:20 Of course, Jesus had a very deep,  intimate knowledge of Jehovah.
00:35:25 And these men that he was considering —he knew them well.
00:35:29 Still, this decision took hours of prayer
00:35:33 to arrive at the 12 apostles selected.
00:35:37 So it will be in performing your work
00:35:39 and making decisions in your assignments
00:35:42 —you cannot simply rely on your knowledge of the Scriptures,
00:35:46 as deep as it may be.
00:35:48 To make decisions, we must implore Jehovah in our prayers
00:35:53 —maybe many prayers—
00:35:55 and our meditations.
00:35:57 Don’t hold back from beseeching Jehovah
00:35:59 as you struggle for a decision.
00:36:02 But certainly, always relying, of course, on his Word, the Bible
00:36:05 —knowledge from his Word—
00:36:07 prayers to our Father, and then meditation on his will.
00:36:14 Of course, you’ve learned in your class
00:36:17 that the knowledge of Jehovah is such a multifaceted gem.
00:36:21 There is an intriguing scripture  that sheds further light on this thought
00:36:26 here at Ephesians 3:19,
00:36:32 Ephesians 3:19.
00:36:36 It says “and to know the love of the Christ,
00:36:39 which surpasses knowledge.”
00:36:41 Well, now, how can knowing something
00:36:46 be more than the knowledge?
00:36:49 Well, you’ve learned here that the Greek term rendered “to know” means
00:36:53 to know “practically, through experience.”
00:36:58 Now, of course, the Gospel accounts teach us much about Christ’s love.
00:37:02 We come to know his patience, his humility, his willingness to forgive, etc.
00:37:07 We read and we study that with delight.
00:37:10 But to really know it,
00:37:13 it’s like, well, a skill that we might learn
00:37:17 only after we actually do it.
00:37:19 For example,
00:37:21 a doctor goes to school to learn to be a doctor.
00:37:25 There’s lots of learning and years of study involved,
00:37:29 but then when the studies are complete, they begin their internship.
00:37:33 They begin making the rounds at the hospital.
00:37:36 They now begin taking part in this education
00:37:40 —what they learned from the books—
00:37:42 and applying it to real-life situations.
00:37:45 The knowledge learned from this experience
00:37:48 surpasses the knowledge learned in the books.
00:37:52 So we have studied the Christ; we do the bookwork; we have learned.
00:37:56 Now, you Gilead students have had the amazing opportunity these last five months
00:38:00 to read and study about his patience, his love,
00:38:04 his forgiveness, humility, compassion.
00:38:08 You cherish that knowledge; you’re in sync
00:38:12 —not quite yet.
00:38:14 You see, now we must do the internship;
00:38:17 now we must take that knowledge and make the rounds, as it were.
00:38:22 We go around the congregation; we interact with our workmates;
00:38:25 we go out in the field ministry.
00:38:27 You deal with a sticky, difficult situation
00:38:30 and put into practice what you’ve learned from the Christ.
00:38:35 This is the way to get the full impact.
00:38:40 You’ve read and studied what he was thinking,
00:38:42 but now you know how he was feeling
00:38:46 —how it feels to unselfishly give of oneself in behalf of others.
00:38:51 How does it really feel to act with humility as Jesus did?
00:38:55 Or you come to know how it really feels
00:38:58 to forgive from the heart as Jesus did.
00:39:01 In this way, by experience
00:39:04 you come “to know the love of the Christ,”
00:39:07 and that ‘surpasses the knowledge.’
00:39:10 Now not only is what you know about God and is treasured in your heart in sync
00:39:15 but now your actions, your life,
00:39:18 and who you are is in sync with Jehovah.
00:39:24 Indeed, like King David, who expressed in the 139th Psalm,
00:39:28 you dear students have found in God’s Word
00:39:31 the precious thoughts of Jehovah.
00:39:34 Continue to search them out,
00:39:36 bring them to mind, cherish them, and do them.
00:39:40 And then you will be living your life in sync with Jehovah.
00:39:51 Well, we are very grateful for that heartfelt talk, Brother Gordon.
00:39:55 Now we go to one of our Gilead instructors for the next talk;
00:39:59 it’s Brother Mark Noumair.
00:40:01 And he will speak on the subject
00:40:04 “Offer Your Bow.”
00:40:08 At the age of 20, he was a natural leader,
00:40:12 commanding a thousand men.
00:40:15 His tribe was legendary
00:40:17 for their military prowess.
00:40:19 He was known as a skilled archer.
00:40:22 His bow never turned back from its target.
00:40:25 He was the firstborn, favored prince
00:40:28 —courageous, loyal, loved by the people.
00:40:31 Everything was lining up perfectly
00:40:35 for Jonathan to become Israel’s next king
00:40:39 —everything except
00:40:41 that he was not Jehovah’s choice.
00:40:44 So how would he react when he saw David
00:40:49 receive Jehovah’s special favor?
00:40:52 How would he react when David
00:40:55 was now transferred permanently
00:40:58 to the king’s house?
00:41:00 Would he be filled with envy, jealousy?
00:41:03 Would he feel threatened?
00:41:05 Would he work to assassinate David’s character?
00:41:09 After all,
00:41:11 David was 30 years younger than Jonathan
00:41:14 and came from a rather insignificant family.
00:41:17 So, what would Jonathan do?
00:41:19 This is what he did.
00:41:21 He did something remarkable.
00:41:24 And it’s found at 1 Samuel 18:3, 4.
00:41:30 And this is what we want you to think about: what he did do and the application,
00:41:34 because this is so valuable for you.
00:41:37 First Samuel 18:3, 4:
00:41:43 “And Jonathan and David made a covenant,
00:41:47 because he loved him as himself.”
00:41:49 Now, note verse 4:
00:41:51 “Jonathan took off the sleeveless coat
00:41:54 “that he wore and gave it to David,
00:41:57 “along with his gear, his sword,
00:42:00 his bow, and his belt.”
00:42:04 Now, this dramatic act of deep symbolism
00:42:07 indicated that Jonathan would submit
00:42:10 his will to Jehovah’s will.
00:42:12 He was going to humbly support David.
00:42:15 But think about it.
00:42:17 By offering his bow to David,
00:42:21 Jonathan was giving up a major part of his identity.
00:42:25 The Bible describes Jonathan as a manly warrior
00:42:28 —‘swifter than an eagle,’ ‘mightier than a lion.’
00:42:31 He was winning battles against the Philistines
00:42:34 before David was even born.
00:42:36 But was he worried about losing the respect of others?
00:42:40 Did he say: ‘What will people think of me?
00:42:42 Will I lose my credibility if I support this younger David?’
00:42:47 No.
00:42:49 Nor did he feel that Jehovah rejected him
00:42:52 because of the special favor upon David.
00:42:55 Jonathan’s bow and his other war equipment
00:42:59 were his trademark,
00:43:01 and that symbolized his military power.
00:43:04 But the bow did not make the man.
00:43:09 Love made the man
00:43:11 —love for Jehovah, love for Jehovah’s choices.
00:43:15 This is what we’re highlighting.
00:43:17 And once Jonathan offered his bow,
00:43:21 he never retracted it,
00:43:23 even when he knew
00:43:25 that David would be the next king.
00:43:28 He respected the divine arrangement,
00:43:31 and repeatedly Jonathan would support David.
00:43:35 He would reassure David, ‘You are Jehovah’s choice.’
00:43:40 Jonathan was not insecure.
00:43:42 He was not afraid to appear insignificant.
00:43:46 He was not threatened to see David rise;
00:43:48 nor did he view David as a rival to be eliminated.
00:43:53 Now, in human terms, this cost Jonathan.
00:43:57 He lost the prospect of being king;
00:44:00 he lost his close relationship with his father;
00:44:04 he might have lost some stature in the eyes of men.
00:44:09 But in spiritual terms, he gained.
00:44:12 His unselfish devotion to David
00:44:16 received honorable mention in God’s Word,
00:44:18 which never would have happened had he resisted Jehovah’s choice.
00:44:22 We wouldn’t even be talking about this right now
00:44:25 if he took a fleshly view
00:44:27 of Jehovah’s divine arrangement.
00:44:30 So this is your first big lesson:
00:44:32 Don’t measure your worth by your job title.
00:44:38 It’s your love of Jehovah
00:44:40 —that’s what makes you so valuable.
00:44:43 A spiritual person is a most powerful tool
00:44:46 in the hands of God, and this is what you are.
00:44:49 So how can you imitate Jonathan?
00:44:52 Offer your bow
00:44:55 by showing your support of Jehovah’s organizational decisions,
00:44:59 even if it means giving up something you love
00:45:03 or want to cling to.
00:45:05 For example,
00:45:07 some of you have been given new country assignments,
00:45:11 and yet you might not have planned
00:45:13 on moving to another country.
00:45:15 You were content where you were; you were happy doing what you were doing.
00:45:20 Thank you.
00:45:22 Thank you for your unselfish support of the decisions made
00:45:26 to advance Kingdom interests globally.
00:45:28 Thank you.
00:45:31 Or perhaps you’ve been trained in some capacity
00:45:34 —something you really enjoy.
00:45:36 And yet now someone else is assigned to do that job.
00:45:40 Will you, like Jonathan,
00:45:42 put your heart into supporting and reassuring
00:45:45 the new person that took your job?
00:45:49 And how about you as a sister?
00:45:52 What about if a new sister comes and gets
00:45:55 the job assignment you love, you cherish?
00:45:57 You wake up every day ‘I love my job!’
00:46:00 and now you’re asked to train her.
00:46:02 What will you do?
00:46:04 Will you offer your bow?
00:46:07 Or the sister gets the office that you dreamed of
00:46:12 —the one with the window.
00:46:13 There it is. You had your eyes set on it.
00:46:16 You might have seniority.
00:46:18 She could be younger than you, but perhaps oversight
00:46:21 took other factors into consideration
00:46:23 that you were not aware of.
00:46:25 What will you do?
00:46:27 What will all of you do in these situations?
00:46:30 Will you accept the fact that supporting decisions
00:46:33 by the organization at times
00:46:35 involves sacrifices on your part?
00:46:39 Well, let your love for Jehovah
00:46:42 mean more than your cherished work assignment.
00:46:46 And this is a very, very big lesson —lesson number one—
00:46:49 and very important for you to think about,
00:46:52 offering your bow in this way.
00:46:56 You’ve already shown this spirit.
00:46:58 We’re just reinforcing something
00:47:00 that you need to hear prior to your departure.
00:47:05 Now, I want you to think about this for a moment.
00:47:09 Compare Jonathan’s good example
00:47:12 with that of his brother Ish-bosheth.
00:47:17 When Saul died,
00:47:20 2 Samuel 2:8 says
00:47:23 that his general, Abner,
00:47:25 made Ish-bosheth king
00:47:28 —no loyalty to Jehovah’s choice.
00:47:31 And Ish-bosheth agreed, ‘I want that.’
00:47:34 Ish-bosheth craved position,
00:47:37 which led to a civil war, which led to problems.
00:47:42 Now, instead of Ish-bosheth offering his bow
00:47:45 and his war equipment to David,
00:47:48 2 Samuel chapter 2
00:47:50 describes how he provoked war with David,
00:47:54 which resulted in bloodshed
00:47:56 and the death of 380 men in Israel.
00:48:00 Ish-bosheth’s heart wasn’t with David.
00:48:04 That was Jehovah’s choice.
00:48:06 He was unlike his brother Jonathan.
00:48:10 But now imagine if Jonathan was still alive
00:48:14 when Saul died and Abner now comes to Jonathan and says:
00:48:17 ‘Jonathan, I want you to be king.
00:48:19 You’d make a great king.’
00:48:21 Would Jonathan have agreed?
00:48:23 Would he have then said, ‘Give me my bow back’ and retract it
00:48:26 and take it back and tell David: ‘No, I feigned loyalty to you.
00:48:30 This is what I really wanted. I want to be king’?
00:48:32 No. No.
00:48:34 Jonathan wouldn’t have done that.
00:48:36 Why?
00:48:38 Because he gave not just his bow to David,
00:48:41 he gave not just his war equipment to David (no),
00:48:44 he gave his very heart to Jehovah’s choice.
00:48:47 And that’s the beautiful thing about him.
00:48:50 The difference between Jonathan,
00:48:52 who sees an opportunity to support Jehovah’s cause,
00:48:56 and Ish-bosheth, who never thought for a moment
00:49:01 about how Jehovah God was directing David, is striking.
00:49:06 And the results speak for themselves.
00:49:09 Jonathan was loved and honored.
00:49:12 Ish-bosheth was hated and murdered.
00:49:19 When Jonathan died,
00:49:21 David was so deeply grieved
00:49:24 by the loss of his dear friend
00:49:27 that he was moved to do something.
00:49:29 And what he did is recorded
00:49:32 at 2 Samuel 1:17, 18.
00:49:37 I’d like to read this to you.
00:49:40 Second Samuel 1:17, 18:
00:49:47 “Then David chanted this dirge [or this song]
00:49:51 “over Saul and his son Jonathan and said
00:49:55 “that the people of Judah should be taught
00:49:58 the dirge [the song] called ‘The Bow.’”
00:50:02 “The Bow.”
00:50:04 Could David have had in mind the bow
00:50:07 that Jonathan gave him at the beginning of their friendship?
00:50:12 Jonathan supported the nation without demanding
00:50:15 that he receive high rank, or position.
00:50:18 Jonathan was so loyal.
00:50:20 It was a powerful lesson that David never forgot,
00:50:23 and neither did he want the sons of Judah to forget,
00:50:26 because he instructed that they all learn this song by heart.
00:50:31 Offering your bow
00:50:34 is a powerful word picture.
00:50:38 When you continue to work in the background
00:50:41 (work quietly in the background),
00:50:43 in loyal support of Jehovah’s choices
00:50:46 despite the cost, despite the human imperfections,
00:50:50 despite the disappointments, despite the perceived injustices,
00:50:53 you don’t worry about all of that.
00:50:55 That’s simply the ebb and flow of life.
00:50:59 Pick yourself up; keep on moving; grow mighty;
00:51:02 become a living example to the brotherhood in loyalty.
00:51:06 That’s what you’ve been trained to do.
00:51:08 And you will receive
00:51:10 Jehovah’s attention and favor
00:51:12 just as Jonathan did.
00:51:15 Jehovah did not merely dismiss Jonathan as a would-have-been king.
00:51:19 No.
00:51:21 Rather, he took note of Jonathan’s loyal support
00:51:25 and had his wonderful example embedded,
00:51:28 etched, into his inspired Word.
00:51:33 So as you go to your assignment,
00:51:36 what is your bow?
00:51:39 Everyone has one.
00:51:42 Is it your cherished work assignment?
00:51:45 Is it that privilege that you have been given that few others enjoy?
00:51:50 Is it the responsibility
00:51:52 that requires many to consult you for direction?
00:51:55 Well, think about this:
00:51:57 The time will come
00:51:59 when someone is put in a leading role,
00:52:03 and you will be asked to support that person,
00:52:06 work under that person, help that person.
00:52:09 And when that time comes, ask yourself,
00:52:12 ‘What will I do?’
00:52:14 And not just you brothers, you sisters too,
00:52:18 I mean, you wives, will you support?
00:52:21 will the wife support as well?
00:52:23 Single sisters, will you support the arrangement?
00:52:25 That’s the point.
00:52:26 Ask yourself: ‘Will I offer my bow like Jonathan?
00:52:30 ‘Will I offer it freely?
00:52:32 ‘Will I offer it generously to anyone chosen
00:52:36 for a role of responsibility within God’s organization?’
00:52:40 And be assured that Jehovah in turn will offer you
00:52:44 —offer you an unimaginable treasure.
00:52:47 And that treasure is his favor and approval.
00:52:50 Jehovah’s favor and approval
00:52:52 —what is better than that?—
00:52:54 now and life in the new world.
00:52:58 And when you get to the new world,
00:53:00 be sure to look for the one
00:53:02 who inspired you to offer your bow.
00:53:20 Well, we thank you, Brother Noumair, very much for that encouraging talk.
00:53:24 In fact, we’ve enjoyed a series of wonderful talks this morning, haven’t we?
00:53:30 What an encouraging program thus far!
00:53:33 And in the upcoming weeks,
00:53:35 look for Parts 2 and 3 of the graduation program.
00:53:39 They’ll be found under Latest Videos
00:53:42 or under the Video on Demand segment of JW Broadcasting.
00:53:47 We’ll conclude this month’s program
00:53:49 by traveling to the tropical island of Kosrae in Micronesia.
00:53:55 Located in the Pacific Ocean,
00:53:57 Kosrae is filled with dense jungles, mangroves,
00:54:01 picturesque beaches, and is surrounded by beautiful coral.
00:54:05 Many on the island work in the tourism,
00:54:07 fishing, or agricultural industries.
00:54:11 Although the official language of Kosrae is English,
00:54:13 there’s a remote translation office here.
00:54:17 One brother and four sisters assist with translating literature
00:54:21 into Kosraean.
00:54:23 There’s one congregation on Kosrae
00:54:26 with 2 field missionaries, 2 special pioneers,
00:54:30 and 2 regular pioneers, and a total of about 15 publishers.
00:54:35 They preach to the over 6,000 inhabitants of the island.
00:54:39 And their hard work is bearing fruit.
00:54:42 For example, in 2018,
00:54:45 there were 82 in attendance at the Memorial celebration
00:54:50 and a peak of 65 attended the regional convention.
00:54:53 And in 2018,
00:54:55 the congregation reported some 60 Bible studies.
00:55:00 The brothers and sisters in Kosrae
00:55:02 send you their warm love and greetings.
00:55:04 And by means of this program,
00:55:07 we all send our love and encouragement back to them.

00:00:01 Welcome, brothers and sisters, to JW Broadcasting.
00:00:05 In this month’s program,
00:00:07 we’ll learn ways to deal with worry and anxiety.
00:00:10 Here are some highlights.
00:00:12 From childhood, this brother found it a challenge
00:00:15 to attend meetings, go to school, hold a job,
00:00:19 and even leave his home each morning.
00:00:22 What can we learn from his experience
00:00:25 to help us cope with our anxieties
00:00:28 one day at a time?
00:00:31 These two sisters have worked shoulder to shoulder in full-time service
00:00:34 for more than 60 years.
00:00:37 We’ll learn what has helped them to remain joyful
00:00:40 despite everyday struggles and unexpected trials.
00:00:45 Have you ever wondered what motivates
00:00:47 our brothers and sisters to make themselves available for Bethel service?
00:00:51 We’ll hear from ones who are serving at Bethel,
00:00:54 and we’ll learn how to prepare and qualify
00:00:57 for this special form of full-time service.
00:01:01 There’s much to enjoy in this May 2019 edition
00:01:05 of JW Broadcasting.
00:01:26 Do you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed
00:01:29 when life’s problems cause you anxiety?
00:01:32 Just trying to provide the necessities
00:01:35 for one’s family can lead to anxiety.
00:01:38 At the same time,
00:01:40 you might be dealing with a chronic or life-threatening illness,
00:01:44 caring for a sick or elderly relative,
00:01:47 grieving the death of a loved one,
00:01:50 loneliness, a natural disaster,
00:01:54 or maybe you’re struggling with the devastating effects
00:01:58 of past or present abuse.
00:02:02 Now, you firmly believe that God’s Kingdom will fix these problems,
00:02:06 but that’s in the future.
00:02:09 What about today?
00:02:12 Perhaps you feel like David,
00:02:14 who prayed at Psalm 13:2:
00:02:17 “How long will I have anxious concern,
00:02:20 with grief in my heart each day?”
00:02:24 A sister who has struggled with anxiety for many years wrote this:
00:02:30 “Anxiety robs me of sleep,  impacts my health,
00:02:35 affects the way I treat others, and makes me want to give up.”
00:02:40 She added: “Anxiety is like a monster
00:02:45 “that lives in my body somewhere between my heart and my belly.
00:02:49 “I cannot wait for Jehovah to kill that monster in the new world.
00:02:53 “But until then, the monster snarls and tears at my insides
00:02:59 and tries to take over my life.”
00:03:02 Can you identify with her feelings?
00:03:06 We often hear a person say concerning anxiety:
00:03:09 “I’m just trying to take it one day at a time.”
00:03:13 But one brother put it this way:
00:03:15 “I try to take it one day at a time,
00:03:18 but sometimes several days attack me at once.”
00:03:23 For so many of us, anxiety is a daily struggle.
00:03:29 If you battle with anxiety,
00:03:31 please know this: You are not alone.
00:03:35 Do not give up the fight.
00:03:38 Jehovah and Jesus are aware of the anxieties
00:03:42 that weigh on your mind and that are deep in your heart.
00:03:46 The Governing Body knows that living in this system of things
00:03:51 is especially “hard to deal with.”
00:03:53 So the theme chosen for this program is
00:03:57 “Deal With Anxiety One Day at a Time.”
00:04:02 First, what is anxiety?
00:04:06 In the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:04:08 the word “anxious” occurs 19 times.
00:04:12 The first occurrence is in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.
00:04:16 Now, Jesus knew that people worried about how to provide for their family.
00:04:20 So at Matthew 6:25,
00:04:24 he gave this wise counsel:
00:04:27 “On this account I say to you:
00:04:30 “Stop being anxious about your lives
00:04:33 “as to what you will eat or what you will drink,
00:04:36 “or about your bodies as to what you will wear.
00:04:39 “Does not life mean more than food
00:04:42 and the body than clothing?”
00:04:45 The Study Bible note for verse 25
00:04:49 says that “the Greek term for ‘anxious’
00:04:52 “can refer to worry that divides a person’s mind
00:04:56 and distracts him, robbing him of joy.”
00:04:59 At Luke 12:29,
00:05:03 Jesus says to “stop being in anxious suspense”
00:05:06 or to “stop worrying.”
00:05:08 The study note here says
00:05:11 that the Greek word for “anxious suspense” was used
00:05:14 to refer “to ships being tossed at sea.”
00:05:18 It says that Jesus used it “figuratively
00:05:21 “for being anxious or unsettled,
00:05:24 “as if tossed about or wavering
00:05:27 because of doubt and anxiety.”
00:05:30 By saying “stop being anxious,”
00:05:34 Jesus recognizes that anxiety is already in progress.
00:05:38 He is very aware of our imperfect nature.
00:05:42 He knows that we tend to bring our worries from yesterday
00:05:46 (the would-haves, could-haves, and should-haves)
00:05:49 and our imagined worries about tomorrow
00:05:53 (the what-ifs) to today.
00:05:56 But ask yourself,
00:05:58 ‘How often have I worried myself sick about what might happen tomorrow,
00:06:03 only to find that tomorrow wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared it would be?’
00:06:09 Jesus also knows that anxiety can have real,
00:06:13 sometimes painful, consequences.
00:06:16 It can stop us from making spiritual progress.
00:06:20 Overthinking and overanalyzing our problems
00:06:24 can literally shut us down.
00:06:27 How, though, can we “stop being anxious”?
00:06:31 What’s the antidote?
00:06:33 Let’s consider four practical things we can do.
00:06:38 First, rely on Jehovah
00:06:40 and take one day at a time.
00:06:44 This is exactly what Jesus prescribed for us
00:06:48 at Matthew 6:33, 34:
00:06:53 “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom
00:06:56 “and his righteousness,
00:06:58 “and all these other things will be added to you.
00:07:01 “So never be anxious about the next day,
00:07:05 “for the next day will have its own anxieties.
00:07:09 Each day has enough of its own troubles.”
00:07:13 Verse 34 has a study note
00:07:16 telling us that “undue anxiety about what may happen in the future
00:07:21 “can adversely affect a person’s relationship with God,
00:07:24 causing him to rely  on his own wisdom rather than on God’s.”
00:07:30 So, what’s the lesson?
00:07:32 Instead of relying on ourselves,
00:07:34 rely on Jehovah, and take one day at a time.
00:07:39 A cross-reference to Matthew 6:34
00:07:42 takes us to Exodus 16:4.
00:07:46 In this account,
00:07:47 Jehovah provided the Israelites with enough manna
00:07:51 for every day of their 40-year trek.
00:07:54 Could Jehovah have provided
00:07:56 a week’s worth of manna? a month’s worth? a year’s worth?
00:08:01 Of course.
00:08:03 So why did he only provide enough for each day?
00:08:08 Well, think about it.
00:08:10 When they stepped out of their tents each morning,
00:08:13 there was no question whether there would be manna on the ground or not,
00:08:18 and there was no question where it came from.
00:08:21 Jehovah never failed to provide for their needs,
00:08:25 not even for one day.
00:08:27 They also knew from the past that Jehovah
00:08:31 always provided for those who were loyal to him.
00:08:35 We too can look back at how Jehovah provided for his servants.
00:08:39 We can have complete confidence that Jehovah knows exactly
00:08:43 what we need when we need it
00:08:46 —for today, tomorrow, and for all eternity.
00:08:51 Even if we have such confidence,
00:08:54 why do we sometimes continue to feel anxious?
00:08:58 The simple answer:
00:09:00 We’re imperfect people trying our best
00:09:03 to serve Jehovah in Satan’s wicked world.
00:09:06 Daily challenges cause anxiety that can make us forget to rely on Jehovah
00:09:11 and take one day at a time.
00:09:13 So we need to add our second way to deal with anxiety:
00:09:18 Pour your heart out
00:09:20 to Jehovah in earnest prayer.
00:09:23 Read with me the reassuring words
00:09:25 at Philippians 4:6, 7:
00:09:29 “Do not be anxious over anything,
00:09:32 “but in everything by prayer
00:09:35 “and supplication along with thanksgiving,
00:09:39 “let your petitions be made known to God;
00:09:42 “and the peace of God that surpasses
00:09:45 “all understanding will guard your hearts
00:09:48 and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”
00:09:52 Paul doesn’t simply tell us not to be anxious,
00:09:56 but he tells us how.
00:09:58 He said “by prayer and supplication,”
00:10:03 which is earnest and specific prayer.
00:10:06 With what benefit?
00:10:08 The “peace of God . . . will guard your hearts.”
00:10:14 “Guard” was a military expression referring to troops
00:10:17 assigned to protect a city.
00:10:19 The inhabitants could sleep soundly
00:10:22 knowing that soldiers were guarding them at night.
00:10:26 In a similar way, when we have “the peace of God,”
00:10:30 our hearts and minds can rest.
00:10:33 This can prevent us from being overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.
00:10:38 How reassuring are the words of the psalmist
00:10:42 at Psalm 4:8:
00:10:45 “I will lie down and sleep in peace,
00:10:49 “for you alone, O Jehovah,
00:10:51 make me dwell in security.”
00:10:54 So when we feel trapped, like there’s no way out of our worries,
00:10:59 the peace from God gives us hope
00:11:03 that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.
00:11:06 What, though, must you do?
00:11:09 Turn your worries into deep, heartfelt prayers.
00:11:14 In fact, at 1 Peter 5:7,
00:11:18 Jehovah invites you to “throw all your anxiety on him,
00:11:22 “[and leave it with him]
00:11:24 because he cares for you.”
00:11:27 Jehovah is the one person who truly understands how you feel.
00:11:32 He knows every moment of your life
00:11:35 —why you feel or react a certain way.
00:11:38 He loves and values you personally
00:11:42 despite your imperfections, your anxieties,
00:11:46 your cares and worries.
00:11:48 He not only has the power to help you, he wants to.
00:11:54 Knowing this should move you to pray specifically,
00:11:59 expressing your deepest emotions
00:12:02 and pleading that he grant you peace of mind and heart.
00:12:07 To the extent you do so,
00:12:09 1 Peter 5:10 promises
00:12:12 that “he will make you firm,
00:12:14 “he will make you strong,
00:12:16 he will firmly ground you.”
00:12:21 Never underestimate the power of prayer!
00:12:25 Jehovah is always ready to help you
00:12:28 —one day at a time.
00:12:32 Our third way to deal with anxiety
00:12:34 is to read and meditate on God’s Word.
00:12:39 Let Jehovah speak to you.
00:12:41 Allow Jehovah’s thoughts to become your thoughts.
00:12:46 At Psalm 94:19,
00:12:49 notice how the psalmist admitted his own anxiety:
00:12:54 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:12:57 you comforted and soothed me.”
00:13:02 Yes, even servants of God can feel overwhelmed by anxieties
00:13:06 or, as one translation says, “burdened with worries.”
00:13:11 That in itself is comforting
00:13:14 that an inspired Bible writer struggled with anxieties.
00:13:18 But Jehovah “comforted and soothed” him,
00:13:22 calming his troubled heart.
00:13:25 God can do the same for us
00:13:28 through his inspired Word, the Bible.
00:13:30 Remember, the Bible is how Jehovah speaks to us.
00:13:35 Rather than allowing our emotions to run wild,
00:13:38 we can learn to focus our mind on upbuilding things,
00:13:43 such as what the apostle Paul listed at Philippians 4:8:
00:13:48 “Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,
00:13:53 “whatever things are of serious concern,
00:13:56 “whatever things are righteous,
00:13:58 “whatever things are chaste,
00:14:00 “whatever things are lovable,
00:14:02 “whatever things are well-spoken-of,
00:14:05 “whatever things are virtuous,
00:14:07 “and whatever things are praiseworthy,
00:14:10 continue considering these things.”
00:14:14 The footnote to verse 8 shows that “considering”
00:14:18 involves “thinking about” or “meditating on.”
00:14:22 We can and should meditate on positive things from the Bible,
00:14:27 replacing negative things that may enter our mind and cause anxiety.
00:14:32 Ask Jehovah to help you to find passages
00:14:37 in his Word that will soothe your heart.
00:14:40 Ask others what scriptures have calmed their heart during anxious moments.
00:14:45 Make your own personal list.
00:14:48 Then set aside time to read
00:14:51 and meditate on those passages.
00:14:54 Meditation is the doorway to your heart.
00:14:58 Meditation lets God’s thoughts affect you
00:15:02 on the deepest possible level.
00:15:05 Imagine that Jehovah is speaking directly to you,
00:15:08 because he is.
00:15:10 Never underestimate the power of God’s Word
00:15:14 —of letting Jehovah speak to you.
00:15:18 Our fourth way to deal with anxiety
00:15:21 is to share your feelings with a trusted friend.
00:15:25 Proverbs 12:25 says:
00:15:29 “Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down
00:15:33 “[or, as the footnote says, ‘depresses him’],
00:15:36 but a good word cheers it up.”
00:15:39 “A good word” can come from a fellow believer
00:15:42 who is motivated by God’s spirit and guided by his Word.
00:15:47 When the apostle Paul was alone in prison,
00:15:50 he prayed for encouragement
00:15:52 and Jehovah provided what he needed to cheer him up.
00:15:56 With a heart full of appreciation,
00:15:59 he said at Colossians 4:11
00:16:01 that “my fellow workers  . . . have become
00:16:04 a source of great comfort to me,”
00:16:06 or “a strengthening aid.”
00:16:10 What can you do if you feel weighed down or imprisoned by anxiety?
00:16:15 Like Paul, pray for encouragement.
00:16:19 Pray for someone you can talk to,
00:16:21 someone you can trust with your feelings.
00:16:24 The answer to your prayer may be an elder
00:16:28 or a mature Christian brother or sister.
00:16:31 But what if it’s difficult for you
00:16:34 to open up to others and confide in them?
00:16:37 Try the advice in the March 1, 1997, Watchtower article
00:16:42 “Are You Afraid to Trust Others?”
00:16:45 When confiding in someone
00:16:47 it says: “Reveal your concerns gradually.
00:16:51 “If he [or she] responds in an appropriate,
00:16:54 “sympathetic, and discreet way,
00:16:57 you might then try disclosing more.”
00:17:00 Even if it takes some effort,
00:17:03 never underestimate the power of our brotherhood.
00:17:07 Jehovah can use a fellow worshipper
00:17:10 to ease your mind of “anxious concern.”
00:17:13 Even at times when there’s no one to talk to,
00:17:16 we can let the experiences,
00:17:19 upbuilding music,
00:17:21 and talks on JW Broadcasting® be like
00:17:24 an encouraging hug from a trusted friend.
00:17:28 Yes, when we make the effort, we give Jehovah something to bless.
00:17:33 Jehovah can help us conquer the seemingly unconquerable.
00:17:38 That may not mean that we’ll completely eliminate anxiety,
00:17:42 but we can learn to take control.
00:17:45 How?
00:17:47 Remember our four ways:
00:17:49 First, rely on Jehovah
00:17:53 and take one day at time;
00:17:55 second, pour out your heart
00:17:58 to Jehovah in earnest, specific prayer;
00:18:02 third, read and meditate on God’s Word
00:18:06 —let Jehovah speak to you;
00:18:09 and fourth, share your feelings with a trusted friend.
00:18:13 With Jehovah’s help,
00:18:15 you can deal with anxiety one day at a time.
00:18:20 Earlier, I read a quote from the sister who described
00:18:23 anxiety as a monster living inside her.
00:18:27 I’m so pleased to say that the sister who wrote that letter about her anxieties
00:18:31 is actually here with us in the studio to tell us more about her experience.
00:18:37 This is Jordan Williams and her husband, Robert.
00:18:39 Thank you so much
00:18:41 for coming here to share with us your battle with anxiety.
00:18:45 Can you elaborate on that, please?
00:18:48 I feel ashamed of my anxiety.
00:18:50 I feel like there’s something wrong with me, and I feel guilty about that.
00:18:55 I feel like I’m letting Jehovah down by feeling anxious
00:18:59 and that I’m even being disobedient to Jesus,
00:19:01 when he says: “Stop being anxious.”
00:19:03 But I just can’t.
00:19:05 Thank you for sharing that.
00:19:06 Robert, what do you do to help Jordan battle this anxiety?
00:19:12 It’s a monster —sometimes a very stubborn monster—
00:19:15 that won’t go away.
00:19:17 Remembering that it’s not her fault
00:19:20 helps me be more compassionate
00:19:23 and caring—listening when she’s explaining these anxieties
00:19:27 that I may not completely understand.
00:19:29 Jordan, are there other practical things that help you battle anxiety?
00:19:34 The single biggest help is walking with Jehovah every day.
00:19:38 I mean that literally.
00:19:39 I’ll wake up in the morning super anxious.
00:19:42 And I can’t breathe; and my chest is tight.
00:19:45 And I’ll get up, and I’ll read the chapter
00:19:48 of the Bible that the daily text comes from.
00:19:50 And then I’ll go on a walk and talk to Jehovah for an hour,
00:19:54 and I try to use the model prayer as an outline.
00:19:56 So I’ll talk to Jehovah about his name
00:19:59 and how I feel so privileged to have that name on me.
00:20:04 And I’ll talk to him about his Kingdom
00:20:06 that’s going to solve all of these problems, including anxiety.
00:20:10 And I’ll talk to him about his will
00:20:13 and specifically what his will is for me that day.
00:20:17 And most of the time,
00:20:20 those three things cover the things that were worrying me.
00:20:23 But if there is another thing, I’ll talk to him specifically about that.
00:20:27 What a nice walk you have with Jehovah.
00:20:29 Are there other things that help you deal and battle anxiety?
00:20:33 Personal study projects help a lot,
00:20:35 especially if they don’t have anything to do with anxiety.
00:20:37 If I do a study project on the spiritual suit of armor or the ransom,
00:20:42 it kind of distracts the “anxiety monster” so that my heart can calm down,
00:20:47 and then these pearls of wisdom will come from Jehovah, and they can get in.
00:20:51 And some of those pearls are actually just what I need to deal with my anxiety.
00:20:56 Are there specific things that help you?
00:20:59 Yes, I made an Anxiety tab in the Personal Study section
00:21:02 of my Study Bible on my tablet,
00:21:04 and I collect scriptures and comments
00:21:08 that really help with my anxiety.
00:21:10 For example, in 2014, there was a regional convention talk
00:21:15 about Matthew chapter 6 and six specific things that combat anxiety.
00:21:20 And it made me think of the twelve-step program  to overcoming addiction.
00:21:24 These are the six steps to overcome anxiety.
00:21:27 What are those six steps?
00:21:29 The first one is to help those in need,
00:21:31 and then pray a lot, to be forgiving,
00:21:35 not to be hypocritical, to store up treasures in heaven,
00:21:39 and then to focus on spiritual matters.
00:21:42 So when we got back from the convention,
00:21:44 she took those items and she wrote them down
00:21:46 and put them on magnets and put them on our refrigerator.
00:21:49 I try to do each one of those six things every day.
00:21:52 And when I accomplish one, I’ll turn the magnet
00:21:54 so that I can see what I still need to work on.
00:21:57 So when I come to the refrigerator in the morning,
00:22:00 if the magnets are turned, we know where she’s at.
00:22:02 If they’re not turned, we know we’re in trouble.
00:22:03 It’s a bad day.
00:22:04 It’s time to do something else.
00:22:05 Very good—nice barometer.
00:22:06 So, what can others do or say
00:22:09 that would be helpful to those going through anxiety?
00:22:12 For the friends, it’s really nice when they’re understanding
00:22:16 and nonjudgmental
00:22:18 and respect my privacy (that’s really helpful)
00:22:22 and when they don’t freeze me in time
00:22:25 or decide that ‘Oh, she’s anxious, and this is how she’s going to be all the time.’
00:22:29 That’s really helpful.
00:22:30 I even forget that Jehovah approves of me.
00:22:34 So reminding me of that
00:22:36 —reminding me that the things that I do to please him are successful
00:22:41 and maybe even reminding me of things that I have accomplished for Jehovah
00:22:45 in the past.
00:22:47 You know, you should tell Ron about your broken dish.
00:22:49 Oh, yeah.
00:22:50 Yes. I’d like to know about that.
00:22:53 So I just found out about this Japanese art called Kintsukuroi.
00:22:57 And it’s basically taking
00:22:59 a broken piece of pottery and fixing it by putting it back together
00:23:03 with gold or silver lacquer,
00:23:06 and the concept is that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken.
00:23:11 And that really resonates with me because I do feel broken by anxiety.
00:23:16 But Jehovah gave Jesus as a ransom,
00:23:19 and that ransom is just pure gold;
00:23:21 and He can take all the broken anxious little bits of me
00:23:25 and put me back together.
00:23:27 And maybe I’ll even be more useful to Jehovah for having been broken.
00:23:32 That’s very precious.
00:23:34 Thank you for sharing that.
00:23:35 Are there other things that help you deal with anxiety?
00:23:39 I’ve learned to recognize when anxiety is clouding my thinking,
00:23:42 and I’ll ask him, “Can I borrow your brain for a minute, please?”
00:23:45 So, what we did is we went and purchased a whiteboard and put it in my office.
00:23:49 And sometimes we’ll go to the whiteboard
00:23:51 and write out all the anxieties that she’s dealing with.
00:23:54 As we are writing them out,
00:23:56 sometimes we realize that those are yesterday’s anxieties
00:23:59 and that they’ve been cared for, so we can erase those from the board.
00:24:02 Some of them are for tomorrow,
00:24:05 and so we don’t want to borrow those and bring them to today.
00:24:07 They’re tomorrow’s anxieties.
00:24:09 And some anxieties can be grouped in little clusters,
00:24:12 and you can realize, ‘The root is here; let’s focus on that.’
00:24:16 I fight anxiety every single day.
00:24:20 And anxiety is constantly changing its tactics, so I have to be adaptable.
00:24:25 But Jehovah never leaves me to fight anxiety alone—ever.
00:24:30 I don’t understand what I’ve done to merit all of his attention,
00:24:35 but I do realize that I don’t need to understand why he loves me.
00:24:39 I trust him, and he never lies,
00:24:42 so I just need to accept it when he shows me that love.
00:24:45 We appreciate you sharing those personal feelings.
00:24:48 And again, we know that Jehovah and Jesus are so proud of you.
00:24:52 And we know that those who are listening in to this interview
00:24:55 will benefit so much from listening to your personal expressions.
00:24:59 Thank you very much.
00:25:01 Anxieties can surface at any time in our lives,
00:25:05 even when we’re very young.
00:25:07 Imagine, though, if the stress of growing up in this system
00:25:11 was made worse by a chronic disorder,
00:25:14 one that made anxiety feel impossible to overcome.
00:25:18 We’ll be encouraged by the experience of Brother Steing Dott,
00:25:22 who never gave up on Jehovah.
00:25:24 See if you can identify what has helped him cope
00:25:28 one day at a time.
00:25:31 My name is Steing Dott.
00:25:33 I was born in 1988 in Darwin, Northern Territory.
00:25:38 When I was eight years old,
00:25:40 I realized that life was getting very difficult for me.
00:25:45 I was diagnosed with ADHD,
00:25:48 obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome.
00:25:51 And on top of all of that, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well.
00:25:55 My mum said this affected the entire family
00:25:59 because I would repeatedly yell out “Good night!”
00:26:02 to each individual person in the family.
00:26:05 And on top of that, I used to constantly go
00:26:09 around the house, checking the locks and the windows.
00:26:13 My school life was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with.
00:26:18 My school was approximately
500 meters from my home.
00:26:22 It would take me at least two hours to get to school
00:26:25 because one of my obsessions was that if there were cracks on the footpath
00:26:30 and if I stepped on one,
00:26:32 I’d have to go all the way back home and start again.
00:26:37 Well, I found life to be a constant struggle,
00:26:40 and as I got older, it only got worse.
00:26:43 Even at ten years old, I decided that I wanted to end my life
00:26:48 so that it would make everyone in the family’s life a lot easier.
00:26:52 But then we decided to use some medication,
00:26:56 which eased my problems a little bit.
00:26:58 Despite having medication,
00:27:01 life was still completely unbearable for me.
00:27:04 I had a constant struggle every day within myself.
00:27:08 I used to wash my hands hundreds of times a day.
00:27:11 I couldn’t leave the home;
00:27:13 I couldn’t get a driver’s license; I couldn’t even get a job.
00:27:17 A major turning point in my life
00:27:20 was my mum’s unwavering faith in Jehovah.
00:27:23 She used to iron my clothes for the meeting
00:27:25 and hang them on the doorknob,
00:27:27 even though I wasn’t ready to attend the meeting.
00:27:30 But what she didn’t know was that when my mum
00:27:32 went to the meeting with my sister, I’d get a Bible,
00:27:35 and I’d try and start to read it.
00:27:37 I also began to pray to Jehovah.
00:27:41 And then one day, I thought, ‘I’m going to give this a shot.’
00:27:45 So I put my suit on, I got ready,
00:27:47 and I went to the meeting.
00:27:49 When I went to the Kingdom Hall, I was absolutely terrified.
00:27:53 I was so nervous.
00:27:54 But when I got there, I saw an elder
00:27:57 who used to come and visit me, and he made me feel very relaxed.
00:28:02 And then the amazing welcome by the brothers and sisters
00:28:05 —it made me feel like I was part of Jehovah’s organization again.
00:28:10 The scripture that really helped me
00:28:12 was 1 Peter 5:7 because it says:
00:28:16 “While you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.”
00:28:21 So this made me feel like I had a very powerful Friend,
00:28:25 and Jehovah wanted me to throw my anxieties on him because he loved me.
00:28:30 On September 4, 2010,
00:28:33 it was my most important day of my life.
00:28:35 I got baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:28:39 at Adelaide Entertainment Centre.
00:28:41 I now serve as a ministerial servant.
00:28:44 I’ve had the privilege of giving public talks,
00:28:47 which is something I never thought I’d ever be able to do.
00:28:50 I completed pioneer school after three attempts
00:28:54 because the pioneer school environment made me feel
00:28:57 like I was back at school and made me have anxiety again.
00:29:01 So the third time I completed it.
00:29:04 And none of this would ever have been possible without Jehovah’s help.
00:29:09 On the 6th of August 2016,
00:29:12 I married my beautiful wife, Laura,
00:29:15 who helps me serve Jehovah,
00:29:17 and we can serve Jehovah every day together.
00:29:19 I, like the apostle Paul,
00:29:21 still feel like I have a war inside me sometimes.
00:29:25 But definitely, Jehovah has never let me down.
00:29:29 Never give up on serving Jehovah
00:29:32 because Jehovah will never give up on you.
00:29:35 Did you notice what Steing considered the turning point in his life?
00:29:39 It was the unwavering faith of his Mum,
00:29:43 the warmth of the congregation
00:29:46 and, most of all, help from Jehovah.
00:29:49 He called Jehovah “a very powerful Friend.”
00:29:53 That’s so true!
00:29:55 Brother Dott overcame monumental challenges,
00:29:59 but is his struggle with anxiety over?
00:30:02 No.
00:30:04 He said that like the apostle Paul,
00:30:06 he sometimes still feels a war within himself.
00:30:11 Do you ever feel that way?
00:30:13 This month’s music video reminds us
00:30:16 that we can find peace and joy despite our burdens.
00:30:20 It’s entitled Each Day Has Its Own Anxieties.
00:30:31 I know about the Paradise under God’s Kingdom,
00:30:38 And I believe with all my heart that better days will come.
00:30:46 But sometimes in this life, for me, It’s hard to see the things unseen,
00:30:53 To feel the love I know is there when my heart is in despair.
00:31:00 But I know Jehovah’s near.
00:31:10 So I say a prayer from the heart. When worries overtake my mind,
00:31:21 On his strength I can rely. I’m not alone; I know he’s there.
00:31:34 I have his words of comfort And true friends who really care.
00:31:40 Yes, each day has its own anxieties. So I take one day at a time;
00:31:52 Leave tomorrow until tomorrow; Peace is what I find
00:31:59 One day at a time.
00:32:07 So take these words I’ve said, my friend, And know that I care.
00:32:14 Focus on the joys in life, Not the burdens that we bear.
00:32:23 Think about what God has done. To show his love, he gave his Son.
00:32:29 So never doubt; keep trusting him. He gave his best so we could live.
00:32:36 So don’t give in to fear.
00:32:43 Say a prayer from the heart. When worries overtake our mind,
00:32:54 On his strength we can rely. We’re not alone, for he is there.
00:33:05 We have his words of comfort And true friends who really care.
00:33:13 Yes, each day has its own anxieties. So take one day at a time;
00:33:25 Leave tomorrow until tomorrow; Peace is what we’ll find
00:33:31 One day at a time.
00:33:54 Say a prayer from the heart. When worries overtake our mind,
00:34:05 On his strength we can rely. We’re not alone, for he is there.
00:34:17 We have his words of comfort And true friends who really care.
00:34:25 Yes, each day has its own anxieties. So take one day at a time;
00:34:36 Leave tomorrow until tomorrow; Peace is what we’ll find
00:34:42 One day at a time— One day at a time.
00:34:58 “We’re not alone, for he is there.
00:35:02 “We have his words of comfort and true friends
00:35:06 who really care.”
00:35:08 What an encouraging thought from that song!
00:35:11 Yes, true friends who share our love for Jehovah are invaluable.
00:35:17 We’ll see that in this story from Japan.
00:35:20 Sisters Takako Sato and Hisako Wakui
00:35:24 have worked together as pioneers since 1957.
00:35:28 Let’s learn how their friendship
00:35:30 has helped them serve Jehovah with joy.
00:35:34 We are pioneer partners.
00:35:38 We’ve been working together
00:35:40 for over 60 years.
00:35:43 In 1956,
00:35:45 I was the only Jehovah’s Witness in Nagano prefecture.
00:35:49 It was lonesome,
00:35:52 but I applied for regular pioneer service.
00:35:55 Surprisingly,
00:35:57 I was appointed as a special pioneer.
00:36:01 I was so happy that I found myself
00:36:04 rolling around on the tatami-mat floor
00:36:07 with the appointment letter in my hand.
00:36:10 That was the way I expressed my joy and appreciation.
00:36:15 When I was invited to serve
00:36:17 as a special pioneer, I was sent to Nagano,
00:36:19 and that’s where I met Hisako.
00:36:23 Takako and I focused on our ministry.
00:36:28 When an isolated group was established,
00:36:31 since there were no brothers,
00:36:33 I would wear a head covering and conduct the meetings.
00:36:38 Sometimes the outlines were in English.
00:36:41 We didn’t understand anything.
00:36:44 But people were delighted to hear
00:36:47 even just the scriptures and went home satisfied,
00:36:51 and that strongly impressed on me the power of God’s Word.
00:36:58 We were assigned to a territory in the city after that.
00:37:03 We found so many not-at-homes,
00:37:06 but we were determined to meet people.
00:37:11 So we changed the times we preached,
00:37:13 and we talked to people on the street
00:37:15 who were going to work.
00:37:17 We cherished even small opportunities.
00:37:20 When we had a chance to meet a householder,
00:37:23 we always tried to have a conversation
00:37:26 that we could link to the next visit.
00:37:29 Before long, I had ten Bible studies.
00:37:35 Takako acts like she’s cheerful,
00:37:38 but she’s been fighting various illnesses.
00:37:43 At times, it was so bad
00:37:46 that I could not even go out in service.
00:37:50 I had a serious skin condition.
00:37:53 I could not bear
00:37:56 to look at the illustration of Job in the magazine,
00:38:00 and I covered it up with paper.
00:38:06 But Jehovah helped me to look to Job’s example.
00:38:10 I learned
00:38:12 that our endurance under trial
00:38:14 would become praise to God.
00:38:19 I have often had health problems.
00:38:23 Just at one of those times,
00:38:26 I received a letter from the branch.
00:38:29 It said:
00:38:31 “What you can accomplish now may be limited.
00:38:36 “However, think about all that you have done up to now
00:38:40 “to give praise to Jehovah
00:38:42 “and about the people you were able to help learn the truth,
00:38:46 and be joyful knowing that you have been used by Jehovah fully.”
00:38:54 I couldn’t stop crying
00:38:56 because I really felt the care and concern
00:39:00 from the organization and from Jehovah.
00:39:05 Hisako also took really good care of me
00:39:09 and prayed with me.
00:39:13 Our thinking and personalities are different,
00:39:16 but we made efforts to talk things out.
00:39:20 Our heartfelt desire to want to serve Jehovah full-time
00:39:25 has always been the same.
00:39:30 For 60 years, we’ve enjoyed
00:39:33 a truly wonderful life of service to Jehovah.
00:39:36 Jehovah has supported us in difficult times
00:39:40 through the Bible, the organization, and friends.
00:39:44 I have tasted the truthfulness of the words:
00:39:47 “When I am weak, then I am powerful.”
00:39:54 ‘When I said: “My foot is slipping,”
00:39:58 your kindness, O Jehovah, has supported me.’
00:40:02 I can say that too.
00:40:05 Although we don’t have energy or ability,
00:40:09 we’ve been able to enjoy full-time service together up until now.
00:40:15 I’m really content now.
00:40:17 It’s all thanks to Jehovah.
00:40:23 Like the apostle Paul, our sisters cultivated singleness
00:40:27 and focused on full-time service to Jehovah
00:40:31 for more than 60 years.
00:40:33 Yes, they face everyday challenges
00:40:36 and the extra ones that come with age,
00:40:39 but their heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah whole-souled
00:40:43 brings Takako and Hisako real joy and contentment.
00:40:48 Whole-souled service for nearly 20,000 brothers and sisters
00:40:53 is a full-time assignment at Bethel.
00:40:57 What motivates them to reach out for this special privilege?
00:41:01 What blessings do they experience?
00:41:04 And what’s the best way to prepare and qualify for Bethel service?
00:41:09 I’d like to invite my friend Patrick LaFranca
00:41:12 to discuss these and other questions.
00:41:14 Welcome, Pat.
00:41:15 Thank you, Ron.
00:41:18 How heartwarming it’s been
00:41:20 to see millions take their stand for true worship!
00:41:23 Thousands more are joining us every week.
00:41:27 Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering work,
00:41:30 and this makes us very happy.
00:41:33 But who will work to provide the Bibles, Bible literature,
00:41:38 and the audio and video publications
00:41:41 that sustain us spiritually
00:41:43 and help us to accomplish our Kingdom preaching and teaching work?
00:41:47 Bethel is a unique place.
00:41:50 It’s where mature Christians
00:41:53 render sacred service to Jehovah
00:41:55 in close association with Christ’s brothers.
00:41:58 They minister to the needs of our worldwide brotherhood
00:42:02 and support the preaching work.
00:42:05 The Bethel family is a group of dedicated,
00:42:09 baptized servants of Jehovah
00:42:11 who live and work together closely.
00:42:14 So they experience in a special way
00:42:18 what Psalm 133:1 says:
00:42:21 “Look! How good
00:42:24 “and how pleasant it is for brothers
00:42:27 to dwell together in unity!”
00:42:29 We’re very pleased to see that many have expanded their service
00:42:33 to Jehovah by making themselves available
00:42:36 for the special privilege of Bethel service.
00:42:40 Have you considered this as a goal?
00:42:44 Making yourself available
00:42:46 for Bethel service is like knocking on a door that leads
00:42:50 to many other privileges of service.
00:42:52 Of course, to serve at Bethel requires
00:42:55 a self-sacrificing spirit
00:42:57 and a willingness to serve
00:42:59 wherever there is a need, in harmony with the attitude displayed
00:43:03 by the prophet Isaiah at Isaiah 6:8:
00:43:06 “Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying:
00:43:10 “‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’
00:43:13 And I said: ‘Here I am! Send me!’”
00:43:18 When Isaiah learned about an opportunity
00:43:21 to do more in Jehovah’s service,
00:43:23 he responded eagerly,
00:43:25 even though he did not know exactly
00:43:27 what he was going to be assigned to do.
00:43:30 It was enough for him to know that Jehovah
00:43:32 was extending an invitation to serve in a special way,
00:43:36 and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.
00:43:39 The same spirit is shown by Bethel family members worldwide.
00:43:45 What especially motivates so many to serve at Bethel?
00:43:49 Love for Jehovah moves us
00:43:51 to put Kingdom interests ahead of self-interest.
00:43:54 As stated in the Proclaimers book, page 295:
00:43:58 “This is not work in which they gain
00:44:01 “personal prominence or material possessions.
00:44:04 “Their desire is to honor Jehovah, and they are satisfied
00:44:07 “with the provisions made for them
00:44:10 “in the way of food, lodging,
00:44:11 and a modest [allowance] for personal expenses.”
00:44:16 Are there any rewards that come from serving in this unique way?
00:44:20 Those who have offered themselves willingly
00:44:23 for Bethel service have truly been blessed.
00:44:27 The love and unity we feel here is incomparable.
00:44:31 It’s not like in a company out in the world
00:44:34 because here you can work with your friends every day.
00:44:39 Like-minded people
00:44:41 have the same goals and support each other.
00:44:43 That is what you can feel here.
00:44:46 Maybe you’re assigned a task
00:44:47 that you’ve never performed before,
00:44:50 but there are many experienced brothers and sisters
00:44:52 who can help —professionally as well as personally.
00:44:56 Whether it is the consideration of the daily text
00:45:00 or the Watchtower Study with the Bethel family,
00:45:02 listening to the practical, valuable comments
00:45:05 of our brothers and sisters is really refreshing.
00:45:08 You really feel that they love Jehovah,
00:45:10 and their comments help you to feel the same.
00:45:14 Here in Bethel, you have the best Employer
00:45:16 that there is—Jehovah.
00:45:18 No other employer is as grateful and considerate as he is,
00:45:22 so out of love for Jehovah, you’re simply happy to give him your best.
00:45:26 Whenever I think about what
00:45:28 is being done at Bethel
00:45:30 —publications are being
00:45:31 produced and shipped,
00:45:32 videos for our conventions are being made,
00:45:35 and translation is being done
00:45:37 into so many different languages—
00:45:39 I keep getting goose bumps.
00:45:42 No matter what I can do here,
00:45:44 knowing that by doing it
00:45:46 I am supporting Christ’s brothers makes me feel very, very good.
00:45:51 So how does a young person
00:45:53 qualify for Bethel service?
00:45:55 My parents raised me to have
00:45:59 a spiritual focus.
00:46:00 So during the school holidays
00:46:02 and growing up, our life revolved around the ministry
00:46:06 —doing spiritual activities.
00:46:08 And it really helped us
00:46:09 keep focused spiritually as a family
00:46:13 and helped me stay focused on the goals that I wanted to achieve.
00:46:17 I really enjoy reading,
00:46:20 and one day my Dad just said to me,
00:46:22 “Why don’t you read the Bible?”
00:46:24 And I know it sounds obvious, but at that point, I had never read it
00:46:27 from Genesis to Revelation.
00:46:29 So when I finished reading the Bible,
00:46:31 it really changed my thinking,
00:46:35 and it really proved the truth to myself.
00:46:39 And this helped me to keep
00:46:43 a spiritual focus, and it really was the first step
00:46:47 in reaching out and achieving
00:46:49 the spiritual goals that I wanted to achieve.
00:46:52 In the congregation, I was able to help out
00:46:54 with doing the magazines and the sound and the platform.
00:46:59 And these privileges really helped me to build
00:47:02 a good work ethic and give in ways
00:47:05 that I could give more to Jehovah.
00:47:07 So the elders used to work with me a lot in the ministry.
00:47:10 So when I felt
00:47:12 that ‘I can’t do this’
00:47:14 or ‘This is too much’ or ‘It’s too overwhelming’
00:47:16 or ‘I’ll never be able to reach this goal,’ an elder showed me
00:47:21 a scripture in the Bible where Jehovah
00:47:23 was encouraging Joshua to be courageous.
00:47:26 And that really impacted me,
00:47:29 so that I was able to be courageous, too, and to reach my goal of Bethel.
00:47:36 So when I visited Bethel,
00:47:38 I saw that they were normal people,
00:47:41 and they had so many good qualities
00:47:44 that I wanted to imitate
00:47:47 —very hospitable, very warm,
00:47:49 very inviting.
00:47:52 That helped me to want to reach my goal, so that I could be like them.
00:47:57 To serve at Bethel
00:47:59 there are qualifications that need to be met.
00:48:01 You should have a deep love for Jehovah
00:48:04 and the organization, which is demonstrated
00:48:07 by living in harmony with Bible standards.
00:48:10 You must have a fine reputation
00:48:12 as a spiritual person.
00:48:14 You should have respect
00:48:16 for Jehovah’s moral standards,
00:48:18 avoiding uncleanness and sexual immorality.
00:48:21 You should have a clean conscience
00:48:24 before Jehovah and be at peace with yourself
00:48:27 and with Jehovah’s organization.
00:48:30 Your dress and grooming should be exemplary,
00:48:32 befitting a Christian minister
00:48:35 even during leisure time.
00:48:37 Styles that are faddish
00:48:39 or extreme or that identify us
00:48:41 with undesirable elements of the world
00:48:44 are not acceptable at Bethel.
00:48:47 The applicant should not read, listen to,
00:48:50 or view any type of material
00:48:53 that is inappropriate for a Christian.
00:48:55 Such unwholesome material
00:48:57 certainly would include pornography,
00:48:59 debasing music, or any kind of entertainment
00:49:03 that features sexual immorality,
00:49:05 spiritism, or violence.
00:49:09 Bethel applicants should be
00:49:11 from 19 to 35 years of age.
00:49:14 Occasionally, there is an opening
00:49:16 for someone over 35 years of age
00:49:18 who may have specialized skills
00:49:20 that are needed at Bethel,
00:49:22 such as those with certain technical
00:49:24 or medical experience, translation skills,
00:49:27 or building trades such as plumbing, electrical,
00:49:31 heavy equipment mechanics, or carpentry.
00:49:35 Those with such capabilities and training
00:49:37 are welcome to apply.
00:49:40 In view of the unique demands
00:49:43 of a full-time assignment at Bethel,
00:49:45 you should be mentally and emotionally sound,
00:49:48 physically strong, and able to work long hours.
00:49:53 You should be able to read, write,
00:49:54 and speak the primary language
00:49:56 of the branch territory.
00:49:58 This will enable you to communicate well
00:50:01 with others serving at Bethel,
00:50:03 to receive needed training, and to work safely
00:50:06 in the Bethel environment.
00:50:09 Bethel applicants agree to serve
00:50:11 for a minimum of one year,
00:50:13 during which time you will receive training
00:50:15 for continued Bethel service.
00:50:19 With regard to secular skills, we do not encourage individuals
00:50:22 to obtain university education
00:50:25 or training with the thought that this will improve
00:50:28 their chances of being called into Bethel.
00:50:30 The best way to prepare for Bethel service
00:50:33 is to first serve in the full-time pioneer ministry.
00:50:38 The greatest need is for single brothers.
00:50:41 However, all who meet the qualifications, including sisters,
00:50:44 are encouraged to apply for temporary volunteer service.
00:50:49 Serving as a temporary volunteer at Bethel may open
00:50:52 the way to other opportunities
00:50:54 to expand your service to Jehovah.
00:50:57 If you are interested in applying for Bethel service,
00:51:00 which application should you request
00:51:03 from a member of your Congregation Service Committee?
00:51:05 Since there are two types
00:51:07 of applications available, first give careful
00:51:10 and prayerful consideration
00:51:12 to your circumstances.
00:51:14 Thereafter, decide whether you will request from the elders
00:51:18 the Application for Volunteer Program (A-19),
00:51:21 which is available for those interested
00:51:23 in serving on a temporary basis
00:51:25 for as brief as one week or as long
00:51:28 as several consecutive months.
00:51:30 Or you may decide to request
00:51:32 the Application to Become a Member of the Worldwide Order
00:51:35 of Special Full-Time Servants of Jehovah’s Witnesses (A-8).
00:51:40 This application is for those interested
00:51:42 in serving on a long-term basis
00:51:44 for one full year or longer.
00:51:47 If the Branch Committee determines that there is a need
00:51:50 for your services, they will decide
00:51:52 where you can best be used, whether at Bethel
00:51:55 or perhaps on a theocratic construction assignment.
00:51:59 Submitting your application may open
00:52:02 a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah
00:52:04 and his organization in a variety of ways.
00:52:10 Of course, not all of us
00:52:12 who have such a self-sacrificing spirit
00:52:16 have the circumstances in life to serve at Bethel.
00:52:20 But we can encourage others who do.
00:52:23 Parents, follow the example
00:52:26 of God-fearing parents
00:52:28 such as Hannah and Elkanah,
00:52:31 who willingly made their son available
00:52:33 for expanded theocratic privileges.
00:52:37 Continue to place the goal of Bethel service before your young ones,
00:52:41 and stimulate their interest in the full-time ministry
00:52:45 by your example and your positive expressions.
00:52:49 If possible,
00:52:51 bring them on tour of world headquarters in New York, U.S.A.,
00:52:55 or make arrangements to bring them on a tour of the Bethel
00:53:00 in the branch territory in which you live.
00:53:03 Such visits can help young ones to witness firsthand
00:53:07 the work that’s being done at Bethel to promote Kingdom interests.
00:53:12 Elders, help young ones in your congregation
00:53:16 who have the potential to expand their service
00:53:18 to Jehovah to meet the qualifications.
00:53:22 Jehovah continues to look for those willing to respond
00:53:26 to his invitation to expand their service to him.
00:53:30 As in Isaiah’s day, He asks:
00:53:33 “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
00:53:37 Will you answer as did the prophet:
00:53:40 “Here I am! Send me!”
00:53:43 We encourage you to progress to spiritual maturity
00:53:47 and serve Jehovah whole-souled.
00:53:49 In due time, you may qualify to serve at Bethel
00:53:53 or in another form of exciting theocratic service
00:53:57 that permits you to use the health and strength
00:54:00 that Jehovah has granted you in an expanded way,
00:54:03 all to his praise.
00:54:07 Please be assured that we love you
00:54:09 for the willing spirit you show
00:54:12 as you continue to reach out in Jehovah’s service.
00:54:17 Thank you, Pat.
00:54:19 We hope that the information Brother LaFranca shared
00:54:22 motivates many more to have
00:54:25 the prophet Isaiah’s willing and self-sacrificing spirit.
00:54:29 So much of what Jehovah provides encourages us
00:54:33 to keep busy with spiritual things.
00:54:35 For one, we’re looking forward to our upcoming conventions.
00:54:39 The theme for this year is “‘Love Never Fails’!”
00:54:44 Would you like a preview of the program?
00:54:47 Let’s take a look.
00:54:49 Love
00:54:51 —is it gone?
00:54:55 Have we lost it?
00:54:59 Is it the possession of the wealthy?
00:55:03 the strong?
00:55:06 Or is it somewhere else?
00:55:09 At the 2019 convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:55:13 you will learn what real love is,
00:55:16 where to find it,
00:55:18 and how to show it
00:55:19 and have it shown in return.
00:55:27 God cares deeply about you.
00:55:30 And he wants you to know
00:55:31 that in this hate-filled world,
00:55:33 love can be found.
00:55:37 It is not lost.
00:55:39 And that love will never fail.
00:55:49 As we’ve discussed, we should never underestimate the power
00:55:53 of our brotherhood to help us overcome worries and anxiety.
00:55:57 Our conventions are wonderful opportunities for us to encourage one another
00:56:02 by the hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands.
00:56:06 And this year, we’re especially excited
00:56:09 that 24 international conventions
00:56:12 will be held throughout the world.
00:56:15 Use the opportunity to get to know more of your brothers and sisters
00:56:20 at the regional or international convention you attend.
00:56:25 To conclude this month’s program,
00:56:27 let’s visit our brothers in Turkey.
00:56:30 Turkey is a nation of more than 80 million people
00:56:34 and a land rich in Bible history.
00:56:39 Turkey occupies a unique geographic position, bridging Europe and Asia.
00:56:45 It’s here that Noah’s ark came to rest near Mount Ararat,
00:56:49 Turkey’s highest mountain.
00:56:52 This is the land of the congregations in Colossae and Galatia,
00:56:56 as well as all seven congregations
00:56:58 mentioned in Revelation.
00:57:01 The territory is diverse and vast,
00:57:04 with a publisher-to-population ratio
00:57:07 of 1 to more than 26,000.
00:57:12 In the capital city of Ankara,
00:57:14 a single congregation is working hard
00:57:16 to reach almost 5.5 million people.
00:57:21 Many congregations in Turkey focus on public witnessing, with encouraging results.
00:57:27 Let’s visit the Hatay Congregation,
00:57:30 near the ancient city of Syrian Antioch.
00:57:33 Paul used Antioch as his home base for his missionary tours.
00:57:38 And it was here that the disciples were first called Christians.
00:57:43 Today,
00:57:45 this part of Turkey is known for its food
00:57:49 —such as spices, herbs, fruits, and sweets.
00:57:53 In recent times,
00:57:55 unrest and war have disrupted the region.
00:57:59 Some of our brothers and sisters have been so near to the conflict
00:58:04 that they could hear explosions from bombs and gunfire.
00:58:08 Despite these threats and anxieties,
00:58:12 the 56 publishers, including 11 regular pioneers
00:58:17 and 2 special pioneers, attend the meetings
00:58:20 and preach without letup.
00:58:23 Our brothers and sisters in Turkey send their love and greetings
00:58:27 to the worldwide brotherhood.
00:58:29 Our love goes back to them for their zeal and steadfast faith.
00:58:34 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:01 Welcome to this month’s broadcast.
00:00:03 Here are a few highlights
00:00:05 of what we’ll enjoy on the program.
00:00:08 What if changing circumstances in the family
00:00:11 begin pushing mates apart emotionally?
00:00:14 This dramatization of Shaan and Kiara
00:00:17 may provide some timely guidance.
00:00:21 Also, the story of Grace Li
00:00:23 will be an encouragement to any who have faced
00:00:26 severe emotional challenges for taking a stand for the truth.
00:00:30 You’ll see the effect that her actions had on those around her.
00:00:34 And this month’s music video
00:00:36 will reassure us of the love, kindness,
00:00:39 and support we enjoy as Jehovah’s people.
00:00:44 All that and more on this February 2019 edition
00:00:49 of JW Broadcasting!
00:01:10 The theme of this program
00:01:11 is taken from the second part
00:01:13 of Romans 12:10:
00:01:15 “In showing honor to one another,
00:01:17 take the lead.”
00:01:19 What is honor?
00:01:21 In the Hebrew Scriptures, the term translated “honor”
00:01:25 literally means “heaviness.”
00:01:27 So when we honor someone,
00:01:29 we’re acknowledging that he’s weighty
00:01:32 or that he amounts to something.
00:01:34 In the Greek Scriptures, the word is related
00:01:36 to setting a price on something,
00:01:39 meaning that the one we honor is esteemed or has value.
00:01:44 Whom should we honor?
00:01:46 Of course, Jehovah is worthy of honor.
00:01:50 Revelation 4:11 says this
00:01:53 and gives us the reason for giving glory and honor to Jehovah.
00:01:58 It says because he “created all things.”
00:02:03 He is responsible for us having life in the first place.
00:02:08 How do we give him honor?
00:02:10 There are many ways:
00:02:12 We honor him by doing his will
00:02:15 —obeying his laws and principles.
00:02:17 We honor him by extolling his qualities and promises
00:02:21 —telling others about these gifts from God.
00:02:25 We show him honor by contributing financially
00:02:28 to the worldwide educational work
00:02:30 that he’s directing through his Son and holy spirit.
00:02:36 And just as Revelation chapter 4 said
00:02:39 about Jehovah being worthy of the honor,
00:02:42 Revelation 5:12
00:02:45 says that his Son, Christ Jesus,
00:02:47 is worthy of the same.
00:02:50 Verse 12 says of Jesus:
00:02:53 “They were saying with a loud voice:
00:02:55 “‘The Lamb who was slaughtered
00:02:57 “‘is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom
00:03:01 and strength and honor and glory and blessing.’”
00:03:06 How do we show honor to Jesus?
00:03:09 One way is acknowledged in the verse we just read.
00:03:12 He was “slaughtered” like a sacrificial lamb
00:03:15 so that we might have the hope of everlasting life.
00:03:18 We highly esteem, and value, that sacrifice.
00:03:22 We honor Jesus by recognizing his role
00:03:25 as an immortal “King of kings” in the heavens.
00:03:28 And another very practical way to honor Jesus
00:03:31 is to strive to imitate his life and personality
00:03:35 as the model for us to follow closely.
00:03:38 If we take the lead in showing honor,
00:03:41 who else will we view as highly valued
00:03:44 —to be treated with esteem?
00:03:47 Ephesians 6:1, 2 says
00:03:50 that children ‘honor their father and mother’ when they’re obedient to them.
00:03:54 Matthew 15:4-6
00:03:57 makes it clear that adult children
00:03:59 honor their parents and grandparents
00:04:01 by giving material assistance to them as needed.
00:04:06 First Timothy 5:17
00:04:09 urges us to give elders “double honor”
00:04:12 because of their hard work in our behalf.
00:04:14 Romans 13:1, 7
00:04:17 even extends the matter of showing honor
00:04:19 to governmental rulers and others in authority.
00:04:24 First Peter 2:17
00:04:27 broadens the meaning of honor even further saying:
00:04:30 “Honor men of all sorts.”
00:04:33 In addition to being kind and respectful to people in general,
00:04:38 we also honor them by being willing
00:04:40 to spend time sharing the good news with them.
00:04:44 Ephesians 5:22-25
00:04:47 appeals to wives to honor their husbands
00:04:50 by having Christlike subjection for them.
00:04:53 Husbands are to honor their wives by showing them love
00:04:58 and treating them just as Jesus treated the congregation.
00:05:02 And what about our theme text for this discussion?
00:05:06 Who was Paul addressing in Romans chapter 12 when he said:
00:05:10 “In showing honor to one another, take the lead”?
00:05:14 Who are the “one another” in that verse?
00:05:19 Look at Romans 1:7 with me.
00:05:24 Paul says he’s writing “to all those who are in Rome
00:05:29 as God’s beloved ones, called to be holy ones.”
00:05:33 So all of us in the Christian congregation
00:05:35 are to have honor for each other.
00:05:39 I’d like to spend the balance of my time
00:05:42 discussing two of the many opportunities
00:05:45 we have to show honor
00:05:47 (they’re the last two that I just referenced):
00:05:51 first, marriage mates showing honor to each other,
00:05:55 and second, showing honor to one another in our congregations.
00:06:01 Marriages in general today are seriously lacking in honor.
00:06:05 Marriage mates often demean one another
00:06:08 with harsh words and disrespectful attitudes.
00:06:13 Some in the world resort to physical violence,
00:06:16 as if that somehow makes the abusive one right
00:06:19 in his view of whatever the issue is.
00:06:21 And infidelity on the part of one or both mates is so common
00:06:26 it doesn’t even raise eyebrows anymore.
00:06:29 All of this is a gross lack of honor in marriage.
00:06:35 But what about marriages
00:06:37 of those professing to be Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:06:41 We’re blessed with so many marriages
00:06:43 that are wholesome and honorable.
00:06:46 True, none are perfect.
00:06:50 But how blessed we are to have the truth
00:06:52 and to have learned to be more and more Christlike with each other.
00:06:57 We’ve learned to shed things that we heard when we were growing up.
00:07:02 However, the matter of honoring our marriage mate
00:07:05 needs to be discussed.
00:07:08 While relatively few of our marriages
00:07:10 end up with some kind of physical violence
00:07:13 and relatively few end up in divorce,
00:07:16 what about having honor in the marriage?
00:07:21 After living together as husband and wife
00:07:23 for many months or for years or even for decades,
00:07:27 familiarity can cause us
00:07:29 to treat each other with less respect or honor
00:07:32 than when we were courting.
00:07:35 That isn’t right.
00:07:37 It isn’t Christlike.
00:07:40 But with our inherited imperfection,
00:07:43 we may succumb to dishonorable words and behavior
00:07:46 with the one that we promised to treasure
00:07:48 “until death do us part.”
00:07:52 How can we get a grip on this trait and minimize the times
00:07:56 that we have a clash of spirit and words?
00:08:00 First, let’s consider
00:08:03 the two basic responsibilities assigned to marriage mates.
00:08:07 This is the foundation
00:08:09 that we can then build on to improve.
00:08:14 The role of the husband is clearly stated
00:08:17 at 1 Corinthians 11:3.
00:08:20 And while some wives in society may bristle at this thought,
00:08:25 wives serving Jehovah are to embrace this thought.
00:08:29 It’s the arrangement of God.
00:08:32 First Corinthians 11:3 says:
00:08:36 “But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ;
00:08:40 “in turn, the head of a woman is the man;
00:08:43 in turn, the head of the Christ is God.”
00:08:46 God’s Word says that “the head of a woman is the man.”
00:08:51 However, the head of the woman
00:08:54 is not to be a domineering man,
00:08:57 not an abusive man —verbally or physically.
00:09:01 He is to imitate his head.
00:09:03 And who is that?
00:09:05 What did the first part of the verse say?
00:09:07 “The head of every man is the Christ.”
00:09:12 In fact, Ephesians chapter 5
00:09:15 strikes this fine balance between being a head of the wife
00:09:19 and being a loving head like the Christ.
00:09:22 Ephesians 5:22, 23 says:
00:09:26 “Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord,
00:09:31 “[But what of the disposition of the husband?]
00:09:34 “because a husband is head of his wife
00:09:37 “just as the Christ is head of the congregation,
00:09:40 he being a savior of this body.”
00:09:44 That verse says it all.
00:09:48 Verse 33 of the same chapter says this:
00:09:52 “Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself;
00:09:57 “on the other hand,
00:09:59 the wife should have deep respect for her husband.”
00:10:04 There’s nowhere in God’s Word
00:10:07 that says that if one mate pushes the other mate’s button
00:10:11 —emotionally— that it cancels
00:10:13 the offended mate’s obligation to be Christlike.
00:10:17 The problem is that when one mate is offended or hurt,
00:10:21 it’s so easy to roll the eyes in disgust
00:10:26 or to lash back with a verbal insult.
00:10:29 Then the other mate fires back with another harsh, cutting remark.
00:10:34 It’s like wind on a forest fire.
00:10:37 Tempers blaze, and the evening goes up in smoke.
00:10:41 It’s not at all Christlike.
00:10:44 There is no honor shown in such a conflagration.
00:10:49 It has to stop sooner rather than later.
00:10:55 The January 15, 2015, issue of The Watchtower said this:
00:11:00 “Remember that marriage is not a competition
00:11:05 “to find out who is stronger, who can shout louder,
00:11:08 “or who can think of the most cutting remark.
00:11:11 “True, we all have flaws, and sometimes we upset others.
00:11:16 “But there is never a justifiable reason
00:11:19 “for either a husband or a wife
00:11:22 “to use sarcastic and demeaning speech,
00:11:25 or worse, to shove or hit each other.”
00:11:30 How can we change the atmosphere?
00:11:33 Someone needs to put out the fire
00:11:36 with the water of God’s Word.
00:11:40 Romans 12:10b, again:
00:11:43 “In showing honor to one another, take the lead.”
00:11:49 One of the mates must take the lead
00:11:51 even if at the time they’re apologizing for their own behavior
00:11:55 by acknowledging that they didn’t respond in a Christlike way saying,
00:12:00 “Forgive me.”
00:12:03 That same issue of The Watchtower cited two scriptures:
00:12:07 one for the husband and one for the wife.
00:12:10 We’ll first read Proverbs 17:27.
00:12:16 Husbands, listen to this
00:12:19 and apply it prior to a rift
00:12:22 or even during the conflict.
00:12:24 Proverbs 17:27:
00:12:27 “A man of knowledge restrains his words,
00:12:31 and a discerning man will remain calm.”
00:12:35 Husbands, does that describe us?
00:12:41 Now wives,
00:12:43 please locate Proverbs 31:26.
00:12:49 Does this describe your speech even when some altercation occurs?
00:12:55 Proverbs 31:26:
00:12:57 “She opens her mouth in wisdom;
00:12:59 the law of kindness is on her tongue.”
00:13:03 Usually after a misunderstanding and rash words have been said,
00:13:08 we feel miserable and upset.
00:13:11 We often chastise ourselves for adding fuel to the fire.
00:13:16 How much better to train ourselves to restrain our words
00:13:20 and remain calm and to speak
00:13:22 in wisdom and with kindness of tongue.
00:13:27 Meet Emil and Firuca Gârbovan from Romania.
00:13:32 They’re good examples of how the power of God’s Word
00:13:35 can mold and change the attitudes of marriage mates
00:13:38 who are willing to be guided by it.
00:13:43 It was in 1983 when I met Firuca.
00:13:49 I already had two little girls.
00:13:52 One was seven years old,
00:13:54 and the other one was three.
00:13:56 I accepted to study the Bible.
00:13:58 My husband worked
00:14:00 as a warrant officer for the police,
00:14:02 so at the beginning, I studied in secret.
00:14:06 Then I decided to tell him the truth.
00:14:08 When I found out
00:14:11 that my wife was studying the Bible
00:14:13 in order to become
00:14:15 one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:14:17 I became very sad.
00:14:19 And I realized that our marriage
00:14:21 and our family was in danger
00:14:24 because I only knew bad things
00:14:26 about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:14:31 He threatened he would divorce me, and he did.
00:14:36 The divorce was a very difficult time in my life
00:14:40 because I was seven months pregnant with our third daughter.
00:14:45 Following the divorce, my husband was given the house and custody
00:14:50 of our two daughters.
00:14:53 I had to leave the house,
00:14:55 and I stayed for almost a year with two families of our brothers.
00:15:03 I saw Jehovah’s love toward me,
00:15:06 and I loved Jehovah very much,
00:15:09 but I loved my husband too.
00:15:14 One day, as I was walking
00:15:17 and holding the little girl’s hand,
00:15:20 I saw Firuca’s husband walking toward me.
00:15:23 My heart stopped,
00:15:25 and I said to myself,
00:15:28 ‘He is going to hit me!’
00:15:31 But Emil was a gentleman.
00:15:33 And he took the little girl in his arms,
00:15:36 talked to her for a few minutes,
00:15:39 and then he put her back down and left.
00:15:43 When I saw him leaving, I thanked Jehovah
00:15:47 because he didn’t beat me.
00:15:51 In 1990, I looked for my wife
00:15:55 and I told her that I would like to remarry her
00:15:58 to reunite our family.
00:16:01 And, after a while, she agreed
00:16:03 and step-by-step I started to study.
00:16:07 In 2003, I became
00:16:10 one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:16:13 I am very happy that I made this change,
00:16:16 and I regret that I didn’t do it sooner.
00:16:22 I personally saw
00:16:24 how the truth can change a person’s life,
00:16:27 even in my own family.
00:16:31 Currently, I serve as an elder.
00:16:33 And in 2010, I became a regular pioneer.
00:16:37 When I see Emil conduct
00:16:40 the Bible study next to me,
00:16:43 I feel like kneeling rather than standing
00:16:47 to thank Jehovah.
00:16:52 So to married couples who love Jehovah we repeat:
00:16:56 “In showing honor . . . , take the lead.”
00:17:00 The principles just discussed can also be applied
00:17:03 when showing honor to others in the congregation.
00:17:06 Like the husband and wife that we just discussed,
00:17:09 all of us should be improving in imitating Jesus
00:17:13 and in ‘following his steps closely’ in all of our interactions
00:17:17 with fellow believers in the congregation.
00:17:21 How do we show honor to one another?
00:17:23 One way is well described
00:17:25 at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.
00:17:30 We show honor when we put the other person’s feelings
00:17:33 and needs ahead of our own.
00:17:36 First Corinthians 10:23, 24:
00:17:40 “All things are lawful,
00:17:43 “but not all things are advantageous.
00:17:45 “All things are lawful, but not all things build up.
00:17:49 “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage,
00:17:53 but that of the other person.”
00:17:56 We show honor when we suppress our own rights.
00:18:00 What we do or say might be lawful, but is it advantageous?
00:18:05 Will it build up?
00:18:07 Verse 24, then, concisely says it:
00:18:11 “Keep seeking, not [our] own advantage [or right],
00:18:14 but that of the other person.”
00:18:18 We show honor to others when we do good deeds for them.
00:18:22 Possibly, it’s even a humble task
00:18:25 that an elderly publisher needs done.
00:18:28 It could be offering to clean the house,
00:18:30 take them to the store, or fill some other need.
00:18:34 The principle is at Luke 22:26:
00:18:37 “You, though, are not to be that way.
00:18:40 “But let the one who is the greatest among you
00:18:42 “become as the youngest,
00:18:44 and the one taking the lead as the one ministering.”
00:18:49 Earlier, I cited 1 Timothy 5:17,
00:18:53 where we’re urged to give elders “double honor”
00:18:56 because of their hard work in our behalf.
00:18:58 They’re also part of our congregation and deserve honor.
00:19:03 In our August program last year,
00:19:05 Brother Lett helped us consider much of what is involved.
00:19:09 You’ll recall that his subject was
00:19:12 “Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”
00:19:15 We minister to or honor others
00:19:18 when we readily forgive them
00:19:20 if they’ve embarrassed us or hurt our feelings.
00:19:24 Overall, Jehovah’s people do quite well
00:19:27 in honoring one another  in the congregation.
00:19:30 But here is the question:
00:19:32 Are we improving in this aspect
00:19:35 of our Christian personality?
00:19:38 In our theme scripture,
00:19:40 Paul didn’t just say to honor one another.
00:19:44 He said to “widen out” or reach out
00:19:47 in this aspect of our Christian life.
00:19:50 His words were to “take the lead.”
00:19:54 If Paul had just said to show honor to each other,
00:19:58 that would be like a teacher
00:20:00 urging a group of literate students to learn to read.
00:20:04 If they’re literate, they don’t need to learn to read.
00:20:08 But what might the teacher be urging them to do?
00:20:12 He might encourage them to read better, or to improve.
00:20:17 Love is the identifying mark of Christ’s disciples.
00:20:21 So honor is something we’ve learned to show.
00:20:25 However, like the teacher,
00:20:28 Paul is urging us to improve in this area.
00:20:32 He said take the lead in showing honor.
00:20:36 The footnote says this could be rendered
00:20:38 taking the “initiative” in showing honor.
00:20:43 Instead of waiting
00:20:44 for some obvious reason to do good for others
00:20:47 —to commend someone, to check on a shut-in—
00:20:50 look for opportunities to take the initiative
00:20:53 to show honor in the family and in our congregations.
00:20:58 Yes, “in showing honor . . . ,  take the lead”!
00:21:05 At times, changing circumstances
00:21:08 can make it challenging to show honor.
00:21:12 In this dramatization, note how the husband and wife
00:21:15 adjusted to a change while learning new ways
00:21:19 to continue showing love and honor to each other.
00:21:27 My name is Kiara,
00:21:30 and that’s my husband, Shaan.
00:21:39 Our son Akil moved out recently
00:21:42 to help where the need is greater.
00:21:45 I didn’t realize just how much he made us laugh.
00:21:50 I miss that.
00:21:55 It’s just more quiet now.
00:21:59 But more than that,
00:22:02 I felt we were growing apart.
00:22:21 I tried talking to him.
00:22:24 It didn’t go well.
00:22:45 Ever since Akil left,
00:22:47 things have been off between Kiara and I.
00:23:35 She is so serious now.
00:23:38 I wish she would just lighten up
00:23:41 and laugh more,
00:23:44 like when Akil was still here.
00:23:47 As much as I hated to admit it,
00:23:50 it felt like we were growing apart.
00:23:58 Even Akil noticed.
00:24:00 Anyway, can I ask you guys a question?
00:24:04 Are you both doing OK?
00:24:06 Because you don’t look OK.
00:24:08 Of course, we’re OK. OK?
00:24:10 We’re doing wonderful, right?
00:24:12 Yeah, we’re doing good.
00:24:13 Everything is good.
00:24:13 Yeah.
00:24:19 We weren’t fooling anyone
00:24:22 —except maybe ourselves.
00:24:27 And for the first time,
00:24:29 we both revealed to each other
00:24:31 just how we had been really feeling.
00:24:36 We knew we were headed down a dangerous path.
00:24:39 We had to do something —fast.
00:24:47 We read aloud the scripture
00:24:49 at Romans 12:10:
00:24:52 “In showing honor to one another, take the lead.”
00:24:58 We thought about Abraham and Sarah.
00:25:01 They weren’t perfect,
00:25:04 but they worked hard to show honor to each other
00:25:08 by listening and by caring.
00:25:20 I told Kiara, “I know I can do better.”
00:25:24 And I wanted to
00:25:26 because I love her so much.
00:25:31 I told Shaan, “Let’s both try to do better.”
00:25:39 So we did.
00:26:24 A few months later, we decided to pioneer together.
00:26:28 Now it seemed we had a lot to talk about.
00:26:33 I felt like I was seeing  a whole new side of Kiara.
00:26:38 Like Abraham and Sarah, our marriage wasn’t perfect.
00:26:43 There are going to be stressful times.
00:26:46 But by working hard to apply Bible principles,
00:26:50 we got through that rough patch
00:26:52 and it drew us even closer together.
00:26:59 First Corinthians 13:4, 7 tell us:
00:27:03 “Love is patient and kind” and “bears all things,
00:27:07 believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”
00:27:12 Our dramatization helped us to see how love can adapt
00:27:16 to changing needs and circumstances.
00:27:19 But wouldn’t it be nice to talk with some real-life examples
00:27:22 of those who have developed such skills?
00:27:25 Well, we have a special treat.
00:27:28 A longtime faithful couple has joined us in the studio
00:27:33 —William and Angela Samuelson,
00:27:35 who serve at Patterson Bethel in the United States.
00:27:39 Now, of course, we’ve known each other for decades,
00:27:42 and I know you as Bill and Angie,
00:27:45 so that’s the way I’ll refer to you.
00:27:47 So nice that you could be here and be interviewed.
00:27:51 What’s helped you both maintain a happy marriage?
00:27:55 Well, we work as a team, so we always check
00:27:59 with each other before making decisions,
00:28:01 even in areas where we wouldn’t necessarily have to
00:28:05 —it would be OK to go ahead.
00:28:07 But just out of respect,
00:28:08 we talk with each other about any decisions that we make.
00:28:13 And, you know, Brother Morris, we’ve been married 60 years now,
00:28:16 and we’ve never really had a real serious argument.
00:28:20 We’ve had some disagreements but nothing ever serious.
00:28:24 And whenever we have those kind of words, why, we never use
00:28:29 demeaning language or say derogatory things about each other,
00:28:34 and that makes me very happy.
00:28:36 Yeah, that’s commendable.
00:28:38 Early in our marriage, there was one occasion
00:28:42 when Angie was upset with me about something
00:28:44 —it could’ve been anything—
00:28:46 and in the conversation, it obviously showed in her tone of voice.
00:28:50 So I explained to her that she could say anything she wanted
00:28:54 as long as she smiled when she said it.
00:28:57 Well, she tried, and we both had a good laugh.
00:29:01 It’s very hard to stay mad when you’re smiling.
00:29:04 Smiling—very, very good advice.
00:29:06 What about in the congregation?
00:29:08 How have you been able to show each other honor there?
00:29:12 Well, when we have assignments
00:29:14 from the platform, either of us, we work together.
00:29:18 Angie is much better
00:29:22 with grammar and pronunciation than I am,
00:29:25 and so I’ll check with her to make sure
00:29:27 that I’m saying things as correctly as possible.
00:29:31 And she checks with me
00:29:33 on prophetic significance, for example,
00:29:35 or theocratic understanding or procedure and timing.
00:29:40 Yes, and something that’s very important
00:29:44 is when we do check with each other, we’re not thin-skinned
00:29:48 about the advice that we want to give each other.
00:29:51 I’ll call it advice.
00:29:53 And that makes life a lot easier.
00:29:56 We don’t get angry because we’ve been told
00:29:58 we need to improve on something.
00:30:01 That’s excellent.
00:30:02 You also spent a long time
00:30:04 in the traveling work before coming to Bethel.
00:30:06 We knew you in the traveling work —early ’70’s and then later
00:30:10 when we were down South and you were assigned down there.
00:30:13 What did you learn about showing honor
00:30:16 in that avenue of service?
00:30:18 Well, as you say, we were in the traveling work
00:30:20 for 33 years, just over.
00:30:23 And for most of those years, we would have other assignments.
00:30:27 I would be working with the district
00:30:29 —now regional— convention organization
00:30:32 or other assignments,
00:30:34 and it meant that Angie would be alone
00:30:36 in the congregation.
00:30:38 She never complained;
00:30:40 nor did she become unduly inquisitive about my assignment,
00:30:45 which sometimes would’ve been confidential.
00:30:48 When we had an unexpected move that came up,
00:30:51 a change of assignment somewhere,
00:30:54 Angie would just pack and be ready to go.
00:30:56 That’s right. That was my job—packing.
00:31:01 And in the field ministry, Brother Morris,
00:31:04 we would usually be in separate car groups
00:31:06 because Bill would work with the brothers and I would work with the sisters.
00:31:09 And I really appreciated the fact
00:31:12 that he always made sure I had a safe driver.
00:31:15 It worked out most of the time.
00:31:17 And if we had a territory that was a little scary,
00:31:22 why, he made sure that we were safe in the territory.
00:31:25 So I appreciated that very much.
00:31:27 In one congregation,
00:31:29 (you know, things don’t always go the way we plan)
00:31:33 the brother scheduling the meals
00:31:36 had scheduled two families
00:31:39 for the same noon meal for us.
00:31:41 The one sister was deaf;
00:31:44 and she had always had the traveling brother on a certain day;
00:31:47 and she didn’t hear when she was told it wouldn’t be that day.
00:31:51 So she had gone ahead and prepared a meal.
00:31:53 In the meantime, we had been assigned to another home,
00:31:56 where they served us a full course
00:31:59 —or courses— of an Italian meal.
00:32:01 While we were eating, we found out
00:32:03 that the other sister was waiting for us.
00:32:06 She would’ve been highly offended if somebody didn’t come.
00:32:08 So I went to the Kingdom Hall
00:32:11 and handled the meeting for field service after the meal,
00:32:13 and Angie went to the sister.
00:32:16 That sister would probably still be mad at me if Angie hadn’t gone.
00:32:20 Boy, was I sleepy that afternoon after two big meals.
00:32:23 I bet. Well, you handled that very Christlike.
00:32:27 Now, as we mentioned, your current assignment is here at Bethel.
00:32:32 How have you navigated the unique challenges
00:32:34 of this form of service while still honoring one another?
00:32:39 Well, as you know, we work in different departments,
00:32:42 but we respect that some things
00:32:45 are confidential to that department.
00:32:48 So we don’t make the work of our department
00:32:52 a major part of our conversation.
00:32:54 We could have an energy problem
00:32:56 at the end of the day after working all day,
00:32:59 so Bill is very considerate about accepting too many social invitations.
00:33:02 Isn’t that nice?
00:33:04 And so we respect each other’s limitations
00:33:06 when it comes to physical
00:33:08 and just energy in general.
00:33:11 Well, that’s certainly honoring each other.
00:33:15 Well, Bill and Angie,
00:33:17 those were practical and encouraging comments.
00:33:19 We really thank you so much
00:33:21 for taking the time and allowing us to interview you,
00:33:25 and we really appreciate your good example all these decades.
00:33:28 Well, thank you.
00:33:29 Thank you.
00:33:32 While the Samuelsons are a wonderful example to try to imitate,
00:33:37 we know that many marriages
00:33:39 may have a more difficult start, or in some cases,
00:33:42 the mates may not share the same spiritual values.
00:33:46 What can be done if we find this to be true in our case?
00:33:51 Notice how sister Grace Li
00:33:54 from Great Britain dealt with these challenges in her marriage.
00:33:59 I was born in Hong Kong in 1952.
00:34:04 When I was just over 14 years of age,
00:34:07 my mother sat me down and said,
00:34:10 “Look, there’s a marriage maker,
00:34:13 “and the gentleman has agreed
00:34:15 to take you as his wife.”
00:34:18 I was absolutely petrified!
00:34:20 I had never met him before.
00:34:22 There was actually
00:34:24 a 20-year difference between our ages,
00:34:27 but I was willing to go through with it because I love my mum.
00:34:30 I wanted her to be able  to have a chance of happiness.
00:34:34 I came to England,  and not long after that,
00:34:38 we started our first  Chinese take-away in that little town.
00:34:42 I had to work very hard seven days a week
00:34:46 to help my husband  run the business.
00:34:53 I was the only Chinese woman  in the entire town.
00:34:57 I had nowhere  to ask for help
00:34:59 or advice, so I had a really bad time.
00:35:04 When my second daughter was born,
00:35:06 one night she just stopped breathing.
00:35:09 And a few minutes later,  the nurse came out and said,
00:35:12 “God wanted a flower for his garden,
00:35:15 and that’s  where your daughter has gone.”
00:35:17 So at that moment in time,  I was very angry.
00:35:20 And I felt sad and sorrow and lonely.
00:35:24 And I had horrible guilt:
00:35:27 “It’s my fault.
00:35:29 Or it’s God’s; it’s his fault.”
00:35:33 So I stopped praying to God.
00:35:36 One day, there was one very kind lady
00:35:40 who came and knocked on my door.
00:35:43 And then, eventually,
00:35:45 one day, the ladies stopped and had a conversation,
00:35:49 and the conversation led
00:35:51 to why people die
00:35:53 and what happens when they’re dead.
00:35:55 Knowing it’s nobody’s fault
00:35:57 —it’s just our imperfection—
00:35:59 I found it a great relief.
00:36:01 God did not punish me for that.
00:36:03 And from then on, I started a Bible study with her.
00:36:08 But my study  was progressing very slow.
00:36:11 By that time, I had six children.
00:36:14 I also had to work full-time.
00:36:17 And also, the lady didn’t speak Chinese,
00:36:20 and my English was no better than her Chinese either.
00:36:27 Since I dedicated my life to Jehovah,
00:36:31 it’s not been easy.
00:36:33 As far as my husband was concerned,
00:36:35 his wife should be concentrating
00:36:38 on looking after the family and the business
00:36:40 and shouldn’t be wasting time on religions like that.
00:36:43 My mum, as well, was very much against me
00:36:47 becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:36:52 My husband shouted at me.
00:36:54 Often he gave me a hard time because I wanted to take
00:36:56 all my children to the meetings.
00:37:01 One day, he wanted me to choose
00:37:04 between him or Jehovah.
00:37:07 And I prayed to Jehovah.
00:37:09 I said, “Jehovah, now is the time
00:37:11 I need your holy spirit to help me.”
00:37:13 And I said,  “My husband is a good man,
00:37:15 “and he deserves to know why
00:37:18 I chose this life.”
00:37:21 And I just felt so calm,
00:37:24 and then I turned around and asked my husband:
00:37:26 “What do you think of me  since I became a Witness?
00:37:29 Am I a better wife, or am I getting worse?”
00:37:33 So my husband said: “Oh, OK then.
00:37:37 If that is the case, go serve your God, Jehovah.”
00:37:43 Before my mother died,
00:37:45 my mother actually prayed to Jehovah
00:37:47 to thank him and to say
00:37:51 that since I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:37:55 I became a better daughter.
00:37:57 I remember, one day,
00:38:00 one of my Bible students came to my house,
00:38:03 and she was crying
00:38:06 because she suffered persecution from her husband.
00:38:08 And my husband was sitting next to me,
00:38:12 and he turned around and said,
00:38:14 “You just have to persevere,
00:38:17 “because my wife went through  the same experience,
00:38:21 and look where she is now.”
00:38:24 For the last ten years, my husband has come
00:38:26 to all the meetings with me.
00:38:29 Seeing my children happy is the most important thing for me.
00:38:33 And they are happy not only for a short time
00:38:37 but they also have a happy future.
00:38:39 My life now—I’m no longer lonely;
00:38:42 I’m no longer a fatherless child,
00:38:45 because I know Jehovah cares for me.
00:38:48 Jehovah helped a little woman like me,
00:38:50 and I’m sure Jehovah will help anybody
00:38:53 whose heart is toward him.
00:38:56 Sister Li’s example helps us to see
00:38:58 that even in spiritually divided homes,
00:39:01 applying Bible principles in our life
00:39:04 can often soften the heart of our mate toward the truth.
00:39:07 Having seen some beautiful examples
00:39:10 of showing honor within our marriage,
00:39:12 let’s now look at ways of showing honor
00:39:14 to one another in the congregation.
00:39:17 For example, what if we’re serving in a foreign territory
00:39:21 where the customs and culture
00:39:23 are quite different from what we’re accustomed to?
00:39:26 This is just one of many challenges often faced
00:39:29 by ones involved in the international construction work.
00:39:33 What have they found to be helpful
00:39:35 when adapting to new environments?
00:41:39 Did you notice the beautiful thought
00:41:42 that every culture has its own strong points
00:41:45 that we can learn from and apply in our lives?
00:41:49 What an excellent way to cultivate
00:41:51 an attitude of viewing others as superior!
00:41:55 But what about ones outside the congregation?
00:41:58 Do we show honor to them as well?
00:42:01 Of course.
00:42:03 Galatians 6:10 tells us:
00:42:05 “As long as we have the opportunity,
00:42:08 let us work what is good toward all.”
00:42:11 The best way we can do this is
00:42:13 by helping them cultivate and satisfy their spiritual needs.
00:42:18 We now visit a town in the state of Oregon in the United States
00:42:22 where the congregations had a unique opportunity to do just this.
00:42:28 An exciting event took place
00:42:30 in 2017 across the United States.
00:42:33 August 21, 2017,
00:42:35 has been on a lot of people’s calendars
00:42:37 for a long time because of the total eclipse.
00:42:39 As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are constantly on the lookout
00:42:42 for events where we can support community outreach.
00:42:46 Brothers and sisters
00:42:48 prepared well in advance to give a Bible education
00:42:50 to the many travelers.
00:42:52 What convinced us that this was an opportunity
00:42:55 to give a great witness was that we did a little research,
00:42:58 and we noticed the hotel bookings.
00:43:01 The town was packed,
00:43:03 so we could tell that this was going to be a big event.
00:43:05 We needed to do something.
00:43:07 We wanted to be in a position to share
00:43:09 the wonderful things from the Bible with them.
00:43:12 We needed to take a global approach.
00:43:14 We had to identify all the resources in Bend
00:43:16 and not just do it by individual congregation.
00:43:19 So in our campaign we decided to feature three primary tools:
00:43:23 first, What Does the Bible Really Teach? because many people wonder;
00:43:27 second, Was Life Created? because with an eclipse event,
00:43:31 people are thinking about the universe, and it’s a good opportunity
00:43:35 to talk about our Creator;
00:43:36 and third,
00:43:38 jw.org,
00:43:40 since we expect a lot of visitors from all over the world,
00:43:42 we can reach them in their language.
00:43:44 Over 200 brothers and sisters attended two seminars
00:43:48 put on by local brothers to help prepare individuals for the massive campaign.
00:43:54 We had examples of what not to do and what to do
00:43:58 so as to benefit as many people as possible.
00:44:02 We had an interview;
00:44:04 we had demonstrations on how to speak to people in different languages.
00:44:10 We’re expecting people from many different parts of the world.
00:44:14 It’s actually an opportunity
00:44:16 to be like a missionary in our own hometown.
00:44:19 Some of the estimates that we have heard are conservative estimates
00:44:22 of probably 200,000 visitors.
00:44:24 It may be more than that.
00:44:27 The local congregations made themselves available
00:44:30 to work with city officials
00:44:32 to prepare the parks for the large influx of people.
00:44:35 So many of Jehovah’s Witnesses have volunteered
00:44:38 to help with all kinds of things.
00:44:40 These are really small communities that are having a very large influx of people.
00:44:44 So all of that extra effort
00:44:46 and help in kind of preparing and cleaning up
00:44:49 is much appreciated.
00:44:52 We have been working with Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:44:54 for a period of years here at Smith Rock.
00:44:56 It’s been a good experience for our staff and our volunteers,
00:44:59 and we want to accommodate that in any way we can.
00:45:02 There’s been a lot of good things happening with cart witnessing.
00:45:05 One of the friends had a nice experience with an Arabic-speaking man,
00:45:09 and she said the seminar  is what helped her to be prepared.
00:45:13 She knew how to work the app,
00:45:15 how to find the video in the language,
00:45:17 and she already had it downloaded and ready to go.
00:45:20 Paul spoke about his ministry.
00:45:23 He said: “Woe is me if I did not declare the good news!”
00:45:26 So we don’t want to look back and wish we would’ve done more.
00:45:31 Trying it for the first time can be scary.
00:45:33 It can be nerve-racking,
00:45:34 but it’s not so scary after you get started.
00:45:37 What’s really been fun is what we are calling roving.
00:45:41 We go into an area where there are a lot of people,
00:45:44 and we just start conversations.
00:45:46 We don’t carry any literature.
00:45:48 We just have our device
00:45:50 and the jw.org contact card.
00:45:53 And then, hopefully, if the opportunity presents itself,
00:45:56 we may share with them a video
00:45:59 or tell them we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:46:01 It’s just been a paradise for them
00:46:03 —a preaching paradise— all these visitors coming in.
00:46:05 We may not see the results
00:46:08 of the seed that was planted when they took a look at our cart,
00:46:10 but Jehovah knows
00:46:13 and the angels know and can make that grow.
00:46:17 This endeavor has really helped me to appreciate
00:46:19 the need to be alert to ways to expand our ministry.
00:46:23 Most communities have a calendar of events.
00:46:27 Have we thought about looking at it
00:46:29 and then making plans to give a witness
00:46:32 by having our literature carts out?
00:46:35 And, really, events like this, they have a bigger impact
00:46:38 on us as Jehovah’s Witnesses because we have an opportunity to talk.
00:46:42 We get excited about our work.
00:46:44 We’re all working together shoulder to shoulder.
00:46:46 It really builds our faith.
00:46:48 Recently, a scripture that stood out to me was 1 Chronicles 28:20,
00:46:53 where it says: “Be courageous . . . and go to work.”
00:46:57 It helped me to realize that I just need to take the initiative and try.
00:47:01 That’s what we all need to do,
00:47:04 and then let Jehovah decide how things turn out.
00:47:07 Jehovah will no doubt bless your efforts
00:47:10 as you show an interest in others.
00:47:14 The interest we show in others is most noteworthy
00:47:18 within the bounds of our own brotherhood.
00:47:20 Galatians 6:10, which we quoted earlier,
00:47:23 ends its thought about working “good toward all,”
00:47:25 saying that we should do this
00:47:27 “especially toward those related to us in the faith.”
00:47:31 Our music video entitled You Can Count on Me
00:47:35 provides a touching example of how this “good” can be shown.
00:47:49 Time and circumstance Don’t always work in our favor.
00:47:59 What might have been if we just had the chance
00:48:05 Is something we may never know.
00:48:12 But God looks down and sees; He knows us better than we do.
00:48:22 He sees what we are and what more we could be.
00:48:28 It’s all in the way that we go.
00:48:35 He values all of us, No matter what talent or gift we possess.
00:48:46 He wants each one of us To be as caring as he is.
00:48:57 So you’re my friend ’cause you’re always there
00:49:02 Through our ups and downs and through all we’ve shared.
00:49:06 And I’m there  When you need someone,
00:49:11 when things are hard to bear.
00:49:15 I’ll be the friend you need. You can count on me.
00:49:28 We weep with those who weep, Sharing the things that we’re feeling.
00:49:39 But sometimes our tears may be all that can speak,
00:49:45 Expressing what words cannot say. Troubles can bring us down.
00:49:57 Jehovah can lift us and carry us through.
00:50:03 We all can do the same And help each other as friends do.
00:50:13 And you’re my friend ’cause you’re always there
00:50:19 Through our ups and downs and through all we’ve shared.
00:50:23 And I’m there When you need someone,
00:50:28 when things are hard to bear.
00:50:31 I’ll be the friend you need. You can count on me.
00:50:58 And you’re my friend ’cause you’re always there
00:51:03 Through our ups and downs and through all we’ve shared.
00:51:07 And I’m there When you need someone,
00:51:12 when things are hard to bear.
00:51:16 I’ll be the friend you need. You can count on me.
00:51:32 We conclude this month’s program by traveling to Indonesia.
00:51:36 Composed of more than 17,000 islands,
00:51:39 it consists of hundreds of distinct native,
00:51:42 ethnic, and linguistic groups,
00:51:45 with the largest being the Javanese.
00:51:47 Let’s visit the city of Malang,
00:51:49 which has some 370 publishers
00:51:52 in 9 congregations.
00:51:54 The territory here is productive,
00:51:56 with many who are open to the Bible’s message.
00:52:00 The largest challenge our brothers face here is economic hardship.
00:52:04 It’s not easy to provide even basic necessities,
00:52:08 so many people in the territory work long hours.
00:52:12 However, the pioneers
00:52:14 have found an ingenious way to make a living
00:52:16 making milk, juice, and cakes from soybeans.
00:52:19 A typical day will have them up at 3:00 a.m.
00:52:23 making fresh soy products
00:52:25 and then selling them on the street in the morning.
00:52:29 In the afternoon they preach and go to the market that evening
00:52:32 to buy fresh ingredients for the next day’s work.
00:52:36 While the brothers in Malang have not yet been able to obtain a permit
00:52:39 for an official Kingdom Hall, they often meet in private homes.
00:52:43 Although it can be cramped and hot,
00:52:45 attendance is nearly always well over 100 percent.
00:52:49 The publishers in Malang
00:52:51 send their warm love and greetings
00:52:54 to our entire global brotherhood.

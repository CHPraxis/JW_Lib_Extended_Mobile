Daily, millions of ants

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:13.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
travel from their nest to their hunting grounds

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:15.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with nearly no congestion.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When army ants leave their nests,

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they navigate around those returning with food,

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instinctively adjusting
to the returning ants’ limited maneuverability.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When leaf-cutter ants encounter slow-moving,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
load-carrying members, they adapt

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reducing speed, forming clusters,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moving as a collective group.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Researchers say that this actually

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps ants reach their destination quicker,

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they will have the right-of-way

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid head-on collisions

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with ants coming out of the nest.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, ants can communicate

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by touching antennae,
enabling them to overcome

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more complex navigational problems.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, 
billions of hours each year are wasted

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when individuals find themselves locked in traffic.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.924 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Scientists hope to mimic the ant’s instinctive adaptability

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:13.177 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by designing traffic systems

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:15.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that optimize vehicle flow

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.306 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
through changing road conditions.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the ant’s ability to avoid congestion

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come about by evolution?

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

The wings of an owl enable it
to fly in virtual silence.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The feathers on the leading edge are serrated.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One theory suggests
that this helps break up the flow of air,

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reducing noise.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile, the trailing edge of the wing

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a flexible fringe,

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
further dispersing airflow.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nearly all remaining sound

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is then absorbed

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the velvetlike feathers
on the owl’s wings.

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:42.646 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Scientists from Cambridge University

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:43.772 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are developing a coating

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:45.399 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
mimicking this wing structure

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.776 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for use on wind turbines.

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:49.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Early tests show that the coating

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:51.155 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
significantly increases

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:52.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
blade speed and efficiency,

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while drastically reducing noise.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the future,
scientists hope similar coatings

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be applied
to a wide range of applications.

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:06.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the owl’s wing evolve?

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

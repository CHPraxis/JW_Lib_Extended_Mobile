00:00:09 Colors fade on man-made materials
00:00:12 —for example, paint and clothing.
00:00:17 Yet, for many species of birds this isn’t the case.
00:00:22 Their feathers remain permanently bright and vivid.
00:00:27 What’s their secret?
00:00:30 Researchers
00:00:32 examining the feathers of the Eurasian jay
00:00:35 discovered that their colors are generated
00:00:37 primarily by small changes in feather structure,
00:00:40 as opposed to pigment.
00:00:42 Surface variations scatter the reflected light,
00:00:46 which produces the hues we see.
00:00:49 And since this structure doesn’t change with age,
00:00:52 the colors never fade.
00:00:55 This discovery opens a whole new world
00:00:58 of possibilities.
00:01:02 Dr. Andrew Parnell states:
00:01:04 “If nature can assemble this material ‘on the wing,’
00:01:07 then we should be able to do it synthetically.”
00:01:10 Researchers are now working to produce
00:01:13 materials that mimic this.
00:01:15 This could lead to paints that never fade,
00:01:17 and perhaps even fabrics that look new
00:01:20 and vibrant wash after wash.
00:01:23 What do you think?
00:01:25 Did the unfading color of bird feathers
00:01:28 come about by evolution?
00:01:31 Or was it designed?

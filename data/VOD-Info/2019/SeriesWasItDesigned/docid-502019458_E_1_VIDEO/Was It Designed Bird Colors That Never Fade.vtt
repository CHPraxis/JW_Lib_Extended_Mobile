—for example, paint and clothing.

Yet, for many species of birds this isn’t the case.

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their feathers remain permanently bright and vivid.

What’s their secret?

Researchers

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.264 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
examining the feathers of the Eurasian jay

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
discovered that their colors are generated

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.853 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
primarily by small changes in feather structure,

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as opposed to pigment.

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surface variations scatter the reflected light,

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which produces the hues we see.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since this structure doesn’t change with age,

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the colors never fade.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This discovery opens a whole new world

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of possibilities.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dr. Andrew Parnell states:

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If nature can assemble this material ‘on the wing,’

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we should be able to do it synthetically.”

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Researchers are now working to produce

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:15.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
materials that mimic this.

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could lead to paints that never fade,

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps even fabrics that look new

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and vibrant wash after wash.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the unfading color of bird feathers

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come about by evolution?

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

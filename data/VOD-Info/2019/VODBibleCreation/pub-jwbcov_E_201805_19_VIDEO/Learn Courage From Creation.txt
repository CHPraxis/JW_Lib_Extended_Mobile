00:00:02 The lion’s fearless reputation is well-founded.
00:00:07 Lions are Africa’s largest native cat.
00:00:12 A full-grown male can weigh up to 230 kilograms,
00:00:17 or about 500 pounds.
00:00:19 Females are smaller but can still weigh up to 180 kilograms,
00:00:24 or nearly 400 pounds.
00:00:28 Lions successfully hunt animals
00:00:31 as large as buffalo and hippos!
00:00:35 Lions are the only cats that live together in social groups.
00:00:41 These groups, called prides,
00:00:43 normally consist of related females and their cubs
00:00:46 along with a small number of resident males.
00:00:50 Healthy adult lions have no natural predators.
00:00:55 However, lions face a threat from a surprising source.
00:00:59 What is it?
00:01:01 Other lions.
00:01:04 Lions are territorial.
00:01:07 They will attack and kill other lions
00:01:09 in an attempt to take over their hunting territory.
00:01:14 Lion cubs face another danger.
00:01:18 Groups of rival males will attempt to drive off the resident males
00:01:22 and take over the pride.
00:01:24 If the invading males are successful,
00:01:27 they will try to kill the cubs that were fathered by other lions.
00:01:31 The invading males can then father cubs of their own.
00:01:35 On their own, the tiny cubs would be defenseless.
00:01:40 But lions vigorously defend their cubs.
00:01:43 Both males and females protect the pride
00:01:46 from other lions.
00:01:49 A mother lion will defend her cubs
00:01:52 even though she may be injured or killed by a larger invading male.
00:01:57 Several mothers may defend their cubs collectively,
00:02:01 giving the cubs a better chance of survival.
00:02:08 Horses were often used in ancient battles.
00:02:13 A charging horse was a powerful weapon.
00:02:17 The mere presence of cavalry
00:02:19 or chariots on the battlefield
00:02:21 was intimidating to opposing armies.
00:02:23 However, horses needed training
00:02:26 to be effective in battle.
00:02:28 Horses are not naturally courageous.
00:02:32 Without proper training,
00:02:34 a horse could be a liability on the battlefield.
00:02:37 Why?
00:02:39 Because of their keen eyesight and hearing,
00:02:41 horses easily become startled.
00:02:45 Horses have a nearly 360-degree range of vision.
00:02:51 Ancient battlefields were filled with sights
00:02:54 that tended to terrify horses.
00:02:56 For this reason, ancient warriors sometimes put blinders on horses.
00:03:02 Horses have 16 muscles that control each of their ears.
00:03:07 They can move their ears to hear sounds more clearly.
00:03:12 A horse can hear the sound of danger before a human.
00:03:17 The possibility of horses panicking in battle
00:03:19 was a constant danger.
00:03:22 Ancient armies would deliberately try to frighten
00:03:26 their enemy’s horses to induce chaos.
00:03:29 How was a horse trained for battle?
00:03:32 Their trainers exposed the horse to sights and sounds
00:03:36 similar to those encountered on the battlefield.
00:03:39 Gradually, the horse would overcome its fear.
00:03:44 When trained properly, instead of fleeing at the sound of battle,
00:03:50 a courageous warhorse would excitedly run towards it.
00:04:02 Across southern Asia lives a small mammal that is surprisingly fearless
00:04:07 —the Indian gray mongoose.
00:04:11 This furry creature is relatively small,
00:04:14 typically measuring less than a meter,
00:04:16 or three feet, in length from head to tail.
00:04:19 Despite its small size,
00:04:22 the mongoose is, in fact, a bold predator.
00:04:26 It feeds on various small creatures,
00:04:28 but the most famous of its prey
00:04:30 are venomous snakes, such as the king cobra.
00:04:35 Several species of mongoose, including the Indian gray mongoose,
00:04:39 are known for their ability to kill venomous snakes.
00:04:43 What protects the mongoose as it fights a venomous snake?
00:04:48 The Indian gray mongoose’s thick fur
00:04:51 is composed of stiff hairs that stand erect
00:04:54 when the mongoose is excited or angry.
00:04:56 This fur serves as a protective layer
00:04:59 to prevent a snake from biting into its flesh.
00:05:02 However, if it is bitten,
00:05:04 the mongoose has an internal defense mechanism
00:05:07 —a tolerance to snake venom.
00:05:10 The mongoose is amazingly fast and agile.
00:05:14 When the snake strikes,
00:05:16 the mongoose swiftly moves out of the way and avoids the bite.
00:05:20 The mongoose also possesses incredible stamina.
00:05:24 It can keep fighting until the snake tires out.
00:05:27 When the mongoose makes its final attack,
00:05:30 it strikes the snake at just the right location to kill it.
00:05:34 The mongoose is endowed with defenses and abilities
00:05:38 that enable it to fearlessly fight and defeat the snake.
00:05:46 Found only in North and South America,
00:05:49 hummingbirds are among the smallest of all birds.
00:05:54 Although the more than 300 species of hummingbirds vary in size,
00:05:58 most species are between 6 and 12 centimeters,
00:06:02 or 2.4 and 4.7 inches, in length.
00:06:07 To the human eye,
00:06:10 the beating of a hummingbird’s wings is just a blur.
00:06:13 Because its wingbeat is so rapid,
00:06:16 this tiny bird generates a humming noise as it flies.
00:06:20 The smaller the hummingbird, the faster its wingbeat.
00:06:26 Larger hummingbirds beat their wings around 10 to 20 times per second;
00:06:31 smaller hummingbirds may beat their wings
00:06:33 70 to 80 times per second in normal flight.
00:06:38 Hummingbirds can fly forward and backward,
00:06:42 sideways,
00:06:45 straight up and down, and,
00:06:48 for brief periods, even upside down.
00:06:52 They hover in place as they feed on flower nectar.
00:06:57 But these beautiful little birds do not have charming temperaments.
00:07:02 Hummingbirds aggressively defend desirable sources of nectar,
00:07:06 attempting to drive off other hummingbirds
00:07:09 that invade their feeding territory.
00:07:12 Females defend their nests.
00:07:16 Especially during mating season,
00:07:19 males of most hummingbird species defend their breeding territory.
00:07:25 Because of their agility in flight,
00:07:28 hummingbirds can chase away
00:07:30 much larger birds, such as crows and hawks.
00:07:33 They will even dive at humans.
00:07:37 Despite their tiny size, hummingbirds are ready to defend themselves
00:07:42 and the things that are essential for their survival.
00:07:52 A herd of African elephants is an impressive sight.
00:07:57 An elephant family group consists
00:08:01 of related adult females and their young.
00:08:05 The close-knit family group provides support to its members.
00:08:11 Elephants have an excellent memory,
00:08:13 and this strengthens their social bonds.
00:08:16 They recognize and remember one another,
00:08:19 even after long periods of separation.
00:08:23 When a young elephant is in distress,
00:08:26 older elephants reassure and comfort the young one
00:08:30 by coming near and touching it with their body or trunk.
00:08:35 If an elephant is weak or injured,
00:08:38 other elephants may attempt to help it to its feet
00:08:41 and assist it to stand.
00:08:44 From the older members of the family group,
00:08:48 young elephants learn vital survival skills,
00:08:52 including how to find food and water.
00:08:56 To find water in times of drought,
00:08:59 the herd may need to travel great distances.
00:09:04 The older elephants lead the way,
00:09:07 helping younger ones make the trip.
00:09:10 How do the elephants know where to go?
00:09:15 Older elephants remember for decades where water can be found,
00:09:19 even in locations hundreds of miles away.
00:09:23 They teach these locations to the younger generation.
00:09:29 The family group also provides protection from predators.
00:09:34 An elephant may charge an attacker
00:09:37 and use its tusks, trunk, and feet as weapons.
00:09:42 To protect the calves, adults encircle them,
00:09:47 standing between them and the predators.
00:09:50 If a member of the herd is seriously wounded,
00:09:54 other elephants, including young ones,
00:09:56 may courageously come to its defense.

The lion’s fearless reputation is well-founded.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:11.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lions are Africa’s largest native cat.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A full-grown male can weigh up to 230 kilograms,

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:19.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about 500 pounds.

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Females are smaller
but can still weigh up to 180 kilograms,

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or nearly 400 pounds.

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:31.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lions successfully hunt animals

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as large as buffalo and hippos!

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:40.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lions are the only cats
that live together in social groups.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These groups, called prides,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
normally consist
of related females and their cubs

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with a small number of resident males.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:55.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Healthy adult lions have no natural predators.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:59.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, lions face a threat
from a surprising source.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other lions.

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lions are territorial.

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will attack and kill other lions

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an attempt to take over their hunting territory.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lion cubs face another danger.

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:22.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Groups of rival males
will attempt to drive off the resident males

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take over the pride.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the invading males are successful,

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will try to kill the cubs
that were fathered by other lions.

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The invading males
can then father cubs of their own.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On their own,
the tiny cubs would be defenseless.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But lions vigorously defend their cubs.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both males and females protect the pride

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from other lions.

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mother lion will defend her cubs

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:57.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though she may be injured
or killed by a larger invading male.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several mothers
may defend their cubs collectively,

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving the cubs a better chance of survival.

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:13.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Horses were often used in ancient battles.

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:17.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A charging horse was a powerful weapon.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mere presence of cavalry

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or chariots on the battlefield

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was intimidating to opposing armies.

00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:26.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, horses needed training

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:28.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be effective in battle.

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Horses are not naturally courageous.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without proper training,

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a horse could be a liability on the battlefield.

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:41.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of their keen eyesight and hearing,

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:44.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
horses easily become startled.

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:50.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Horses have a nearly 360-degree range of vision.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ancient battlefields were filled with sights

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that tended to terrify horses.

00:02:56.893 --> 00:03:01.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, ancient warriors
sometimes put blinders on horses.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Horses have 16 muscles
that control each of their ears.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can move their ears
to hear sounds more clearly.

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:17.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A horse can hear
the sound of danger before a human.

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The possibility of horses panicking in battle

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a constant danger.

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ancient armies would deliberately try to frighten

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their enemy’s horses to induce chaos.

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was a horse trained for battle?

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their trainers exposed the horse
to sights and sounds

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar to those encountered on the battlefield.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, the horse would overcome its fear.

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:49.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When trained properly,
instead of fleeing at the sound of battle,

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:54.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a courageous warhorse
would excitedly run towards it.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:07.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Across southern Asia
lives a small mammal that is surprisingly fearless

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Indian gray mongoose.

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:14.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This furry creature is relatively small,

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
typically measuring less than a meter,

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or three feet,
in length from head to tail.

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite its small size,

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:26.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mongoose is, in fact, a bold predator.

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:28.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It feeds on various small creatures,

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the most famous of its prey

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are venomous snakes, such as the king cobra.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:39.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several species of mongoose,
including the Indian gray mongoose,

00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are known for their ability
to kill venomous snakes.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:48.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What protects the mongoose
as it fights a venomous snake?

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Indian gray mongoose’s thick fur

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is composed of stiff hairs that stand erect

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the mongoose is excited or angry.

00:04:56.512 --> 00:04:59.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This fur serves as a protective layer

00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:02.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent a snake from biting into its flesh.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, if it is bitten,

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mongoose
has an internal defense mechanism

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a tolerance to snake venom.

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mongoose is amazingly fast and agile.

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:16.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the snake strikes,

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:20.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mongoose swiftly moves
out of the way and avoids the bite.

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mongoose
also possesses incredible stamina.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can keep fighting until the snake tires out.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the mongoose makes its final attack,

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:34.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it strikes the snake
at just the right location to kill it.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mongoose is endowed
with defenses and abilities

00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:42.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enable it
to fearlessly fight and defeat the snake.

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Found only in North and South America,

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hummingbirds are
among the smallest of all birds.

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the more than 300 species
of hummingbirds vary in size,

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most species are between 6 and 12 centimeters,

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 2.4 and 4.7 inches, in length.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the human eye,

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:13.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beating
of a hummingbird’s wings is just a blur.

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because its wingbeat is so rapid,

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:20.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this tiny bird generates
a humming noise as it flies.

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The smaller the hummingbird,
the faster its wingbeat.

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:30.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Larger hummingbirds beat their wings
around 10 to 20 times per second;

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smaller hummingbirds may beat their wings

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70 to 80 times per second in normal flight.

00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hummingbirds can fly forward and backward,

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sideways,

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:48.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
straight up and down, and,

00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:52.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for brief periods, even upside down.

00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hover in place
as they feed on flower nectar.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these beautiful little birds
do not have charming temperaments.

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hummingbirds aggressively defend
desirable sources of nectar,

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attempting to drive off other hummingbirds

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that invade their feeding territory.

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:16.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Females defend their nests.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially during mating season,

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
males of most hummingbird species
defend their breeding territory.

00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of their agility in flight,

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hummingbirds can chase away

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much larger birds,
such as crows and hawks.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will even dive at humans.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite their tiny size,
hummingbirds are ready to defend themselves

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:46.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the things
that are essential for their survival.

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:56.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A herd of African elephants
is an impressive sight.

00:07:57.994 --> 00:08:01.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An elephant family group consists

00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:05.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of related adult females and their young.

00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The close-knit family group
provides support to its members.

00:08:11.107 --> 00:08:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elephants have an excellent memory,

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this strengthens their social bonds.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They recognize and remember one another,

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even after long periods of separation.

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a young elephant is in distress,

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:30.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
older elephants reassure
and comfort the young one

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by coming near
and touching it with their body or trunk.

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If an elephant is weak or injured,

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other elephants may attempt to help it to its feet

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and assist it to stand.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the older members of the family group,

00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:52.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
young elephants learn vital survival skills,

00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including how to find food and water.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find water in times of drought,

00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the herd may need to travel great distances.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The older elephants lead the way,

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:10.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping younger ones make the trip.

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:15.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do the elephants know where to go?

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:19.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Older elephants remember for decades
where water can be found,

00:09 Father, for me, the time has now come.
00:13 Fulfilling the words that were said by your Son:
00:17 ‘If they persecuted me, then they’ll do it to you.’
00:21 It’s not a surprise.  Really, nothing that’s new.
00:25 Jehovah, I pray, please, let me be strong. My life and devotion to you they belong.
00:33 My record of faith will never be lost. I’ll be loyal to you no matter the cost.
00:43 I’ll never give in to taunts or to threats. Enduring in faith, I’ll have no regrets.
00:51 To suffer these things for the sake of your name,
00:55 I count as an honor; I won’t be ashamed.
01:01 I won’t give up, won’t turn aside. I won’t give up, and I won’t run and hide.
01:09 Let me be strong; let me be true. Carrying on, trusting in you.
01:18 I won’t give up.
01:31 You’ve trusted in me.  I’ve trusted in you.
01:35 Each trial I face, you help me get through. No king and no ruler, no family or friend
01:43 Can make me lose sight  of the prize at the end.
01:49 I won’t give up, won’t turn aside. I won’t give up, and I won’t run and hide.
01:57 Let me be strong; let me be true. Carrying on, trusting in you.
02:07 I won’t give up, won’t turn aside. I won’t give up, and I won’t run and hide.
02:15 Let me be strong; let me be true. Carrying on, trusting in you.
02:26 I won’t give up.

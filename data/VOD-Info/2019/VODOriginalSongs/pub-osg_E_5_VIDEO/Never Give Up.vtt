00:09.392 --> 00:13.364
Father, for me, the time has now come.


00:13.363 --> 00:17.100
Fulfilling the words
that were said by your Son:


00:17.100 --> 00:21.370
‘If they persecuted me,
then they’ll do it to you.’


00:21.370 --> 00:25.142
It’s not a surprise. 
Really, nothing that’s new.


00:25.142 --> 00:33.384
Jehovah, I pray, please, let me be strong.
My life and devotion to you they belong.


00:33.383 --> 00:43.258
My record of faith will never be lost.
I’ll be loyal to you no matter the cost.


00:43.258 --> 00:51.233
I’ll never give in to taunts or to threats.
Enduring in faith, I’ll have no regrets.


00:51.233 --> 00:55.338
To suffer these things
for the sake of your name,


00:55.338 --> 01:01.276
I count as an honor;
I won’t be ashamed.


01:01.277 --> 01:09.619
I won’t give up, won’t turn aside.
I won’t give up, and I won’t run and hide.


01:09.618 --> 01:18.461
Let me be strong; let me be true.
Carrying on, trusting in you.


01:18.462 --> 01:21.000
I won’t give up.


01:31.073 --> 01:35.311
You’ve trusted in me. 
I’ve trusted in you.


01:35.312 --> 01:43.085
Each trial I face, you help me get through.
No king and no ruler, no family or friend


01:43.085 --> 01:49.225
Can make me lose sight 
of the prize at the end.


01:49.225 --> 01:57.533
I won’t give up, won’t turn aside.
I won’t give up, and I won’t run and hide.


01:57.533 --> 02:07.310
Let me be strong; let me be true.
Carrying on, trusting in you.


02:07.310 --> 02:15.418
I won’t give up, won’t turn aside.
I won’t give up, and I won’t run and hide.


02:15.418 --> 02:26.361
Let me be strong; let me be true.
Carrying on, trusting in you.


02:26.362 --> 02:39.059
I won’t give up.

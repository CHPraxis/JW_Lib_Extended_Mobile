Time and circumstance
Don’t always work in our favor.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:26.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What might have been
if we just had the chance

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is something
we may never know.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God looks down and sees;
He knows us better than we do.

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees what we are
and what more we could be.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all in the way
that we go.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He values all of us,
No matter what talent or gift we possess.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants each one of us
To be as caring as he is.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re my friend
’cause you’re always there

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through our ups and downs
and through all we’ve shared.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m there 
When you need someone,

are hard to bear.

You can count on me.

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weep with those who weep,
Sharing the things that we’re feeling.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes our tears
may be all that can speak,

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Expressing what words cannot say.
Troubles can bring us down.

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:24.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can lift us
and carry us through.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all can do the same
And help each other as friends do.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re my friend
’cause you’re always there

00:00:02 It’s dark outside. To start the day,
00:00:08 She humbly starts to pray For her kids at school
00:00:15 And the brotherhood: “Father, help us be faithful.”
00:00:22 When things make it hard to cope, She never thinks of losing hope,
00:00:32 Never stops being kind. And that song—it’s always on her mind:
00:00:41 ‘I will make you strong. Do not be afraid.
00:00:51 I will be with you. I will be your aid.’
00:01:00 Be courageous and strong. It’s her favorite song.
00:01:10 And “he will make you firm, And he will make you strong.”
00:01:21 Time to get on her feet— Try to make ends meet—
00:01:27 Never sure what to expect. Her true friends out there
00:01:34 Really show her they care, So she never needs to fret.
00:02:20 She’ll soar on wings To rise up high,
00:02:26 Like eagles in the sky. All the roles she plays—
00:02:31 So little time each day— And in her heart, she starts to pray.
00:02:39 Aching feet and tired hands— She tries the very best she can.
00:02:48 But there’s strength she can find In that song that’s always on her mind:
00:02:56 ‘I will make you strong. Do not be afraid.
00:03:07 I will be with you. I will be your aid.’
00:03:16 Be courageous and strong. It’s her favorite song.
00:03:25 And “he will make you firm, And he will make you strong.”
00:03:37 And “he will make you firm, And he will make you strong.”

It’s dark outside.
To start the day,

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She humbly starts to pray
For her kids at school

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brotherhood:
“Father, help us be faithful.”

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When things make it hard to cope,
She never thinks of losing hope,

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never stops being kind.
And that song—it’s always on her mind:

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will make you strong.
Do not be afraid.

00:00:51.488 --> 00:01:00.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be with you.
I will be your aid.’

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be courageous and strong.
It’s her favorite song.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “he will make you firm,
And he will make you strong.”

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Time to get on her feet—
Try to make ends meet—

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never sure what to expect.
Her true friends out there

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really show her they care,
So she never needs to fret.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll soar on wings
To rise up high,

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like eagles in the sky.
All the roles she plays—

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So little time each day—
And in her heart, she starts to pray.

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:48.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aching feet and tired hands—
She tries the very best she can.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s strength she can find
In that song that’s always on her mind:

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will make you strong.
Do not be afraid.

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:16.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be with you.
I will be your aid.’

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:25.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be courageous and strong.
It’s her favorite song.

00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “he will make you firm,
And he will make you strong.”

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “he will make you firm,
And he will make you strong.”

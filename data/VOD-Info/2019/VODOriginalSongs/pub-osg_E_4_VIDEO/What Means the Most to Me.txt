00:00:07 What are the things that I value, The things that mean the most to me?
00:00:22 What are the things that will help me to be— To be the person I want to be?
00:00:36 With each new day there are choices to be made.
00:00:43 Sometimes the choice will need to be a trade.
00:00:50 The time I have can never be replaced. The steps I take can never be retraced.
00:01:04 That’s why I want to choose carefully
00:01:12 And choose what really means the most to me.
00:01:19 How will I honor Jehovah, The one who means the most to me?
00:01:33 I’ll give the best I can offer to him. And he deserves the best I can be.

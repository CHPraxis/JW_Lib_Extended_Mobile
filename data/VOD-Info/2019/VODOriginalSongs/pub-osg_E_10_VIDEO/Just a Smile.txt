00:00:15 We can tell a hundred stories; We can speak a million words;
00:00:22 We can paint a thousand pictures, But will a heart be stirred?
00:00:29 We can often make a diff’rence With a kindly word or deed,
00:00:37 But sometimes just a smile Is all we really need.
00:00:45 Just a smile can lift a weary heart. Just a smile can help us make a start.
00:01:00 When you’ve done your best praying you’ll succeed,
00:01:08 Then you will see a smile is what we need.
00:01:19 This world is unforgiving —full of coldness and despair.
00:01:26 Many hopes are disappointed  by a world that doesn’t care.
00:01:33 And we see it in their faces  as they pass us on the street.
00:01:42 So we offer hope and comfort  to the people that we meet.
00:01:50 Just a smile can lift a weary heart. Just a smile can help us make a start.
00:02:05 When you’ve done your best  praying you’ll succeed,
00:02:14 Then you will see a smile is what we need.
00:02:23 At times we feel downhearted  when no one seems to care
00:02:31 About the hope we offer  or the message that we bear.
00:02:38 For some hearts are just too hardened  to receive the Kingdom seed.
00:02:46 But could it be a friendly smile  is what they really need?
00:02:55 Just a smile can lift a weary heart. Just a smile can help us make a start.
00:03:10 When you’ve done your best  praying you’ll succeed,
00:03:17 Then you will see a smile is what we need.

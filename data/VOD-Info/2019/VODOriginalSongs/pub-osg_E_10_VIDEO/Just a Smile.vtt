We can tell a hundred stories;
We can speak a million words;

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:29.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can paint a thousand pictures,
But will a heart be stirred?

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can often make a diff’rence
With a kindly word or deed,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes just a smile
Is all we really need.

Just a smile can lift a weary heart.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:26.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This world is unforgiving
—full of coldness and despair.

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:33.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many hopes are disappointed 
by a world that doesn’t care.

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:42.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we see it in their faces 
as they pass us on the street.

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:50.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we offer hope and comfort 
to the people that we meet.

At times we feel downhearted 
when no one seems to care

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:38.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About the hope we offer 
or the message that we bear.

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some hearts are just too hardened 
to receive the Kingdom seed.

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:55.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But could it be a friendly smile

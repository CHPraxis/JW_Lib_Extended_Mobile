00:00:07 I know about the Paradise under God’s Kingdom,
00:00:14 And I believe with all my heart that better days will come.
00:00:22 But sometimes in this life, for me, It’s hard to see the things unseen,
00:00:29 To feel the love I know is there when my heart is in despair.
00:00:37 But I know Jehovah’s near.
00:00:47 So I say a prayer from the heart. When worries overtake my mind,
00:00:58 On his strength I can rely. I’m not alone; I know he’s there.
00:01:10 I have his words of comfort And true friends who really care.
00:01:17 Yes, each day has its own anxieties. So I take one day at a time;
00:01:29 Leave tomorrow until tomorrow; Peace is what I find
00:01:35 One day at a time.
00:01:43 So take these words I’ve said, my friend, And know that I care.
00:01:50 Focus on the joys in life, Not the burdens that we bear.
00:01:59 Think about what God has done. To show his love, he gave his Son.
00:02:05 So never doubt; keep trusting him. He gave his best so we could live.
00:02:13 So don’t give in to fear.
00:02:19 Say a prayer from the heart. When worries overtake our mind,
00:02:30 On his strength we can rely. We’re not alone, for he is there.
00:02:41 We have his words of comfort And true friends who really care.
00:02:50 Yes, each day has its own anxieties. So take one day at a time;
00:03:01 Leave tomorrow until tomorrow; Peace is what we’ll find
00:03:07 One day at a time.
00:03:31 Say a prayer from the heart. When worries overtake our mind,
00:03:41 On his strength we can rely. We’re not alone, for he is there.
00:03:53 We have his words of comfort And true friends who really care.
00:04:01 Yes, each day has its own anxieties. So take one day at a time;
00:04:12 Leave tomorrow until tomorrow; Peace is what we’ll find
00:04:19 One day at a time— One day at a time.

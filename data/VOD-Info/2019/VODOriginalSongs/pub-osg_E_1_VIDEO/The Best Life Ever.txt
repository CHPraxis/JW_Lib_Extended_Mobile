00:00:07 This world would like to make me lonely, but I got my friends with me.
00:00:17 We’re trying hard to help others find friends eternally.
00:00:28 When I would worry about me, oh, this world would bring me down.
00:00:38 I’m feeling better lifting others off the ground.
00:00:45 Look what I’ve found.
00:00:50 I want to know what I can do; I want to give what I can give.
00:00:57 That is the best feeling ever.
00:01:01 I know this’ll last forever. I’m where I want to be.
00:01:08 This is the best life ever.
00:01:16 So many good things yet to be done with these two hands of mine.
00:01:27 I’ll take some love and build us a bridge— connects your heart to mine.
00:01:38 When I would worry about me, oh, this world would bring me down.
00:01:49 I’m feeling better lifting others off the ground.
00:01:55 Look what I’ve found.
00:02:00 I want to know what I can do; I want to give what I can give.
00:02:07 That is the best feeling ever.
00:02:11 I know this’ll last forever. It’s better than a dream.
00:02:18 This is the best life.
00:02:21 I’m not afraid, come what may.
00:02:33 This kind of life gets better ev’ry day— ev’ry day, ev’ry way.
00:02:52 I want to live for more than me; I want to give ’til I feel free.
00:03:00 That is the best feeling ever.
00:03:04 I know this’ll last forever. Come with me; you’ll see.
00:03:11 This is the best life ever.
00:03:17 This is the best life ever.
00:03:22 This is the best life ever.

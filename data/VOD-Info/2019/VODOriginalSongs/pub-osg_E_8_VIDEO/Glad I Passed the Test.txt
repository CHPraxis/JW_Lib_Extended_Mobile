00:00:06 Seems like there’s something ev’ryday,
00:00:10 Some new test that comes my way— something ev’ryday.
00:00:18 I never know what it might be,
00:00:21 But whatever it might be, I know I have the key.
00:00:29 ‘Cause I can face it if I’m steady, And prepare so I’ll be ready;
00:00:35 How to act and what to say When a challenge comes my way.
00:00:40 At times it’s tough for me out there,
00:00:46 And so I turn to God in prayer.
00:00:51 I pray I’ll pass each test— Ev’ry one that comes my way.
00:00:56 I pray I’ll pass each test, And be faithful through the day.
00:01:10 Some things I know I’ll face again.
00:01:14 Like the pressure to fit in— face it once again.
00:01:21 There will be times when other kids
00:01:25 Do the things that God forbids— the things that God forbids.
00:01:32 And pressure me to go along with Kids I know I don’t belong with.
00:01:38 That’s the time I call to mind
00:01:41 I don’t want to be that kind— ‘Cause I’m a Witness for God’s name.
00:01:49 So there’s no cause to be ashamed.
00:01:54 I’m glad I passed the test. I was faithful all day long.
00:02:00 I’m glad I passed the test. I’m glad that I was strong.

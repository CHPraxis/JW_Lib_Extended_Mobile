00:00:11 O heavenly Father, I want to give all I can give.
00:00:21 My desire is to please you and love you as long as I live.
00:00:32 I’ll help those who listen to find in your Word what they need.
00:00:43 To preach and to teach is the way I can really succeed.
00:00:54 As I praise you, Jehovah, my faith’s getting stronger each day.
00:01:04 I’ll reflect on my dedication. I’ll walk in your way.
00:01:15 O heavenly Father, to you I give praise,
00:01:21 Determined to serve you in so many ways.
00:01:26 My heart is wide open as long as I live.
00:01:33 Jehovah, I’ll love you and give you all I can give.
00:02:06 Whole-souled devotion and love for my brothers I’ll show.
00:02:16 Volunteering to play my part is the best way I know.
00:02:27 I’m happier when I am giving than when I receive,
00:02:37 When I’m taking the time to help others who may be in need.
00:02:48 As I praise you, Jehovah, my faith’s getting stronger each day.
00:02:58 I’ll reflect on my dedication. I’ll walk in your way.
00:03:10 O heavenly Father, to you I give praise,
00:03:15 Determined to serve you in so many ways.
00:03:21 My heart is wide open as long as I live.
00:03:27 Jehovah, I’ll love you and give you all I can give.
00:03:38 O heavenly Father, to you I give praise,
00:03:43 Determined to serve you in so many ways.
00:03:49 My heart is wide open as long as I live.
00:03:55 Jehovah, I’ll love you and give you all I can give.

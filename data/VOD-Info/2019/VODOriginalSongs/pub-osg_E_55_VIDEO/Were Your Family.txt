00:00:15 Touching down in a foreign land With a thousand miles behind us—
00:00:22 Since we left our home,
00:00:24 It’s Jehovah’s hand That is blessing ev’ry move.
00:00:29 And the work that we do isn’t easy, But it’s all for Jehovah.
00:00:37 And the love that we feel for this fam’ly is real,
00:00:40 So this we say to you:
00:00:45 “We’re all Jehovah’s people; United, we are family.
00:00:52 “And though your land is far away, We love you.
00:00:58 We’re your family.”
00:01:03 Waiting there as our plane came in, You were reaching out to greet us.
00:01:10 Then the music starts, and the day begins, And our love grows even more.
00:01:17 But we know that it’s only Jehovah Who can cause this to happen.
00:01:25 So we’ll praise him together and love him forever
00:01:29 On ev’ry distant shore.
00:01:33 “We’re all Jehovah’s people; United, we are family.
00:01:40 “And though your land is far away, We love you.
00:01:46 We’re your family.”
00:01:51 Silver wings fly across the sea To a land so unfamiliar.
00:01:58 But we bring good news, and the ones we meet Are so gentle, kind, and good.
00:02:05 And the love we receive from our brothers Makes us feel we belong here.
00:02:13 So wherever we are and no matter how far, We love our brotherhood!
00:02:36 It’s good to know That we have family ev’rywhere we go—
00:02:43 From Mali to Mexico, From Japan to Jamaica.
00:02:52 “We’re all Jehovah’s people; United, we are family.
00:03:00 “And though your land is far away, We love you.
00:03:05 “We’re your family.
00:03:07 “From ev’ry tribe and nation— United, we are family.
00:03:15 “These bonds of love are plain to see Because we’re Jehovah’s family!
00:03:36 “Fiji, Tahiti, and New Caledonia— Navajo, Blackfoot, and Cherokee—
00:03:43 “Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Estonia— We love you.
00:03:50 We’re your family.”

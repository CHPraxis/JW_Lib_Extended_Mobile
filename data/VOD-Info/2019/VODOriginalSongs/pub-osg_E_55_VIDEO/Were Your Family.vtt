Touching down in a foreign land
With a thousand miles behind us—

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we left our home,

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jehovah’s hand
That is blessing ev’ry move.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the work that we do isn’t easy,
But it’s all for Jehovah.

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the love that we feel
for this fam’ly is real,

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this we say to you:

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re all Jehovah’s people;
United, we are family.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And though your land is far away,
We love you.

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re your family.”

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Waiting there as our plane came in,
You were reaching out to greet us.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the music starts, and the day begins,
And our love grows even more.

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that it’s only Jehovah
Who can cause this to happen.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll praise him together
and love him forever

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On ev’ry distant shore.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

We love you.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re your family.”

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Silver wings fly across the sea
To a land so unfamiliar.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we bring good news, and the ones we meet
Are so gentle, kind, and good.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:13.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the love we receive from our brothers
Makes us feel we belong here.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wherever we are and no matter how far,
We love our brotherhood!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good to know
That we have family ev’rywhere we go—

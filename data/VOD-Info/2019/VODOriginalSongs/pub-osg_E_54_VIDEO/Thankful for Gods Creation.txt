00:00:13 Dandelions growing on top of the hill,
00:00:18 Mountains in the distance, wind blowing through the field,
00:00:23 Warmth of the sun casting down from the sky,
00:00:29 Birds fly up above, Clouds rolling by—
00:00:34 What did I do To see such beauty?
00:00:40 And what do I do To show how much I care?
00:00:45 I’ve got to be thankful, Tell Jehovah in prayer
00:00:51 That I’m thankful For the love that he shares.
00:00:57 Stop,  look around,
00:01:00 Take a moment, and let it sink down in my heart.
00:01:05 Never take for granted all he’s done.
00:01:10 I’ve got to be thankful. I’ve got to be thankful.
00:01:23 So many colors now painted in the sky,
00:01:28 What a beautiful canvas you’ve laid before my eyes!
00:01:34 The sound of the river running into the night,
00:01:40 The stars are dancing in the moon’s spotlight—
00:01:45 What did I do To see such beauty?
00:01:50 But I know what to do To show how much I care.
00:01:56 I’ve got to be thankful, Tell Jehovah in prayer
00:02:02 That I’m thankful For the love that he shares.
00:02:08 Stop, look around,
00:02:11 Take a moment, and let it sink down in my heart.
00:02:15 Never take for granted  all he’s done.
00:02:21 I’ve got to be thankful.
00:02:28 I see your wisdom and your strength,
00:02:32 Your goodness in ev’rything, And how much you love.
00:02:38 And I’m so thankful; I’ve got to be thankful.
00:03:06 I’ve got to be thankful, Tell Jehovah in prayer
00:03:12 That I’m thankful For the love that he shares.
00:03:19 Stop, look around,
00:03:21 Take a moment, and let it sink down in my heart.
00:03:26 Never take for granted all he’s done.
00:03:31 I’ve got to be thankful. I’ve got to be thankful.
00:03:42 We’ve got to be thankful.

00:00:09 With the days forever darkening And the signs so very clear,
00:00:18 We must keep our sense of urgency As the end is drawing near.
00:00:28 We will seize this opportunity To declare Jehovah’s name,
00:00:36 And the blessings of his Kingdom Is the message we’ll proclaim.
00:00:44 Now is the time For preaching with zeal.
00:00:49 We’ll never give up or give way to fear.
00:00:53 And now is the time To show how we feel,
00:00:58 Now that the final days are here.
00:01:08 There will never be another time For this preaching to be done.
00:01:16 So we want to have a part in it And reach out to ev’ryone.
00:01:25 When we look back in some future time At these days in which we live,
00:01:34 Then we’ll say that for Jehovah We gave all that we could give.
00:01:43 Now is the time For preaching with zeal.
00:01:47 We’ll never give up or give way to fear.
00:01:51 And now is the time To show how we feel,
00:01:56 Now that the final days are here.
00:02:10 With our loyal ones surrounding us We will run with all our might.
00:02:19 Then we turn the final corner, And the new world is in sight.
00:02:30 Now is the time For preaching with zeal.
00:02:34 We’ll never give up or give way to fear.
00:02:39 And now is the time To show how we feel,
00:02:44 Now that the final days are here.

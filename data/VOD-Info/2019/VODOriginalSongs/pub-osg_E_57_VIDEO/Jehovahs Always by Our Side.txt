00:00:14 At times, I felt scared inside, Only looking for a place to hide.
00:00:21 The world made me feel different.  Now I hold my head up high.
00:00:29 He said he’d be my confidence, That he’d come to my defense.
00:00:34 His love I can’t deny,
00:00:39 ’Cause he gave me Courage when I was feeling weak,
00:00:45 Courage when I could not speak, Courage in my darkest night,
00:00:56 Courage to stand up tall, Courage to face it all,
00:01:02 Courage to trust him with my life. Jehovah’s always by my side.
00:01:11 He walks with me To help me see
00:01:17 His ways are always right. He’ll take my hand,
00:01:27 Help me understand It’s worth the sacrifice.
00:01:38 You are not alone. Even far away from home,
00:01:43 He’ll be your guide. He will pick you up
00:01:54 Even when you think you’ve had enough And make you strong and wise,
00:02:06 ’Cause he’ll give you Courage when you are feeling weak,
00:02:11 Courage when you cannot speak, Courage in your darkest nights,
00:02:19 Courage to stand up tall, Courage to face it all,
00:02:28 Courage to trust him with your life. Jehovah’s always by our side—
00:02:37 Always, always. Jehovah’s always by our side.
00:02:49 He walks with you and me To help us see

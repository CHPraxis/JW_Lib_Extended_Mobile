00:00:04 In my reading and my study, There are treasures that I find
00:00:13 When I’m searching, digging deeper, When I take a little time.
00:00:23 In my imagination, I am in the scene.
00:00:29 It helps me understand  just what the Bible means.
00:00:35 Imagination and meditation—​ ​These are the things that help me see.
00:00:44 They give the insight to help me do right And be the person I should be—​
00:00:54 ​The person I should be.
00:00:59 I can ponder on the people—​ ​Some were faithful; some were not.
00:01:08 Their example gives me insight To God’s feelings and his thought.
00:01:18 Sometimes my meditation makes me realize
00:01:24 How I can be  more pleasing in Jehovah’s eyes.
00:01:30 Imagination and meditation—​ ​These are the things that help us see.
00:01:39 They give the insight to help us do right And be the persons we should be—​
00:01:48 ​The persons we should be.
00:01:53 Imagination and meditation,
00:01:58 Imagination and meditation,
00:02:02 Imagination and meditation.

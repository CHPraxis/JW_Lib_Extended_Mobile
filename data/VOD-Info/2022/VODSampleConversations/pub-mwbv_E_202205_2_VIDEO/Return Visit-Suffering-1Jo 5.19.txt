00:00:01 Hi, Ian, it’s good to find you home.
00:00:03 In case you don’t recall, my name is Francisco.
00:00:06 And I’m Shane.
00:00:07 Hello. Good to see you.
00:00:09 You too, Ian.
00:00:10 The last time we were here, we left the question, Why do we suffer?
00:00:14 Notice the answer that the Bible gives here
00:00:17 at 1 John 5:19.
00:00:20 Shane, would you please read that?
00:00:22 Sure.
00:00:23 It says:
00:00:25 “We know that we originate with God,
00:00:28 but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.”
00:00:32 Thank you.
00:00:33 So according to this verse, who controls the world?
00:00:37 Is it God or someone else?
00:00:40 Hmm.
00:00:41 It says “the wicked one.”
00:00:44 Does that mean the Devil?
00:00:46 Yes.
00:00:47 He’s the real ruler of the world.
00:00:50 Do you think we’re seeing evidence of his rule in the world around us?
00:00:54 For sure, all of the crime and hatred that exists.
00:00:58 Exactly.
00:01:05 And in other parts of the Bible, it shows that Satan’s influence
00:01:08 has led to sin and death for all mankind.
00:01:11 I’ve never heard that before, but it makes a lot of sense.
00:01:16 You’re right; it does.
00:01:17 So God doesn’t cause our suffering,
00:01:20 but he does care about it.
00:01:23 Maybe next time we can discuss how God feels about our suffering.
00:01:27 You may find that the answer addresses
00:01:29 some of those nagging questions you’ve had about God.

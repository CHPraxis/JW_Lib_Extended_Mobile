00:00:06 Last time, we discussed that God’s purpose
00:00:09 was for the earth to be a paradise,
00:00:11 and we left you with the question,
00:00:13 How can we be sure that God’s purpose for humans
00:00:15 here on earth will still be fulfilled?
00:00:18 Um, I’m not really sure.
00:00:21 We find the Creator’s assurance here at Isaiah 55:11.
00:00:25 Tina, would you please read that for us?
00:00:27 OK.
00:00:28 “So my word that goes out of my mouth will be.
00:00:30 “It will not return to me without results,
00:00:33 “but it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delight,
00:00:36 and it will have sure success in what I send it to do.”
00:00:46 Thank you.
00:00:47 Now, since these are the words of God himself,
00:00:50 how do we know that his purpose will be fulfilled?
00:00:53 Well, he says: “It will have sure success.”
00:00:56 Isn’t that interesting?
00:00:58 Our heavenly Father guarantees it.
00:01:01 Absolutely!
00:01:02 And looking again at this verse,
00:01:04 God says that his word will “accomplish whatever is [his] delight.”
00:01:09 So how does he feel about accomplishing his purpose?
00:01:13 He wants to accomplish it.
00:01:15 Yes, he delights to.
00:01:17 He’s really looking forward to bringing mankind happiness.
00:01:21 So we can be sure he will fulfill his purpose for the earth.
00:01:24 That’s very touching.
00:01:27 We think so too.
00:01:29 But what will life be like when God fulfills his purpose for humans?
00:01:33 Let’s discuss the Bible’s answer next time we talk.

Hi, Mia.
It’s nice to see you again.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I mentioned last week,
I’m Kiara, and this is Anna.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last time we spoke,
I left you with the question,

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we trust the Bible?

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right, I remember.

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Bible is trustworthy,

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it should be in harmony
with established scientific facts, right?

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I can agree with that.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have just a minute,
I’d like to show you a brief video

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that illustrates
the Bible’s scientific accuracy.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s called <i>The Earth Hangs Upon Nothing</i>.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the time when the Bible was written,

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:47.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people had mistaken ideas
about the shape of the earth.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:52.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A theory written
after the Bible was completed

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that the universe
emerged from a cosmic egg

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the earth
was supported by various creatures.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, about the year 1473 B.C.E.,

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses wrote that the earth
is suspended “upon nothing.”

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And around the year 732 B.C.E.,

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophet Isaiah wrote
that the earth is a circle, or sphere.

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These Bible writers contradicted ideas
that were popular at the time.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was some 200 years after Isaiah’s day

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:30.903 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
may have proposed that the earth is a sphere.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:33.989 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And more than 3,000 years passed

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from Moses’ writings

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until scientists such as Isaac Newton

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:39.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
realized that the earth

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
seemed to hang upon nothing.

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keeping those points in mind,

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read what the Bible said
some 3,500 years ago.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna, would you please read for us Job 26:7?

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “He stretches out the northern sky

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over empty space,

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suspending the earth upon nothing.”

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based off of what we learned in the video,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do you think it’s surprising
that the Bible says

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the earth is suspended “upon nothing”?

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, people didn’t believe that at the time.

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:23.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:25.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That point always amazes me!

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we can trust the Bible
in scientific matters,

00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what other areas is the Bible trustworthy?

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:43.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The video we showed you
is part of a free Bible study course

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the use of this brochure.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ll read it,
I’d be happy to leave it with you.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And next time, we’ll discuss
some of the questions that the Bible answers.

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can be found in lesson 1.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sure.
It sounds interesting.

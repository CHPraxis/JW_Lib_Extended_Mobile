Today, we’re discussing

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what God’s purpose is for humans.

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s your opinion?

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm. I think we’re here to help

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each other cope with life’s problems.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, that’s a thoughtful viewpoint,

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s understandable
because life today is filled with tests.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible shows
that the kind of life we live today

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not what God intended.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, notice what the Bible says here

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Genesis 1:28.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Morgan, would you please
read the first part of the verse?

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “God blessed them,

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and God said to them:

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be fruitful and become many,

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fill the earth and subdue it.’”

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to this verse,

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did God want Adam and Eve to do?

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm. “Be fruitful” and “fill the earth.”

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, God’s purpose
was for Adam and his descendants

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to expand the garden of Eden
until the whole earth was a paradise.

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, things didn’t work out that way.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:23.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does that mean God’s purpose failed?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or will it one day be fulfilled?

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can talk
about that on our next visit.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:30.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sounds good.

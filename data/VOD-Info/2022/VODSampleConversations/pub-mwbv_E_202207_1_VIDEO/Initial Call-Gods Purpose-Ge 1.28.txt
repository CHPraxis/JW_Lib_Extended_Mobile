00:00:06 Today, we’re discussing
00:00:08 what God’s purpose is for humans.
00:00:11 What’s your opinion?
00:00:13 Hmm. I think we’re here to help
00:00:15 each other cope with life’s problems.
00:00:25 You know, that’s a thoughtful viewpoint,
00:00:27 and it’s understandable because life today is filled with tests.
00:00:32 But the Bible shows that the kind of life we live today
00:00:35 is not what God intended.
00:00:37 Really?
00:00:38 Yes.
00:00:39 In fact, notice what the Bible says here
00:00:41 at Genesis 1:28.
00:00:44 Morgan, would you please read the first part of the verse?
00:00:46 Sure.
00:00:48 It says: “God blessed them,
00:00:50 “and God said to them:
00:00:52 “‘Be fruitful and become many,
00:00:54 fill the earth and subdue it.’”
00:00:57 Thank you.
00:00:58 So according to this verse,
00:01:00 what did God want Adam and Eve to do?
00:01:03 Hmm. “Be fruitful” and “fill the earth.”
00:01:06 That’s right.
00:01:07 In other words, God’s purpose was for Adam and his descendants
00:01:11 to expand the garden of Eden until the whole earth was a paradise.
00:01:16 Of course, things didn’t work out that way.
00:01:19 But does that mean God’s purpose failed?
00:01:23 Or will it one day be fulfilled?
00:01:25 Maybe we can talk about that on our next visit.
00:01:28 OK, sounds good.

00:00:01 The last time we spoke, I left you with the question,
00:00:04 Why did Jesus die?
00:00:06 How would you answer that question?
00:00:09 I’ve been thinking about it.
00:00:11 I don’t really know.
00:00:20 That’s OK.
00:00:21 It’s a question that has puzzled a lot of people throughout history.
00:00:25 Thankfully, the Bible can help us find the answer.
00:00:28 Notice what it says here at Matthew 20:28.
00:00:32 Would you like to read that out loud?
00:00:34 Sure.
00:00:36 “Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to,
00:00:40 “but to minister and to give his life
00:00:43 as a ransom in exchange for many.”
00:00:46 Thank you.
00:00:48 Looking at the end of the verse,
00:00:50 do you notice the reason Jesus gave his life?
00:00:53 “As a ransom”?
00:00:54 Exactly.
00:00:56 Jesus gave his life to buy back the lives of others
00:00:59 —and not just a few but many.
00:01:02 Really, Jesus gave his life for everyone
00:01:05 who sincerely wants to benefit from that sacrifice,
00:01:08 including you and me.
00:01:10 He also taught us how we can show our appreciation for it.
00:01:13 Let’s consider what he said about that the next time I’m here.
00:01:16 That sounds great.

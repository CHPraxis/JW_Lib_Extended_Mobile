The last time we spoke,
I left you with the question,

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus die?

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you answer that question?

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been thinking about it.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:12.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t really know.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s OK.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a question that has puzzled
a lot of people throughout history.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully, the Bible
can help us find the answer.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says here at Matthew 20:28.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to read that out loud?

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as the Son of man came,
not to be ministered to,

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but to minister and to give his life

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a ransom in exchange for many.”

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking at the end of the verse,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you notice the reason Jesus gave his life?

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a ransom”?

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave his life
to buy back the lives of others

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just a few but many.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, Jesus gave his life for everyone

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sincerely wants
to benefit from that sacrifice,

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including you and me.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also taught us
how we can show our appreciation for it.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider what he said
about that the next time I’m here.

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds great.

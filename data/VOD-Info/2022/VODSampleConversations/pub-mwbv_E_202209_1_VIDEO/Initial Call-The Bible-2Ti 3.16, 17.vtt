We’ve been asking people the question,

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where can we find
practical advice for daily living?

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are your thoughts?

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:16.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, I don’t know.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I ask my friends for advice
if I’m not sure what to do.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends can offer helpful advice,
that’s for sure.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This ancient book of wisdom
mentions another source.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna, would you please read for us
2 Timothy 3:16, 17?

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All Scripture is inspired of God

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for setting things straight,

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for disciplining in righteousness,

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that the man of God
may be fully competent,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:00.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you see in those verses

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the Scriptures, or God’s Word,
can help us?

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, it says: “teaching, . . . disciplining.”

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:12.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do the Scriptures equip us for?

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every good work”?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly! You got it.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible can help us to improve our lives.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, how can we deal with stress?

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we enjoy our work?

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or how can our families be happy?

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible comments on all of those topics.

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was just a religious book.

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people aren’t aware
of the Bible’s practical value.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other people say that the Bible
is full of myths or legends.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time I stop by, I’d like to discuss
why we can trust the Bible.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you be home again next week
at this time?

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I should be around.

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great! Do you text?

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like, I can send you
a text before I come.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:01.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

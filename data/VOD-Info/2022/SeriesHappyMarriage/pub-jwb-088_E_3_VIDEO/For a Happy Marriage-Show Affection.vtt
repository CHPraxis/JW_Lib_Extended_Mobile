As married couples,

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of us have been there.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:31.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day-to-day pace of life,

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work,

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and distractions

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause us

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw away from our mate emotionally.

00:00:58.203 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin to talk less

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—distance ourselves.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may feel unappreciated

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even become cold or unkind.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:29.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even our desire for intimacy and affection
may cool.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may go from being loving and passionate

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to platonic roommates.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to avoid this?

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An excellent principle we can apply

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Acts 20:35:

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we know what to give

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what actions to take so our mate

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feels our love and affection?

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best way to know

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is simply to ask.

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does our mate need?

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some feel loved

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they are actively listened to

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:36.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or hear warm expressions of appreciation.

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For others, it’s expressions of love
shown through touch

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or simply quality time.

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others find

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:51.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helping them with chores
and sharing the workload at home

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes them feel cherished.

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever the discussion reveals

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and regardless of our mate’s imperfections,

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to do what we can

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make them feel loved and cared for

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the actions they appreciate.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if we each do all we can
to show unselfish love,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
genuine affection will follow.

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is just one of many secrets

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a happy marriage.

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, why not just take a moment,
pause the video,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask each other these three questions.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:06.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, share your honest feelings,

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:09.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when listening, don’t be defensive.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:13.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is simply a chance to openly express
how each of you feels.

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:19.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So pause your video now, and really talk.

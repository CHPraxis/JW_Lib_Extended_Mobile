Like an island of calm
In dark stormy seas,

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people
are living in peace.

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our eyes of faith,
We see beyond the clouds

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that the storm
soon will cease.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:46.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

When the new world is here,
All will be one

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
On earth
and in heaven above.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace we’ll know
We’ve never known before—

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:38.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
A world ruled
by justice and love.

To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

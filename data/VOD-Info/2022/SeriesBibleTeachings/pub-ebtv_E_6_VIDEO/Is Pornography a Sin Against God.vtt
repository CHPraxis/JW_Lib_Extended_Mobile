Once relegated to adult theaters,
bookstores, or newsstands,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
today pornography is everywhere

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:18.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
—only a click or a tap away.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not new.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Erotic art existed in ancient cultures.

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some, it was even a part
of their worship.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, even some religious people

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel that pornography is harmless

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:00.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore acceptable.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:07.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
some who read the Bible feel
that pornography and erotic literature

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
are harmful, even a sin against God.

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is God’s view of pornography?

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though the word “pornography”
doesn’t appear in the Bible,

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible’s principles make very clear
how God feels about sexual matters.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 6:9, 10

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaves no doubt about God’s view
of sexual immorality,

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
sexual acts outside of marriage.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those who are sexually immoral . . .

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:56.095 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus told us that fueling immoral desires

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:57.805 line:10% position:50% align:center
is also sinful.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:01:59.014 line:10% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.350 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Everyone who keeps on looking at a woman

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.268 line:10% position:50% align:center
“so as to have a passion for her

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:05.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
“has already committed adultery with her

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.940 line:10% position:50% align:center
in his heart.”

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Colossians 3:5, we are told

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “deaden . . . [our] body members . . .

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:14.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as respects sexual immorality,

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:18.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion.”

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pornography arouses immoral,
unclean sexual desires

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the very opposite of what we are told to do:

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“deaden,” or suppress, them.

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:39.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible warns what uncontrolled desire
can lead to.

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:14, 15 says:

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[We are] . . . drawn out
and enticed by [our] own desire.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the desire, when it has become fertile,

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“gives birth to sin;

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in turn sin, when it has been carried out,

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings forth death.”

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
If God condemns immoral acts,

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
clearly he would disapprove of us watching
people engage in such acts.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pornography, whether we watch it,
read it, or listen to it,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be highly offensive to God.

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
God wants husbands and wives to enjoy

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
love and intimacy in their marriage.

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he hates all forms of sexual uncleanness,
including pornography.

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like any bad habit,

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
viewing pornography can be overcome.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many, with God’s help,

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
have successfully done so.

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:38.113 line:10% position:50% align:center

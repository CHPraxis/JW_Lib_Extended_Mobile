Have you ever wanted to ask God:

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who are you?

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where are you?

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you care about me?”

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
For centuries,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
people everywhere have felt the need

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:29.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know their Maker.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a woman
who has never known her father.

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
All her life she has been told lies
that her father abandoned her.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
But deep inside she feels
—she knows—

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not true.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,
she receives a letter from her father.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
She learns that he is alive
and that, unbeknownst to her,

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had been reaching out
to be part of her life

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
since the day she was born.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
The daughter learns who her father is,

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:28.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
she finds him.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learn about one another

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build a strong bond

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they are inseparable friends.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is like a group

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:01.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
of letters from our heavenly Father.

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the Bible,

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:10.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn how to talk to God,

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:12.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he responds,

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the many ways

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
he shows his tender care.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible can help us to do something

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may never have thought possible

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
—be God’s friend.

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
That friendship starts by learning the name

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your heavenly Father and new Friend,

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and God tells us his name:

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:47.187 line:10% position:50% align:center
“You, whose name is Jehovah,

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:50.858 line:10% position:50% align:center
you alone are the Most High.”

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah guarantees that if you

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘draw close to him,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will draw close to you.’

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Father openly extends friendship

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:09.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all who search for him.

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you accept his invitation?

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center

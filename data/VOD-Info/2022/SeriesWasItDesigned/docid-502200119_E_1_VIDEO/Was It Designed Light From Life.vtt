Many creatures on earth
have a remarkable ability,

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that is beautiful

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:23.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and amazing:

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability to emit light,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
also known as bioluminescence.

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why do some living things glow?

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some animals glow to be noticed.

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fireflies combine chemicals to create light

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
to catch the eye of a prospective mate.

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every species flashes its own unique pattern.

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even synchronize their flashes.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
While fireflies glow to stand out,

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
some animals glow to disappear.

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
At about 3 centimeters (1 inch) long,

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
bobtail squid are good at hiding.

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when they come out to feed at night,

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re vulnerable.

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the light of the moon and stars,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
their silhouette could be seen
by predators below.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.745 line:10% position:50% align:center
So they illuminate their underside

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
to match the light from above

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.959 line:10% position:50% align:center
and effectively vanish.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
A bobtail squid alone produces no light,

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
so how does it glow?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the squid hatches,

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
a unique bacteria colonizes

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
its undeveloped light organ

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and switches on genes in the squid

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
that cause the light organ to finish growing.

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bacteria live in the organ

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and produce light for the squid.

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
The squid cannot grow a working light organ

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it never meets the bacteria,

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no other bacteria can inhabit this organ.

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
This ability of some living things
to emit light

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more than just beautiful,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.509 line:10% position:50% align:center
it’s a marvel of energy efficiency.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.178 line:10% position:50% align:center
No man-made source of light

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:41.056 line:10% position:50% align:center
can match the energy efficiency

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.600 line:10% position:50% align:center
of creatures that glow.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a process as elegant
and efficient as this

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not as simple as lighting a match.

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both fireflies and bobtail squid
grow complex organs

00:02:56.405 --> 00:03:01.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
that include a reflector, a lens,
and a filter

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:03.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just like man-made lighting.

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:08.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
All over our planet,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many organisms that emit light,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as fungi,

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
insects,

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
jellyfish,

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
squid,

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:25.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fish.

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every species uses
a different combination of chemicals

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
to produce light.

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the ability to produce
light from life evolve?

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or was it designed?

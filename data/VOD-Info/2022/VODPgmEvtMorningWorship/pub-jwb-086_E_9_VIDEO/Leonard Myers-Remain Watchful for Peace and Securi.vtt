00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.485 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, we eagerly

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.054 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
look forward to the fulfillment

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of 1 Thessalonians 5:3, don’t we?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.292 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just before Jehovah’s day begins,

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:12.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the nations will say, “Peace and security!”

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:16.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “then sudden destruction”
will come upon the wicked.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This morning, let’s remind ourselves
about some of the key elements

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:23.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this prophecy and its significance for us.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me in your Bibles
to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This prophecy was written by the apostle Paul

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:34.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Christians
in Thessalonica around 50 C.E.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s first notice
the attitude of these Christians,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned there in verse 1
—1 Thessalonians 5:1:

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:45.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now as for the times
and the seasons, brothers,

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:49.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need nothing to be written to you.”

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The zeal of these Christians was exemplary.

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an example
to other Christians in the first century,

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a good example for us today.

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imitate the Thessalonian Christians
by remaining alert

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:06.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the times in which we’re living,
remaining aware of God’s timetable,

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:08.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not being distracted.

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that so important?

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 2:

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For you yourselves know very well

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:19.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s day
is coming exactly as a thief in the night.”

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:26.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s day refers to the period that will
start with the destruction of false religion

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and culminate in the war of Armageddon.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like “a thief in the night”
—in other words, unforeseen—

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
destruction will strike when least expected.

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:40.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even true Christians who are in expectation

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be surprised by its sudden start.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we won’t be caught off guard.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because as true Christians,
we “keep in expectation,”

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as our comments for today mention.

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world will experience
much more than just a surprise.

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice our prophecy here in verse 3:

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:07.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:21.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the thought of humans achieving peace

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or wanting to achieve that peace
—that isn’t anything new.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, what happened
after the two world wars?

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:29.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The nations wanted peace.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:33.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After World War I, the League of Nations
was formed in the hope of bringing peace.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After World War II, the United Nations

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became a popular hope
of bringing peace to mankind.

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Government and religious leaders
looked to those agencies

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring about peaceful conditions.

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us may remember back in 1986

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:53.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the United Nations declaring
the International Year of Peace

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and government and religious leaders
joining the head of the Catholic Church

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to offer prayers for peace.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:04.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But neither that proclamation
of “peace and security” nor others like it

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been the fulfillment
of 1 Thessalonians 5:3.

00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:14.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, the foretold
“sudden destruction” hasn’t occurred yet.

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the fulfillment has to be
something striking enough

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to justify its being recorded
as a specific prophecy inspired by Jehovah.

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “peace and security” proclamation
must be an exceptional development,

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different from the many peace efforts
that have been made up until that time.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter what form
the proclamation takes

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how convincing it may sound,

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will only be a veneer.

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:48.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world will still be
under the control of Satan.

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think about it,
proclamations of peace

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t make any real changes in people.

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those proclamations
can’t make people love one another,

00:03:57.854 --> 00:03:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can’t stop crime,

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can’t eliminate disease and death

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:06.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things that are needed
to bring about true peace and security.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The proclamation of “peace and security”
won’t mean that the decay

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this old world has been reversed.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 3:13 says that “wicked men
and impostors will advance from” what?

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad to better?

00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, “bad to worse.”

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:28.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly no improvement foretold there.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, many in the world will be deceived

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they hear “peace and security.”

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Destruction will strike when least expected,

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when their attention
is on their hope for peace and security.

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah’s servants won’t be deceived.

00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:48.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember this image on our screens?

00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:51.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in the October 2019 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our picture description
helped us to see what’s happening.

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:56.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It states: “Patrons at a coffee shop

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:59.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“react to ‘Breaking News’ on television

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:02.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about a proclamation
of ‘peace and security.’”

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we focus on the middle of that image.

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s happening there?

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The description continues: “A Witness couple,

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“taking a break from field service,

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:15.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not fooled by this report.”

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be fooled
because we listen when God speaks.

00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We listen when God speaks.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does God tell us?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 4:8—King David,
under inspiration, wrote:

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will lie down and sleep in peace,

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you alone, O Jehovah,

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make me dwell in security.”

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So true peace and security
are only from Jehovah.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any declaration of “peace and security”

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed outside the context

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:52.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Kingdom arrangement
is counterfeit.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as worthless as counterfeit money.

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:58.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That type of peace
can’t achieve anything of lasting value.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we benefit from understanding
the significance of this prophecy?

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please notice verse 4:

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:12.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you, brothers, you are not in darkness,

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:16.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the day should overtake you
as it would thieves.”

00:06:17.493 --> 00:06:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike people in general,
we discern where current events are heading.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t keep us in the dark
regarding these significant events.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, he dignifies us

00:06:28.738 --> 00:06:31.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by kindly giving us advance knowledge

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:35.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of a general outline of events
that are going to occur in the future.

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would we expect anything less
from our loving Father?

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought this
was nicely highlighted in a quote

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:46.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>Awake!</i>  magazine some years ago.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A branch received a letter
from a 77-year-old Catholic monk

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:53.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who explained this:

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not agree with all your beliefs,

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:59.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but what I read today
in <i>The Watchtower  </i>makes me admit

00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:03.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you have your finger
on the pulse of time. . . .

00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You courageously and legitimately explain

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s words at 1 Thessalonians 5:3.”

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now notice what else he states:

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:16.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nowhere in our church
do I find such explanations.

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A person cannot dispute
the workings of holy spirit

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah dignifies us
by kindly granting us advance knowledge.

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since we’re “not in darkness”
regarding future events,

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned there in verse 4,
what more is required of us?

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s required of you and me?

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:39.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verses 6 and 8:

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:44.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, then, let us
not sleep on as the rest do,

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:47.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but let us stay awake and keep our senses.”

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8 says:
“But as for us who belong to the day,

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:53.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let us keep our senses

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and put on the breastplate of faith and love

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:59.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hope of salvation as a helmet.”

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in verse 6, in speaking of “us,”

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was obviously referring
to genuine Christians

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are active and responsive
to Jehovah’s direction,

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritually awake to God’s purpose.

00:08:14.143 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “rest” mentioned here would be
persons (perhaps professed Christians)

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are spiritually asleep
and unconcerned about the coming destruction.

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:26.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8 likens faithful servants of God

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:29.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to well-trained soldiers who are attentive,

00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have on their protective armor,

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who are ready to obey
any command given by their leader.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we’re not like unprepared troops

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sleeping in the barracks
during a time of danger and urgency.

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:46.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we don’t know
just when the proclamation

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “peace and security” will be made,

00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doesn’t lessen the need
for alertness today, does it?

00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:54.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it greatly increases

00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:59.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heightens the need for all of us
to be awake, watchful, and ready.

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our not knowing the exact time

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requires that we be ready all the time.

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what have we considered?

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imitate the Thessalonian Christians

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by remaining alert to the times
in which we’re living,

00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remaining aware of God’s timetable,
and not being distracted.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what form the proclamation
of “peace and security” takes

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how convincing it may sound,
it will only be a veneer.

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be fooled
because we listen when God speaks.

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we don’t know
when the proclamation will be made,

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we stay alert.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not knowing greatly increases and heightens
the need to be spiritually awake.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:46.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we all remain watchful and ready

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:51.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the proclamation
of “peace and security” draws ever closer!

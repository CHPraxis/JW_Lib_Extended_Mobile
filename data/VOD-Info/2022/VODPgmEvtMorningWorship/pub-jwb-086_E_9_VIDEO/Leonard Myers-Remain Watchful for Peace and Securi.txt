00:00:01 Well, we eagerly
00:00:02 look forward to the fulfillment
00:00:04 of 1 Thessalonians 5:3, don’t we?
00:00:07 Just before Jehovah’s day begins,
00:00:09 the nations will say, “Peace and security!”
00:00:12 And “then sudden destruction” will come upon the wicked.
00:00:16 This morning, let’s remind ourselves about some of the key elements
00:00:20 of this prophecy and its significance for us.
00:00:23 Please turn with me in your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
00:00:27 This prophecy was written by the apostle Paul
00:00:30 to the Christians in Thessalonica around 50 C.E.
00:00:34 And let’s first notice the attitude of these Christians,
00:00:37 as mentioned there in verse 1 —1 Thessalonians 5:1:
00:00:42 “Now as for the times and the seasons, brothers,
00:00:45 you need nothing to be written to you.”
00:00:49 The zeal of these Christians was exemplary.
00:00:52 It was an example to other Christians in the first century,
00:00:55 and it’s a good example for us today.
00:00:58 We can imitate the Thessalonian Christians by remaining alert
00:01:01 to the times in which we’re living, remaining aware of God’s timetable,
00:01:06 and not being distracted.
00:01:08 Now, why is that so important?
00:01:10 Notice verse 2:
00:01:13 “For you yourselves know very well
00:01:15 that Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.”
00:01:21 Jehovah’s day refers to the period that will start with the destruction of false religion
00:01:26 and culminate in the war of Armageddon.
00:01:29 Like “a thief in the night” —in other words, unforeseen—
00:01:34 destruction will strike when least expected.
00:01:37 Even true Christians who are in expectation
00:01:40 may be surprised by its sudden start.
00:01:43 But we won’t be caught off guard.
00:01:46 Why is that?
00:01:48 Well, because as true Christians, we “keep in expectation,”
00:01:53 just as our comments for today mention.
00:01:55 On the other hand,
00:01:57 the world will experience much more than just a surprise.
00:02:01 Notice our prophecy here in verse 3:
00:02:04 “Whenever it is that they are saying,
00:02:07 “‘Peace and security!’
00:02:09 “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,
00:02:12 “just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,
00:02:14 and they will by no means escape.”
00:02:18 Now, the thought of humans achieving peace
00:02:21 or wanting to achieve that peace —that isn’t anything new.
00:02:24 For example, what happened after the two world wars?
00:02:27 The nations wanted peace.
00:02:29 After World War I, the League of Nations was formed in the hope of bringing peace.
00:02:33 After World War II, the United Nations
00:02:36 became a popular hope of bringing peace to mankind.
00:02:39 Government and religious leaders looked to those agencies
00:02:42 to bring about peaceful conditions.
00:02:45 Many of us may remember back in 1986
00:02:49 the United Nations declaring the International Year of Peace
00:02:53 and government and religious leaders joining the head of the Catholic Church
00:02:57 to offer prayers for peace.
00:03:00 But neither that proclamation of “peace and security” nor others like it
00:03:04 have been the fulfillment of 1 Thessalonians 5:3.
00:03:07 Why not?
00:03:09 Well, for one thing, the foretold “sudden destruction” hasn’t occurred yet.
00:03:16 Also, the fulfillment has to be something striking enough
00:03:20 to justify its being recorded as a specific prophecy inspired by Jehovah.
00:03:26 The “peace and security” proclamation must be an exceptional development,
00:03:31 different from the many peace efforts that have been made up until that time.
00:03:37 But no matter what form the proclamation takes
00:03:40 or how convincing it may sound,
00:03:42 it will only be a veneer.
00:03:44 The world will still be under the control of Satan.
00:03:48 And when you think about it, proclamations of peace
00:03:51 won’t make any real changes in people.
00:03:55 Those proclamations can’t make people love one another,
00:03:57 they can’t stop crime,
00:03:59 and they can’t eliminate disease and death
00:04:02 —things that are needed to bring about true peace and security.
00:04:07 The proclamation of “peace and security” won’t mean that the decay
00:04:10 of this old world has been reversed.
00:04:13 Second Timothy 3:13 says that “wicked men and impostors will advance from” what?
00:04:18 Bad to better?
00:04:21 No, “bad to worse.”
00:04:24 Certainly no improvement foretold there.
00:04:28 Sadly, many in the world will be deceived
00:04:30 when they hear “peace and security.”
00:04:33 Destruction will strike when least expected,
00:04:36 when their attention is on their hope for peace and security.
00:04:41 But Jehovah’s servants won’t be deceived.
00:04:45 Do you remember this image on our screens?
00:04:48 It’s in the October 2019 Watchtower,
00:04:51 and our picture description helped us to see what’s happening.
00:04:53 It states: “Patrons at a coffee shop
00:04:56 “react to ‘Breaking News’ on television
00:04:59 about a proclamation of ‘peace and security.’”
00:05:02 But we focus on the middle of that image.
00:05:05 And what’s happening there?
00:05:07 The description continues: “A Witness couple,
00:05:10 “taking a break from field service,
00:05:12 are not fooled by this report.”
00:05:16 We won’t be fooled because we listen when God speaks.
00:05:21 We listen when God speaks.
00:05:24 And what does God tell us?
00:05:27 Psalm 4:8—King David, under inspiration, wrote:
00:05:31 “I will lie down and sleep in peace,
00:05:34 “for you alone, O Jehovah,
00:05:38 make me dwell in security.”
00:05:41 So true peace and security are only from Jehovah.
00:05:44 Any declaration of “peace and security”
00:05:47 expressed outside the context
00:05:49 of Jehovah’s Kingdom arrangement is counterfeit.
00:05:52 It’s as worthless as counterfeit money.
00:05:55 That type of peace can’t achieve anything of lasting value.
00:06:00 Well, how do we benefit from understanding the significance of this prophecy?
00:06:05 Please notice verse 4:
00:06:09 “But you, brothers, you are not in darkness,
00:06:12 so that the day should overtake you as it would thieves.”
00:06:17 Unlike people in general, we discern where current events are heading.
00:06:21 Jehovah doesn’t keep us in the dark regarding these significant events.
00:06:26 Actually, he dignifies us
00:06:28 by kindly giving us advance knowledge
00:06:31 in the form of a general outline of events that are going to occur in the future.
00:06:36 Would we expect anything less from our loving Father?
00:06:41 I thought this was nicely highlighted in a quote
00:06:44 in the Awake!  magazine some years ago.
00:06:46 A branch received a letter from a 77-year-old Catholic monk
00:06:51 who explained this:
00:06:53 “I do not agree with all your beliefs,
00:06:56 “but what I read today in The Watchtower  makes me admit
00:06:59 “that you have your finger on the pulse of time. . . .
00:07:03 “You courageously and legitimately explain
00:07:06 Paul’s words at 1 Thessalonians 5:3.”
00:07:09 And now notice what else he states:
00:07:12 “Nowhere in our church do I find such explanations.
00:07:16 “A person cannot dispute the workings of holy spirit
00:07:20 upon Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:07:23 Jehovah dignifies us by kindly granting us advance knowledge.
00:07:29 Now, since we’re “not in darkness” regarding future events,
00:07:32 as mentioned there in verse 4, what more is required of us?
00:07:35 What’s required of you and me?
00:07:37 Notice verses 6 and 8:
00:07:40 “So, then, let us not sleep on as the rest do,
00:07:44 but let us stay awake and keep our senses.”
00:07:47 Verse 8 says: “But as for us who belong to the day,
00:07:51 “let us keep our senses
00:07:53 “and put on the breastplate of faith and love
00:07:56 and the hope of salvation as a helmet.”
00:08:00 There in verse 6, in speaking of “us,”
00:08:03 Paul was obviously referring to genuine Christians
00:08:07 who are active and responsive to Jehovah’s direction,
00:08:10 spiritually awake to God’s purpose.
00:08:14 The “rest” mentioned here would be persons (perhaps professed Christians)
00:08:18 who are spiritually asleep and unconcerned about the coming destruction.
00:08:24 Verse 8 likens faithful servants of God
00:08:26 to well-trained soldiers who are attentive,
00:08:29 who have on their protective armor,
00:08:31 and who are ready to obey any command given by their leader.
00:08:36 See, we’re not like unprepared troops
00:08:38 sleeping in the barracks during a time of danger and urgency.
00:08:44 And even though we don’t know just when the proclamation
00:08:46 of “peace and security” will be made,
00:08:48 that doesn’t lessen the need for alertness today, does it?
00:08:51 In fact, it greatly increases
00:08:54 and heightens the need for all of us to be awake, watchful, and ready.
00:08:59 Our not knowing the exact time
00:09:02 requires that we be ready all the time.
00:09:06 Well, what have we considered?
00:09:09 We can imitate the Thessalonian Christians
00:09:11 by remaining alert to the times in which we’re living,
00:09:14 remaining aware of God’s timetable, and not being distracted.
00:09:19 No matter what form the proclamation of “peace and security” takes
00:09:23 or how convincing it may sound, it will only be a veneer.
00:09:27 We won’t be fooled because we listen when God speaks.
00:09:32 And even though we don’t know when the proclamation will be made,
00:09:36 we stay alert.
00:09:38 Not knowing greatly increases and heightens the need to be spiritually awake.
00:09:43 May we all remain watchful and ready
00:09:46 as the proclamation of “peace and security” draws ever closer!

00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:02.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Watchtower</i>  comment for today

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:06.823 line:10% position:50% align:center
makes a very bold statement when it says:

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:10.994 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Satan uses movies and television shows

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:13.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
to spread his way of thinking.”

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that thought alone
should cause anyone that loves Jehovah

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:23.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think twice before turning on a television

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a monitor.

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:30.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concerning this method
that Satan uses to spread his thinking,

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Watchtower </i> comment further says:

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:35.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He understands that storytelling

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does much more than entertain us;

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
it teaches us how to think, feel, and act.”

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:48.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when choosing our entertainment,

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to remember that Satan’s storytelling

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
has had a detrimental effect

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
upon people for generations.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look at Isaiah 55:7,

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
the results can be seen.

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Let the wicked man leave his way

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:16.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the evil man his thoughts.”

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the person that is taught by Satan

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:22.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have his thinking corrupted

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in time will end up

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an evil and wicked individual.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, verses 8 and 9

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
show us that imperfect thinking

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
is separate from Jehovah God’s thinking.

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:43.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice what it says at verse 8:

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:46.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For my thoughts are not your thoughts,

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:49.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your ways are not my ways,’
declares Jehovah.

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For as the heavens
are higher than the earth,

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so my ways are higher than your ways

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my thoughts than your thoughts.’”

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:03.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while the verse is talking
about an evil and wicked individual,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
somewhere along the way that individual was

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
an imperfect individual only.

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:12.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So something happened to push them

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the evil and the wicked category.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it was being taught by Satan the Devil.

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what happened.

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
So today, we’re all imperfect individuals.

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we maintain Jehovah’s thinking

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:30.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we don’t get pushed into the category

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
of evil and wicked?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it is a fact
that Jehovah also uses storytelling

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:42.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to adapt our thinking
to Jehovah’s thinking.

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:46.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the Bible is filled
with the experiences of individuals

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both good and bad.

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible gives us many illustrations
and many stories that touch the heart

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:56.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help us to understand
timeless principles

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:58.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Bible laws

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:01.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us in our decision process

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our ways can become

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:06.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Jehovah’s ways.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take an example.

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:11.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, throughout the Bible,
it really highlights

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s forgiving nature.

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:15.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s talk about that.

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:17.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Exodus (first of all)

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Exodus chapter 34 and we’ll read verse 7.

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember we’re being taught

00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s way of forgiveness.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it says this:

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Showing loyal love to thousands,

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
pardoning error and transgression and sin.”

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s Jehovah’s forgiving nature.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then if you turn to Isaiah 1:18,

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how he paints
a picture about this for us

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:53.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 1:18.

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “‘Come, now,

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:01.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let us set matters straight between us,’
says Jehovah.

00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:04.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Though your sins are like scarlet,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘they will be made as white as snow;

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:11.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘though they are as red as crimson cloth,

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will become like wool.’”

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, there again, it’s identifying
that this is Jehovah’s way.

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:21.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to touch our heart
and really go to the core of the matter,

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has a story told.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in fact, Jesus did that.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found in Luke chapter 15

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:32.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
(about the prodigal, or the lost son),

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 15, verse 11.

00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re not going to read it,

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:39.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’ll start to tell the story
in just a few sentences.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:43.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look at verse 11,
there was ‘a man that had two sons.’

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:48.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 12,
the younger son took his inheritance.

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:52.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 13,
“he traveled to a distant country

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and . . . squandered” his inheritance.

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, in verses 15 and 16,
he became destitute.

00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 17, ‘he finally came to his senses’

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:04.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and returned to his father.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 20 shows
that “his father caught sight of him

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and was moved with pity,

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:15.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he ran and embraced him
and tenderly kissed him.”

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:20.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what are some of the lessons
that Jehovah is teaching us

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of this story?

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
Jehovah yearns to extend forgiveness.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s his forgiving nature.

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like that father,

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
we recognize that sinners
may waste resources given to them.

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never lose hope that a sinner will return,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll give a warm reception

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they do return to Jehovah God.

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sinners can be restored completely

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regain a place in the family of Jehovah.

00:05:55.838 --> 00:06:00.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, we learn that sinners
may have to hit rock bottom

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:02.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
before they return to their senses.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you agree?

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:05.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are valuable lessons

00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:09.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help us to understand Jehovah’s thinking

00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:13.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to adapt our imperfect thinking to his.

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as a part
of using this as an illustration,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>New World Translation</i>  takes
a little over 500 words

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:23.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to tell this story,

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
but less than 10 words are used

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:29.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
to describe the wrongdoing
of the prodigal son.

00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:32.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look at verse 13, it says

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was “living a debauched life.”

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 30,
(a few more details) it says

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:43.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he ‘squandered his belongings
with prostitutes.’

00:06:43.386 --> 00:06:48.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here is an example of a story
that contains some wrongdoing,

00:06:48.124 --> 00:06:50.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in no way does it spotlight it,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
glorify it, or make it attractive.

00:06:54.097 --> 00:06:57.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it draws us closer to Jehovah God,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping us to understand
his forgiving nature.

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:04.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s just why the story was written.

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:10.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we can only imagine
how Satan would twist the story line

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:13.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the prodigal son.

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he portray the father
as restrictive and intolerant?

00:07:19.622 --> 00:07:22.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he show the rebellious son’s home life

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:27.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
as oppressive, stifling his independence?

00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:33.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he insert some disrespectful
or obscene language in the script?

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much time do you imagine
that he would devote

00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:41.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the immoral aspects of the story?

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:46.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when the son returns home,
would he be repentant?

00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:50.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or would the father be portrayed as mellowing

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
and becoming tolerant?

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Might the son even return home
with one of the women that he was with?

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:05.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, with Satan’s stories,
when we read between the lines,

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s always filth and untruth.

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
The story content is a repeating plot

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:17.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a plot of rebellion, of violence,
and of immorality.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, it’s the same basic story

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
told over and over again

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
with different characters.

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s stories,
when we read them,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
we discover something every time.

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:39.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, when we
meditatively read between the lines,

00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:41.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
the story blossoms, doesn’t it?

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:45.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems that no matter
how often we read the story,

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn something about Jehovah

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can adapt to our own thinking.

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in making decisions
regarding entertainment,

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:59.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to reason on the matter:

00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is teaching me?

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will the entertainment refresh me

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accomplish something good for me?

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:13.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is there a chance that it will undermine
my faith in Jehovah God?

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:18.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
If in doubt,
wouldn’t it be wise to simply refrain?

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:22.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while in this system,
we need to be careful

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our entertainment choices.

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s be taught by Jehovah

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can think and feel

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reason on matters as he does

00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:35.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we look forward to the time

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:38.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the only option available to us

00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:41.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be safe and wholesome entertainment.

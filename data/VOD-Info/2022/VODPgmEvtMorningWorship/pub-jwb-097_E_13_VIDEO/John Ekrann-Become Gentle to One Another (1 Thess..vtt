Our text for today,

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:04.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
1 Thessalonians 2:7,

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:07.190 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is part of a very warm,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
comforting, and encouraging letter

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:11.361 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—1 Thessalonians.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s clear from the tone and message

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.664 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:18.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really loved the brothers and sisters
in Thessalonica.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was there at the founding
of the congregation,

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:25.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he saw the persecution 
that they endured with the Jews

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:27.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they tried to come into the truth,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew the persecution
they were still going through.

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was concerned about them,
and he wanted to come see them in person.

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at 1 Thessalonians 2:17,

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “But when we were
separated from you, brothers,

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for just a short time
(in person, not in our hearts),

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of our [very] strong desire,

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:55.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we made every effort to see you in person.”

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was concerned about them;
he really wanted to know how they were doing.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t that a nice expression
that Paul uses

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:05.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that while he couldn’t be there “in person,”

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was with them ‘in his heart’?

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:12.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel the same way today
when we’re separated from our families,

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our congregations, and our close friends.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are with them, not “in person,”

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re with them “in our hearts.”

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since he couldn’t be there in person,
Paul sent Timothy.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Timothy came back with a very good report

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how the brothers and sisters
were doing.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:34.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Paul writes this inspired letter
of 1 Thessalonians to them.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, 1 Thessalonians is an excellent example

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:41.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a well-written and encouraging letter.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re looking for ideas on how to write
an encouraging letter to others,

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:50.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Thessalonians is a good example
to study and look at.

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very heartfelt and meaningful letter.

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you read or listen to the whole letter
(it only takes about 15 minutes),

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:02.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can easily imagine
that Paul was alive today

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wrote that letter to you
and your congregation.

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so warm and encouraging that you
may want to listen to it several times.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:14.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It feels really appropriate
to the trials and challenges

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we, many of us, are facing today.

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look at a few verses
from 1 Thessalonians

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us
to endure our current trials.

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to cover four basic themes:

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:29.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commendation, gentleness,

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friendship, and consolation.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk about commendation.

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look at 1 Thessalonians 1:3

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so all these verses are
from 1 Thessalonians—verse 3, chapter 1:

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:47.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we continually remember
your faithful work, your loving labor,

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your endurance because of your hope

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:54.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our Lord Jesus Christ
in the presence of our God and Father.”

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:58.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, look for occasions to commend others

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be as specific as possible.

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:06.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister got a text message recently

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from another sister thanking her
and her husband for something

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had done over ten years ago
for that couple.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do you feel when you
receive a well-written card,

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
text message, or email that commends you
for something that you have done

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or recalls something
that you did for someone?

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:29.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You feel encouraged and strengthened;
you feel happy.

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, commendation helps all of us to know

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:35.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others see the good that we’re doing,
and they appreciate it.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul described his reaction

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he got the good report from Timothy
about how they were doing.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used a phrase in chapter 3 and verse 8

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he said: “We are revitalized.”

00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:50.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t that a good way to put it?

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we get commendation
and we hear a good report, we’re revitalized.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now next, after commendation,

00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider our text for today,
chapter 2 and verse 7.

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:07.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as when a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.”

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, gentleness.

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you get a cut on your hand

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and someone else wants to help you
take care of it,

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you want that cut to be handled?

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gently.
It hurts.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, emotionally, many people today
are really hurt,

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to care for them gently.

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:34.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are our conversations,

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our text messages, emails, letters—

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we gentle?

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the stress and pressures of life
in this old system,

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be easy to be abrupt, or curt,

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:50.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or short, in our dealings with others.

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re going to send an email,

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we read it over and think for a moment
before we press Send?

00:04:57.814 --> 00:05:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you receive an email that’s very strong

00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a bit biting,
are we gentle in our response,

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:09.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
realizing that others are also feeling
the emotional strain of things?

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:14.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we take time to express
our tender heart and care?

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we may send a card
or a text message

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:22.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a couple of scriptures cited,
and this is always appreciated.

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one sister said that what she
appreciated even more

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when someone sent a card and they

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually wrote out the phrase
in the scripture

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they appreciated and said why

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that scripture or phrase
meant something to them.

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:42.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After gentleness, he mentions friendship.

00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:45.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at chapter 2 and verse 8:

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:52.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,
we were determined to impart to you,

00:05:52.402 --> 00:05:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only the good news of God
but also our very selves,

00:05:56.973 --> 00:06:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that expression ‘impart to you
our very selves’ is powerful.

00:06:05.648 --> 00:06:10.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was not just their Bible teacher,
but he was a close friend.

00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us need close friends

00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:17.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially these days—
ones that you can talk to,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
express your feelings to,
and be confident that they’re going to listen

00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect your thoughts and privacy.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul came to really love
the brothers and sisters in Thessalonica.

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:32.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not treat them as a to-do list,
checking off things or say,

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:36.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is my job to teach them the Bible”
and move on.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The relationship went deeper than that.

00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:43.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we may work together;
we may be in the same congregation;

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may have a meal together,

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:49.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that does not automatically
make us friends.

00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:52.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The old saying ‘to have a friend,
you have to be a friend’

00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrates that being a friend really takes

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of effort and work on our part.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we true friends with others?

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we taking the initiative
to make close friends?

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:09.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul says, it really means giving

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:11.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “our very selves.”

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:15.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after friendship, he mentions consoling.

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look at chapter 2 and verse 11,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “You well know that we
kept exhorting and consoling you

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bearing witness to each one of you,

00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:31.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as a father does his children.”

00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:34.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, earlier, the apostle Paul
had used a mother

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:37.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to illustrate gentleness.

00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:41.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he uses a father to illustrate consoling.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see that the apostle Paul
really felt like he was family

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:50.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the congregation there in Thessalonica.

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:55.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, life has some
very sad and tragic events.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:00.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a good father knows
how to console and comfort his children

00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things go wrong and bad things happen.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul knew that the Thessalonians

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually going through a tough time,

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:12.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of them had suffered

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:15.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the loss in death of friends or family.

00:08:15.878 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his very consoling reasoning
in chapter 5

00:08:21.717 --> 00:08:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we’ll just read one verse
about the hope of the resurrection.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at verse 10:

00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:30.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He died for us,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that whether
we stay awake or are asleep,

00:08:34.263 --> 00:08:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should live together with him.”

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s so consoling, isn’t it?

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Death does not break
that person’s relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:47.743 --> 00:08:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alive or dead, Jehovah loves all of us.

00:08:53.382 --> 00:08:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we review,

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the inspired advice

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Paul’s warm and loving letter

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:05.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his friends in Thessalonica
can encourage all of us to commend,

00:09:05.228 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be gentle, to show true friendship,

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to console one another.

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:15.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we head deeper into this old system,

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:18.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s kind of like watching
the chaos on a ship

00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:23.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the passengers
realize that the ship is sinking.

00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:27.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We, though, on the other hand,
are in the lifeboats, and we’re together.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re trying to help one another

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:34.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make it through this situation
until we can be rescued.

00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:37.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re comforting, consoling,
and helping one another

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waiting to be rescued.

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:45.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to all of you, we can say the words
of chapter 5 and verse 11:

00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:48.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, keep encouraging one another

00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:51.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and building one another up,

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:54.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as you are in fact doing.”

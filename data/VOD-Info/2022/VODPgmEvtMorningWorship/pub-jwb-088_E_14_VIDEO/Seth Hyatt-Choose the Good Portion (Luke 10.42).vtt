00:00:01.718 --> 00:00:04.287 line:10% position:50% align:center
The account from which the words

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10% position:50% align:center
of today’s scripture text is drawn

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
is really the Scriptural introduction

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:14.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
to these two women

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
—Mary and Martha.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we know about them?

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:21.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they were siblings,

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:26.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were both women
of faith, disciples of Christ;

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:30.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and each had
a unique personality and outlook.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:34.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not unusual in families, is it?

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we can imagine their excitement

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:38.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the late summer

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:42.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
or early autumn of the year 32 C.E.

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they prepared their home

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a very special guest,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, the Son of God.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what it would be like

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have Jesus visit your home?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when Jesus arrived,

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha was busy with preparations.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Mary chose to sit at Jesus’ feet,

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:08.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the account tells us
that she kept listening.

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha was a product of her upbringing.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
In first-century Jewish life,

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:20.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
women were taught
to care for domestic duties.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
So her frustration with her sister

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
reached a breaking point, didn’t it?

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:29.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can read about it in Luke chapter 10.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn there with me, please,

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Luke chapter 10,

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beginning in verse 40,

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read that “Martha, on the other hand,

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:46.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was distracted
with attending to many duties.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So she came to [Jesus] and said:
‘Lord, does it not matter to you

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:54.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that my sister has left me alone
to attend to things?

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:59.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell her to [get up and] come and help me.’”

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:03.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I’ve heard my sister say that to me

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our childhood days,

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:09.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get up and come help me.”

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very typical of siblings, isn’t it?

00:02:15.084 --> 00:02:17.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there was a problem.

00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:21.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was Mary the problem?

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the scripture indicates

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Martha was distracted,

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she was probably surprised
when rather than correcting Mary,

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:34.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said in verse 41:

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:36.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Martha, Martha,

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:40.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are anxious
and disturbed about many things.”

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was gentle readjusting.

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 42:

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A few things, though,
are needed, or just one.”

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Martha needed to adjust her thinking.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was distracted,

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then rather than correct Mary,

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did Jesus do?

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
He commended her, didn’t he?

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was noteworthy too

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in first-century Jewish life

00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:15.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
women were not encouraged
to pursue academic studies.

00:03:15.812 --> 00:03:18.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a woman to sit at the feet of a rabbi

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the purpose of taking in instruction
was very unusual.

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:26.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus was not offended by it.

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he commended Mary.

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:30.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
She “chose the good portion,”

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:35.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the footnote on the verse
tells us she chose “the best portion.”

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Martha offended by the counsel?

00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:43.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just a few months later,

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
we meet Mary and Martha again

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible account in John chapter 11.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:53.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on this occasion, very sadly,

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
their brother, Lazarus, had died.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:04:00.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Martha was the first to greet Jesus
when he entered Bethany,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what followed
was a deep spiritual discussion

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reveals Martha’s faith.

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:10.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only did she express faith
in the resurrection

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:13.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she had this to say about Jesus.

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:17.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at John 11:27:

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:23.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She said to him: ‘Yes, Lord, I have believed

00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that you are the Christ, the Son of God,

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one coming into the world.’”

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Martha was a woman of faith.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 32, we find
the only words in the Bible

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:40.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
attributed to Mary:

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Lord, if you had been here,
my brother would not have died.”

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, both women
were disciples of Christ, women of faith.

00:04:51.174 --> 00:04:53.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our last glimpse

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes just six days before Jesus died.

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had opportunity, one more time,

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:02.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy sweet fellowship with this family

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:05.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
who he loved so much.

00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the home of Simon the leper, Jesus,

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary, Martha, Lazarus,

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had been resurrected,

00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:19.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus’ apostles gathered for a meal.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what
that must have been like?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:26.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in chapter 12 of John, verse 2,

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read that “they spread
an evening meal for [Jesus] . . . ,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Martha was serving them.”

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:39.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s her hospitable spirit
coming to the fore,

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus didn’t criticize her for that.

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary enters the scene in verse 3.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
She poured perfumed oil on Jesus’ head.

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Subsequent verses tell us
that the oil would have been worth

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a year’s wage
for the common wage earner at that time.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did Mary get that oil?

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible doesn’t say.

00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:07.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the point is, she gave her best.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:11.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than being focused on food,
she was focused on Jesus.

00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:14.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just as she had been criticized earlier,

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s criticized again, but not by Martha.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:22.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
On this occasion, Judas takes the lead.

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:24.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parallel accounts in Matthew and Mark

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell us that the other apostles joined in

00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:30.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what seemed to be a valid objection.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
The oil could have been sold
and given to the poor.

00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
But again, Jesus comes to Mary’s defense.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 7 says: “Let her alone.”

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:49.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we learn
from these two women?

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are three:

00:06:52.628 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one, spiritual people
can make different choices.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have different strengths.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true that two siblings
can grow up in the same spiritual home?

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:04.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on reaching adulthood,

00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
one may feel the need
to marry and have children

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:09.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may do a beautiful job

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
of bringing up children
in the way of Jehovah.

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the other, even from a young age,

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be focused on the full-time ministry,

00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s the goal.

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:23.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in pursuing that goal,

00:07:23.292 --> 00:07:27.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sibling may decide
to forgo having a family.

00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:31.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may decide not to marry
in order to serve Jehovah undistracted.

00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:36.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Question: Is one
more spiritual than the other?

00:07:36.906 --> 00:07:38.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not necessarily.

00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:43.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus didn’t counsel Martha

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:45.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she was hospitable.

00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:49.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
He counseled Martha
because she was distracted.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his life story, Stanley Jones,

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
who spent seven years
in solitary confinement

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a Chinese prison,

00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:02.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaks of a time when he became distracted.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was able to get hold of some textbooks,

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he began to read those textbooks,

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he enjoyed them very much.

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:16.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he says then: ‘I realized
I was neglecting my Bible reading.’

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:19.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if it’s possible

00:08:19.148 --> 00:08:23.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an imprisoned missionary
to become distracted,

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:26.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would be fooling ourselves
to think we couldn’t.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:30.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could a Christian parent become distracted?

00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could a pioneer become distracted?

00:08:33.563 --> 00:08:37.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could a Bethelite become distracted?

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:40.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Secular pursuits, a career,

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:44.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
education, problems, hobbies

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
—any of those could distract us

00:08:47.343 --> 00:08:51.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we neglect spiritual priorities.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the lesson:

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each day, we need to demonstrate

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:57.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re choosing “the good portion.”

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:00.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second lesson:

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those around you may not always understand

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:06.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
the reason for your choices.

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:08.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it.

00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary was criticized first by her sister

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then by responsible brothers
for her choices.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:20.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
And something similar could happen today.

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:23.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may have relatives or brothers or sisters

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:26.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
who don’t understand why we sacrifice

00:09:26.349 --> 00:09:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
our resources, our energy, or our time

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue the goals that we pursue.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that happens, don’t be disheartened.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, you’re not the first.

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:40.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary knew what it was like.

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:44.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, Jesus
understood and appreciated it.

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:48.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, lesson number three:

00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:53.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jesus, be quick
to commend those around you

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:57.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have demonstrated
that they’re choosing the good portion.

00:09:57.813 --> 00:10:02.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our congregation,
we have youngsters and older ones as well.

00:10:02.785 --> 00:10:05.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right here in our work environment,

00:10:05.154 --> 00:10:07.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re surrounded by individuals

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have chosen the good portion.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commend them.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Express appreciation.

00:10:14.297 --> 00:10:17.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in reflecting that appreciative attitude

00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:19.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will strengthen your own resolve

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:24.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go on choosing the good portion.

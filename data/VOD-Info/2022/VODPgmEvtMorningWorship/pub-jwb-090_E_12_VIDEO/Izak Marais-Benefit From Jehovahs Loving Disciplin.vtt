WEBVTT

00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:05.155 line:10% position:50% align:center
It is easy to admit that we are imperfect.

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:08.124 line:10% position:50% align:center
But why is it that it is so painful

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
when we receive correction?

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:12.062 line:10% position:50% align:center
We all know the right attitude

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:13.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
we should have,

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.934 line:10% position:50% align:center
as outlined here at Psalm 141:5.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shall we read that?

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 141:5—it says:

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Should the righteous one strike me,

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:28.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it would be an act of loyal love;

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should he reprove me,
it would be like oil on my head,

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
which my head would never refuse.”

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
So maybe we are affected

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a worldly view of discipline.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
One dictionary says that discipline is

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:49.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“punishment to gain control.”

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another dictionary says
that “discipline is to make people obey

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to punish when they don’t.”

00:00:57.073 --> 00:01:00.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so different from Jehovah God’s
point of view, isn’t it?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our text for today, here in Hebrews,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that Jehovah
invites us as his children.

00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says in verse 5 “my son”

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:16.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then in verse 6:
“For those whom Jehovah loves

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:18.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
he disciplines.”

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:22.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it puts discipline
in a very appealing light, doesn’t it?

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:24.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the bottom line is

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
discipline is a form of training.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s actually a very exciting process

00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:37.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it helps us
to get to know Jehovah even better.

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:40.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what we would like to do now is discuss

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
three common reactions to discipline.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess all of us have been guilty of them
at one time or another.

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:53.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is to feel very crushed

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
—embarrassed—

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have this pain in our heart.

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:00.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is very natural.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see this even in little children

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that they can feel very crushed

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they experience
the displeasure of their parents.

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they react with a long face,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe they even start pouting.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:20.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we as Christians, mature grown-ups,

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:22.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t react that way, do we?

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:28.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the question is, How do we react?

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:30.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should be the proper reaction?

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, do not be so overwhelmed

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the emotion.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not feel sorry for yourself.

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:41.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another important point is

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:43.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it is painful

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the discipline exposes

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:50.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
something very sensitive inside us.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:54.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is much better to respond positively
toward the discipline

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:57.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the counsel is given for our benefit.

00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us read the words here at Proverbs 15:32

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:05.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 15:32.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:09.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Anyone refusing discipline

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
despises his life.”

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is a miserable life

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:18.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
while fighting our correction, or discipline.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it goes on to say:
“But whoever listens to reproof

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“acquires understanding.

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:29.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fear of Jehovah is a training in wisdom,

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before glory there is humility.”

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:37.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us learn the lessons
and be trained by Jehovah.

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get the sense

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
before strong counsel comes

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before some of the bad consequences

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
come upon us.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second negative reaction we may have

00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that of dismissing the counsel:

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, the counsel is wrong for me.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:03:59.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s inappropriate.

00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m not that bad,
and the person who counseled me

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘does not see the full picture.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:09.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the way, they can improve
in their way of giving counsel.’

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, usually when we have this reaction,

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:17.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is because the counsel exposed

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:20.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we love what is wrong,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we cover that

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
by accusing the bearer of the message
as unqualified.

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:31.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is <i>we</i>  don’t see the big picture.

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe we don’t want to see
the big picture.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
And could it be that we rely
on our own understanding

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of Jehovah’s view?

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:46.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about having this attitude
here at Proverbs 25:12

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an attitude toward the counselor

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:51.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he gives us counsel and advice?

00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:56.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 25:12

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says: “Like an earring of gold

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:03.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and an ornament of fine gold

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a wise reprover to the receptive ear.”

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:10.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can dignify the process

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:15.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
by adorning the bearer of the message
—the counselor—

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
with gold, as it were.

00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:21.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we need to respond with love.

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:24.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly see God’s love,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love the correction
and the discipline we have.

00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:30.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the third reaction,

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:32.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may be irritated

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:36.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
or angered by the counsel,

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Who do they think they are?’

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it’s a peer.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:45.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it is someone, in our opinion,
who is in a lower status than we are.

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They have not been in the truth as long.’

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They do not know as much.’

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They are younger,’
or whatever reason we may have.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:57.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may look down on them
because they are not good teachers.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is, Are we willing to admit

00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah knows better

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that it is really Jehovah talking to us?

00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:11.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there may be a very important reason

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
why Jehovah selected that person
or that agency

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:18.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to us and give us the advice.

00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:22.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the scripture for our day text
here at Hebrews 12:5

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that we must not despise

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:28.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s counsel.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says we must not “give up

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:33.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
when [we] are corrected by him.”

00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we may say,
“Well, if Jehovah comes to me

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he gives me this counsel directly,

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:41.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
of course I will listen.”

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:43.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t this Jehovah’s way

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
of speaking to us directly?

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the case of David.

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:53.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Nathan came to him,

00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
David didn’t rebel.

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was not angry with Nathan.

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:01.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
He accepted the counsel,

00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said: “I have sinned against Jehovah.”

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the point?

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not dismiss counsel;

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
accept the counsel wholeheartedly.

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:20.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in summary, see the big picture.

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are part of Jehovah’s family,

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we hopefully are,

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us will receive much counsel,
much advice.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:37.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the advice, all the counsel,
that comes from Jehovah

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:39.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
is for our good.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:42.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is shaping us individually

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:46.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become the kind of person
he wants us to become.

00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:49.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is not really a discussion

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:51.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the need of discipline,

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:56.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it is a discussion
of our attitude toward discipline.

00:07:57.393 --> 00:08:00.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s words in Hebrews 12

00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:03.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
are taken from Proverbs.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in Proverbs chapter 3,
it discusses discipline.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:09.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there toward the end of the discussion

00:08:09.138 --> 00:08:12.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 3:18,

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:16.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
it gives this beautiful invitation
to all of us.

00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:19.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:18

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:21.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says about discipline:

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is a tree of life

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:27.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who take hold of it,

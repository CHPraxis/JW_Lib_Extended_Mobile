00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, throughout his earthly ministry,

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus expressed and showed gratitude.

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:08.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at what we can learn

00:00:08.958 --> 00:00:11.428 line:10% position:50% align:center
from what he said and what he did

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
as a thankful person.

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:16.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
First, Jesus’ heartfelt prayers of thanks

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
had an effect on others.

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider what happened the day after Jesus

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
miraculously fed thousands

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
near Bethsaida along the Sea of Galilee.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 6:23, we read

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “boats from Tiberias . . . arrived
near the place where they ate the bread

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the Lord had given thanks.”

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
That added comment,
“after the Lord had given thanks,”

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be in there for a reason.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
this tells us that the boats arrived

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:52.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just near the place
where a miracle had occurred the day before,

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it also tells us
that the boats arrived near the place

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:59.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the Lord had given thanks.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:04.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
That fact was recorded under inspiration
many years later by the apostle John.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this shows us that Jesus’ true disciples

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
saw and remembered more

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:13.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the miracle itself.

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also witnessed and remembered

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ heartfelt prayer of thanks.

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:23.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt Jesus’ disciples
followed his good example.

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at two of the many fine qualities

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:31.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Christians who imitate
Jesus’ good example display,

00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:35.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
namely, courage and humility.

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
We begin with courage.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:40.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was moved by a deep sense of gratitude

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be courageous.

00:01:42.952 --> 00:01:44.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say this?

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
because of something that he said

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
during a very critical time for him.

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll recall
that in the garden of Gethsemane,

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:56.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus prayed out of great concern

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the reproach that his death

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one being charged
with blasphemy and sedition

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:05.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
would bring to his heavenly Father.

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus implored Jehovah

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:11.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a death of this sort
might pass away from him.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, despite such intense feelings, he said:

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:18.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not as I will, but as you will.”

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Jesus
to make that courageous statement,

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:24.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing what it would lead to?

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:27.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find the answer in Hebrews 12:2,

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says in part of Jesus

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “for the joy that was set before him

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
he endured a torture stake, despising shame.”

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:43.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what helped Jesus
to accept God’s will for him?

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The joy that was set before him.”

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
That joy included his hope, yes,

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:52.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
but above all his privilege to honor Jehovah

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:55.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping his integrity.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how much his enemies
opposed him, mocked him,

00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:03.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
or tried to heap shame on him
and his heavenly Father,

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus put that out of his mind,

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
despising shame and finding joy.

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the joy that was set before him”
he gratefully and courageously

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:19.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepted the privilege
of putting God’s will ahead of his own.

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:24.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not as I will, but as you will,” he said.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:29.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do God’s people today imitate
Jesus’ grateful and courageous example?

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ true followers today
strive to do God’s will

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:38.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite threats of imprisonment,
actual imprisonment,

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
torture, verbal abuse,
loss of livelihood, and so forth.

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:47.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when our brothers
are unjustly imprisoned,

00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do all that we can for them,

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
including speaking up in their behalf

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, praying for them.

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jesus, gratitude for the privilege

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:00.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know and worship Jehovah

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:04.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the blessing of serving
in this marvelous brotherhood that we have

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
should move us to have and show courage

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
in doing God’s will today.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we allow gratitude, not shame,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take root and grow within us.

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:20.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second quality
that we want to look at is this:

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grateful Christians are humble people.

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:26.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we’ll consider Jesus’ example.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every miracle that he performed

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every teaching that he passed on
to his disciples

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
was carried out in humility.

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:40.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus never sought
to draw attention to himself, did he?

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, what do we see?

00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:46.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see that he was grateful
for the privilege to serve others

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:49.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grateful for every positive response

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he saw in others.

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what he saw went beneath the surface.

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind, think about what happened

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:02.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
during Jesus’ last evening
with his faithful apostles

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
when their imperfections
were on full display, you could say.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, out of all of them,

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
only Jesus would wash the feet of the others.

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, despite this, Jesus saw what?

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:17.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw the good in them,

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was motivated
to do something extraordinary for them.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take note of what Jesus saw in them

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:27.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we read Luke chapter 22,

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 28 and 29,

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:33.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jesus said this to them:

00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, you are the ones
who have stuck with me in my trials;

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:41.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I make a covenant with you,

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:44.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as my Father has made
a covenant with me,

00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:46.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a kingdom.”

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:50.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
What moved Jesus to do this for them?

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gratitude.

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:56.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Jesus saw the good in them
—didn’t he?—and he remembered it.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are the ones who have stuck with me
in my trials,” he said.

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:03.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a wonderful gift he was offering to them

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
by inviting them to share in his Kingdom,

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what outstanding humility he displayed
in doing this!

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not view himself
as so great in his own eyes

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he could overlook the good
that was in his disciples.

00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:23.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was humble, he appreciated the good,

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he truly “loved them to the end.”

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we likewise show humility and gratitude

00:06:29.572 --> 00:06:33.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
though faced with the imperfections
of our brothers?

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must remember
that Jesus never overreacted

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the obvious faults of his disciples.

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:43.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he was grateful for their support.

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he always looked for and found

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:49.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and found—the good in them.

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:52.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should want to do the same
for one another

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of us need it.

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:58.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we need one another
now more than ever, don’t we?

00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
The gratitude that we feel
for being in pure worship

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
should move us to seek
the good in one another always.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:09.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with this, we should be moved
to reach out

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encourage one another
in any way that we can.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes giving sincere commendation
that stems from gratitude.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus said: “You are the ones

00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:25.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have stuck with me in my trials.”

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:28.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was commending them,
acknowledging the good in them.

00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was thankful for it.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
We too should give sincere commendation

00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:37.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
to others when appropriate
and do it out of gratitude.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really mean it from the heart.

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we considered this morning?

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:46.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We looked
at how Jesus’ sincere prayers of thanks

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
were long remembered by his disciples.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:54.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, his prayers were remembered
as much as his miracles.

00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:58.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
As another example,
think of what we read at John 11:41,

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
where—when resurrecting Lazarus—
Jesus offered a prayer

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started off by saying: “Father,

00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thank you that you have heard me.”

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
That resurrection was astounding!

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:16.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus’ prayer of thanks
was also remembered.

00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also reviewed how Christlike qualities,
such as courage and humility,

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow out of a grateful heart.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we considered ways
in which we can show such qualities.

00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah’s people
are definitely doing this.

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
The numbers that we hear about
of those now attending our meetings

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:40.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
are proof of the grateful spirit
found in God’s people

00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:44.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in those who see the wisdom of returning

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:47.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
while there’s still time.

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t yet know
when this present world situation will end,

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:57.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know this:
Jehovah’s purpose will not fail.

00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:59.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and his Son will make certain

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all causes for harm disappear forever.

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
And aren’t we grateful for that?

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our job is this:

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:13.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to make certain
that we are ready to accept the opportunities

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may yet present themselves
in doing Jehovah’s will

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:21.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the complete end arrives.

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:23.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes giving everything we’ve got

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:27.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help others come over to Jehovah’s side.

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
The gratitude and humility and the courage

00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:33.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
that result from a thankful spirit

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:35.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to do this.

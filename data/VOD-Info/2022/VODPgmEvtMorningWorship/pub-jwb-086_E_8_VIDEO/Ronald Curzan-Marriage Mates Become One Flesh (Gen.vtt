Today’s text reminds us

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:06.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our loving God, Jehovah,

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:08.091 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and what he’s done for you and for me

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:09.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and for all humans.

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He is the Originator of marriage.

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he is the Marriage-Bond Maker.

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So his purpose from the very beginning,
from Adam and Eve to our day,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that they would stick together

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that they would be “one flesh,”
bonded together—

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it would be a permanent and lasting
and happy relationship.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s the problem.

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, we have Satan,
who is the original bond breaker.

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to break marriages and families.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:42.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to get in between your marriage
and my marriage

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cause a wedge.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:48.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will make or break our marriage?

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the key is to the extent

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:54.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to which we show and prove
our love to Jehovah

00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are loyal to his commandments
—including the marriage arrangement—

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our love and our loyalty to our mate.

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must also prove our hatred

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what Satan has done and is doing today

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by breaking up families and marriages

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making sure that nothing will interfere

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the tight bond, or secure bond,

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have within our marriage.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the marriage-bond breakers,
the Pharisees,

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were trying to test Jesus in his day,
do you remember what Jesus did?

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:28.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the first thing he did
was to go back and quote

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah said about Adam and Eve.

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you go in your Bible, let’s go

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Matthew 19:5, 6.

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus told these Pharisees:

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Didn’t you read about this already?’

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 5, he goes on to say:
“For this reason

00:01:46.422 --> 00:01:48.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a man will leave his father and his mother

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:51.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and [he] will stick to his wife,

00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:54.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the two will [become] one flesh.”

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he quoted exactly what Jehovah said.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he went
a little bit further in verse 6.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:04.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, what God has yoked together,

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:10.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let no man put apart.”

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:13.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that our study notes help us

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate what “stick to” means.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Literally, it means “to glue;

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:22.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join (bind) closely together;
to cling to.”

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:25.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to a union
of a husband and wife,

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they need to be glued together.

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:30.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the term “one flesh”?

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:34.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That could also mean
“one body” or “one person.”

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:38.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It describes the closest bond
between a husband and wife

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—inseparable companions.

00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says in the study note
that “such a union cannot be broken up

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without damage to the partners bound by it.”

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So something that’s supposed to be
permanently glued,

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:53.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you try to tear it apart,
there will be problems.

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People often say that when
a newly married couple gets married,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they “tied the knot.”

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:00.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we’ve all heard that.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But unfortunately,
some couples or many couples

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go from being stuck on their partner

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—being attracted to them because of maybe
looks or because of things in common—

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to actually being stuck with them.

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:16.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Big difference.

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:18.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They quickly want to untie the knot

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:22.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—separate the bond and become unglued.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how many in the world are.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not you,
and that’s not Jehovah’s people in general.

00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:32.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions are enjoying
a happy, successful marriage.

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what are these marriages missing?

00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are they becoming unglued?

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they don’t have the right kind of glue.

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:42.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is the glue

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will bond your marriage
and all marriages around the world?

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we need?

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Paul tells us at Colossians 3:14

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the secret to success,
the glue, that bonds us together.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Colossians 3:14,

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “Love [love] . . . is

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:08.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a perfect bond of union.”

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the glue that is missing
in most marriages.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a romantic type of love
but the attachment that will not let go

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that will continue to be bonded
not only to the couple

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to Jehovah.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we know, if we’re trying
to glue something together

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with wood glue or plastics
or some kind of adhesive,

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:32.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many different types of components,
or ingredients, within glue

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:36.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that give it maximum holding power,
or strength.

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:40.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the bonding ingredients,
or materials, found in love?

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:43.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re still in Colossians chapter 3,

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:46.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul lists many bond makers

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as bond breakers.

00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:53.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go through the list of bond breakers
so that we know what to avoid.

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in Colossians chapter 3,
notice verse 5.

00:04:56.512 --> 00:05:01.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bond breakers are
“sexual immorality, uncleanness,

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:06.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uncontrolled sexual passion,
hurtful desire, and greediness.”

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:07.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Total selfishness.

00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:09.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see this in most marriages today.

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8 goes on to say
“wrath, anger, badness,

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
abusive speech, and obscene talk.”

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:18.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 9, it’s “[lying].”

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these are things
that will tear our marriage apart.

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:23.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will not keep it together.

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know this.

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:27.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we need to ask ourselves,
‘If I know this,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘why would I want to bring into my marriage
anything that would tear it apart

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—inappropriate material,

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘entertainment, pornography?

00:05:37.487 --> 00:05:41.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why would I form an attachment,
an emotional attachment,

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:44.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone who is not my mate
or flirt with them?’

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would break the marriage bond.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why would I speak in such a harsh,
sarcastic, critical way

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my best friend, to my marriage mate?’

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before using glue
and trying to put something together,

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both surfaces need to be clean

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, in a physical way
but also with the marriage itself.

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to make sure
that everything is removed

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would prevent permanent bonding.

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to have a clean conscience

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be clean with what we think
and what we see and what we do.

00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:21.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are the bond makers
that will help us,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help love
to be part of our marriage?

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the ingredients?

00:06:25.234 --> 00:06:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Colossians 3:12;

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:32.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says what we are to put on
after we strip off the old things:

00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Clothe [ourselves]
with the tender affections of compassion,

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kindness, humility, mildness, and patience.”

00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are keys to our success.

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 13, we should
“continue putting up with one another

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forgiving one another freely.”

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:52.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these will lead to a happy family life.

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all want to be happier than we are now.

00:06:56.766 --> 00:07:00.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said that the first to apologize
is the bravest,

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first to forgive is the strongest,

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the first to forget is the happiest.

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the key to success as well.

00:07:08.444 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are many fine examples in the Bible

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and modern-day examples
that we can try to imitate.

00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:17.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the couples that comes to my mind
from the Bible

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:19.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Aquila and Priscilla.

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do we know about them?

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, they were always together.

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was never mentioned without the other.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:30.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In theocratic activities
and their social life, they were together.

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were running
the race for life together.

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate
how they were bonded together.

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made them a success.

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to imitate that
and all the modern-day examples

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help us to appreciate
that we want to continue to stick together.

00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:48.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all running in the race for life;
that’s true.

00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:51.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re married,
we’re not running alone.

00:07:51.287 --> 00:07:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have our partner,
and we need to run with them.

00:07:55.124 --> 00:07:59.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s sort of like running
in a three-legged race.

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:01.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is a three-legged race?

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s when two people
are joined together at the ankle,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they run to the finish line.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we have Caleb and Sophia’s parents

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping to demonstrate this for us.

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re tied together.

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do we know
that their marriage will be successful?

00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:17.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first, the partners must remain tied.

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must be bound together—permanent.

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to cling tightly to their partner

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:27.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—support them and stabilize them
if they were to stumble or fall.

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need close communication
to start off on the right foot

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to continue to run in the same direction
toward the same goal.

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:39.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s vital that they run together,

00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:42.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move as one body
—“one flesh,” not two—

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in harmony with synchronized steps,

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and run at the same pace, at the same speed.

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:51.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they will be successful.

00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:54.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, when it comes to your marriage
and my marriage,

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:59.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need partners who are strong,
who will support us, who will stabilize us.

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work together to achieve goals

00:09:02.525 --> 00:09:06.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will make Jehovah happy
and in turn make us happy.

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:10.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Communication is the key to our success.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:13.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can reach the finish line together

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:17.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this bonding
and with Jehovah in the marriage.

00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:19.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if our partner were to fall

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or feel down?

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 4:10 says:

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:28.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if one of them falls,
the other can help his partner up.”

00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if our partner is stressed out,

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:34.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anxious, emotionally spent, feeling down,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could pick them up
by giving them our full attention.

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:41.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’re busier than ever
with our work assignments,

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:44.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re trying to exercise, and we’re trying
to be with all of our friends,

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that cannot overshadow

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:50.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the communication that is needed
with our best friend

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our running mate—
our wife or our husband.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:56.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to put the work away,
put down our device,

00:09:56.812 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give undivided attention to our partner.

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:05.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each day, we want to communicate
through prayer.

00:10:05.154 --> 00:10:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to Jehovah, the three of you,

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make Jehovah part of that marriage.

00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Ecclesiastes 4:12 says:

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A threefold cord
cannot quickly be torn apart.”

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, just love between a man and a woman
is not enough.

00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:23.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need Jehovah to make it
the strongest and happiest possible.

00:10:23.306 --> 00:10:26.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you keep Jehovah
as a central strand in your marriage,

00:10:26.976 --> 00:10:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be married at heart.

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will stick together
with the right kind of glue.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, love is the “perfect bond of union”
that will never fail.

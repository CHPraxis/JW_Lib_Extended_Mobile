00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:05.722 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘Remember your Grand Creator

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:08.391 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the days of your youth.’

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:13.430 line:10% position:50% align:center
That exhortation is very timely,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.299 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially for our youth today.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are surrounded by a world

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:21.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really ignores God.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they idolize people or things.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:32.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some boldly deny the existence of God.

00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have young people in school

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:38.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have science or biology teachers

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
who point out the wonders

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:45.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
of animal life, marine life, bird life.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:49.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then they give credit

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:53.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a mythical, nameless “Mother Nature”

00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:55.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
or evolution.

00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
One <i>Awake!</i>  magazine
described how science writers

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:03.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
will write articles
in which they express amazement

00:01:03.747 --> 00:01:05.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
at what they’re discovering.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they use such words as “miraculous,”

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remarkable,” “ingenious,”

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“extraordinary,” “perfect,” “a masterpiece,”

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:17.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a great mystery,” “unerring,”

00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“astonishing,”
“fantastic,” and “unbelievable.”

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they say,
“Isn’t Mother Nature wonderful?”

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:31.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, while our text
is directed to young ones,

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:35.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s good to remind ourselves

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remember our Grand Creator.

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:43.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
The January 15, 2014,
<i>Watchtower,</i>  page 23, made this comment:

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:49.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even though we may
have been serving Jehovah for many years,

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is good for us to stop occasionally

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and think appreciatively

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:58.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about how grand our Creator is.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:03.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is not life awe-inspiring?

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The complexity of its design

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is beyond human understanding.

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:13.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s provisions are so rich in variety

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:17.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we have
abundant possibilities for enjoying life.

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:21.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When we contemplate Jehovah’s creation,

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we renew our appreciation

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his love, wisdom, and power.”

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And really, it should not be difficult for us

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continually remember

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Grand Creator, Jehovah.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
perhaps in your room or in your house,

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have gifts on display

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:48.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
that friends have given you over the years.

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know my wife and I
have a cabinet just filled

00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
with gifts and mementos.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we look at each one of these things,

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
we remember who gave it to us.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:05.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, similarly,
Jehovah’s creations are gifts to us.

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every time
we see one of these amazing creations,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re reminded of his greatness,

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:16.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
his majesty, how awesome he is,

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, how grand he is.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article series “Was It Designed?”

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
constantly amazes us

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jehovah’s creative genius.

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:32.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
One young sister wrote:

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:36.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love to read
the feature ‘Was It Designed?’

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It proves to me
that evolution cannot be true.

00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:45.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s crazy to think that something

00:03:45.508 --> 00:03:48.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as beautiful as a butterfly

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:52.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a hummingbird can come about by accident.”

00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:57.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we say to that, “Amen.”

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister mentioned butterflies, and indeed,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
these insects are among the most beautiful

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s creations.

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a closer look at two butterflies

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:13.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of the thousands of species
that Jehovah has created.

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:15.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the first is the monarch butterfly.

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:20.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now look at this delicate jewel.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
No fashion expert ever designed

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:25.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
such a rich color combination

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:29.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
as these delicate orange wings,

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:31.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
etched in black,

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:34.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
with intricately designed borders.

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:36.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s more.

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now imagine: The monarch butterfly

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a brain that is only about the size

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the tip of a ballpoint pen.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, each autumn

00:04:48.237 --> 00:04:50.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
that butterfly has the ability

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and skill to migrate

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 1,800 miles (nearly 3,000 km)

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Canada to a particular forest

00:04:57.747 --> 00:04:59.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
in central Mexico.

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
They cross large lakes,

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:04.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
rivers, and mountains.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even young butterflies

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have never made this flight before

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrive safely.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they do it?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, they use the sun

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them migrate, that is, navigate.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the sun shifts in the sky,

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it seems that Jehovah designed

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:26.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
its minute brain

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the ability to compensate

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the sun’s movement.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what can the monarch butterfly

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
remind us about our Grand Creator?

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, clearly this masterpiece

00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:44.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
of color and design

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:49.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us clearly—Jehovah loves beauty.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:51.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s more.

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about this:

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our Grand Creator

00:05:56.205 --> 00:05:58.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
took such care

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give the monarch butterfly the capacity

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
to travel long distances

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:08.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and safely arrive at its destination,

00:06:08.418 --> 00:06:11.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much more is he interested

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:15.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
in guiding us humans in our long journey

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:17.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
through life to the new world!

00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:21.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a look at another butterfly.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Giant Blue Morpho.

00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now look at the wings

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this blue morpho butterfly.

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:32.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seem so fragile, don’t they?

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it may make us wonder:

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How could this butterfly weather

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘a rainstorm

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘if the moisture would stick to its wings

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘weighing it down, making it very difficult,

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘if not impossible, to fly?

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And yet the wings stay dry.

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?’

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the wings

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
look to us (to the naked eye)

00:06:59.135 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
very smooth,

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you look at them through a microscope,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see that the surfaces

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:10.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
are covered with minute overlapping scales

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:14.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resemble tiles on the roof of a house.

00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in addition, there are very tiny grooves

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the surface of these scales

00:07:20.823 --> 00:07:24.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
that cause drops of water to roll off.

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Engineers are trying to copy

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:28.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wings’ design

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make water-resistant coatings
for commercial use.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, aside from reminding us

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:41.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Grand Creator’s marvelous wisdom,

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:45.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
what else could this remind us about him?

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:50.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah put that much thought

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and detail into making the scales

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the wings of this beautiful butterfly,

00:07:56.626 --> 00:07:58.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
should we ever wonder

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he cares about the details of our life?

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:06.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has he not also spiritually equipped us

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
to weather the figurative storms of life?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only is he a God of wisdom,

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:18.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
but certainly, above all, a God of love.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’ve just examined two samples

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:27.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s wisdom, knowledge, and love.

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:30.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
His gifts are endless, aren’t they?

00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would take us an eternity

00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:37.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fully appreciate
the riches of God’s personality.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is basically what Solomon said

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:42.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ecclesiastes 3:11:

00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has made
everything beautiful in its time.

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has even put eternity in their heart;

00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet mankind will never find out the work

00:08:55.184 --> 00:08:59.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the true God
has made from start to finish.”

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
And David wrote at Psalm 143:5:

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:08.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I eagerly ponder over [or study]

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:11.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work of your hands.”

00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like David, our faithful slave

00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:21.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
has devoted a lot of research and space

00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our printed and digital publications
to the wonders of creation,

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:30.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as in the series “Was It Designed?”

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:35.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll do us good to study these,

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps making it a project.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let it fire our curiosity
and our sense of wonder

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:46.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jehovah’s amazing gifts to us.

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we do so,

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:51.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will remember our Grand Creator.

00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:56.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will deepen our gratitude
and our appreciation for him

00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:59.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our determination
to give him our very best

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:01.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
for as long as we live.

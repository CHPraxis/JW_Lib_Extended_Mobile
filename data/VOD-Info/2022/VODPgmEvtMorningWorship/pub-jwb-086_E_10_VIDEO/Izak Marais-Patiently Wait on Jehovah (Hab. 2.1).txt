00:00:01 The world is in chaos.
00:00:05 This system of things is disintegrating
00:00:08 —the world economy, health systems,
00:00:11 security, governments— and we know where this all is leading.
00:00:16 It’s leading to the great tribulation.
00:00:20 Have you ever asked yourself,
00:00:23 ‘Do I have enough faith
00:00:27 ‘to face these fear-inspiring events
00:00:32 with “the joy of Jehovah”?’
00:00:37 Well, we can learn much from the example of Habakkuk.
00:00:42 He lived in a similar time.
00:00:44 Jehovah inspired him to give
00:00:46 this prophecy about 20 years before
00:00:49 the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.
00:00:56 Our daily text comments highlight
00:01:01 three lessons we can learn
00:01:04 from the book of Habakkuk.
00:01:06 It says there: “Never stop praying,
00:01:10 “. . . listen to what Jehovah tells us through his Word and organization . . . ,
00:01:15 and patiently wait on Jehovah.”
00:01:20 So let us take those three points and discuss them briefly.
00:01:23 The first one: “Never stop praying.”
00:01:30 Habakkuk, in chapters 1 and 2,
00:01:33 is engaged in a dialogue with Jehovah God.
00:01:37 And if you look here in chapter 1,
00:01:41 verses 1-4,
00:01:43 he’s asking Jehovah very intensely,
00:01:47 ‘Why do you allow violence,
00:01:52 wrongdoing, oppression, injustice?’
00:01:58 It concerned him very much.
00:02:01 Then Jehovah answered Habakkuk from verses 5-11,
00:02:06 and Jehovah says something very interesting in verse 5.
00:02:09 He says: “Something will happen in your days
00:02:13 “that you will not believe even if it is told to you.
00:02:18 For here I am raising up the Chaldeans,” the Babylonians.
00:02:23 So Jehovah was going to bring Babylon
00:02:28 to bring judgment and punishment on the evildoers.
00:02:33 So Jehovah answered his prayer.
00:02:38 We also are affected by injustice, are we not?
00:02:43 A brother here at Bethel recently told me
00:02:46 that he was watching a news program,
00:02:49 and the reporter was explaining
00:02:52 all the obvious and terrible injustices that were happening.
00:02:57 He said: “It got me very tense.
00:03:01 I had to shut the television off.”
00:03:05 But then he said: “I talked to Jehovah.
00:03:09 Afterward,” he said,
00:03:11 “I calmed right down, and my confidence returned.”
00:03:16 So prayer is very important.
00:03:18 It puts us in the right frame of mind, but it doesn’t end there.
00:03:23 We need to go to the next step,
00:03:26 that of listening to what Jehovah tells us
00:03:29 through his Word and his organization.
00:03:33 Now, we can take the example from Habakkuk here in chapter 2.
00:03:39 He helps us to see a procedure,
00:03:43 a process, or an approach that he took.
00:03:47 First, in Habakkuk 2:1,
00:03:51 he says: “At my guardpost I will keep standing,
00:03:55 and I will station myself on the rampart.”
00:04:00 Then he says:
00:04:02 “I will keep watch to see what he will speak by means of me
00:04:06 and what I will reply when I am reproved.”
00:04:09 Do you see the two things he was doing?
00:04:12 He was keeping standing
00:04:16 and, the next thing, he was keeping watching.
00:04:21 So “keep standing.”
00:04:23 In this particular case, he says he “will station [himself] on the rampart.”
00:04:27 Now, a rampart, in those days,
00:04:30 could often have been a wall around the city
00:04:33 —a huge, strong wall.
00:04:35 So in other words, he was keeping himself
00:04:37 in a position of safety, first of all.
00:04:41 And then secondly, he “[watched] to see.”
00:04:45 He listened to what Jehovah was telling him.
00:04:49 Now, as you know, listening has two components.
00:04:53 The one part is hearing, getting the sense of it.
00:04:57 And the second part is acting upon it.
00:05:02 So here Jehovah was speaking to Habakkuk.
00:05:05 In verse 2, Jehovah answered him,
00:05:07 and Jehovah said: “Write down the vision,
00:05:12 “and inscribe it clearly on tablets,
00:05:16 so that the one reading aloud from it might do so easily.”
00:05:21 Very interesting that Jehovah gives him
00:05:23 an assignment to write this down.
00:05:25 But Jehovah also reveals that he had in mind for someone
00:05:29 to read it aloud,
00:05:32 to spread his message to others.
00:05:38 So we can follow that example of Habakkuk.
00:05:42 First of all, place ourselves
00:05:46 under Jehovah’s protection,
00:05:48 “on [our] rampart,” as it were, under the mighty hand of God.
00:05:52 Don’t leave that safe place.
00:05:54 And then secondly, listen.
00:05:57 Be ready to respond to whatever Jehovah tells us to do.
00:06:01 So how do we stay in our place?
00:06:03 Well, we stay focused on our assignment.
00:06:05 We have work to do.
00:06:07 We must preach and teach and do our part in the Christian congregation.
00:06:12 And we listen by being
00:06:15 very carefully attuned to God’s organization,
00:06:19 the leading we receive from God’s organization.
00:06:22 We cannot anticipate what is going to happen next.
00:06:26 Take, for instance, with this pandemic, who of us expected that?
00:06:31 But look how beautifully Jehovah’s people —his organization—
00:06:35 led us through these very difficult times.
00:06:39 This now brings us to the third aspect, patiently wait.
00:06:44 The reality is that matters are going to get far worse than they are now.
00:06:50 And we shouldn’t be surprised if our reaction is the same
00:06:55 as that of Habakkuk when he started anticipating what was coming.
00:06:59 Let us read Habakkuk 3:16.
00:07:03 He says: “I heard and I trembled within;
00:07:08 “at the sound my lips quivered . . .
00:07:10 My legs beneath me were shaking.”
00:07:15 But then he says (the second part of verse 16):
00:07:19 “But I quietly wait for the day of distress.”
00:07:23 That reaction is not a lack of faith, “but . . . quietly wait”
00:07:28 —that’s evidence of true faith.
00:07:31 Now, Habakkuk was not naive.
00:07:33 He knew what was coming.
00:07:35 He describes here in verse 17: “The fig tree may not blossom, . . .
00:07:40 “no fruit on the vines; the olive crop may fail, . . .
00:07:44 the fields may produce no food.”
00:07:47 So food may run short.
00:07:50 Property may be lost.
00:07:53 Standards of living may go down.
00:07:56 But the question is, How will we respond?
00:08:00 What will be our reaction?
00:08:02 Will we quietly wait
00:08:05 and patiently, calmly accept whatever happens,
00:08:09 even if the sequence of events
00:08:11 are not exactly what we expect them to be?
00:08:15 So, what’s the lesson?
00:08:17 The lesson is at Habakkuk 2:3;
00:08:21 Jehovah has an appointed time.
00:08:25 He says the vision is “for [the] appointed time, . . .
00:08:28 “Keep in expectation of it! . . .
00:08:31 It will not be late!”
00:08:35 So, what matters is not
00:08:38 when the end will come or how the end will come
00:08:43 but that we live a life of faith
00:08:47 doing Jehovah’s will.
00:08:49 So back to the question,
00:08:51 Do I have enough faith to go through
00:08:53 the upcoming fear-inspiring events and keep my joy?
00:08:56 Absolutely!
00:08:58 At Habakkuk 3:18, he ends the chapter.
00:09:01 He says: “As for me,
00:09:04 “I will exult in Jehovah;
00:09:07 I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.”
00:09:12 So, what’s the bottom line?
00:09:14 Pray, listen, and wait patiently.

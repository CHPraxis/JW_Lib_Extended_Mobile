00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:04.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is the most important day

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
in this year, 2022.

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:11.615 line:10% position:50% align:center
Friday, April 15, is the anniversary

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:14.702 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ sacrificial death.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.037 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m happy to be able to address

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
the millions of you on this special day,

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter where you are or what time it is

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can now view this recording.

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:32.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we will ask Brother Clive Martin,

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read our text for the day.

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will always be with the Lord.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Thess. 4:17.”

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Martin.

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friends, did you notice that it said “we”?

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will always be with the Lord.”

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who does the word “we” refer to?

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
By extension, in a sense,

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could say it embraces
all faithful servants of Jehovah

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are gifted
everlasting life in the future.

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:12.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, specifically those words of Paul

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
apply to the resurrected anointed ones.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
The words were written
by the apostle Paul under inspiration.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
All anointed ones look forward to the time

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we receive our heavenly reward

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereafter
“will always be with the Lord.”

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of the millions

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:34.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are viewing
this Morning Worship program,

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
by far the vast majority have the hope

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
of enjoying everlasting life
as humans here on earth.

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:46.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I thought I would address
the bulk of my comments

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those of you
who have the marvelous earthly hope.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look back to the time
of Adam’s creation.

00:01:55.636 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 2:15-17

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:04.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
shares some details
about the arrangement, or conditions,

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:07.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Adam’s continued existence.

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along
as I read it from the screen.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 2 starting with verse 15 says:

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah God took the man and settled him

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the garden of Eden

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:24.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to cultivate it and to take care of it.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah God also

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“gave this command to the man:

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘From every tree of the garden

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:32.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you may eat to satisfaction.

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:34.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But as for the tree of the knowledge

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘of good and bad,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you must not eat from it,

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for in the day you eat from it

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will certainly die.’”

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah’s original purpose

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:49.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not include death.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would only be introduced

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:56.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
if perfect Adam chose
to disobey the clear command

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:59.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
about not eating
from the specific tree in the garden

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:01.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and became imperfect.

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand the cause, don’t we?

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
A spirit creature was the first to defect.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jehovah’s wisdom,

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has never told us the original name

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:17.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
of that rebellious spirit creature.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:20.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, God chose not to reveal

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
even the descriptive name of this enemy

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
until some 2,500 years

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:30.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the rebellion in Eden.

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, only three books
of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
even mention the name Satan,
which means “Resister.”

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:43.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now know him as Satan the Devil.

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:46.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
By clever means and an outright lie,

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
he tempted Eve into eating from the very tree

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had placed a restriction on.

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:56.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eve got Adam
to join her in eating of the fruit.

00:03:56.715 --> 00:04:00.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what was introduced to all mankind?

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Death.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Death is inevitable

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this old system.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah first created Adam and Eve

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the garden of Eden,

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is no indication to us

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:19.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he purposed

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:21.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have some humans change life-forms

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:25.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
and dwell in the heavens as spirit creatures.

00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the majority of you viewing this program

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually have the prospect

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:36.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
of enjoying the original purpose
for all mankind

00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:40.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
—everlasting life as humans
on the Paradise earth.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is an amazing hope in itself!

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, after Adam and Eve sinned,

00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:53.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah immediately
put into place an arrangement

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
to end Satan’s abusive reign.

00:04:57.317 --> 00:04:59.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
This arrangement was outlined

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the first prophecy recorded in the Bible

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:05.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Genesis 3:15.

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:09.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please follow along on your screen

00:05:09.663 --> 00:05:12.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I read that prophetic verse.

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said:

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I will put enmity between you

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that’s Satan]

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:20.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the woman

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah’s wifelike
organization of spirit creatures]

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:27.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and between your offspring

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:30.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[which includes the demon angels]

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:32.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and her offspring

00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:36.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[who ultimately proved to be Jesus Christ].

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will crush your head

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:42.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jesus will deal Satan a death blow],

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:45.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will strike him in the heel.”

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:50.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan would only be able to inflict

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:53.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
a minor, temporary wound

00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:57.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus gave up
his human life in sacrificial death

00:05:57.461 --> 00:06:02.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was shortly thereafter
resurrected to heavenly life.

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam’s death had no value.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
He deserved to die for his sin.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:12.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ death had great value

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:16.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he died in a sinless state

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
to replace what Adam lost

00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:21.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the entire human family.

00:06:21.777 --> 00:06:26.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God could accept
the value of Jesus’ perfect life

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:31.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a ransom
for obedient descendants of sinful Adam.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the value of Jesus’ sacrifice

00:06:34.998 --> 00:06:38.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not stop at paying for our past sins.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 51:5 says:

00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:48.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! I was born guilty of error,

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:51.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my mother conceived me in sin.”

00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:55.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
So being conceived in sin,

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are bound to make more mistakes again.

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jesus’ sacrifice

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes provision for our future.

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:07.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will help loyal ones

00:07:07.072 --> 00:07:11.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain the perfect life
Jehovah originally intended

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:13.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the offspring of Adam and Eve.

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:17.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once likened Adam

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:20.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a father who died and left humans

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
in such deep financial debt, or sin,

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is no possible way

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get out of debt on one’s own.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, Jesus was likened
to a good father

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
who died and left us all

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
a rich inheritance

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:45.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
that not only frees us
from the enormous debt of Adamic sin

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also provides enough for us

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live on eternally.

00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:56.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ death is not simply
a cancellation of past sins.

00:07:56.663 --> 00:08:00.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is also a wonderful provision
for the future.

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:07.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, according to John 3:16,

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:10.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ death is a means

00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:14.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
of rescuing
“everyone exercising faith in him”

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
from sin, disease, old age,

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:21.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfection, and death itself.

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:24.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is that willing,

00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:27.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
selfless death of Jesus

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we will all remember tonight
at the Memorial.

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice Genesis 3:15 said

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:38.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
there would be “enmity”

00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:43.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Satan
and Jehovah’s heavenly organization?

00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:46.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
During that period of animosity,

00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah progressively revealed the details

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:54.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
to restore his original purpose to the earth.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:58.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those details included

00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:02.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
pointing his ancient servants

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:05.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the Messiah,
who proved to be Jesus.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:10.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus came to earth as a perfect man

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:13.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and died to provide the opportunity

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:17.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Adam’s descendants
to gain everlasting life.

00:09:17.869 --> 00:09:20.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also unveiled

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
another unexpected detail
in the first century.

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:26.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made clear

00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would anoint 144,000 humans,

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:32.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Revelation 14,

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:35.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
to change life-forms

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and share in the heavenly part
of his organization,

00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:43.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually ruling as kings with Jesus.

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:48.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this is what we
will commemorate this evening

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:51.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we follow the direction Jesus gave

00:09:51.736 --> 00:09:56.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
his 11 faithful apostles

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the glorious hope

00:09:58.243 --> 00:10:02.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
for both the anointed
and those with earthly hopes

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:05.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not fade into insignificance.

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:10.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2021, we had a record attendance

00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:12.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Memorial,

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:16.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though it was by means
of videoconferencing.

00:10:16.303 --> 00:10:20.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all still have time today to send a text

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:24.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
or make a phone call to interested ones
whom we have invited.

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:27.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remind them of this special occasion,

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:31.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make sure they know
how to go about attending

00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
this special meeting locally.

00:10:35.197 --> 00:10:37.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we will ask Brother Martin

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:40.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read the <i>Watchtower</i>  comments for us.

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:44.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Anointed ones who today
finish their earthly course

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:47.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are instantly raised to life in the heavens.

00:10:47.083 --> 00:10:50.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is confirmed
by the apostle Paul’s words

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“recorded at 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52.

00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:56.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Upon their resurrection,

00:10:56.885 --> 00:11:00.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“these brothers of Christ
will have complete joy.

00:11:00.472 --> 00:11:03.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Bible tells us what work

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:06.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those who are changed
‘in the blink of an eye’ will do in heaven.

00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:08.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus says to them:

00:11:08.438 --> 00:11:12.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘To the one who conquers
and observes my deeds down to the end,

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:14.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will give authority over the nations,

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:17.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and he will shepherd the people
with an iron rod

00:11:17.322 --> 00:11:20.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that they will be broken
to pieces like clay vessels,

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:23.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as I have received from my Father.’”

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:26.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Martin.

00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:28.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the last four days,

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:31.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Bible reading
has covered the Bible accounts

00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:34.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading up to Jesus’ sacrificial death.

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:37.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to follow along

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the reading for today.

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:44.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
The specific verses
will appear on-screen in your language.

00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:49.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please give contemplative attention
to what is described.

00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:59.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the first day of the Unleavened Bread,

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:02.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the disciples came to Jesus, saying:

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:06.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Where do you want us to prepare
for you to eat the Passover?’

00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:10.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said: ‘Go into the city to So-and-so

00:12:10.542 --> 00:12:13.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and say to him, “The Teacher says:

00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:15.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“‘My appointed time is near;

00:12:15.714 --> 00:12:18.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“‘I will celebrate the Passover

00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:19.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my disciples at your home.’”’

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples did
as Jesus instructed them

00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:25.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prepared for the Passover.”

00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:36.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now on the first day
of the Unleavened Bread,

00:12:36.276 --> 00:12:40.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when they customarily
offered up the Passover sacrifice,

00:12:40.697 --> 00:12:43.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“his disciples said to him:

00:12:43.617 --> 00:12:47.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Where do you want us to go
and prepare for you to eat the Passover?’

00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:52.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With that he sent two
of his disciples and said to them:

00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:54.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go into the city,

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:58.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and a man carrying
an earthenware water jar will meet you.

00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:01.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Follow him, and wherever he goes inside,

00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:04.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘say to the master of the house,

00:13:04.137 --> 00:13:07.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“The Teacher says: ‘Where is the guest room

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:10.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“where I may eat
the Passover with my disciples?’

00:13:10.727 --> 00:13:15.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And he will show you
a large upper room, furnished and ready.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Prepare it for us there.’

00:13:17.692 --> 00:13:19.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the disciples went out,

00:13:19.944 --> 00:13:24.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they entered the city
and found it just as he said to them,

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:27.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they prepared for the Passover.

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:37.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The day
of the Unleavened Bread now arrived,

00:13:37.212 --> 00:13:41.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on which
the Passover sacrifice must be offered;

00:13:41.216 --> 00:13:44.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so Jesus sent Peter and John, saying:

00:13:44.844 --> 00:13:48.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go and get
the Passover ready for us to eat.’

00:13:48.473 --> 00:13:52.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They said to him:
‘Where do you want us to get it ready?’

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:56.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to them: ‘Look!
When you enter into the city,

00:13:56.856 --> 00:14:01.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘a man carrying
an earthenware water jar will meet you.

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:03.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Follow him into the house that he enters.

00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:06.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And say to the landlord of the house,

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:10.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“The Teacher says to you:
‘Where is the guest room

00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:14.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘where I may eat the Passover
with my disciples?’”

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:18.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And that man will show you a large,
furnished upper room.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get it ready there.’

00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:24.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they left and found it
just as he had told them,

00:14:24.634 --> 00:14:26.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they prepared for the Passover.”

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now because he knew
before the festival of the Passover

00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:42.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that his hour had come for him
to leave this world and go to the Father,

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:45.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus, having loved his own
who were in the world,

00:14:45.947 --> 00:14:48.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“loved them to the end.

00:14:48.533 --> 00:14:50.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The evening meal was going on,

00:14:50.952 --> 00:14:55.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the Devil had already put it
into the heart of Judas Iscariot,

00:14:55.248 --> 00:14:58.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the son of Simon, to betray him.

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:01.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Jesus, knowing that the Father

00:15:01.254 --> 00:15:03.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“had given all things into his hands

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:07.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that he came from God
and was going to God,

00:15:07.343 --> 00:15:12.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“got up from the evening meal
and laid aside his outer garments.

00:15:12.724 --> 00:15:17.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And taking a towel,
he wrapped it around his waist.

00:15:17.228 --> 00:15:20.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After that he put water into a basin

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and started
to wash the feet of the disciples

00:15:24.068 --> 00:15:28.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to dry them off with the towel
that was wrapped around him.”

00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:37.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not let your hearts be troubled.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Exercise faith in God;

00:15:40.084 --> 00:15:43.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“exercise faith also in me.

00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:47.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the house of my Father
are many dwelling places.

00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:50.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Otherwise, I would have told you,

00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:53.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for I am going my way
to prepare a place for you.

00:15:53.932 --> 00:15:58.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, if I go my way
and prepare a place for you,

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:02.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will come again
and will receive you home to myself,

00:16:02.482 --> 00:16:06.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that where I am you also may be.”

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were significant passages

00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:13.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading up to the greatest act of love

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all time.

00:16:16.162 --> 00:16:20.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus cooperated together

00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:22.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
to undo the horrible results

00:16:22.836 --> 00:16:26.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
that came from the actions
of Satan, Adam, and Eve.

00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether of the anointed or the other sheep,

00:16:30.718 --> 00:16:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
we look forward to the future

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we will always acknowledge the role

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:38.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
that both Jehovah and Jesus played

00:16:38.142 --> 00:16:41.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
in rescuing us from sin and death.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray that all of you
will enjoy your evening

00:16:45.984 --> 00:16:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Memorial of Jesus’ death.

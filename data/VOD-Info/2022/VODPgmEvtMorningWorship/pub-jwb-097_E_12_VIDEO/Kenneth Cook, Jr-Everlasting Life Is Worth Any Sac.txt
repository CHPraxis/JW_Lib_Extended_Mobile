00:00:01 This morning, we’re going to look at this question:
00:00:03 What price are you willing to pay?
00:00:07 In today’s text at Mark 10:29, 30,
00:00:11 Jesus made it clear that when a person chooses to follow him,
00:00:16 he or she might have to give up some things,
00:00:19 including family relationships at times.
00:00:22 As we know, this sometimes happens when a person accepts the truth
00:00:27 and then his or her family rejects the message
00:00:30 and perhaps even him or her as a result.
00:00:34 When this happens, as painful as it is,
00:00:37 a sincere person will choose
00:00:39 to stand firmly on Jehovah’s side.
00:00:43 In fact, we’ll give up whatever we must in order to serve him faithfully.
00:00:47 True?
00:00:48 So, what have you paid?
00:00:50 It’s good for us to consider what we’re willing
00:00:53 to do for Jehovah and his Son.
00:00:55 They will bless us many times over
00:00:57 if we remain committed to following Jesus’ example.
00:01:02 And that’s the point of today’s text.
00:01:05 The fact is that many of our brothers and sisters
00:01:08 continue to serve Jehovah faithfully,
00:01:11 despite having only a few family members
00:01:14 or perhaps no family members serving Jehovah along with them.
00:01:18 At the same time,
00:01:20 others may have generations of relatives who have served God,
00:01:25 and we rejoice with them
00:01:27 because they too are serving Jehovah faithfully.
00:01:31 The fact is that circumstances often affect
00:01:34 what a person may have to leave behind
00:01:37 or give up at times.
00:01:39 Jesus certainly knew that would be the case,
00:01:42 and that’s why he said what he did.
00:01:45 But no matter what we must endure,
00:01:47 Jehovah and his Son will prove true
00:01:51 to the promise there in Mark chapter 10.
00:01:54 It guarantees a hundredfold blessing
00:01:57 for those who are loyal and everlasting life.
00:02:02 What should that promise move us to do?
00:02:06 We should be moved to continue sacrificing whatever is needed
00:02:11 in order to continue doing God’s will.
00:02:14 That should be our prime motivation.
00:02:16 We’re moved by faith and love to serve Jehovah
00:02:20 because he’s so kind and he’s so generous.
00:02:25 And we remember that he too has sacrificed much for us.
00:02:30 Moved by faith, we refuse to become like Demas who, you’ll recall,
00:02:35 abandoned the apostle Paul when things got difficult, didn’t he?
00:02:40 Demas looked back at the things behind,
00:02:42 and he lost sight of this point:
00:02:45 It’s what we give
00:02:47 and what we’re willing to give up in order to be loyal
00:02:50 that matters to Jehovah.
00:02:53 What we give and what we give up
00:02:55 says a lot about who we really are.
00:02:59 So while what each of us
00:03:01 may have to give or give up at times will vary,
00:03:04 Jehovah will kindly give us more in return
00:03:07 than we can ever imagine.
00:03:09 Again, Jesus said at Mark 10:30
00:03:12 “100 times more,” so to speak.
00:03:16 When we keep that in mind, we’ll be helped to remain focused
00:03:20 on Jesus’ promise in today’s text.
00:03:23 Jesus himself remained focused on such words.
00:03:27 For example, when his half brothers
00:03:29 did not put faith in him at first,
00:03:32 how did Jesus deal with that disappointment?
00:03:36 He never compromised his commitment to Jehovah’s work
00:03:40 just to please others, even family.
00:03:43 At one point, Jesus said:
00:03:46 “Woe whenever all men speak well of you.”
00:03:50 Jesus knew that those who try
00:03:52 to please everyone in the world while serving Jehovah
00:03:56 always end up compromising their integrity.
00:04:00 Jesus kept his integrity
00:04:02 because he refused to be preoccupied with what other people thought of him.
00:04:07 He was always most concerned with pleasing his heavenly Father.
00:04:12 What was an added benefit that resulted
00:04:14 from Jesus’ faithful course?
00:04:17 The Scriptures tell us that his half brothers
00:04:20 eventually responded favorably,
00:04:24 especially, it seems, after witnessing the events
00:04:27 involved with his death and resurrection.
00:04:30 Their view of Jesus and his teachings
00:04:34 changed quickly when the right time arrived.
00:04:37 Now, let’s put all this together into a very specific context
00:04:41 for many who are listening.
00:04:44 Many of you have unbelieving family members,
00:04:47 perhaps even your parents are not serving Jehovah along with you,
00:04:50 and this may be true for many years.
00:04:53 What can you do to remain hopeful toward such family members,
00:04:58 even though the time is short?
00:05:00 The answer?
00:05:01 Follow Jesus’ example.
00:05:05 Like Jesus, never give up on them.
00:05:07 Yet, never compromise in your service to Jehovah
00:05:12 just to please them.
00:05:14 Keep setting a good example for them to see and to remember.
00:05:18 As Jesus said at Matthew 5:16,
00:05:23 you’ll note he said there:
00:05:25 “Let your light shine before men,
00:05:28 “so that they may see your fine works
00:05:32 and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”
00:05:36 What do others, including unbelieving relatives, see
00:05:41 when they look at us?
00:05:43 Do they see that we’re facing the future with confidence
00:05:46 and that our faith is strong?
00:05:49 We build up our faith
00:05:52 by praying for more of it every day
00:05:55 and by being absorbed in God’s Word every day.
00:05:59 Those who may be starting to lean the right way
00:06:02 will see this in us.
00:06:04 They will see that our faith is backed up by works.
00:06:08 In turn,
00:06:10 they may lean even more in the right direction.
00:06:14 We need to think about that since, as the saying goes,
00:06:17 our example may speak louder than words.
00:06:21 Or as Jesus said, let them “see your fine works
00:06:26 and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”
00:06:30 Still, realistically, we may continue to have some worry
00:06:35 about our non-Witness family members.
00:06:37 We think about them because we love them.
00:06:42 We’re concerned that they may not respond to the good news in time.
00:06:46 We worry about that.
00:06:48 When such concerns come up into your mind and heart,
00:06:52 remember this:
00:06:54 Just as eventually happened with Jesus’ half brothers,
00:06:58 Jehovah can turn a heart very quickly
00:07:01 when it is leaning the right way.
00:07:04 Jehovah knows the leaning of every person on earth.
00:07:09 Jesus knows this too,
00:07:11 and he sees every potential sheeplike one.
00:07:15 With a positive view then,
00:07:17 continue helping your family members
00:07:20 to lean the right way,
00:07:23 and then leave the matter in Jehovah’s hands.
00:07:25 Keep trusting that he will draw them to himself
00:07:28 if their heart condition is right.
00:07:31 Experience shows
00:07:33 that sheeplike ones tend to run in families.
00:07:38 We’ll repeat that: Experience shows
00:07:41 that sheeplike ones tend to run in families.
00:07:46 This has proven to be true over and over again.
00:07:49 So remain patient and hopeful toward them.
00:07:54 But what if your family members never respond?
00:07:58 That could happen.
00:08:00 Well, if that’s the case, keep in mind
00:08:02 that Jehovah knows what you’ve tried to do,
00:08:05 and he will bless you forever for trying.
00:08:09 So in review, what price are you willing to pay?
00:08:13 If we’re following Jesus’ example,
00:08:16 we’ll stand firmly on the side of the truth
00:08:18 and never allow anything to pull us away,
00:08:21 even at great cost to ourselves,
00:08:24 even if it involves family relationships.
00:08:28 When we keep our integrity,
00:08:30 our example may move someone else to lean the right way
00:08:35 and the direction that Jehovah may draw him or her.
00:08:39 If we’re willing to sacrifice much in order to follow Jesus,
00:08:44 what did he promise?
00:08:46 A hundredfold blessing,
00:08:48 which today involves our international brotherhood
00:08:52 —the only true brotherhood on earth.
00:08:56 Along with this, he promised that in the coming system of things,
00:09:00 his self-sacrificing followers
00:09:03 will receive everlasting life.

00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:03.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
This morning,
we’re going to look at this question:

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:07.457 line:10% position:50% align:center
What price are you willing to pay?

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:11.528 line:10% position:50% align:center
In today’s text at Mark 10:29, 30,

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:16.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus made it clear that when a person
chooses to follow him,

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she might have to give up some things,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
including family relationships at times.

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:27.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know, this sometimes happens
when a person accepts the truth

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then his or her family
rejects the message

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps even him or her as a result.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
When this happens, as painful as it is,

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sincere person will choose

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stand firmly on Jehovah’s side.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we’ll give up whatever we must
in order to serve him faithfully.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:48.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
True?

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have you paid?

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good for us
to consider what we’re willing

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do for Jehovah and his Son.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will bless us many times over

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we remain committed
to following Jesus’ example.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the point of today’s text.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is that many
of our brothers and sisters

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to serve Jehovah faithfully,

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:14.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite having only a few family members

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:18.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps no family members
serving Jehovah along with them.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:20.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:25.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
others may have generations of relatives
who have served God,

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we rejoice with them

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they too
are serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is that circumstances often affect

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:37.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a person may have to leave behind

00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
or give up at times.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:42.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus certainly knew that would be the case,

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why he said what he did.

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:47.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter what we must endure,

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and his Son will prove true

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the promise there in Mark chapter 10.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
It guarantees a hundredfold blessing

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:02.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those who are loyal and everlasting life.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:06.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should that promise move us to do?

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be moved
to continue sacrificing whatever is needed

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to continue doing God’s will.

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
That should be our prime motivation.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re moved by faith and love
to serve Jehovah

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he’s so kind and he’s so generous.

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:29.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we remember that he too
has sacrificed much for us.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moved by faith, we refuse
to become like Demas who, you’ll recall,

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
abandoned the apostle Paul
when things got difficult, didn’t he?

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:42.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Demas looked back at the things behind,

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he lost sight of this point:

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what we give

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:50.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what we’re willing to give up
in order to be loyal

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:53.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
that matters to Jehovah.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we give and what we give up

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
says a lot about who we really are.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while what each of us

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:04.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have to give or give up
at times will vary,

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:07.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will kindly give us more in return

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:09.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
than we can ever imagine.

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, Jesus said at Mark 10:30

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:16.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“100 times more,” so to speak.

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we keep that in mind,
we’ll be helped to remain focused

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:23.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Jesus’ promise in today’s text.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus himself
remained focused on such words.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when his half brothers

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:32.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not put faith in him at first,

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:36.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did Jesus deal with that disappointment?

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
He never compromised
his commitment to Jehovah’s work

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to please others, even family.

00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:46.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one point, Jesus said:

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Woe whenever all men speak well of you.”

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew that those who try

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:56.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
to please everyone in the world
while serving Jehovah

00:03:56.552 --> 00:04:00.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
always end up compromising their integrity.

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:02.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus kept his integrity

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he refused to be preoccupied
with what other people thought of him.

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:10.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was always most concerned
with pleasing his heavenly Father.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was an added benefit that resulted

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jesus’ faithful course?

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:20.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures tell us that his half brothers

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
eventually responded favorably,

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially, it seems,
after witnessing the events

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
involved with his death and resurrection.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their view of Jesus and his teachings

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:37.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
changed quickly when the right time arrived.

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:41.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s put all this together
into a very specific context

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many who are listening.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of you have unbelieving family members,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even your parents
are not serving Jehovah along with you,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this may be true for many years.

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:58.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can you do to remain hopeful
toward such family members,

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though the time is short?

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer?

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:05.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow Jesus’ example.

00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:07.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jesus, never give up on them.

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:12.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, never compromise
in your service to Jehovah

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to please them.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep setting a good example for them
to see and to remember.

00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:23.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus said at Matthew 5:16,

00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:25.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll note he said there:

00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:28.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your light shine before men,

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:32.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give glory to your Father
who is in the heavens.”

00:05:36.853 --> 00:05:41.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do others,
including unbelieving relatives, see

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:43.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they look at us?

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:46.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they see that we’re facing
the future with confidence

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that our faith is strong?

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
We build up our faith

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
by praying for more of it every day

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:59.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by being absorbed
in God’s Word every day.

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who may be starting
to lean the right way

00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:04.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
will see this in us.

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will see that our faith
is backed up by works.

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:10.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn,

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may lean even more
in the right direction.

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:17.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to think about that since,
as the saying goes,

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:21.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
our example may speak louder than words.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or as Jesus said,
let them “see your fine works

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:30.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give glory to your Father
who is in the heavens.”

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, realistically,
we may continue to have some worry

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our non-Witness family members.

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:42.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think about them because we love them.

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:46.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re concerned that they may not respond
to the good news in time.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
We worry about that.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
When such concerns
come up into your mind and heart,

00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember this:

00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as eventually happened
with Jesus’ half brothers,

00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:01.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can turn a heart very quickly

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it is leaning the right way.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows the leaning
of every person on earth.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knows this too,

00:07:11.547 --> 00:07:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he sees every potential sheeplike one.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a positive view then,

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue helping your family members

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:23.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lean the right way,

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then leave the matter
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep trusting
that he will draw them to himself

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:31.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
if their heart condition is right.

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:33.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Experience shows

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:38.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sheeplike ones tend to run in families.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:41.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll repeat that: Experience shows

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:46.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sheeplike ones tend to run in families.

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:49.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has proven to be true
over and over again.

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:54.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
So remain patient and hopeful toward them.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if your family members
never respond?

00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
That could happen.

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if that’s the case,
keep in mind

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:05.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah knows
what you’ve tried to do,

00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will bless you forever for trying.

00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:13.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in review,
what price are you willing to pay?

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re following Jesus’ example,

00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll stand firmly on the side of the truth

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never allow anything to pull us away,

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
even at great cost to ourselves,

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it involves family relationships.

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:30.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we keep our integrity,

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:35.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
our example may move someone else
to lean the right way

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the direction that Jehovah
may draw him or her.

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:44.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re willing to sacrifice much
in order to follow Jesus,

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:46.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did he promise?

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:48.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
A hundredfold blessing,

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:52.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
which today involves
our international brotherhood

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:56.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the only true brotherhood on earth.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:00.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with this, he promised
that in the coming system of things,

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:03.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
his self-sacrificing followers

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive everlasting life.

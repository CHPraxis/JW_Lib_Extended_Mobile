00:00:02.152 --> 00:00:05.255 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our sacred service is our sacrifice,

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.058 line:10% position:50% align:center
our gift to Jehovah.

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:10.326 line:10% position:50% align:center
But here’s a key point:

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:13.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
Before Jehovah looks at our gift,

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:15.432 line:10% position:50% align:center
he looks at us.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
He must accept us first
if he’s to accept our gift.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the key question, then:

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah look for in us?

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to use three Bible examples
to explore that question.

00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin in the Most Holy
of the tabernacle

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the Day of Atonement.

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
The high priest’s mission
is to offer a sin offering

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
for himself and for the nation.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:48.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before he can do that, Jehovah tells him
to do something very specific,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
as depicted here.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s recorded at Leviticus chapter 16,

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 12 and 13.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please turn with me to that
—Leviticus chapter 16—

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:04.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first time he enters
the Most Holy on that day.

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will then take the fire holder

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“full of burning coals
from the altar before Jehovah

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and two handfuls of fine perfumed incense,

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will bring them inside the curtain.

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:19.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will also put the incense
on the fire before Jehovah,

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:24.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the cloud of the incense will envelop
the Ark cover, which is on the Testimony,

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:27.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he may not die.”

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, from that last phrase,

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah needed to approve
of the high priest and what he did

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:37.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was to accept the sin offering.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had to bring in incense.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible,
incense is associated with prayer.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
So clearly, the high priest had to come in

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a humble, prayerful attitude.

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:59.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine, though, if he decided to bring
his own incense recipe

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he preferred that smell.

00:02:02.438 --> 00:02:04.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Jehovah likely to accept that?

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what if he followed
the procedure perfectly

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
but yesterday he was leading the nation
in worship to Molech?

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:18.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Jehovah approve
of what he did on this day?

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what qualities was Jehovah looking for
in the high priest?

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:31.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble, prayerful attitude;

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:34.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
strict obedience to direction;

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:36.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
moral and spiritual integrity.

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:44.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything on that day,
the high priest and his sin offering,

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
pictured Jesus Christ.

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:51.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we learn from Jesus
while he was on earth?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a beautiful description
at Hebrews 5:7, 8.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s read that verse together,

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:02.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pick out what this tells us about Jesus.

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 5:7, 8:

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During his life on earth, Christ offered up

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“supplications and also petitions,

00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:14.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with strong outcries and tears,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the One who was able to save him
out of death,

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he was favorably heard
for his godly fear.

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although he was a son, he learned obedience

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:27.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the things he suffered.”

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Supplications and petitions—

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:35.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although he was the perfect son of God,

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus humbly recognized
his total dependence on his Father.

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
From verse 8, it’s easy
to pick up that key quality.

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:49.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was perfectly obedient

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
in carrying out Jehovah’s will for him.

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about this phrase
at the end of verse 7:

00:03:55.618 --> 00:04:00.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was favorably heard for his godly fear”?

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:05.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus’ fervent desire
to please Jehovah in everything

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that was the source
of his perfect integrity.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question, though, is why?

00:04:12.702 --> 00:04:16.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
What moved Jesus to do these things?

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in his own words, John 14:31:

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In order for the world to know
that I love the Father.”

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:27.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah see in Jesus?

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw remarkable humility;

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:34.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
total dependence on his Father;

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
perfect obedience;

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:39.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
flawless integrity;

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the purest of motives
—love for his Father.

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s no wonder that Jehovah looked down
and said:

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:54.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my Son, the beloved,
whom I have approved.”

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah approved of Jesus,

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:59.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he approved of the ransom sacrifice.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now it’s down to us.

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Jehovah looking for in you and me?

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:07.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as with Jesus, he’s looking

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the right qualities and the right motive

00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:14.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so qualities and motive.

00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:18.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s familiar to us,
even in human relationships.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve all seen the picture
of a sheepish husband who comes home

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
carrying a big bouquet of flowers.

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:30.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he’s done something that’s going
to make his wife angry when she finds out,

00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:33.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he wants to appease her
to make her less angry.

00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is she going to be happy with that?

00:05:37.954 --> 00:05:39.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
She may accept the flowers,

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she does not want to be appeased.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:46.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
What she wants is a loyal husband

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:50.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give her a gift because he loves her

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities and motive.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this in mind,
let’s learn one further lesson

00:05:57.306 --> 00:05:59.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the example of King David.

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had told David
that he would not be the one

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would build the temple,

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:07.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David obeyed Jehovah’s direction.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he loved pure worship.

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:12.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to do something.

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
So David carefully studied the temple plan
that Jehovah gave him,

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he brought Jehovah a gift,

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what a gift it was,
from his personal fortune

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
—gold, silver, and so many other things!

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, just the gold and silver
from his personal fortune

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:36.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
was worth almost six billion dollars.

00:06:36.512 --> 00:06:40.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when David was ready
to present that gift to Jehovah,

00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:42.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said a special prayer.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to look at it
in 1 Chronicles chapter 29.

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 10-17 is the prayer.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s worth its own study project.

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’ll look at just a few key points.

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please look to see
what each of these reveals

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
about David as the giver of the gift.

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:06.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
So 1 Chronicles 29:14:

00:07:08.077 --> 00:07:10.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who am I and who are my people

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we should be in a position
to make voluntary offerings like this?

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For everything is from you,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have given to you
what comes from your own hand.”

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:26.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite his rank, his seniority,

00:07:26.562 --> 00:07:30.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
David humbly recognized
what a privilege it was

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:33.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to do anything for Jehovah.

00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:37.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now glance down at verse 17.

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would make Jehovah approve of this gift?

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know, O my God,
that you examine the heart

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that you take pleasure in integrity.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the uprightness of my heart,

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have voluntarily offered all these things.”

00:07:57.126 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Jehovah would approve the gift.

00:08:00.963 --> 00:08:05.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, bear in mind,
David has just presented to Jehovah

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:09.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
billions of dollars worth of gifts.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet look at verse 13,

00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:15.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is his motive:

00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:19.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And now, O our God, we thank you

00:08:19.482 --> 00:08:21.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and praise your beautiful name.”

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:26.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
His gratitude moved David to give

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:30.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything that he possibly could to Jehovah.

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how are we like David
when we give gifts to Jehovah?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
We humbly recognize what a privilege it is

00:08:40.903 --> 00:08:43.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to do anything for Jehovah.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep strict obedience to direction.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
We fight to maintain our integrity,

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:51.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s our love and our gratitude

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
that moves us to give Jehovah

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything that we can

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our very best.

00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:04.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah sees these qualities
and these motives in us,

00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:06.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he’s very pleased,

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:08.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will be pleased to accept our gift,

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we give him the fortune of David
or the widow’s mite.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what gifts will you bring
to Jehovah today?

00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:23.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah smile when he sees you,

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:28.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may he approve
of your good qualities and your good motive,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:33.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may he turn your gift
into a blessing for you and for many others.

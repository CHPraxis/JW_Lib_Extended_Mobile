WEBVTT

00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:02.752 line:10% position:50% align:center
This morning, I thought we’d talk

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:06.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
about why we love Jehovah so much.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.292 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, obviously, there are

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.861 line:10% position:50% align:center
basic fundamental reasons why we love him.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:14.731 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to Acts chapter 17,

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll just mention
the <i>A</i> part of the verse

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to why we love him.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:26.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 28 of Acts chapter 17:

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:28.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For by him we have life

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move and exist.”

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we love him because we love life.

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful that we’re able to move
and that we exist.

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:42.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you think about it,

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
this beautiful earth that Jehovah created

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
continues to sustain humans

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:52.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
with food and water.

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s just fundamental.

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:56.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love him for all these things.

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:58.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really, why we love him so much

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
gets much more personal

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just these things
that keep us in existence.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:10.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah is like a loving Father to us

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:14.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when he’s real
and when we feel confident he’s listening

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our personal, private prayers

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:22.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that strengthens us to continue on
and to endure.

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:26.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s the case with some of God’s people,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
including some raised around the truth,

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they didn’t have a loving human father
during their childhood.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:36.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reasons and details

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to why a father wouldn’t love
his own child

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:45.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
are numerous but never justified.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the evidence is often

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:52.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people that suffer
from having experienced

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:54.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
this lack of love,

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:57.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
sadly, grow up with being filled

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:59.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
with negative thinking.

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:03.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can become consumed
with negative thinking,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then their life becomes
like a roller coaster of emotions,

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:13.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they find it very difficult
to face each day.

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:17.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the good news is
that this negative thinking,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those that worship Jehovah and love him,

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often be eliminated or, certainly,
at least held at bay

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:31.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have this close
personal relationship with Jehovah God.

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has drawn us to him.

00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:37.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank him for that; it was undeserved.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s more

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:42.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
to why we love him so much.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a verse that we find
in our publications often

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
is in Psalm 34.

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:52.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s take a look at Psalm 34.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:54.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us are very familiar with this verse,

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
but let’s think about it—verse 18:

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:09.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:11.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we love this verse,

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:15.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if we went through difficulties
or, as I mentioned,

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:20.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t have a father that displayed love.

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:22.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can break a heart,

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:25.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the individual can feel

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
crushed in spirit, totally discouraged,

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
unable to face basic things in life.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to illustrate that,
I thought I’d just show you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
this beautiful crystal, here,

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
of two birds.

00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful piece?

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:49.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m being careful
because it’s really my wife’s.

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know how it is.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:55.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s mine is hers,

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:57.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what’s hers is hers.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I’m just teasing.

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is absolutely adorable,
these two birds in this crystal.

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:13.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you were to take a hammer,
a large hammer,

00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and smash it,

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:21.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s the idea of crushed

00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“crushed in spirit.”

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:25.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, you start to get the feeling

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what some of us have experienced

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
—crushed in spirit.

00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:34.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the reason we love Jehovah so much

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:38.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that he actually has the power,

00:04:38.728 --> 00:04:42.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of his love,
he can put the pieces back together

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:47.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can go on and continue to love him

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worship him for eternity.

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:54.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s just a wonderful Creator,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s why we love him so much,
and he’s the only one that can do that.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some other human that loves you

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
can’t really put the pieces back together.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can be consoling, and should be,

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah can put us back together.

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:16.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to further help us appreciate
why we love him so much,

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice Isaiah chapter 49.

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:22.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve always appreciated the verse here,

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:27.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on occasion, I’ve used it
with shepherding someone

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
struggling from various issues

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:33.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
related to the way they grew up

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
or were mistreated.

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:40.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Isaiah chapter 49,
and notice here at verse 15,

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says:

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can a woman forget her nursing child

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or have no compassion
for the son of her womb?

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even if these women forget,

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:57.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never forget you.”

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s just think about this.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question’s raised:
Can a woman, or mother, of a nursing child,

00:06:05.548 --> 00:06:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
forget them?

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the news indicates
they continue to do that.

00:06:13.022 --> 00:06:16.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just heartbreaking to hear
about a mother

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:19.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
who left her child in a car on a hot day,

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:21.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the child dies.

00:06:21.931 --> 00:06:25.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, they are of nursing age.

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:27.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it can happen.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does happen.

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:32.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, most of the time

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
(that’s why Jehovah uses this comparison),

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:40.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
a mother is just an amazing part
of a child’s life.

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just to illustrate, when my sons were young

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:48.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
(both of them because they’re
about a year and a half apart,

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:53.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
so one was an infant, and the other was
about a year and a half or thereabouts),

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at the time we lived

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:58.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a second floor apartment,

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and next to us was a train track.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it wasn’t that there were always
trains going by,

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:06.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this certain fast train

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:09.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming from New York
to Providence, Rhode Island,

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:12.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
would just come by late at night,

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:14.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
early in the morning, predawn,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the house would vibrate.

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:18.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how close we were to the track.

00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:20.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the rent was good,

00:07:20.323 --> 00:07:22.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it helped

00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
with being able to make ends meet.

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:30.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that would wake me up every time.

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:34.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d hear that
—the train and the house vibrating.

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:37.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, my wife, Susan,
would sleep right through it.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:39.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t bother her.

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:44.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
The train went by, and I look over
and like: ‘Boy, if I could do that.’

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know?

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:50.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, whenever one of our sons cried out,

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t care what hour it was,

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
she shot out of that bed and was over there.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m trying to come to
as to why she moved.

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:01.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s the love of a mother

00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:04.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is emphasizing here.

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone that thinks about that

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and that always deeply impressed me

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:14.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is what Jehovah is talking about
with mothers)

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:16.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how they love their children—

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s just very touching.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:20.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve never, never forgotten it.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
And anyone that had a mother like that
should be very grateful to them.

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:30.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you haven’t thanked them lately,
it would be a good idea to do so.

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the reason we love Jehovah so much
when considering this verse

00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:39.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because Jehovah is comparing
the tender love of a mother

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his love.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he makes the point because obviously
it happened down through history;

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:48.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
these women can forget.

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:52.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some can become that selfish
and other reasons

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and forget their nursing child.

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah will never forget you.

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll never forget me.

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:03.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
So frankly, regardless of our past,

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:06.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it was a good upbringing or not,

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can exhibit joy

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:12.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love Jehovah so much.

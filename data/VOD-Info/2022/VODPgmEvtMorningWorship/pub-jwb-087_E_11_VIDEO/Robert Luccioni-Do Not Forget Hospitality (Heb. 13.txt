00:00:01 Our text today is discussing hospitality.
00:00:05 And as we know, hospitality includes
00:00:07 generously giving to others.
00:00:10 But you may have noted that our comments
00:00:12 make a very profound statement.
00:00:14 It says that “hospitality is
00:00:16 one of the finest antidotes to loneliness.”
00:00:21 Have you ever been lonely, really lonely?
00:00:25 Loneliness can be quite painful.
00:00:27 As we know, it’s possible to be lonely even when we’re surrounded by people.
00:00:32 One writer stated: “Solitude is pleasant.
00:00:36 Loneliness is not.”
00:00:38 Another described loneliness as “like being in the rain,
00:00:42 and the sky holds nothing but the promise of more clouds.”
00:00:46 One sister described the feeling of loneliness
00:00:48 as “slipping down a deep well.”
00:00:50 The further she slipped, the darker things became.
00:00:55 So, what can help us to deal with loneliness before we sink too deep?
00:01:00 What can help us start climbing back out of that well
00:01:02 or pushing those clouds out into the sky?
00:01:05 Well, as our text says, hospitality —generosity, giving—
00:01:10 is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness.
00:01:14 Now, why is that?
00:01:16 Well, let’s consider three Scriptural principles
00:01:18 as to why that is the case, and we’ll see why this is true.
00:01:22 Look first at Acts 20:35.
00:01:25 Let’s read that together—Acts 20:35—
00:01:29 and we’ll see our first promise.
00:01:32 And here it says: “I have shown you in all things
00:01:34 “that by working hard in this way, you must assist those who are weak
00:01:38 “and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said:
00:01:42 ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’”
00:01:47 So our first point is very simply
00:01:49 that giving makes us happy.
00:01:52 Now, the apostle Paul here is quoting Jesus.
00:01:55 And you notice Jesus was not saying that we give when we are happy
00:02:00 or we give because we are happy.
00:02:02 He says that we are happy because we give.
00:02:06 Now, that’s significant because that tells us that even when we force ourselves to give,
00:02:10 even if we don’t feel like it,
00:02:12 we will experience happiness.
00:02:15 Researchers today have confirmed what Jesus knew all along.
00:02:18 They even state that giving possibly releases endorphins in the brain
00:02:23 that help us with serenity and with contentment.
00:02:27 So our first point is that giving makes us happy.
00:02:31 For a second promise, look at Hebrews 13:16.
00:02:38 Hebrews 13:16 says:
00:02:42 “Moreover, do not forget to do good
00:02:44 “and to share what you have with others,
00:02:47 for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”
00:02:51 So our second point is that giving
00:02:54 puts us in a special relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:57 Jehovah is well-pleased when we are hospitable—when we give to others.
00:03:02 Now, what does that cause Him to do?
00:03:04 Well, we may think of Paul’s words at Philippians 4:18, 19.
00:03:08 There the apostle Paul was commending the Philippian congregation
00:03:12 because they generously helped him —helped Paul.
00:03:15 And so Paul said in response that ‘Jehovah would fully supply
00:03:20 according to their need.’
00:03:23 So giving puts us in a special relationship with Jehovah.
00:03:26 We’re precious to Jehovah, and he promises
00:03:28 that he will fill all of our needs, including our emotional needs.
00:03:33 Now, we may hear that, and we say: “Well, now wait a minute.
00:03:35 “It is true that when I give, when I’m hospitable, I am happy for a time,
00:03:40 “but then later loneliness comes back again.
00:03:43 Does that mean that this scripture, this principle, does not apply to me?”
00:03:46 No.
00:03:47 Just think about what Jesus said
00:03:49 at Matthew 6:25, 33.
00:03:52 Remember there, Jesus said: ‘Do not be anxious
00:03:54 ‘about what we’re going to eat or what we’re going to drink
00:03:57 because Jehovah will give us what we need when we need it.’
00:04:00 And we trust that statement.
00:04:02 But do we take that to mean
00:04:04 that if we’re hungry or we’re going through a difficult time
00:04:07 and Jehovah gives us something —takes care of our needs—
00:04:10 that we’ll never feel hungry again?
00:04:12 No. Later that day and the next day, we’re hungry again.
00:04:14 What’s the point?
00:04:16 The point is that Jehovah will make sure
00:04:18 that we have what we need when we need it.
00:04:21 Well, it’s the same with our emotional needs.
00:04:23 Jehovah does not say that we will never feel lonely
00:04:26 or that we’ll never feel down or depressed,
00:04:28 but he assures us that if we give to others, if we are hospitable,
00:04:32 he will make sure that we have what we need
00:04:35 so that we can be happy and fulfilled in life.
00:04:38 So that’s our second promise.
00:04:40 Giving puts us in a special relationship with Jehovah,
00:04:43 and he will supply our needs.
00:04:46 For a third one, let’s look at Luke 6:38
00:04:51 —Luke 6:38.
00:04:54 This principle or this promise is that Jehovah makes sure
00:04:57 that we always receive much more than we give.
00:05:01 Luke 6:38 says: “Practice giving,
00:05:04 “and people will give to you.
00:05:06 “They will pour into your laps a fine measure,
00:05:08 “pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing.
00:05:11 “For with the measure that you are measuring out,
00:05:13 they will measure out to you in return.”
00:05:17 So Jehovah always makes sure that we receive much more than we give.
00:05:21 And we believe that scripture.
00:05:23 But all of us have hit points in our time when we feel like we are just giving
00:05:27 —giving maybe to the congregation, to the family, or to a situation in our life.
00:05:31 We’re giving, and we’re just not getting anything back.
00:05:34 Well, what then?
00:05:36 Does that mean the scripture is not true?
00:05:38 Well, no. Jesus understood that would happen.
00:05:39 Notice the way it’s worded.
00:05:41 He says: “Practice giving,
00:05:43 and people will give to you”
00:05:46 —people, not necessarily the ones that we’re giving to.
00:05:49 See, with the measure that you measure out,
00:05:52 they (people) will give to you in return.
00:05:56 So, what’s the point?
00:05:58 The point is that Jehovah promises if we practice giving,
00:06:02 if we practice strengthening our brothers, if we practice hospitality,
00:06:05 Jehovah will ensure through one way or another
00:06:09 that we receive the blessings, the strength, and the encouragement to continue.
00:06:14 Now, does this formula work?
00:06:16 Well, it does, and we’ll tell you an experience.
00:06:19 I’ll tell you an experience of a sister who we’ll call Lydia.
00:06:21 Now, Lydia was a single sister and a regular pioneer.
00:06:24 And though she had her normal down days as everybody does,
00:06:28 Lydia was known as a generous and hospitable sister
00:06:32 —as she always had gatherings at her home.
00:06:34 She would invite the whole field service group to her home for breakfast
00:06:38 before we’d go out in service.
00:06:40 Or she would do other outings —special outings—for older ones.
00:06:44 Well, then Lydia was diagnosed with cancer,
00:06:47 and this hit her very, very hard.
00:06:49 And then she later had to have surgery.
00:06:52 And Lydia sank into a very, very deep depression,
00:06:56 such that the elders, the congregation, even her friends wondered
00:07:00 if she would ever be able to pull out of it.
00:07:03 Well, finally, on one shepherding call, two elders went to visit her
00:07:07 and they read with her Luke 6:38, the scripture that we just considered.
00:07:11 And they reminded her of how generous,
00:07:14 how hospitable, she used to be in the past
00:07:16 and how this brought her such happiness.
00:07:19 And she acknowledged it was true.
00:07:21 But she said: “I just don’t want to be around people anymore.
00:07:24 I can’t be around people.”
00:07:26 So these two brothers challenged her in a kind way
00:07:29 to prayerfully try to force herself to give
00:07:33 just for a few months and see how things worked out.
00:07:36 And to everybody’s surprise, she did.
00:07:39 And it was like the clouds parted and the old Lydia came back again.
00:07:44 Now, that was many years ago,
00:07:46 and Lydia still has her down days, just like everybody does.
00:07:49 But she is again a happy and productive servant of Jehovah.
00:07:53 What’s the lesson?
00:07:54 Well, hospitality —generosity, giving—
00:07:59 is one of the finest antidotes to loneliness and depression.
00:08:02 If we give, Jehovah promises that we will get back in return.
00:08:07 Now, there’s a beautiful account that reminds us
00:08:10 that we cannot “outgive” Jehovah.
00:08:13 And we know this one in 2 Chronicles chapter 25.
00:08:17 Let’s look at that together —2 Chronicles chapter 25,
00:08:20 starting there in verse 5.
00:08:22 This is speaking about Amaziah the king.
00:08:25 He’s 25 years old, king of Judah, and this is at a time
00:08:28 when he’s facing a conflict with the Edomites.
00:08:31 Verse 5 says that he gathers in Judah,
00:08:34 and he identifies “300,000 [skilled] warriors
00:08:38 to serve in the army.”
00:08:40 But he feels that that’s not enough.
00:08:42 So you look at verse 6, and he goes out and he hires
00:08:44 100,000 soldiers from Israel
00:08:47 “for 100 silver talents.”
00:08:49 Now, in verse 7, the “man of the true God” comes and says
00:08:53 to send the 100,000 soldiers of Israel back because “Jehovah is not with Israel.”
00:08:58 Go with the 300,000 you have, and I’ll be with you.
00:09:02 Well, you look at the beginning of verse 9 —2 Chronicles 25:9—
00:09:06 the king says: ‘But what about the money I paid out?’
00:09:10 Now, that was no small change.
00:09:12 According to the Appendix B14 in the back of our Bible,
00:09:16 those 100 silver talents
00:09:18 would be worth about $1.5 million in today’s money in silver.
00:09:23 So the king put out a lot of money to hire those soldiers.
00:09:26 Now the prophet just says to send them away.
00:09:29 But it’s the next words that are so reassuring
00:09:31 in the context of what we’re talking about today.
00:09:33 Notice that verse 9, the latter part of it, says:
00:09:37 “The man of the true God replied:
00:09:40 ‘Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that.’”
00:09:44 Don’t worry about it.
00:09:46 Jehovah has the means to give you much more than that.
00:09:49 You cannot “outgive” Jehovah.
00:09:52 So in the context of our discussion,
00:09:55 Jehovah promises that if we are hospitable, if we are generous, if we are giving,
00:09:59 we will be happy;
00:10:02 he guarantees that he’ll supply all of our needs, even our emotional needs;
00:10:07 and he will move others to give back to us
00:10:10 much more than we ever could give.
00:10:12 So may we be determined to practice giving,
00:10:16 practice hospitality, and practice generosity.
00:10:19 And every time we do, we will push the clouds
00:10:22 farther back into the sky
00:10:24 and we will always receive much more than we give.

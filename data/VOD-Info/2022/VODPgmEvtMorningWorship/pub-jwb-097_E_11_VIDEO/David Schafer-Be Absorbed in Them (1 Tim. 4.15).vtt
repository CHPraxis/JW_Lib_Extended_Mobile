00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:03.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
What are the things Paul

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:07.590 line:10% position:50% align:center
was telling Timothy to “be absorbed in”

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.626 line:10% position:50% align:center
and to “ponder over”?

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:11.461 line:10% position:50% align:center
And in what sense

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.798 line:10% position:50% align:center
do we today make our advancement

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
clearly seen?

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 4
and examine the context.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
We begin in the last paragraph
of this chapter.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 4:11 says:

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:33.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on giving these commands
and teaching them. 

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:35.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never let anyone look down on your youth.

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Instead, become an example
to the faithful ones in speaking,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in conduct, in love,

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in faith, in chasteness.

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:48.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Until I come, continue applying yourself

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to public reading,
to exhortation, to teaching.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:54.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not neglect the gift in you
that was given you

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through a prophecy when the body of elders
laid their hands on you.

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ponder over these things;

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be absorbed in them,

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:08.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that your advancement
may be plainly seen by all people.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pay constant attention to yourself
and to your teaching.

00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:17.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Persevere in these things,
for by doing this you will save both yourself

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who listen to you.”

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:22.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first note that it says,

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be absorbed”

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not immersed but “absorbed.”

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the difference?

00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:36.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you can drop a whole onion
into a pot of soup,

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if it’s not in there very long,

00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:41.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can pull it back out
and it’s still an onion.

00:01:41.484 --> 00:01:44.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the soup tastes basically the same.

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:46.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if you were to prepare that onion

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:51.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then drop it in the soup
and leave it there for hours?

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:55.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, then it absorbs into the soup
to the extent that we 

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply cannot remove it any longer.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are absorbed in something,

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become part of it.

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word for “be absorbed in”

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:10.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally translates
“in these things be you.”

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:15.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some older translations say
“give thyself wholly to.”

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the soup, as it were,

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
into which we are to be absorbed?

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verse 12 lists ‘speaking,

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
conduct, love, faith, and chasteness.’

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:33.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we ask ourselves,
‘Are these qualities and actions 

00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:36.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
what I am?’

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is our advancement plainly seen,

00:02:40.677 --> 00:02:44.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
for instance, in the way we speak?

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:47.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is not referring
to public speaking privileges.

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Timothy had been a well-known traveling elder

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
for upward of ten years before he received

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
this letter from Paul.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
But his advancement would be plainly seen

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:03.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his loyalty and in the way his speech

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:06.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflected his love and his faith.

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, regarding speech,

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:12.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
turn with me, please, to James chapter 1
—James chapter 1.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this verse,

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
James points out the impact

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:20.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our speech can have on our worship.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote at James 1:26:

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If any man thinks

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he is a worshipper of God but does not keep

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a tight rein on his tongue,

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he is deceiving his own heart,
and his worship

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
is futile.”

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other older translations say,

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This man’s religion is vain.”

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:47.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
This, in fact, is one of the texts
that drew our brothers

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the conclusion that there is a distinction

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:54.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
between true religion and false religion.

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never would we want
to show the spirit of false religion,

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:01.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
deceiving ourselves into thinking
that as long as we do some good,

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
God won’t care if our words

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:06.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
are mean or untrue.

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:10.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we “keep a tight rein on [our] tongue.”

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:13.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that expression
“keep a tight rein on” reminds us

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
of James’ horse illustration at James 3:3.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping a tight rein on our tongue
does not mean that we never speak

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:26.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
any more than keeping a tight rein
on a horse means that you never ride it.

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:29.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, a horse is valuable, powerful, beautiful,

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:32.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can be very useful

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
when trained.

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:37.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we use our gift of speech,

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:40.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we control what we say
so that it has the effect

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want and the effect Jehovah wants.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our speech can reveal the degree

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
to which we have made spiritual progress.

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, today, most don’t serve
in congregations like Ephesus,

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Paul asked Timothy
to keep working as a bulwark

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
against “false stories”

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “misleading inspired statements
and teachings of demons.”

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:02.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can set a powerful example

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:05.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way we speak.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:10.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
We work with people here in Bethel
and in our congregations.

00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:13.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 133rd Psalm says that Jehovah’s blessing

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
is where brothers “dwell together in unity.”

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 4:14 says that Jehovah’s spirit

00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:23.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “resting” upon the congregation.

00:05:23.973 --> 00:05:27.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s a blessing when we work together.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one human has every quality needed

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:33.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see a project through to its completion.

00:05:33.216 --> 00:05:37.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we come together, we speak.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talk about how to get the job done.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we consider:
Is this a good plan of action?

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is our work being done well?

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it effective?

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it being carried out in harmony
with published guidelines?

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it genuinely helpful?

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that process,
people who have poured hours of work

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a project could find that their feelings

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
are keenly attuned

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the answers to those questions.

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:09.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happens if someone
takes exception to the way

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:12.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have done our job?

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if they point out a problem,

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
but their solution
is worse than the problem itself?

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:20.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we stop listening to them

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
or stop respecting them?

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:26.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could we be grateful for their perspective

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:29.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
that something is not quite right
while at the same time

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
continuing to seek a solution?

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:35.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
What words will we use?

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could be a very good opportunity

00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to “become an example

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the faithful ones in speaking.”

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever noticed that some people

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:51.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
consistently show gratitude

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are rich with words of commendation,

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when they’re offering correction?

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:00.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not just a technical formula

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:02.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the “counsel sandwich”—

00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:05.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
commendation, counsel, commendation.

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:07.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it’s valid

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
—words that took real observation

00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:14.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciation coming from a person

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
who on other occasions
only shows encouragement.

00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:21.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or, you know, those elders who can enter
into the most stressful situation

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:25.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just get everybody laughing
and then offer frank counsel if needed

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:28.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then keep everybody in a good mood?

00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an art.

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never make the mistake of thinking,
‘He’s just a natural.’

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that is advancement.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many in our Bethel family have this skill.

00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate them.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Become an example to the faithful ones
in speaking.

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:50.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Paul also mentions conduct

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chasteness.

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:57.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
How good it is to be surrounded
by examples of those who truly delight

00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
in maintaining
Jehovah’s high moral standards.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And 1 Timothy 4:12 also mentions

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
becoming an example “in love.”

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:09.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Timothy had been harsh or unkind

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way he dealt
with his fellow believers,

00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:16.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
what effect could that have had on all
the good work he had accomplished already

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a teacher and an overseer?

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we also set an example

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the faithful ones in faith.

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be seen in our ability

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:33.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discern Jehovah’s hand

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the way he’s backing and blessing

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:38.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work that we’re doing.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we build Ramapo under lockdown?

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:43.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we make videos when we can’t

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
get 20 people together in a small space?

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:48.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we make disciples if we have to stay

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:50.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
six feet away from everyone?

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:52.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what have we seen?

00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ramapo is ahead of schedule.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW Broadcasting® is more useful than ever.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Congregation meetings
are better attended than before.

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:03.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thousands of new disciples

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:06.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
are still being baptized every week.

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:12.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because “all things are possible” with God

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:14.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
if one has faith.

00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:17.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Become an example to the faithful ones

00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:20.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
in speaking, in conduct,

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
in love, in faith, in chasteness.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the soup.

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ponder over these things,

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:32.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
be absorbed in them,

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:35.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in that way your advancement

00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:37.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be plainly seen.

00:00:01 What are the things Paul
00:00:03 was telling Timothy to “be absorbed in”
00:00:07 and to “ponder over”?
00:00:09 And in what sense
00:00:11 do we today make our advancement
00:00:14 clearly seen?
00:00:16 Let’s open our Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 4 and examine the context.
00:00:21 We begin in the last paragraph of this chapter.
00:00:24 First Timothy 4:11 says:
00:00:28 “Keep on giving these commands and teaching them.
00:00:33 “Never let anyone look down on your youth.
00:00:35 “Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking,
00:00:40 “in conduct, in love,
00:00:42 “in faith, in chasteness.
00:00:45 “Until I come, continue applying yourself
00:00:48 “to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.
00:00:50 “Do not neglect the gift in you that was given you
00:00:54 “through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
00:00:58 “Ponder over these things;
00:01:01 “be absorbed in them,
00:01:04 “so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people.
00:01:08 “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.
00:01:13 “Persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself
00:01:17 and those who listen to you.”
00:01:20 Well, first note that it says,
00:01:22 “Be absorbed”
00:01:25 —not immersed but “absorbed.”
00:01:29 What’s the difference?
00:01:31 Well, you can drop a whole onion into a pot of soup,
00:01:36 and if it’s not in there very long,
00:01:38 you can pull it back out and it’s still an onion.
00:01:41 And the soup tastes basically the same.
00:01:44 But what if you were to prepare that onion
00:01:46 and then drop it in the soup and leave it there for hours?
00:01:51 Well, then it absorbs into the soup to the extent that we
00:01:55 simply cannot remove it any longer.
00:01:58 If we are absorbed in something,
00:02:01 we become part of it.
00:02:04 The Greek word for “be absorbed in”
00:02:06 literally translates “in these things be you.”
00:02:10 Some older translations say “give thyself wholly to.”
00:02:15 So, what is the soup, as it were,
00:02:18 into which we are to be absorbed?
00:02:23 Well, verse 12 lists ‘speaking,
00:02:26 conduct, love, faith, and chasteness.’
00:02:30 So we ask ourselves, ‘Are these qualities and actions
00:02:33 what I am?’
00:02:36 How is our advancement plainly seen,
00:02:40 for instance, in the way we speak?
00:02:44 Now, this is not referring to public speaking privileges.
00:02:47 Timothy had been a well-known traveling elder
00:02:50 for upward of ten years before he received
00:02:53 this letter from Paul.
00:02:55 But his advancement would be plainly seen
00:02:58 in his loyalty and in the way his speech
00:03:03 reflected his love and his faith.
00:03:06 Now, regarding speech,
00:03:08 turn with me, please, to James chapter 1 —James chapter 1.
00:03:12 In this verse,
00:03:15 James points out the impact
00:03:17 that our speech can have on our worship.
00:03:20 He wrote at James 1:26:
00:03:22 “If any man thinks
00:03:25 “he is a worshipper of God but does not keep
00:03:28 “a tight rein on his tongue,
00:03:32 “he is deceiving his own heart, and his worship
00:03:35 is futile.”
00:03:38 Other older translations say,
00:03:40 “This man’s religion is vain.”
00:03:44 This, in fact, is one of the texts that drew our brothers
00:03:47 to the conclusion that there is a distinction
00:03:49 between true religion and false religion.
00:03:54 Never would we want to show the spirit of false religion,
00:03:58 deceiving ourselves into thinking that as long as we do some good,
00:04:01 God won’t care if our words
00:04:03 are mean or untrue.
00:04:06 No, we “keep a tight rein on [our] tongue.”
00:04:10 And that expression “keep a tight rein on” reminds us
00:04:13 of James’ horse illustration at James 3:3.
00:04:17 Keeping a tight rein on our tongue does not mean that we never speak
00:04:22 any more than keeping a tight rein on a horse means that you never ride it.
00:04:26 No, a horse is valuable, powerful, beautiful,
00:04:29 and it can be very useful
00:04:32 when trained.
00:04:34 So we use our gift of speech,
00:04:37 but we control what we say so that it has the effect
00:04:40 we want and the effect Jehovah wants.
00:04:43 Our speech can reveal the degree
00:04:45 to which we have made spiritual progress.
00:04:48 Now, today, most don’t serve in congregations like Ephesus,
00:04:51 where Paul asked Timothy to keep working as a bulwark
00:04:54 against “false stories”
00:04:56 and “misleading inspired statements and teachings of demons.”
00:04:59 But we can set a powerful example
00:05:02 in the way we speak.
00:05:05 We work with people here in Bethel and in our congregations.
00:05:10 The 133rd Psalm says that Jehovah’s blessing
00:05:13 is where brothers “dwell together in unity.”
00:05:17 First Peter 4:14 says that Jehovah’s spirit
00:05:20 is “resting” upon the congregation.
00:05:23 So there’s a blessing when we work together.
00:05:27 No one human has every quality needed
00:05:30 to see a project through to its completion.
00:05:33 And when we come together, we speak.
00:05:37 We talk about how to get the job done.
00:05:39 At times, we consider: Is this a good plan of action?
00:05:43 Is our work being done well?
00:05:45 Is it effective?
00:05:47 Is it being carried out in harmony with published guidelines?
00:05:49 Is it genuinely helpful?
00:05:52 In that process, people who have poured hours of work
00:05:56 into a project could find that their feelings
00:05:59 are keenly attuned
00:06:02 to the answers to those questions.
00:06:05 But what happens if someone takes exception to the way
00:06:09 we have done our job?
00:06:12 What if they point out a problem,
00:06:14 but their solution is worse than the problem itself?
00:06:18 Will we stop listening to them
00:06:20 or stop respecting them?
00:06:23 Could we be grateful for their perspective
00:06:26 that something is not quite right while at the same time
00:06:29 continuing to seek a solution?
00:06:31 What words will we use?
00:06:35 This could be a very good opportunity
00:06:38 for us to “become an example
00:06:41 to the faithful ones in speaking.”
00:06:45 Have you ever noticed that some people
00:06:48 consistently show gratitude
00:06:51 and are rich with words of commendation,
00:06:55 even when they’re offering correction?
00:06:57 And it’s not just a technical formula
00:07:00 —the “counsel sandwich”—
00:07:02 commendation, counsel, commendation.
00:07:05 No, it’s valid
00:07:07 —words that took real observation
00:07:11 and appreciation coming from a person
00:07:14 who on other occasions only shows encouragement.
00:07:18 Or, you know, those elders who can enter into the most stressful situation
00:07:21 and just get everybody laughing and then offer frank counsel if needed
00:07:25 but then keep everybody in a good mood?
00:07:28 It’s an art.
00:07:29 Never make the mistake of thinking, ‘He’s just a natural.’
00:07:34 No, that is advancement.
00:07:37 So many in our Bethel family have this skill.
00:07:41 We appreciate them.
00:07:44 Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking.
00:07:48 But Paul also mentions conduct
00:07:50 and chasteness.
00:07:53 How good it is to be surrounded by examples of those who truly delight
00:07:57 in maintaining Jehovah’s high moral standards.
00:08:01 And 1 Timothy 4:12 also mentions
00:08:03 becoming an example “in love.”
00:08:06 If Timothy had been harsh or unkind
00:08:09 in the way he dealt with his fellow believers,
00:08:12 what effect could that have had on all the good work he had accomplished already
00:08:16 as a teacher and an overseer?
00:08:19 And we also set an example
00:08:21 for the faithful ones in faith.
00:08:24 Our faith
00:08:26 can be seen in our ability
00:08:29 to discern Jehovah’s hand
00:08:33 and the way he’s backing and blessing
00:08:35 the work that we’re doing.
00:08:38 Can we build Ramapo under lockdown?
00:08:41 How can we make videos when we can’t
00:08:43 get 20 people together in a small space?
00:08:45 How do we make disciples if we have to stay
00:08:48 six feet away from everyone?
00:08:50 But what have we seen?
00:08:52 Ramapo is ahead of schedule.
00:08:54 JW Broadcasting® is more useful than ever.
00:08:57 Congregation meetings are better attended than before.
00:09:01 And thousands of new disciples
00:09:03 are still being baptized every week.
00:09:06 Why?
00:09:07 Because “all things are possible” with God
00:09:12 if one has faith.
00:09:14 Become an example to the faithful ones
00:09:17 in speaking, in conduct,
00:09:20 in love, in faith, in chasteness.
00:09:24 That’s the soup.
00:09:27 Ponder over these things,
00:09:29 be absorbed in them,
00:09:32 and in that way your advancement
00:09:35 will be plainly seen.

00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:03.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of us have had

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
very interesting experiences with young ones,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.425 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we could go on quite a while

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
speaking about them.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But there is a story

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:15.665 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about a “child psychologist

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:20.670 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“who began his practice with four theories

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and no children. . . .

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some years later he found
that he had four children

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no theories!”

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He learned that there was quite a bit to do.

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot to do to raise a child.

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:40.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was far more than just a few theories.

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this was a comment that was reported
by psychologist Bruce Narramore

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and published in the <i>Awake!</i>
of April 8, 1981.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So theories about child raising come and go,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the best counsel on raising a child,
of course, is found in the Bible.

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that, because it’s been there
for thousands of years,

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:04.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s consistent.

00:01:04.347 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s consistently successful.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another interesting point

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is four times as much counsel

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:15.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
given to children in the book of Proverbs

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as given to adults.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That might surprise you,
but that’s what I read, so I believe it.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 22:6 is a familiar scripture
for all of us.

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 22:6, and here it says:

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Train a boy in the way he should go;

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when he grows old
he will not depart from it.”

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that true?

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s true.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean that in every case

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:51.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a boy that’s well-trained by his parents
won’t depart from it?

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
It does not mean that.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s giving a general, overall view

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what will take place

00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:02.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if a child is trained properly
by his parents.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what it is,
this is an interesting brief statement

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:10.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from <i>The Watchtower</i>  of 2008, April 1st

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if a child is trained
according to the Bible’s counsel,

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the parent or parents “are creating

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the most favorable circumstances

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:23.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring about a marvelous result.”

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:25.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That marvelous result is

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a faithful servant of Jehovah God.

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:31.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can turn to Proverbs 23:24

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where reference is made to that

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 23:24.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how many parents are so delighted
with their children,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the case of so many
who are serving at Bethel!

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There at Proverbs 23:24, it says:

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The father of a righteous one
will surely be joyful;

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:56.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whoever fathers a wise son
will rejoice in him.”

00:02:56.025 --> 00:03:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it does; it brings great pleasure
to parents when that happens.

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:02.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s another side to the coin.

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the most earnest efforts of parents,

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some children do become unfaithful.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about Solomon.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t a child, but actually,

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s very difficult to understand

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how that man turned away from Jehovah
in his old age, but he did.

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then even Jehovah had sons
who proved unfaithful.

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:28.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what the June 1, 2007,<i> Watchtower</i>

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed clearly,
and we’re all familiar with it

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the angels who turned away
from their Father, their Creator.

00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:36.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something to keep in mind

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for parents, particularly,
who have really tried hard

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to raise their children properly,

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:46.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t want to see them
beat themselves figuratively speaking,

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on and on for years and years

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they feel like they’re failures.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They should not do that.

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you account
—if it seems to some parents

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that know somehow they failed—

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well then, how do you account for children

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who receive no help whatsoever
from their parents

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they love Jehovah
and they come into the truth?

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:09.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s heart—heart condition.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So parents would be wise
to focus on the future and what they can do,

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to look back and beat themselves

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:19.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over problems of the past.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even when children do turn aside
from serving Jehovah,

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:27.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
parents who have
conscientiously trained their children

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way to walk,

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can still entertain the hope

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:34.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those young ones
will come back some day.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never give up on our kids.

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t give up
on our close friends or siblings

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may have walked away from the truth.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always hope that they’ll come back.

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:49.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 19:7 is interesting

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 19:7—

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speaking of the reminders of Jehovah.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:03.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it reads: “The law of Jehovah
is perfect, restoring strength.”

00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it says:
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the inexperienced one wise.”

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for those who leave the truth,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times it’s reminders
that come back to them

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:20.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the way it was at home,
the counsel they received from their parents,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the loving congregation that they attended.

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who comes to mind when you think
about the reminders coming to mind

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after living a life of debauchery?

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:34.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prodigal son.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was at his lowest,
and then who did he remember?

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:42.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His father
—his father, who undoubtedly had shown

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kindness and love to him.

00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t want to overlook

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power there is in parental training.

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:51.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though they may not respond

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:54.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—children may not respond—
immediately,

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they do many times later on.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they go through experiences in life,
sometimes,

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wake them up
to the facts of life and reality.

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth is there are
thousands upon thousands

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:08.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of children of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:08.918 --> 00:06:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are being raised in the truth
and whose way “is pure and right.”

00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:16.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really is thrilling to see young ones
who are able to think.

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t just parrot
what their parents tell them.

00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:20.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not just memorizing things.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve learned to have thinking ability,
and they can speak about the truth.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:28.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They defend the truth
in a very interesting way.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:33.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Britain, Tim and Sam, both 11 years old
and unbaptized publishers,

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were engaging in field service
with Tim’s mother.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:41.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boys needed new bags
to carry their Bibles and literature,

00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but money was a problem.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, before starting
in the field service that day,

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mothers of the two publishers
made this a subject of prayer.

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:54.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the last house to be visited that morning,

00:06:54.297 --> 00:06:58.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tim spoke to the householder
and read a Bible verse to her.

00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:02.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She interrupted him
to ask what his religion was.

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:05.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Tim replied
that he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the woman scolded him

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said to his mother
that she could not understand

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why Jehovah’s Witnesses
let their children die

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than allow them
to accept blood transfusions.

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that would be a difficult thing
to have thrown in your face

00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:22.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a young man there at the door
with his mother.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tim’s mother suggested
that the woman ask the boys

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:29.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they felt about this.

00:07:29.232 --> 00:07:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tim explained that he would always choose
alternative treatment

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than go against
his Bible-trained conscience.

00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was from this young boy himself.

Sam then said, the other young boy,

00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:48.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his own sister
had received alternative treatment

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:51.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had fared better
than patients who had received blood.

00:07:54.123 --> 00:07:56.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the householder
again turned to Tim’s mother,

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this time she expressed disapproval

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of taking young children from door to door.

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve heard that many times, I’m sure.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both of the boys responded to the woman
on this occasion

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they enjoyed preaching,
adding that they preferred this

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to roaming the streets
like others of their age.

00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:18.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this slowed the householder down a bit.

00:08:18.881 --> 00:08:21.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was impressed by their reply.

00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The householder asked the boys
to wait a moment

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while she went into her house.

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a surprise they had when she returned
and presented each of them

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a smart, new, leather bag

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ideal for their ministry!

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:37.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She sold these items for a living.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:42.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her changed attitude also allowed the boys
to arrange for a return visit.

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as they were leaving,

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the householder’s 94-year-old mother,
who had been listening,

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:51.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to the door and asked Tim’s mother

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit her at her home.

00:08:54.584 --> 00:08:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, we are proud of our young ones.

00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a delight when you hear them

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make comments at the meetings
in their own words

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:06.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when you are out
in the field ministry with them

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:09.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see them make expressions of faith.

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have thousands upon thousands
of good children

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really are showing that they’re mature
and that they love Jehovah God.

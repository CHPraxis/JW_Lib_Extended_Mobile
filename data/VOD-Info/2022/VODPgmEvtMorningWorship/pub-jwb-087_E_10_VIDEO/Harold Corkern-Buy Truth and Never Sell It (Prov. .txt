00:00:02 We’d like to begin our discussion
00:00:03 with the importance of buying truth
00:00:07 personally.
00:00:09 No one else can do that for us.
00:00:11 And then we’ll talk just for a moment
00:00:13 about how much effort it takes to do that.
00:00:18 Let’s begin our discussion with something that happened
00:00:21 to King David of Israel.
00:00:24 He wanted to buy a threshing floor from a man named Araunah.
00:00:29 And he wanted to offer up sacrifices to Jehovah.
00:00:34 But Araunah the landowner said, ‘Look, David, take the threshing floor.
00:00:38 ‘I’ll give you the cattle. I’ll give you whatever you need.
00:00:41 Just take it and worship Jehovah.’
00:00:44 But how did David respond?
00:00:46 At 2 Samuel 24:24, he said this:
00:00:50 “I will not offer up to Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices
00:00:54 that cost me nothing.”
00:00:57 David realized that it had to be his personal sacrifice
00:01:01 in order for it to have value.
00:01:05 Likewise, when we buy truth,
00:01:07 we have to pay for it, in effect, ourselves.
00:01:11 How much effort does it take?
00:01:13 Well, let’s open our Bibles to the book of 2 Peter chapter 1,
00:01:17 and let’s look at a couple of expressions here
00:01:20 that will help us to appreciate the effort that’s required.
00:01:25 Second Peter 1:5:
00:01:28 “For this very reason, put forth all earnest effort
00:01:32 “to supply to your faith virtue,
00:01:35 to your virtue knowledge.”
00:01:39 So we’re always having to add, to supply,
00:01:42 to our knowledge of the truth.
00:01:44 And what kind of effort? —earnest effort, sincere,
00:01:48 strenuous with depth of feeling, conscientious.
00:01:53 And how about this matter of supplying knowledge?
00:01:58 The original Greek noun here used meant “leader of a chorus.”
00:02:02 What does that have to do with supply?
00:02:05 Well, back in the day when this was written,
00:02:09 if a city wanted to put on a stage play and they had a chorus,
00:02:13 men of the city who had money would actually go into their own pockets
00:02:18 and pay for the training and the maintenance of that chorus for the city.
00:02:22 They had to spend a lot,
00:02:24 but they were willing to do it for what they considered to be a worthy cause.
00:02:29 So it was a personal sacrifice on their part.
00:02:31 So likewise, no one else can
00:02:35 read for us, study for us,
00:02:38 research for us, meditate for us.
00:02:41 It has to be personal, and it has to be done sincerely.
00:02:46 But now, even though we get the truth (and we’re glad that we have),
00:02:51 we want to make sure that we never sell it, we never lose it.
00:02:56 Now, these expressions “buy” and “sell,” they’re business expressions, aren’t they?
00:03:01 Well, let’s see what principles in the Bible can help us
00:03:04 to be on guard against the Devil and this system,
00:03:08 who are always trying to get us to sell,
00:03:11 or to get rid of, our truth.
00:03:15 Let’s go this time to the book of Proverbs chapter 20,
00:03:19 and we want to look at verse 14
00:03:21 —Proverbs 20:14.
00:03:24 Now, this is a dishonest businessman, and notice what he does:
00:03:28 “‘It is no good, it is no good!’ says the buyer;
00:03:33 then he goes away and boasts about himself.”
00:03:36 So he sees something he wants.
00:03:39 But he doesn’t want to pay them the value,
00:03:42 so he runs down the product; he criticizes and makes it look like it’s inferior.
00:03:47 And then the seller, if he’s not aware and alert,
00:03:50 will actually sell his product
00:03:52 for far less than it’s worth, for practically nothing.
00:03:55 And then this dishonest buyer goes off, and he brags about it.
00:04:00 Well, buyers are not the only ones that can be dishonest.
00:04:05 Sellers can be dishonest too, can’t they?
00:04:07 “This is the product you need.
00:04:09 It’s exactly what you want.”
00:04:12 But they don’t tell you about the long history of problems
00:04:15 that it has.
00:04:17 They don’t tell you about the cost that it takes to maintain it
00:04:21 and the difficulties that come with owning that product.
00:04:24 All they want you to do is buy this beautiful product.
00:04:27 Well, how can we take that principle
00:04:31 and apply it to what Satan and his system tries to do to us?
00:04:36 Jehovah warned about those who say this, as recorded at Isaiah 5:20:
00:04:41 “Woe to those who say that good is bad
00:04:45 and bad is good.”
00:04:49 So Satan, with all of his cunning and his deception,
00:04:53 will try to say to us: “You know the truth that you purchased?
00:04:57 “That was a bad purchase.
00:04:59 “It’s too burdensome.
00:05:01 “It took away your freedom.
00:05:03 “You lost your independence.
00:05:05 “Now, I’ve got some products
00:05:07 that will really make you happy right now.”
00:05:12 Well, we know that in the business world,
00:05:14 the buyer always has to separate the facts
00:05:19 from the salesman’s empty, or foolish, talk,
00:05:23 or his nonsense.
00:05:25 Not all salesmen are like that, but many are.
00:05:29 So we have to be careful that we don’t buy into something that seems so good,
00:05:33 but in reality, doesn’t have value at all.
00:05:38 So how do we fight all of this propaganda from the system of things around us
00:05:43 to make us feel that we made a bad purchase with the truth?
00:05:48 Well, we have a very good example in Jesus.
00:05:52 Remember the time when the Devil came to him, as recorded in Matthew chapter 4,
00:05:57 and the Devil said to him,
00:05:59 ‘I’m going to give you all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
00:06:03 and all you have to do is one act of worship to me.’
00:06:07 How did Jesus respond?
00:06:10 “Go away, Satan!”
00:06:12 He knew that that was a lie, and he knew it was nonsense.
00:06:17 But how did he support and protect his truth?
00:06:20 He went to the truth.
00:06:22 He said to Satan: “It is written:
00:06:25 “‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship,
00:06:27 and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”
00:06:32 Well, that was the truth from God’s Word,
00:06:35 and that’s how we can protect our truth
00:06:38 that we’ve worked so hard
00:06:40 to obtain and to maintain.
00:06:43 We use the Scriptures, the truth from Jehovah,
00:06:47 to defend our precious purchase.
00:06:51 So may we continue to do that and not be fooled by this system of things
00:06:56 and all of its glitter that it says it wants to give to us.
00:07:02 Now, when considering what we’ve talked about thus far
00:07:06 —personal effort
00:07:08 and never letting the truth go because we view it as so valuable—
00:07:12 we can talk just briefly about the apostle Paul.
00:07:16 At Acts 22:3,
00:07:21 he talked about his previous education, obtaining knowledge,
00:07:25 and he said: ‘I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel,
00:07:30 ‘instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral Law,
00:07:34 and zealous for God.’
00:07:37 Saul, as he was known then,
00:07:39 was being trained at the feet of one of the most famous and renowned teachers
00:07:43 in the first century, Gamaliel.
00:07:46 Well, what did Gamaliel teach?
00:07:49 He promoted belief in the oral law,
00:07:53 and he placed greater emphasis on the oral law
00:07:57 than the inspired Scriptures.
00:08:00 So when the Hebrew Scriptures didn’t say specifically or explicitly
00:08:04 what a person should do,
00:08:06 men like Gamaliel came up with all of these oral traditions through the years.
00:08:11 And they knew them well, and the rabbis
00:08:14 would make the decision for the person, not the person.
00:08:18 In fact, Gamaliel was so esteemed that he was the first to be called rabban,
00:08:23 which was a title higher than a rabbi.
00:08:27 And Paul had to learn all of this oral tradition.
00:08:32 And research shows that it was a very painstaking,
00:08:35 relentless training program,
00:08:37 where they had to memorize all of these voluminous laws
00:08:41 and make it their own.
00:08:44 There would be benefits in the secular world —prestige.
00:08:49 But when Paul learned the truth,
00:08:54 what did he do?
00:08:56 He came to appreciate Mark 7:7, 8, when Jesus said:
00:09:00 “It is in vain that they keep worshipping me,
00:09:03 “for they teach commands of men as doctrines.
00:09:06 You let go of the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men.”
00:09:11 So Paul understood that he thought he had something of value,
00:09:15 but it was all in vain.
00:09:18 And from the time that he accepted and bought the truth,
00:09:21 he never let it go, did he?
00:09:23 Regardless of the pain and the suffering and the sacrifices he made,
00:09:28 he considered it all worth it.
00:09:31 What a fine example of personally buying
00:09:34 at great sacrifice!
00:09:37 And as the years went by,
00:09:40 Paul never sold the truth, did he?
00:09:43 At Philippians chapter 3,
00:09:45 he talked about his life as a servant of God,
00:09:50 and he had no regrets.
00:09:52 He said what he gave up was “a lot of refuse,”
00:09:55 and the original terms there
00:09:57 could indicate dung or food garbage.
00:10:01 He made the right purchase, didn’t he?
00:10:03 And when he taught and when he wrote under inspiration,
00:10:07 we do not hear the apostle Paul say,
00:10:09 “When I was with Gamaliel, this is what he said”
00:10:13 or “Gamaliel would do this in this case.”
00:10:15 Never.
00:10:16 He always went back to the real truth,
00:10:19 the truth from Jehovah’s inspired Word.
00:10:22 What a fine example for us all!
00:10:24 So, what have we learned this morning?
00:10:27 Truth is valuable, and it’s worth every personal effort to obtain it.
00:10:31 But be careful.
00:10:33 Don’t let the Devil fool us into believing we made a bad purchase.
00:10:37 Resist the Devil and this system.
00:10:39 And as a result, we’ll have no regrets over our decision.
00:10:44 We will always be so grateful that we took the time and effort
00:10:47 to buy truth, and we’ve held on to it.
00:10:50 And then the God of truth
00:10:53 will reward us with everlasting life.

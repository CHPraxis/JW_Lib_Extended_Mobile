00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.687 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’d like to begin our discussion

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the importance of buying truth

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.292 line:10% position:50% align:center
personally.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.995 line:10% position:50% align:center
No one else can do that for us.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:13.830 line:10% position:50% align:center
And then we’ll talk just for a moment

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.600 line:10% position:50% align:center
about how much effort it takes to do that.

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin our discussion
with something that happened

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
to King David of Israel.

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:29.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to buy a threshing floor
from a man named Araunah.

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:32.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he wanted to offer up
sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Araunah the landowner said,
‘Look, David, take the threshing floor.

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ll give you the cattle.
I’ll give you whatever you need.

00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:44.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just take it and worship Jehovah.’

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:46.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did David respond?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Samuel 24:24, he said this:

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will not offer up to Jehovah my God
burnt sacrifices

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:57.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
that cost me nothing.”

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
David realized that it had to be
his personal sacrifice

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for it to have value.

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, when we buy truth,

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:11.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to pay for it, in effect, ourselves.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much effort does it take?

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:17.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles
to the book of 2 Peter chapter 1,

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s look
at a couple of expressions here

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to appreciate
the effort that’s required.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 1:5:

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:32.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this very reason,
put forth all earnest effort

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:35.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to supply to your faith virtue,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
to your virtue knowledge.”

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:42.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re always having to add, to supply,

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our knowledge of the truth.

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:48.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what kind of effort?
—earnest effort, sincere,

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
strenuous with depth of feeling,
conscientious.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how about this matter
of supplying knowledge?

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original Greek noun here used
meant “leader of a chorus.”

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:05.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that have to do with supply?

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, back in the day when this was written,

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
if a city wanted to put on a stage play
and they had a chorus,

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:18.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
men of the city who had money
would actually go into their own pockets

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:22.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pay for the training and the maintenance
of that chorus for the city.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to spend a lot,

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:29.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they were willing to do it for what they
considered to be a worthy cause.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:31.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was a personal sacrifice on their part.

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:35.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
So likewise, no one else can

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
read for us, study for us,

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:41.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
research for us, meditate for us.

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:45.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be personal,
and it has to be done sincerely.

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, even though we get the truth
(and we’re glad that we have),

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:55.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to make sure
that we never sell it, we never lose it.

00:02:56.793 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these expressions “buy” and “sell,”
they’re business expressions, aren’t they?

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s see what principles in the Bible
can help us

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be on guard against the Devil
and this system,

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:11.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are always trying to get us to sell,

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:13.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to get rid of, our truth.

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go this time
to the book of Proverbs chapter 20,

00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:21.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to look at verse 14

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 20:14.

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:28.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is a dishonest businessman,
and notice what he does:

00:03:28.992 --> 00:03:33.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is no good, it is no good!’
says the buyer;

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:36.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he goes away and boasts about himself.”

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he sees something he wants.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he doesn’t want to pay them the value,

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:47.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he runs down the product; he criticizes
and makes it look like it’s inferior.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the seller,
if he’s not aware and alert,

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
will actually sell his product

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
for far less than it’s worth,
for practically nothing.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:59.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then this dishonest buyer goes off,
and he brags about it.

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, buyers are not the only ones
that can be dishonest.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sellers can be dishonest too, can’t they?

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:09.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the product you need.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s exactly what you want.”

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they don’t tell you
about the long history of problems

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:17.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it has.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t tell you about the cost
that it takes to maintain it

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:24.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the difficulties that come
with owning that product.

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:27.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
All they want you to do
is buy this beautiful product.

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:31.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we take that principle

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:35.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and apply it to what Satan
and his system tries to do to us?

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:41.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah warned about those who say this,
as recorded at Isaiah 5:20:

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:45.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Woe to those who say that good is bad

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:49.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bad is good.”

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:53.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Satan, with all of his cunning
and his deception,

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:57.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
will try to say to us:
“You know the truth that you purchased?

00:04:57.814 --> 00:04:59.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That was a bad purchase.

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s too burdensome.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:03.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It took away your freedom.

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You lost your independence.

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I’ve got some products

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will really make you happy right now.”

00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:14.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that in the business world,

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:19.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
the buyer always has to separate the facts

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:23.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the salesman’s empty, or foolish, talk,

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
or his nonsense.

00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:29.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not all salesmen are like that, but many are.

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:33.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to be careful that we don’t buy
into something that seems so good,

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in reality, doesn’t have value at all.

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we fight all of this propaganda
from the system of things around us

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:47.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make us feel that we made
a bad purchase with the truth?

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:52.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have a very good example in Jesus.

00:05:52.402 --> 00:05:57.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the time when the Devil came
to him, as recorded in Matthew chapter 4,

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:59.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Devil said to him,

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:03.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m going to give you all the kingdoms
of the world and their glory,

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:07.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all you have to do
is one act of worship to me.’

00:06:07.984 --> 00:06:10.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus respond?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go away, Satan!”

00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:17.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that that was a lie,
and he knew it was nonsense.

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:20.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did he support and protect his truth?

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:22.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went to the truth.

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to Satan: “It is written:

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:27.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:32.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.’”

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was the truth from God’s Word,

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s how we can protect our truth

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve worked so hard

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain and to maintain.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
We use the Scriptures,
the truth from Jehovah,

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
to defend our precious purchase.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:56.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may we continue to do that
and not be fooled by this system of things

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of its glitter that it says
it wants to give to us.

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when considering
what we’ve talked about thus far

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:08.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
—personal effort

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never letting the truth go
because we view it as so valuable—

00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:15.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can talk just briefly
about the apostle Paul.

00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:21.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 22:3,

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:25.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
he talked about his previous education,
obtaining knowledge,

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:30.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said: ‘I was educated
at the feet of Gamaliel,

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘instructed according to the strictness
of the ancestral Law,

00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
and zealous for God.’

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul, as he was known then,

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:43.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being trained at the feet of one
of the most famous and renowned teachers

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the first century, Gamaliel.

00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:49.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Gamaliel teach?

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
He promoted belief in the oral law,

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he placed greater emphasis
on the oral law

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the inspired Scriptures.

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the Hebrew Scriptures
didn’t say specifically or explicitly

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a person should do,

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:11.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
men like Gamaliel came up with all of these
oral traditions through the years.

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they knew them well, and the rabbis

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
would make the decision for the person,
not the person.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:23.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Gamaliel was so esteemed
that he was the first to be called rabban,

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:26.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was a title higher than a rabbi.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:32.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul had to learn
all of this oral tradition.

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:35.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
And research shows that it was
a very painstaking,

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
relentless training program,

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they had to memorize
all of these voluminous laws

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make it their own.

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
There would be benefits in the secular world
—prestige.

00:08:49.378 --> 00:08:54.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Paul learned the truth,

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did he do?

00:08:56.219 --> 00:09:00.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
He came to appreciate Mark 7:7, 8,
when Jesus said:

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:03.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is in vain that they keep worshipping me,

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:06.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for they teach commands of men as doctrines.

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
You let go of the commandment of God
and cling to the tradition of men.”

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:15.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul understood that he thought
he had something of value,

00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was all in vain.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from the time that he accepted
and bought the truth,

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:23.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
he never let it go, did he?

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regardless of the pain and the suffering
and the sacrifices he made,

00:09:28.184 --> 00:09:31.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
he considered it all worth it.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a fine example of personally buying

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:36.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
at great sacrifice!

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the years went by,

00:09:40.196 --> 00:09:43.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul never sold the truth, did he?

00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:45.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians chapter 3,

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:50.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
he talked about his life as a servant of God,

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:52.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had no regrets.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said what he gave up
was “a lot of refuse,”

00:09:55.778 --> 00:09:57.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the original terms there

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
could indicate dung or food garbage.

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made the right purchase, didn’t he?

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:07.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when he taught
and when he wrote under inspiration,

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not hear the apostle Paul say,

00:10:09.892 --> 00:10:13.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I was with Gamaliel,
this is what he said”

00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:15.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Gamaliel would do this in this case.”

00:10:15.765 --> 00:10:16.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always went back to the real truth,

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:22.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
the truth from Jehovah’s inspired Word.

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a fine example for us all!

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:27.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned this morning?

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:31.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth is valuable, and it’s worth
every personal effort to obtain it.

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:33.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
But be careful.

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:37.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let the Devil fool us into believing
we made a bad purchase.

00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:39.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Resist the Devil and this system.

00:10:39.989 --> 00:10:44.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result, we’ll have no regrets
over our decision.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will always be so grateful
that we took the time and effort

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
to buy truth, and we’ve held on to it.

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the God of truth

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:57.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reward us with everlasting life.

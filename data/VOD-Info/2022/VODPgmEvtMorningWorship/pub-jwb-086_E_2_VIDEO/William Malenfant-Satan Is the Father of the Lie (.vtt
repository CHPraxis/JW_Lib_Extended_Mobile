The Scriptures do not say specifically

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:09.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the Devil fathered any of the Nephilim.

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:14.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus’ words at John 8:44 reveal the fact

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:17.634 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the Devil does indeed have children,

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
figuratively speaking.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can’t create humans,

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he can influence people

00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:28.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reflect his characteristics.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what makes them his children.

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:36.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to John 8:44.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll read the entire text of Jesus’ words.

00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:46.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that the religious leaders
were out to kill him,

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:50.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ words point out who their father is.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 8:44, Jesus said:

00:00:54.404 --> 00:00:58.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are from your father the Devil,

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you wish to do
the desires of your father.

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:05.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That one was a murderer when he began,

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:08.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he did not stand fast in the truth,

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:12.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because truth is not in him.

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he speaks the lie,

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:18.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he speaks according to his own disposition,

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:23.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is a liar
and the father of the lie.”

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:27.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to the text,
at one time he was in the truth.

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he had free will,

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he toyed with wrong thinking

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to such a degree
that it eroded anything that was good,

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing good was left within him.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he made himself
into “the father of the lie”

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan the Devil.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we add Jesus’ words

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what John wrote at 1 John 3:10,

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can identify specific characteristics

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “the children of the Devil”

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the children of [Jehovah] God.”

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that together at 1 John 3:10.

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It states: “The children of God

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the children of the Devil

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are evident by this fact:

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever does not practice righteousness

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“does not originate with God,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor does the one
who does not love his brother.”

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:34.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must “practice righteousness,”
but it’s not self-righteousness.

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:37.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t establish
what is righteous for ourselves.

00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:39.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jehovah’s righteousness.

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that what Jesus said at Matthew 6:33:

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Keep on seeking the Kingdom
and his righteousness’?

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The standards that Jehovah God has set for us

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is what righteousness is.

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:56.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the points
about being righteous and serving God

00:02:56.492 --> 00:02:59.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that we are “no part of the world.”

00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:01.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s interesting about that idea

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:05.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that there are many people in the world
who think they are righteous.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They set their own standards.

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are people who believe
they’re practicing righteousness

00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:16.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they set about
to bring about social justice

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or remove injustices

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:23.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the political, the commercial,
the economics of this world.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to see justice for all.

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:27.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No more racial inequality

00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so many other items
they follow through on

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remove them from this world scene today.

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they feel
that they truly are being righteous.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:45.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it appears, though,
that one injustice is removed,

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it only appears that way in many cases,

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t there always another one that comes up?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t there a multitude
of injustices in this world?

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me think
about a longtime faithful servant of Jehovah

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was approached by a group of men

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:05.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who criticized Jehovah’s Witnesses
because we don’t get involved

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in working against the social injustices
of this world.

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother, who was known
for being straightforward and outspoken,

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:19.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said that what these men were doing

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their fight against injustices
in the world

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was battling against spiderwebs.

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:31.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Injustices were like spiderwebs,
and they would fight and battle,

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would demonstrate
to bring down a spiderweb.

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But another spiderweb
was being woven, being spun,

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe the same one in many cases
just came up again.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it just continues on and on that way.

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:48.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he looked at the men, and he said:

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:52.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But we are going to get

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:54.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the spider, Satan the Devil.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re after the webs, what he produces.

00:04:57.046 --> 00:05:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’ve got to go to the source
and see that the spider is eliminated.

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:06.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And it’s Jesus Christ
who is going to abyss Satan the Devil,

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the spider who’s spinning
all of these things to distract people

00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:14.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the real issue about God’s Kingdom

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and serving Jehovah wholeheartedly.

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That spider will be thrown into the abyss.

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:23.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No more spiderwebs.”

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, the Devil’s lie to Eve

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about becoming like God,
knowing good and evil,

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has had far-reaching consequences

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that affect people more than ever
right down to this day.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see it
—the world’s attitude.

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re independent.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You don’t need God.

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We don’t need to be guided
by Scriptural principles—what the Bible says.

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You decide for yourself
how you want to live.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There are no moral standards.

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:53.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You fix your own standards.’

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that precisely what Satan told Eve?

00:05:56.172 --> 00:05:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You can be like God.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You decide what’s good, what’s bad,

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:01.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what’s right for you and not right.’

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they feel so sophisticated and so wise.

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:08.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We can fix our problems.’

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:09.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, really?

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look at the world scene today.

00:06:11.654 --> 00:06:13.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they really fixing the problems?

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:16.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we really see happening?

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s out of control.

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The entire world scene is out of control.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world in its wisdom prefers the lie.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though they don’t recognize the liar,

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they still prefer the lie

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of recognizing
their need for Jehovah God.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the outcome for the world

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:43.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stated for us at Jeremiah 8:9:

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:45.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wise have been put to shame.

00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:48.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They have become terrified
and [they] will be caught.

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!
They have rejected the word of Jehovah,

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what wisdom do they have?”

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know,
you might ask the question:

00:06:58.067 --> 00:06:59.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why?

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:03.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why are people so determined
to go their own way?

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:05.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with their thinking?’

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:10.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are various reasons,
but there is one that truly stands out.

00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:12.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the apostle Paul spoke about it

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Thessalonians 2:10.

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:18.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what Paul said in part.

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He tells us that people will perish

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they did not accept

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the love of the truth

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:29.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order that they might be saved.”

00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:32.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, “the love of the truth.”

00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:34.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People really don’t love truth.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to make up their own truths,
which are lies.

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:39.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not truths.

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:42.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must accept the love of the truth.

00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:46.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really quite wonderful
that Jehovah has made the truth in such a way

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it appeals to our heart

00:07:49.018 --> 00:07:51.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as to our head.

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:54.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the time
when Jesus taught the truth

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his disciples who were walking
on their way to Emmaus.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember how they responded?

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s at Luke 24:32.

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said:
“Were not our hearts burning

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . as he was speaking to us
on the road,

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he was fully opening up
the Scriptures to us.”

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:16.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I found a very interesting comment

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in <i>The Watchtower</i>  on this verse.

00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:24.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s <i>The Watchtower</i>  of 1962,
April 15, page 227.

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what it said:

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:30.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only when we have real love for the truth

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:35.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will we go through the experience
of burning hearts.”

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:37.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that fascinating?

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:42.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about when your heart has burned

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when you’ve observed a drama,

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’ve heard an encouraging talk,

00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:51.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you sang a wonderful Kingdom song.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the Hezekiah drama.

00:08:56.319 --> 00:09:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we saw the angel spread his wings

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while facing the Assyrian troops

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then devastation came,

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t your heart burn?

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we think about when armed troops

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were stealthily advancing
on our brothers in an open field,

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in the opened-up heavens

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see Jesus on a white horse
with bow in hand

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:23.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ready to take vengeance
on those who hate Jehovah.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a reality foretold in Scripture.

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That fires the heart.

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:32.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are other things
that fire our heart

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:35.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when we hear beautiful songs
that are meaningful,

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as “Never Alone”

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Give Me Courage”

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many others.

00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heart that loves Jehovah
does indeed burn.

00:09:47.937 --> 00:09:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is not just emotion.

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:53.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our thinking ability
and our emotions work together

00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:56.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivate us to know and to feel

00:09:56.545 --> 00:09:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of the truth.

00:09:58.948 --> 00:10:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As <i>The Watchtower</i>  I quoted from declares:

00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:07.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Our life depends
on whether we have love for the truth.’

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So love Jehovah.

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love our neighbor.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, yes, we must love the truth.

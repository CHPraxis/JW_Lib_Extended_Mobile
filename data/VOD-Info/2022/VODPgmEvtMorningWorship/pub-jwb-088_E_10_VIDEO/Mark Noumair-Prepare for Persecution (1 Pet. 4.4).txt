00:00:01 Now, at Matthew 5:11, Jesus said
00:00:06 people would ‘lyingly say
00:00:10 every wicked thing’
00:00:12 against lovers of truth.
00:00:14 They lied about Jesus Christ.
00:00:17 They spread lies about first-century Christians.
00:00:20 They spread lies about true worshippers.
00:00:23 Today, we should expect lies against us,
00:00:26 expect persecution, expect reproach.
00:00:29 This is what Jesus said would happen.
00:00:33 And especially during “the Lord’s day” (which we are living in right now),
00:00:37 prophecies indicate that even at this time,
00:00:40 reproach and persecution would become clearly evident.
00:00:44 For example, let’s open our Bibles
00:00:47 to Revelation chapter 13
00:00:49 and see how this applies in our day —Revelation chapter 13.
00:00:54 We should expect and prepare for persecution.
00:00:58 Now, at Revelation 13:1,
00:01:04 it speaks about “a wild beast.”
00:01:06 Now, this wild beast is Satan’s political creation
00:01:10 among the masses of mankind.
00:01:14 But there’s something about this wild beast that we need to understand.
00:01:17 And let’s now go to verse 3
00:01:21 about the wild beast, or the political creation
00:01:23 of Satan the Devil.
00:01:27 In verse 3, it says:
00:01:29 “All the earth [mankind]
00:01:33 followed the wild beast with admiration.”
00:01:37 So it’s admired.
00:01:38 In what sense is this wild beast admired?
00:01:41 Well, it’s admired because it endeavors to create
00:01:43 a higher standard of living in various countries.
00:01:47 It makes advances in technology.
00:01:49 It tries to cure diseases.
00:01:51 So it wins that admiration of people.
00:01:53 “Oh, look at the wild beast.”
00:01:56 But now, let’s go beyond admiration.
00:01:58 Notice in verse 4 what begins to happen:
00:02:01 “And they worshipped the dragon because it gave the authority
00:02:05 “to the wild beast [there it is again],
00:02:07 and they worshipped [people worshipped] the wild beast.”
00:02:11 So now we go from admiration
00:02:15 to worship—worshipping the wild beast.
00:02:17 Well, in what respect? How is it worshipped?
00:02:20 It’s worshipped when people say love of country before love of God.
00:02:25 They put love of country, their devotion to nationalism,
00:02:29 before their love of Jehovah God
00:02:32 —so from admiration to worship.
00:02:37 But now, notice in verse 7 what happens:
00:02:41 “It was permitted to wage war with the holy ones [true] and conquer them,
00:02:45 and it was given [now notice this] authority.”
00:02:49 So now, the wild beast ‘was given authority over every tribe,
00:02:53 people, tongue, and nation.’
00:02:57 Authority worldwide
00:02:59 —authority given over the worldwide system of rulership,
00:03:02 tribe, people, tongue, and nation.
00:03:06 And now it uses its authority, especially against Jehovah’s people,
00:03:10 to clamp down on the work that Jehovah God has given us to do
00:03:14 —to try to ban our work and persecute us.
00:03:16 That’s the authority that they use against God’s people.
00:03:21 We have to be prepared for that.
00:03:25 But now, notice here in verse 8—
00:03:27 Any authority or any victory they might have over God’s people
00:03:31 (the intense suffering, yes, that we have to undergo
00:03:35 because of this authority),
00:03:37 well, it’s going to be short-lived.
00:03:40 And notice in verse 8 why we say that.
00:03:45 It says: “Not one of their names
00:03:49 “[not one of their names, those in Satan’s organization, not one of their names]
00:03:54 has been written in the scroll of life.”
00:03:57 So any apparent victory is short-lived
00:03:59 because no one in Satan’s visible organization
00:04:02 is going to be “written in the scroll of life.”
00:04:05 The only ones “written in the scroll of life” here are those who rule with Jesus Christ.
00:04:09 So again, any apparent victory that they might have over God’s people
00:04:14 is merely temporary.
00:04:18 However, we go further in verse 9,
00:04:22 and now we have a warning.
00:04:24 Verse 9 says:
00:04:27 “If anyone has an ear,
00:04:29 let him hear.”
00:04:33 What does this mean?
00:04:35 Well, John now is giving direction for us to have discernment.
00:04:39 If we have an ear of discernment, we have to hear; we have to listen.
00:04:43 Why? Because Jehovah God is allowing the wild beast
00:04:47 to have this type of authority.
00:04:49 He’s allowing the wild beast to operate.
00:04:51 He’s allowing the wild beast to go to these lengths.
00:04:53 So we have to have discernment
00:04:56 and understand what this means in our life.
00:05:00 What does it mean?
00:05:02 Well, verse 10 says:
00:05:05 “If anyone is meant for captivity, he will go into captivity.”
00:05:09 So there’s the persecution again.
00:05:11 Some of us will go into captivity.
00:05:13 Our brothers are already in captivity.
00:05:15 We think about those in Russia or in Eritrea.
00:05:19 They’ve been in captivity.
00:05:20 We go into captivity then. We don’t compromise.
00:05:24 We hold on to Bible principles.
00:05:27 A little bit further, it goes on in verse 10:
00:05:29 “If anyone will kill with the sword, he must be killed with the sword.”
00:05:33 So there it is again.
00:05:35 Some of our brothers have lost their lives.
00:05:37 They’ve given their lives because of not compromising.
00:05:41 They’re integrity-keepers.
00:05:43 And this is our lot in life.
00:05:44 It could mean this for any one of us.
00:05:46 But the fact is, that’s why we have an ear of discernment.
00:05:52 And now it goes on in verse 10 and says:
00:05:55 “This is where it calls for endurance and faith on the part of the holy ones.”
00:06:00 So it will take a tremendous amount of endurance,
00:06:03 not giving up hope in the face of an obstacle, and faith.
00:06:07 It’s this trust and conviction that whatever Jehovah God allows
00:06:12 will certainly, ultimately end up being
00:06:15 in our best interests at the end
00:06:18 —so faith,
00:06:20 courage,
00:06:22 endurance,
00:06:24 not compromising,
00:06:26 and always basing our decisions on Bible principles.
00:06:31 Now, John goes further in verse 11.
00:06:34 He identifies now another wild beast.
00:06:36 He identifies a beast. This one is a two-horned wild beast.
00:06:41 Notice that there in verse 11
00:06:44 that it’s the Anglo-American World Power.
00:06:46 That’s the two-horned wild beast.
00:06:48 Now, in verse 14, we have another beast.
00:06:52 This is the image of the wild beast, and that’s the United Nations.
00:06:56 The Anglo-American World Power: Look what it does there
00:07:00 in verse 14 and in verse 15.
00:07:03 It breathes life into the image.
00:07:06 So the Anglo-American World Power
00:07:08 breathes life into the image —the United Nations.
00:07:10 Why?
00:07:12 So that it can play a role in world history.
00:07:15 It can move and exist and act and play a role in world history.
00:07:19 And that’s exactly what we see happening today during the Lord’s day.
00:07:25 But now, in verse 16, there’s something again
00:07:27 that we need to discern and understand and have that ear of discernment.
00:07:30 Verse 16 says:
00:07:33 “It [again, the wild beast]
00:07:36 “puts under compulsion all people
00:07:39 “—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—
00:07:44 that these should be marked on their right hand or on their forehead.”
00:07:48 So now, we’re speaking about a mark
00:07:51 that the wild beast wants to give all of us —all people.
00:07:55 You see, this wild beast is used by the Devil
00:07:58 to maneuver the wild beast to promote intense suffering,
00:08:03 particularly on the part of Jehovah God’s people.
00:08:07 So a mark on the right hand is showing active support
00:08:10 —actively supporting the wild beast—
00:08:12 giving in to nationalism, worldly holidays, and so forth.
00:08:17 This is the mark of the beast.
00:08:19 The right hand is a symbol of action and active support.
00:08:23 And then notice even the forehead.
00:08:26 The mark on the forehead is public identity.
00:08:28 “This is who I support as well.”
00:08:31 It affects one’s thinking.
00:08:33 So the mark of the beast is something that, again, the Devil uses.
00:08:36 It’s a demonic mark.
00:08:38 So that one promotes suffering for those who do not have the mark.
00:08:43 Verse 17 says: “And that nobody can buy or sell
00:08:46 except a person having the mark, the name of the wild beast.”
00:08:50 Buying or selling
00:08:52 —you can imagine that demonic mark of the wild beast—
00:08:55 Anyone engaged in activities, normal activities such as buying or selling,
00:09:00 is pressured to do things the way the wild beast wants them to do it.
00:09:04 And again, whether it be holidays or supporting nationalism,
00:09:08 they’re expected to worship the wild beast
00:09:11 —let it rule their lives so as to receive its mark.
00:09:15 Those who refuse to receive the mark —Jehovah’s people today—
00:09:19 will have constant problems.
00:09:22 And this has been true for decades.
00:09:24 We’ve had to fight court battles because of not having the mark,
00:09:27 endure violent mobs because of not having the mark,
00:09:30 thrown into concentration camps, and endure lengthy imprisonments
00:09:34 because of not having the mark.
00:09:36 And in fact, in some countries, our brothers
00:09:38 literally are unable to buy or sell or even to obtain property.
00:09:44 And yet, in spite of it all, in spite of it all,
00:09:48 in spite of the pressure, look at true worship today.
00:09:51 Look at the way true worship is not just alive and well
00:09:54 but thriving and vibrant.
00:09:56 This is an outstanding demonstration of Jehovah’s power—his spiritual protection—
00:10:01 upon millions of his worshippers earth wide, integrity-keepers.
00:10:06 And this indisputably shows that true worship
00:10:09 will never be extinguished from the earth.
00:10:12 John too sees a great crowd that survived the great tribulation.
00:10:17 So we’re thrilled to be able to defend the truth
00:10:19 in spite of this type of persecution.
00:10:22 It’s our privilege to do so.
00:10:24 So it’s true,
00:10:27 Peter said that people will speak abusively of us.
00:10:31 That’s true.
00:10:32 We’re going to expect persecution; we expect reproach.
00:10:35 But in spite of it, we are determined
00:10:38 —determined not to compromise our faith,
00:10:41 not cower in fear, not tremble at men,
00:10:44 but continue to courageously magnify Jehovah God
00:10:49 right down to the end.

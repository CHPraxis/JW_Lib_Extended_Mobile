00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:06.723 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, at Matthew 5:11, Jesus said

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:10.026 line:10% position:50% align:center
people would ‘lyingly say

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:12.629 line:10% position:50% align:center
every wicked thing’

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
against lovers of truth.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:17.600 line:10% position:50% align:center
They lied about Jesus Christ.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spread lies
about first-century Christians.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spread lies about true worshippers.

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we should expect lies against us,

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
expect persecution, expect reproach.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:32.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what Jesus said would happen.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And especially during “the Lord’s day”
(which we are living in right now),

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
prophecies indicate that even at this time,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
reproach and persecution
would become clearly evident.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, let’s open our Bibles

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Revelation chapter 13

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how this applies in our day
—Revelation chapter 13.

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:58.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should expect and prepare for persecution.

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:02.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at Revelation 13:1,

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:06.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
it speaks about “a wild beast.”

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this wild beast
is Satan’s political creation

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the masses of mankind.

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:17.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s something about this wild beast
that we need to understand.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s now go to verse 3

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the wild beast,
or the political creation

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Satan the Devil.

00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:29.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 3, it says:

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All the earth [mankind]

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed the wild beast with admiration.”

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:38.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s admired.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what sense is this wild beast admired?

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:43.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s admired
because it endeavors to create

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
a higher standard of living
in various countries.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes advances in technology.

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tries to cure diseases.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:53.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it wins that admiration of people.

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, look at the wild beast.”

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s go beyond admiration.

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:01.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 4 what begins to happen:

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:05.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they worshipped the dragon
because it gave the authority

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the wild beast [there it is again],

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they worshipped [people worshipped]
the wild beast.”

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:15.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we go from admiration

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
to worship—worshipping the wild beast.

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in what respect? How is it worshipped?

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:25.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s worshipped when people say
love of country before love of God.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:29.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put love of country,
their devotion to nationalism,

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
before their love of Jehovah God

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:35.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so from admiration to worship.

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, notice in verse 7 what happens:

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was permitted to wage war
with the holy ones [true] and conquer them,

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was given
[now notice this] authority.”

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:53.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, the wild beast
‘was given authority over every tribe,

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:56.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
people, tongue, and nation.’

00:02:57.794 --> 00:02:59.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Authority worldwide

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
—authority given
over the worldwide system of rulership,

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
tribe, people, tongue, and nation.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now it uses its authority,
especially against Jehovah’s people,

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:14.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
to clamp down on the work
that Jehovah God has given us to do

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:16.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to try to ban our work and persecute us.

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the authority that they use
against God’s people.

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:23.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to be prepared for that.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, notice here in verse 8—

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any authority or any victory
they might have over God’s people

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the intense suffering,
yes, that we have to undergo

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of this authority),

00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:40.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, it’s going to be short-lived.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice in verse 8 why we say that.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:49.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Not one of their names

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:54.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[not one of their names, those in Satan’s
organization, not one of their names]

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:57.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been written in the scroll of life.”

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
So any apparent victory is short-lived

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:02.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
because no one
in Satan’s visible organization

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be
“written in the scroll of life.”

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only ones “written in the scroll of life”
here are those who rule with Jesus Christ.

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
So again, any apparent victory
that they might have over God’s people

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
is merely temporary.

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we go further in verse 9,

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now we have a warning.

00:04:24.981 --> 00:04:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 9 says:

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone has an ear,

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:33.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
let him hear.”

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean?

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, John now is giving direction
for us to have discernment.

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:43.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have an ear of discernment,
we have to hear; we have to listen.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:47.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? Because Jehovah God
is allowing the wild beast

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have this type of authority.

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s allowing the wild beast to operate.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s allowing the wild beast
to go to these lengths.

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to have discernment

00:04:56.346 --> 00:05:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and understand what this means in our life.

00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:02.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it mean?

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verse 10 says:

00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone is meant for captivity,
he will go into captivity.”

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:11.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s the persecution again.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us will go into captivity.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers are already in captivity.

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think about those in Russia or in Eritrea.

00:05:19.035 --> 00:05:20.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve been in captivity.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We go into captivity then.
We don’t compromise.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hold on to Bible principles.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little bit further, it goes on in verse 10:

00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:33.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone will kill with the sword,
he must be killed with the sword.”

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there it is again.

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our brothers have lost their lives.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve given their lives
because of not compromising.

00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re integrity-keepers.

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is our lot in life.

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:46.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could mean this for any one of us.

00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:50.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact is,
that’s why we have an ear of discernment.

00:05:52.135 --> 00:05:55.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now it goes on in verse 10 and says:

00:05:55.772 --> 00:06:00.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is where it calls for endurance
and faith on the part of the holy ones.”

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it will take
a tremendous amount of endurance,

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:07.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
not giving up hope
in the face of an obstacle, and faith.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s this trust and conviction
that whatever Jehovah God allows

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
will certainly, ultimately end up being

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our best interests at the end

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:20.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so faith,

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
courage,

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
endurance,

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:26.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
not compromising,

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and always basing our decisions
on Bible principles.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:34.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, John goes further in verse 11.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
He identifies now another wild beast.

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:41.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
He identifies a beast.
This one is a two-horned wild beast.

00:06:41.017 --> 00:06:44.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that there in verse 11

00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:46.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s the Anglo-American World Power.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the two-horned wild beast.

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in verse 14, we have another beast.

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:56.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the image of the wild beast,
and that’s the United Nations.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Anglo-American World Power:
Look what it does there

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 14 and in verse 15.

00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
It breathes life into the image.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Anglo-American World Power

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:10.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
breathes life into the image
—the United Nations.

00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:12.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:15.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that it can play a role in world history.

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can move and exist and act
and play a role in world history.

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what we see happening
today during the Lord’s day.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, in verse 16, there’s something again

00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:30.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to discern and understand
and have that ear of discernment.

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:33.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 16 says:

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:36.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It [again, the wild beast]

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:39.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“puts under compulsion all people

00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:44.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the small and the great, the rich
and the poor, the free and the slaves—

00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
that these should be marked
on their right hand or on their forehead.”

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:51.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, we’re speaking about a mark

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:55.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the wild beast wants to give all of us
—all people.

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:58.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, this wild beast is used by the Devil

00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maneuver the wild beast
to promote intense suffering,

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly on the part
of Jehovah God’s people.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a mark on the right hand
is showing active support

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actively supporting the wild beast—

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:17.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving in to nationalism,
worldly holidays, and so forth.

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the mark of the beast.

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:23.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
The right hand is a symbol
of action and active support.

00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:26.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then notice even the forehead.

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:28.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mark on the forehead is public identity.

00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:31.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is who I support as well.”

00:08:31.227 --> 00:08:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
It affects one’s thinking.

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the mark of the beast is something
that, again, the Devil uses.

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:38.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a demonic mark.

00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:43.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that one promotes suffering
for those who do not have the mark.

00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:46.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 17 says:
“And that nobody can buy or sell

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
except a person having the mark,
the name of the wild beast.”

00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Buying or selling

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you can imagine that demonic mark
of the wild beast—

00:08:55.351 --> 00:09:00.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone engaged in activities,
normal activities such as buying or selling,

00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:04.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
is pressured to do things the way
the wild beast wants them to do it.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, whether it be holidays
or supporting nationalism,

00:09:08.531 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re expected to worship the wild beast

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
—let it rule their lives
so as to receive its mark.

00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who refuse to receive the mark
—Jehovah’s people today—

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:22.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have constant problems.

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:24.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this has been true for decades.

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:27.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had to fight court battles
because of not having the mark,

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:30.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
endure violent mobs
because of not having the mark,

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:34.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
thrown into concentration camps,
and endure lengthy imprisonments

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of not having the mark.

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:38.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in fact, in some countries, our brothers

00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:43.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally are unable to buy or sell
or even to obtain property.

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:48.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, in spite of it all,
in spite of it all,

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of the pressure,
look at true worship today.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at the way true worship
is not just alive and well

00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:56.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
but thriving and vibrant.

00:09:56.646 --> 00:10:01.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is an outstanding demonstration
of Jehovah’s power—his spiritual protection—

00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
upon millions of his worshippers earth wide,
integrity-keepers.

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:09.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this indisputably shows that true worship

00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
will never be extinguished from the earth.

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:17.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
John too sees a great crowd
that survived the great tribulation.

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:19.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re thrilled to be able
to defend the truth

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:22.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spite of this type of persecution.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s our privilege to do so.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s true,

00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter said that people
will speak abusively of us.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:35.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to expect persecution;
we expect reproach.

00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in spite of it, we are determined

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
—determined not to compromise our faith,

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:44.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
not cower in fear, not tremble at men,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
but continue to courageously magnify
Jehovah God

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:51.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
right down to the end.

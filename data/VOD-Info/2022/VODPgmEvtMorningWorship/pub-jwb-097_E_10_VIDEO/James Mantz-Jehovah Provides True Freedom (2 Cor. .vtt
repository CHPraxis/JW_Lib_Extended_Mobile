Throughout history,

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:05.355 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
mankind has been in a constant struggle

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:06.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for freedom.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Men have fought for freedom of religion,

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
freedom of speech, freedom of the press,

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:15.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and freedom from bondage and slavery.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man’s perception of freedom

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is shaped by his environment,

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his personal situation,

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even his age.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While growing up, I remember the boys
in my neighborhood getting together 

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the final day of summer vacation 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy what we called
“our last day of freedom” baseball game.

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:42.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We called it that because school started
the next day.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this matter of freedom is not a game.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our view of freedom

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a matter of life and death.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what our personal feelings
or needs are regarding freedom,

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must recognize one fundamental fact.

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, there are
only two kinds of freedom:

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true freedom from Jehovah

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and false freedom

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:13.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is offered by Satan and his world.

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:16.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every person must make a choice

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between these two freedoms.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:22.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider what each
of these freedoms represents

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how our choice affects our prospect

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:27.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for eternal life.

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 7.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 13 and 14.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:37.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we read an illustration

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:40.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus gave in the Sermon on the Mount,

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:44.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the illustration he speaks
about two gates and two roads.

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this also relates

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the two freedoms
that we’re discussing this morning.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 7:13, 14

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he said:
“Go in through the narrow gate,

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because broad is the gate and spacious

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:03.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the road leading off into destruction,

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and many are going in through it;

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:08.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whereas narrow is the gate and cramped

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the road leading off into life,

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and few are finding it.”

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first glance, this “spacious” road

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:22.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may appear to be the road to true freedom.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:23.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s easy to travel.

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:29.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Travelers on this road
can go where they please,

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think as they please,
and live as they please.

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There aren’t any restrictions

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no rules, no commitments.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not surprising

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:42.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we realize
that one definition of “freedom”

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “the ability or capacity to act
without undue hindrance

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or restraint.”

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is the freedom

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan and his world have to offer.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it real freedom?

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:00.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Ephesians chapter 2.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 2 and 3.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture describes
the situation of people

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who choose to enter that broad gate

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then walk the spacious road.

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 2:2, 3

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes them this way:

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In which you at one time walked according

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the system of things of this world,

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the ruler
of the authority of the air,

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:29.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the spirit that is

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“now at work in the sons of disobedience.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, among them we all at one time

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“conducted ourselves in harmony
with the desires of our flesh,

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“carrying out the will of the flesh

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:47.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of our thoughts,
and we were naturally children of wrath

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:49.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as the rest.”

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that the ones
walking on this road

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:56.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not free at all?

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have a ruler,

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:02.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the ruler of the authority of the air,”
Satan the Devil.

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they also have a master.

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They carry out the will of the flesh;

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:12.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are slaves of the flesh and its desires.

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to 2 Peter chapter 2,

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:18.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 19.

00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words confirm

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan’s promise of freedom

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a false promise that results in slavery.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Peter 2:19 says:

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:34.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“While they are promising them freedom,

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they themselves are slaves of corruption;

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for if anyone is

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcome by someone, he is his slave.”

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s road is not the road of true freedom.

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:54.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, it’s not a freeway.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:57.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it’s a toll road,

00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the toll to walk on this road

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:02.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very heavy.

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:05.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This permissive, broad road takes its toll

00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:08.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sexually transmitted diseases,

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broken homes, bodies and minds

00:05:11.127 --> 00:05:15.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are sick with drug and alcohol abuse,

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and acts of violence.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This toll is way too expensive

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to walk on a dead-end street

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:28.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ends in destruction.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:32.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about the other road
that Jesus talked about?

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said ‘the gate is narrow’
and ‘the road is cramped.’

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do so few people
choose to walk this road?

00:05:41.157 --> 00:05:43.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Primarily because very few people today

00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
want God’s laws and principles
to govern their lives.

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, this road has boundaries,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those boundaries help
the ones who walk the road

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:56.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid wrongdoing,

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fight wrong desires,
to resist peer pressure

00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fear of ridicule that may come

00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of walking this road.

00:06:05.715 --> 00:06:09.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The broad road is centered on self

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:12.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—self-indulgence, self-awareness,

00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
self-fulfillment, and self-interest.

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:17.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast,

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this narrow road calls for self-control,

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:24.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
self-denial, hard work,

00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:27.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect for authority.

00:06:27.403 --> 00:06:32.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is the road to true freedom.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, some scriptures
that talk about the freedom

00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:39.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gives may appear to be
a little bit confusing.

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:43.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, let’s open
to 1 Peter chapter 2

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse16.

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:48.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read it, notice

00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:52.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the contrasting expressions in this scripture

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 2:16.

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:59.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Be as free people,

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“using your freedom,
not as a cover for doing wrong,

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:07.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as slaves of God.”

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How interesting that we can be free

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be a slave at the same time!

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For most people, the idea of becoming
a slave to anyone or anything

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:20.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not appealing.

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there are positive aspects

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being a slave.

00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:28.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider an example.

00:07:28.064 --> 00:07:31.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Israel, a man who fell into debt

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could sell himself as a slave
to pay off his debt,

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this wasn’t a permanent arrangement.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was to be freed after seven years

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:44.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in a Jubilee year, whichever came first.

00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:46.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While serving as a slave,

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:48.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was treated like a hired man;

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was protected from abuse.

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he was released,
his master gave him a gift

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help him get back on his feet.

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:01.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was Jehovah’s arrangement,

00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it gives us a glimpse of what it’s like

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a slave for Jehovah.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The life of an Israelite slave

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be so secure
that the slave could choose to remain

00:08:14.477 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his master for life.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This arrangement is described

00:08:19.215 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Exodus 21:5, 6, where it says:

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But if the slave should insist and say,

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I love my master, my wife, and my sons;

00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not want to be set free,’

00:08:31.327 --> 00:08:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“his master must bring him
before the true God.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he will bring him
up against the door or the doorpost,

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his master will pierce his ear
through with an awl,

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will be his slave for life.”

00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:48.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are like that slave.

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:50.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love for Jehovah

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our appreciation
for the true freedom he gives

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:58.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are so strong that we give our lives to him.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We identify ourselves as Jehovah’s slaves,

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not by getting our ears pierced,

00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by dedication and baptism.

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to freedom,
we all must make a choice.

00:09:12.268 --> 00:09:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we take the broad road
of false freedom

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered by Satan and his world?

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it’s literally a dead-end street.

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:25.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we take the narrow road
of true freedom?

00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That road is defined

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by God’s righteous standards,

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is the road
that leads to everlasting life.

00:09:35.258 --> 00:09:37.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even now, we’ve been freed

00:09:37.293 --> 00:09:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from fear of the future
and the superstitious fear of death.

00:09:40.596 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been freed from the pains
that result from a lifestyle

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ignores God’s standards.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The freedom that Jehovah provides

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will eventually give the human family

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:54.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the basic freedoms

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that honest-hearted people long for today

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—freedom from fear, freedom from crime,

00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:03.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
freedom from hunger, from poverty,

00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pollution, sickness, and war.

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we continue to walk on the road
of true freedom ourselves

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help others to find the true freedom

00:10:14.297 --> 00:10:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only Jehovah can give.

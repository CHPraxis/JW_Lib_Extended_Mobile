00:00:01 Our text this morning is taken from the article
00:00:04 “Why We ‘Keep Bearing Much Fruit.’”
00:00:09 And the article offered four major reasons
00:00:13 why you and I preach today.
00:00:18 The first reason given was to glorify Jehovah
00:00:22 and to sanctify his name before mankind.
00:00:27 The second reason given was
00:00:29 to show our heartfelt love
00:00:32 for Jehovah and for Jesus.
00:00:36 And the third reason given was
00:00:39 that we preach to give a warning.
00:00:43 And it was none of those three
00:00:45 that I was going to emphasize in my discussion today.
00:00:49 I wanted to talk about the fourth reason.
00:00:52 We preach because we love our neighbor
00:00:58 —we love our neighbor.
00:01:01 The Watchtower  study article made a very powerful point
00:01:06 that shows what’s involved
00:01:08 in showing our love for our neighbor this way.
00:01:13 Here’s what it stated:
00:01:16 “We are moved by such love to endure in this work,
00:01:21 “recognizing that people
00:01:23 “may have a change of heart
00:01:26 when their circumstances change.”
00:01:30 Now, what does this thought register in us?
00:01:33 It helps us to see why we should always be positive and enthusiastic
00:01:38 when it comes to sharing in the preaching work.
00:01:41 We don’t know what the person
00:01:44 to whom we are going to speak
00:01:47 is thinking at that particular visit.
00:01:51 The study article used an example
00:01:56 of a jailer at the time
00:01:58 that Paul and Silas were arrested in Philippi.
00:02:02 What happened while they were there in jail?
00:02:04 There was an earthquake and things shook.
00:02:07 And the jailer thought that all the prisoners
00:02:10 had been shaken out of their shackles
00:02:15 and that they were able to get out of there.
00:02:17 And so the account at Acts chapter 16,
00:02:22 verse 27 says
00:02:27 that the jailer feared that the prisoners had fled
00:02:32 “and was about to kill himself.”
00:02:36 “But Paul called out . . . : ‘Do not hurt yourself.’”
00:02:41 The distressed jailer asked:
00:02:46 “What must I do to get saved?”
00:02:49 And Paul and Silas told him:
00:02:52 “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will get saved.”
00:02:55 And we learn something from this.
00:02:59 Sometimes we can meet people
00:03:01 and because of their current circumstance,
00:03:05 we don’t get a listening ear.
00:03:08 But look at what happened to this jailer.
00:03:10 He was making sure everybody
00:03:13 was soundly bound in the jail.
00:03:17 But then when this earthquake came,
00:03:19 he had a change of thought
00:03:21 because of his change of circumstance.
00:03:26 So, what should we learn from this?
00:03:30 This can happen when it comes to our preaching activity too.
00:03:34 And that’s why in our midweek meetings,
00:03:37 we have all of these demonstrations
00:03:40 of how we can go about in our preaching work
00:03:43 to try to touch the hearts of people.
00:03:47 Now, some individuals did not respond
00:03:51 to the Bible’s message before
00:03:54 when we called on them before.
00:03:56 But they may have a change of heart and look for help
00:03:59 when their world is suddenly shaken
00:04:02 like this jailer’s world was shaken
00:04:06 when that earthquake took place.
00:04:08 So we never know when something like this
00:04:12 has happened in the lives of people.
00:04:15 And that’s why when we go,
00:04:17 we should always have that positive state of mind.
00:04:21 I’m reminded of an experience
00:04:24 that I heard some time ago:
00:04:27 The sister had been to a house in her territory a number of times.
00:04:31 And every time she returned,
00:04:33 this woman at the house was very rude.
00:04:39 But this day, she knocked on the woman’s door
00:04:43 and the same woman answered.
00:04:46 And here’s what the woman said to our sister,
00:04:50 “I’ve been waiting for you to return.”
00:04:52 The sister was shocked
00:04:55 to hear this woman who’d always been so rude
00:04:58 make such an expression.
00:05:01 And here’s what she said.
00:05:03 The woman said: “I had a relative in another part of the country call me.
00:05:08 “And that relative told me
00:05:11 “that if I would invite you in when you came,
00:05:15 “you would take my Bible and show me in my own Bible
00:05:19 “that hell is not a place of fire and torment.
00:05:23 I want you to show me that.”
00:05:27 And it resulted not only in showing
00:05:30 but also in a productive Bible study for this woman.
00:05:34 Now, what else could change
00:05:36 a person’s whole attitude toward us
00:05:41 in our preaching work?
00:05:44 They could have been diagnosed with a very serious illness.
00:05:49 Or they may be heartbroken over losing
00:05:52 a loved relative, or family member, in death.
00:05:57 When such events take place,
00:06:00 some distressed individuals
00:06:03 may ask us questions about the meaning of life.
00:06:07 And at one time, those were questions they ignored.
00:06:11 We might call at their door
00:06:14 or even be working on a job with them
00:06:17 when they have this negative experience in their life
00:06:21 —like the earthquake that the jailer experienced.
00:06:25 But it’s our love for people that moves us
00:06:29 to take advantage of the opportunities
00:06:32 that we have to help people
00:06:35 when they’re in the proper mood and attitude
00:06:39 for receiving the message.
00:06:43 This particular article that we’re studying today
00:06:46 mentioned a pioneer brother.
00:06:49 He had been a pioneer for some 34 years.
00:06:52 And here’s what the article quoted him as saying,
00:06:56 capturing this point that we’re making here this morning.
00:07:00 He said: “Today, more than ever,
00:07:04 many people feel emotionally low.”
00:07:09 So our objective is to keep preaching.
00:07:13 Jehovah brings forth the fruitage.
00:07:16 We are His and the angels’ fellow workers.
00:07:21 I put a little more emphasis on that point because we should always think of that.
00:07:26 We’re not ever in this service by ourselves.
00:07:29 Jehovah is interested in those people;
00:07:32 the angels are interested in those people.
00:07:35 And they know things about those people that we don’t know
00:07:39 because of their invisible presence
00:07:42 and their personal interest in mankind.
00:07:47 And so Jehovah brings forth the fruitage.
00:07:54 We are His and the angels’ fellow workers.
00:07:58 Another pioneer who has been pioneering over 30 years, Robert,
00:08:03 was quoted as saying, “To work along with angels who know
00:08:07 what is going on in the householders’ lives is exciting.”
00:08:12 Have you ever thought of that as you go forth into the preaching work,
00:08:16 that you have angelic company?
00:08:20 And those angels know what’s going on.
00:08:24 Back in 2008, we had an Awake!  article,
00:08:29 and the article was entitled
00:08:31 “Can the Problem of Crime Be Solved?”
00:08:35 That was February 2008.
00:08:40 And the book
00:08:45 Inside the Criminal Mind
00:08:48 was written by Dr. Stanton E. Samenow.
00:08:54 And in the article,
00:08:56 it told us to consider the example of a woman
00:09:00 who had been molested as a child.
00:09:03 She took up drugs;
00:09:05 she abused alcohol and used tobacco.
00:09:09 And at the time that the article was written,
00:09:12 she was serving a life sentence in prison.
00:09:19 But while in prison, she began to study with us.
00:09:23 See, that prison circumstance
00:09:26 changed her vantage point and her viewpoint.
00:09:30 Well, anyhow, she studied with us,
00:09:33 and she took to heart what she was learning.
00:09:38 And the article says: “Now she is no longer a slave
00:09:42 “to destructive thinking and vices.
00:09:46 “One of her favorite Bible texts
00:09:49 “is 2 Corinthians 3:17, which states:
00:09:53 “‘Now Jehovah is the Spirit;
00:09:56 “‘and where the spirit of Jehovah is,
00:09:59 there is freedom.’”
00:10:02 So we love the people out there.
00:10:06 That’s why we don’t give up in our efforts to help them
00:10:10 and that’s why we keep getting at our midweek meeting
00:10:13 this encouragement to keep preaching
00:10:16 and to have a positive attitude.
00:10:18 Because we don’t know
00:10:22 who or what kind of individual
00:10:26 we’re going to be talking to at each door.
00:10:30 And so we should always have that positive attitude.

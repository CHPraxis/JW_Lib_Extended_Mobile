00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:02.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
If we stop and think about this

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:03.987 line:10% position:50% align:center
scripture text for today,

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:05.488 line:10% position:50% align:center
it was taken from an article

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:07.624 line:10% position:50% align:center
that dealt with how to help couples

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:09.592 line:10% position:50% align:center
who are perhaps having difficulties

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:11.161 line:10% position:50% align:center
in their marriage to resolve them

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:13.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
and to move forward.

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.799 line:10% position:50% align:center
We contrast that with the world.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, in the world,
when they get married,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
they anticipate they’re going
to have problems and conflicts,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ve already mapped a route
for leaving the marriage if things are

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
too inconvenient for them
or are just not working for them.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s really because they don’t know
our God, Jehovah, do they?

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t know how he feels
and the depth of his feelings.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stop and consider marriage
and the institution of marriage

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he inaugurated back
in the garden of Eden,

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see a great contrast.

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not want marriage
just to be a contractual agreement,

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
something for convenience
or personal interest

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even just for procreation purposes.

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:00.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t want it to be a heavy burden.

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, at Genesis 2:24

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah did perform the first marriage, 

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:09.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
he didn’t say: ‘That is why a man
will leave his father and mother,

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will be stuck with each other
for the rest of their lives,’

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:17.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if committing them
to a life sentence or punishment.

00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:17.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:22.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we read Jehovah’s words
in this scripture,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hear in Jehovah
a great deal of affection

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even sentiment about the couple,
Adam and Eve, 

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:34.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he says: “That is why a man
will leave his father and mother

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:38.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will stick to his wife,

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:42.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will become one flesh.”

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, from this we learn about Jehovah

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:48.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
—truly, love being his dominant quality

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:50.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he conveyed that dominant quality

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his earthly creation,
humans made in his image.

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam and Eve had the capacity, then,
of developing such a love 

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
for one another
that they would literally cling

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
 to one another
—hold on to one another.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is an important aspect of marriage,

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:12.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially as imperfect people
living in “the time of the end”:

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:14.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to cling to one another

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to get through
the ‘tribulation of the flesh’

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:21.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other difficulties
that come upon married people today.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:26.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we see, though, in analyzing this

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we get to know our God, Jehovah,

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:32.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deep love that he himself has

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conveys to his people.

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the superlative example
of a man,

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you will—a person—

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
who clung to his wife.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why do we say that?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider how he viewed ancient Israel.

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:52.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles, please,
to the book of Isaiah

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:55.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 54 and verse 5.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read: “For your Grand Maker

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is as your husband,

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:07.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah of armies is his name.”

00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:12.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, true, we think
of the covenant that Jehovah initiated

00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:14.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his ancient people, Israel.

00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were bound together
in a covenant agreement.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was behind it?

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:23.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was love.

00:03:23.152 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made that clear to his people

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
when this contract

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:31.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this covenant—was inaugurated.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Deuteronomy 7:7, 8,

00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Jehovah through Moses said.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “It was not because you were
the most numerous of all the peoples

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah showed affection

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you and chose you,

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:54.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you were the smallest
of all the peoples.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:59.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, it was because
of Jehovah’s love for you

00:03:59.622 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because he kept the oath
that he had sworn to your forefathers.”

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love was behind this.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is what motivated Jehovah
to make a covenant with Abraham

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pass that on to Isaac, to Jacob,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to other faithful men,
like David later on.

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:22.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was love that moved him
to engage in this covenant.

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:26.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
He found someone that was
of the same mind and heart as him

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:28.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
who he could use to work out

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:32.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
his purpose on behalf of mankind.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave them his very best.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
He clung to them and looked after them.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how deeply it pained him

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
when his covenant people

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
—wife, if you will—

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
turned unfaithful to him and rejected him!

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s feelings are pure and deep.

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:02.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah felt truly betrayed

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:05.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deeply cut to the heart.

00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:08.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he really wanted to make this clear
to his people,

00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially the ten-tribe kingdom
who were so spiritually bankrupt

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:16.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they lost total sense
of what Jehovah was all about.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
So before he pronounced judgment upon them,

00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:22.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
he made very clear to them just how he felt

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
about them and what they had done to him.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did he do that?

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
He commissioned his prophet Hosea

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a very difficult assignment.

00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:35.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hosea

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
in chapter 1,

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice right away what Hosea was to do

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 1 and verse 2.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “When Jehovah started
to speak his word through Hosea,

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:51.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah said to Hosea:

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:54.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go, marry a woman of prostitution

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:56.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and have children of prostitution,

00:05:56.806 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because by prostitution the land

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
has turned completely away
from following Jehovah.’”

00:06:01.978 --> 00:06:04.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine getting that assignment?

00:06:05.248 --> 00:06:08.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you are a virgin
—never been married before—

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re told now to go marry someone
that you know

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be unfaithful to you.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:16.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah did that.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:19.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to show in a very real way

00:06:19.862 --> 00:06:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this hardhearted people

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:24.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
just what his feelings were and what

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was going through in dealing with them.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a drama, not of actors,
but of real-life people.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can just imagine those in the village
of Hosea and what they were thinking.

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is this prophet of God,
and here this woman was just cheating on him

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and treating him very, very badly.

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:50.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anybody with any kind of spiritual sense
would have been cut to the heart.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah reached out to those
who were cut to the heart

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he said,
‘This land is going to be destroyed;

00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:01.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to be exiles,
but I’m going to call you back.’

00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:03.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Hosea 3:1 says:

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:06.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jehovah said to me:
‘Go once again, love the woman

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘who is loved by another man
and is committing adultery,

00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
while they turn to other gods
and love raisin cakes.’”

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:18.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved them.

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:22.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those that loved him,
after exile, returned

00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:27.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went back to Jerusalem
to continue worshipping God there.

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:30.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, when we consider
the history of Israel,

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:34.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel, or know, that Jehovah definitely had

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
a legal right to just do away with them.

00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he didn’t.

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:40.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:42.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because there were things to be considered.

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:48.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a great deal
riding on this relationship.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was working out his purpose
on behalf of mankind.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Messiah was going to come
through this nation.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
So despite all the immorality

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the people of Israel committed
by going to the nations

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worshipping Baals and whatnot

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all this unfaithfulness—Jehovah said,
‘I’m going to take her back

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue working with her.’

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, there was a limit to this.

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Jesus came to the earth,
we know that Jehovah

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
had reached his limit with his people,

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when they put
his only-begotten Son to death.

00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can see the remorse
and the pain of heart

00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had
was perfectly reflected in Jesus.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:36.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 19:41, 42,

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:40.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
here it says:
“When [Jesus, that is, when] he got nearby

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, to Jerusalem], he viewed the city

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and wept over it, saying:

00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:48.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you, even you,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘had discerned on this day
the things having to do with peace

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:54.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but now they have been hidden
from your eyes.’”

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was too late—too far gone.

00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:01.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
The relationship—the marriage—
was going to come to an end,

00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:03.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it hurt deeply.

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:08.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, in understanding
the marriage relationship

00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:12.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah uses
this relationship in a very real way,

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:14.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can understand Jehovah better.

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:18.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get to know how deeply he feels

00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:20.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
about mankind,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he treasures mankind,

00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:26.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also how he treasures his purpose

00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
in wanting to help people.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:31.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
He feels for those who
are going through ‘tribulation in the flesh,’

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he especially feels deeply

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those whose mates have proven unfaithful.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows completely the emotions
—the gamut of emotions—

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
that such ones go through.

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:47.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he is there to help them
work through this

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making appropriate decisions
that are good for them.

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:56.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oftentimes, with such ones,
we see how Jehovah has blessed them

00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:58.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
with new assignments and, yes,

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
even a new mate that loves Jehovah.

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re off faithfully serving
their God together,

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:07.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
easing their pain.

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:10.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by imitating God’s love
—cultivating God’s love—

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our marriages and understanding marriage,

00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:15.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
we understand Jehovah better.

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:19.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not want any of us
to view marriage or any assignment

00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:23.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something that is a life sentence,
a drudgery, or a burden.

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:26.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but through love,

00:10:26.108 --> 00:10:30.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are able to cultivate our marriages
and have a life

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
—whatever situation we are in—

00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:35.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would truly bring us joy and happiness.

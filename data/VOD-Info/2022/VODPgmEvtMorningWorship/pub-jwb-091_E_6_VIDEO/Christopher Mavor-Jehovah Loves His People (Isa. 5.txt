00:00:01 If we stop and think about this
00:00:02 scripture text for today,
00:00:03 it was taken from an article
00:00:05 that dealt with how to help couples
00:00:07 who are perhaps having difficulties
00:00:09 in their marriage to resolve them
00:00:11 and to move forward.
00:00:13 We contrast that with the world.
00:00:15 You know, in the world, when they get married,
00:00:17 they anticipate they’re going to have problems and conflicts,
00:00:20 and they’ve already mapped a route for leaving the marriage if things are
00:00:25 too inconvenient for them or are just not working for them.
00:00:29 And that’s really because they don’t know our God, Jehovah, do they?
00:00:33 They don’t know how he feels and the depth of his feelings.
00:00:37 When we stop and consider marriage and the institution of marriage
00:00:41 that he inaugurated back in the garden of Eden,
00:00:44 we see a great contrast.
00:00:47 He did not want marriage just to be a contractual agreement,
00:00:51 something for convenience or personal interest
00:00:55 or even just for procreation purposes.
00:00:57 He didn’t want it to be a heavy burden.
00:01:00 For instance, at Genesis 2:24
00:01:02 when Jehovah did perform the first marriage,
00:01:05 he didn’t say: ‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother,
00:01:09 and they will be stuck with each other for the rest of their lives,’
00:01:12 as if committing them to a life sentence or punishment.
00:01:17 No.
00:01:17 But when we read Jehovah’s words in this scripture,
00:01:22 we hear in Jehovah a great deal of affection
00:01:26 and even sentiment about the couple, Adam and Eve,
00:01:30 when he says: “That is why a man will leave his father and mother
00:01:34 “and he will stick to his wife,
00:01:38 and they will become one flesh.”
00:01:42 You see, from this we learn about Jehovah
00:01:44 —truly, love being his dominant quality
00:01:48 and how he conveyed that dominant quality
00:01:50 to his earthly creation, humans made in his image.
00:01:55 Adam and Eve had the capacity, then, of developing such a love
00:01:59 for one another that they would literally cling
00:02:02  to one another —hold on to one another.
00:02:06 And this is an important aspect of marriage,
00:02:09 especially as imperfect people living in “the time of the end”:
00:02:12 We have to cling to one another
00:02:14 in order to get through the ‘tribulation of the flesh’
00:02:17 and other difficulties that come upon married people today.
00:02:22 So we see, though, in analyzing this
00:02:26 that we get to know our God, Jehovah,
00:02:28 and the deep love that he himself has
00:02:32 and conveys to his people.
00:02:35 Jehovah is the superlative example of a man,
00:02:39 if you will—a person—
00:02:41 who clung to his wife.
00:02:45 And why do we say that?
00:02:47 Consider how he viewed ancient Israel.
00:02:49 Open your Bibles, please, to the book of Isaiah
00:02:52 chapter 54 and verse 5.
00:02:57 Here we read: “For your Grand Maker
00:03:00 “is as your husband,
00:03:03 Jehovah of armies is his name.”
00:03:07 Now, true, we think of the covenant that Jehovah initiated
00:03:12 with his ancient people, Israel.
00:03:14 They were bound together in a covenant agreement.
00:03:17 But what was behind it?
00:03:21 It was love.
00:03:23 Jehovah made that clear to his people
00:03:26 when this contract
00:03:28 —this covenant—was inaugurated.
00:03:31 At Deuteronomy 7:7, 8,
00:03:39 notice what Jehovah through Moses said.
00:03:42 It says: “It was not because you were the most numerous of all the peoples
00:03:46 “that Jehovah showed affection
00:03:48 “for you and chose you,
00:03:51 “for you were the smallest of all the peoples.
00:03:54 “Rather, it was because of Jehovah’s love for you
00:03:59 and because he kept the oath that he had sworn to your forefathers.”
00:04:05 Love was behind this.
00:04:07 Love is what motivated Jehovah to make a covenant with Abraham
00:04:12 and pass that on to Isaac, to Jacob,
00:04:14 and to other faithful men, like David later on.
00:04:17 It was love that moved him to engage in this covenant.
00:04:22 He found someone that was of the same mind and heart as him
00:04:26 who he could use to work out
00:04:28 his purpose on behalf of mankind.
00:04:32 Jehovah gave them his very best.
00:04:37 He clung to them and looked after them.
00:04:42 And how deeply it pained him
00:04:45 when his covenant people
00:04:48 —wife, if you will—
00:04:51 turned unfaithful to him and rejected him!
00:04:54 Jehovah’s feelings are pure and deep.
00:04:58 So Jehovah felt truly betrayed
00:05:02 and deeply cut to the heart.
00:05:05 Now, he really wanted to make this clear to his people,
00:05:08 especially the ten-tribe kingdom who were so spiritually bankrupt
00:05:12 that they lost total sense of what Jehovah was all about.
00:05:16 So before he pronounced judgment upon them,
00:05:20 he made very clear to them just how he felt
00:05:22 about them and what they had done to him.
00:05:24 And how did he do that?
00:05:27 He commissioned his prophet Hosea
00:05:30 with a very difficult assignment.
00:05:33 Turn with me, please, to the book of Hosea
00:05:35 in chapter 1,
00:05:38 and notice right away what Hosea was to do
00:05:42 —chapter 1 and verse 2.
00:05:44 It says: “When Jehovah started to speak his word through Hosea,
00:05:48 “Jehovah said to Hosea:
00:05:51 “‘Go, marry a woman of prostitution
00:05:54 “‘and have children of prostitution,
00:05:56 “‘because by prostitution the land
00:05:59 has turned completely away from following Jehovah.’”
00:06:01 Can you imagine getting that assignment?
00:06:05 Here you are a virgin —never been married before—
00:06:08 and you’re told now to go marry someone that you know
00:06:10 is going to be unfaithful to you.
00:06:14 And Jehovah did that.
00:06:16 He wanted to show in a very real way
00:06:19 to this hardhearted people
00:06:22 just what his feelings were and what
00:06:24 he was going through in dealing with them.
00:06:30 This was a drama, not of actors, but of real-life people.
00:06:34 We can just imagine those in the village of Hosea and what they were thinking.
00:06:38 Here is this prophet of God, and here this woman was just cheating on him
00:06:43 and treating him very, very badly.
00:06:46 Anybody with any kind of spiritual sense would have been cut to the heart.
00:06:50 Jehovah reached out to those who were cut to the heart
00:06:54 because he said, ‘This land is going to be destroyed;
00:06:57 you’re going to be exiles, but I’m going to call you back.’
00:07:01 And Hosea 3:1 says:
00:07:03 “Then Jehovah said to me: ‘Go once again, love the woman
00:07:06 “‘who is loved by another man and is committing adultery,
00:07:09 “‘just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel
00:07:13 while they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.’”
00:07:16 Jehovah loved them.
00:07:19 And those that loved him, after exile, returned
00:07:22 and went back to Jerusalem to continue worshipping God there.
00:07:28 Certainly, when we consider the history of Israel,
00:07:30 we feel, or know, that Jehovah definitely had
00:07:34 a legal right to just do away with them.
00:07:37 But he didn’t.
00:07:39 Why?
00:07:40 Because there were things to be considered.
00:07:44 There was a great deal riding on this relationship.
00:07:48 He was working out his purpose on behalf of mankind.
00:07:50 The Messiah was going to come through this nation.
00:07:54 So despite all the immorality
00:07:58 that the people of Israel committed by going to the nations
00:08:01 and worshipping Baals and whatnot
00:08:03 —all this unfaithfulness—Jehovah said, ‘I’m going to take her back
00:08:07 and continue working with her.’
00:08:11 However, there was a limit to this.
00:08:16 And when Jesus came to the earth, we know that Jehovah
00:08:19 had reached his limit with his people,
00:08:21 especially when they put his only-begotten Son to death.
00:08:24 And we can see the remorse and the pain of heart
00:08:27 that Jehovah had was perfectly reflected in Jesus.
00:08:32 At Luke 19:41, 42,
00:08:36 here it says: “When [Jesus, that is, when] he got nearby
00:08:40 “[that is, to Jerusalem], he viewed the city
00:08:42 “and wept over it, saying:
00:08:45 “‘If you, even you,
00:08:48 “‘had discerned on this day the things having to do with peace
00:08:51 —but now they have been hidden from your eyes.’”
00:08:54 It was too late—too far gone.
00:08:58 The relationship—the marriage— was going to come to an end,
00:09:01 and it hurt deeply.
00:09:05 You see, in understanding the marriage relationship
00:09:08 and how Jehovah uses this relationship in a very real way,
00:09:12 we can understand Jehovah better.
00:09:14 We get to know how deeply he feels
00:09:18 about mankind,
00:09:20 how he treasures mankind,
00:09:23 and also how he treasures his purpose
00:09:26 in wanting to help people.
00:09:28 He feels for those who are going through ‘tribulation in the flesh,’
00:09:31 and he especially feels deeply
00:09:34 for those whose mates have proven unfaithful.
00:09:37 Jehovah knows completely the emotions —the gamut of emotions—
00:09:41 that such ones go through.
00:09:43 And he is there to help them work through this
00:09:47 in making appropriate decisions that are good for them.
00:09:52 Oftentimes, with such ones, we see how Jehovah has blessed them
00:09:56 with new assignments and, yes,
00:09:58 even a new mate that loves Jehovah.
00:10:01 And they’re off faithfully serving their God together,
00:10:04 easing their pain.
00:10:07 So by imitating God’s love —cultivating God’s love—
00:10:10 in our marriages and understanding marriage,
00:10:12 we understand Jehovah better.
00:10:15 He does not want any of us to view marriage or any assignment
00:10:19 as something that is a life sentence, a drudgery, or a burden.
00:10:23 No, but through love,
00:10:26 we are able to cultivate our marriages and have a life
00:10:30 —whatever situation we are in—
00:10:32 that would truly bring us joy and happiness.

00:00:01 This morning, we’re going to discuss the thought
00:00:04 of keeping “the belt of truth”
00:00:06 tight around our waists.
00:00:09 Now, why is that so important?
00:00:11 Well, we see in the world today
00:00:13 there’s just no end to the misinformation,
00:00:16 the lies, the falsehoods that are being spread.
00:00:21 But in addition to that, as Jehovah’s people
00:00:24 we face all sorts of verbal attacks, don’t we?
00:00:28 People accuse us of horrific things,
00:00:31 and this can be very discouraging.
00:00:34 So that’s why we need to make sure
00:00:36 that we’ve got “the belt of truth”
00:00:38 firmly around our waist—tight.
00:00:41 But how can we tighten it?
00:00:44 Well, of course, there are many different ways
00:00:46 that we can reassure ourselves of the truth.
00:00:50 But this morning, I thought we might talk about just one thing that may help us,
00:00:54 and that is to go back to the basics.
00:00:58 From time to time, think about this question,
00:01:01 What was it that convinced me or my family
00:01:06 that this is the truth?
00:01:08 And if we meditate on that,
00:01:11 it can help to strengthen our resolve
00:01:14 to continue in the truth.
00:01:16 And in this way, figuratively speaking, it’s as if we tighten the belt.
00:01:20 And we all know, those of us who wear belts,
00:01:23 you need a tight belt for it to be effective.
00:01:26 Now, with that in mind, if you ever visit me in my office,
00:01:30 you’ll notice that I have two things
00:01:32 that from time to time I’ll look at.
00:01:35 One is this publication.
00:01:39 Now, when you look at it, you might say the same as my wife did a few days ago:
00:01:44 “Don’t you have a better copy of that edition?
00:01:46 It’s not really looking so good.”
00:01:49 So why is this in my collection of books in the office?
00:01:53 Well, because this is the book, “Let God Be True,”
00:01:56 that my mother started studying in 1956
00:01:59 when she was contacted in the door-to-door work.
00:02:03 Now, I have a connection to this because at that time I was 18 months old.
00:02:07 And as you can see in the front,
00:02:11 I had no potential whatsoever
00:02:14 of being in the Writing Department or the Art Department.
00:02:17 But I guess it did prove that at an early age,
00:02:19 I was interested in books.
00:02:22 Anyway, this book is close to my heart
00:02:25 because it helped my mother
00:02:27 at a time when she faced some opposition.
00:02:30 She’d just started using this book
00:02:33 when a minister from the Methodist Church and a missionary
00:02:37 came along to her house to try to force her
00:02:40 to stop studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:43 Now, what did they do?
00:02:45 Well, they berated the Witnesses.
00:02:48 They said all sorts of falsehoods.
00:02:50 And they said everything they could
00:02:52 that was negative about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:56 Once they left, my mother said that she felt
00:02:58 very discouraged and disheartened
00:03:01 after being the victim of this verbal abuse.
00:03:05 So, what did she do?
00:03:07 She took her King James Bible
00:03:10 and turned to a scripture
00:03:12 that she had just studied in paragraph 5
00:03:16 of this book in the first chapter.
00:03:18 Maybe you’d like to read it with me, if you would.
00:03:21 If you have an electronic device,
00:03:23 you have an advantage this morning because I’d like you to turn
00:03:26 to the book of Isaiah 8:20.
00:03:30 But I’d like you to read it from the King James Version.
00:03:35 So Isaiah 8:20
00:03:38 —and if you tap on verse 20,
00:03:40 you’ll see that the King James Version  may come up.
00:03:44 It says: “To the law and to the testimony:
00:03:47 “if they speak not according to this word,
00:03:50 it is  because there is  no light in them.”
00:03:55 Now, that touched her heart
00:03:57 and helped her to make the decision to continue studying.
00:04:02 Now, if you’re like me, you are probably trying to work out:
00:04:05 ‘What is “the testimony”? What’s this all about?’
00:04:09 But if you look at the revised text
00:04:11 of the New World Translation  in verse 20, it helps us, doesn’t it?
00:04:14 There, it says: “Instead, they should inquire of the law
00:04:19 “and of the written confirmation!
00:04:22 When they do not speak according to this word, they have no light.”
00:04:28 So she realized that these two who had come to visit her
00:04:32 did not show her anything from the Scriptures.
00:04:35 Rather, they just said what they felt
00:04:38 about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:40 So that helped her because she realized,
00:04:43 as the “Let God Be True”  book says in chapter 1,
00:04:46 that everything we believe about God
00:04:49 needs to be based on the Word of God, the Bible
00:04:54 —in other words, written confirmation.
00:04:58 So that’s the first lesson—the first point that is a good reminder to me personally.
00:05:02 No matter what people say about us,
00:05:05 no matter what negative comments are made,
00:05:09 we can always take comfort in the thought
00:05:12 that our beliefs are solidly based on the Bible.
00:05:18 Now, the second thing that you might notice in my office
00:05:22 is this Watchtower  magazine.
00:05:25 It’s from February 15, 1955.
00:05:29 So if I’m not in my office and you see it, you may think,
00:05:31 ‘Ah, he’s got that there because he was born
00:05:35 just a couple of weeks after this.’
00:05:38 No, that’s not the reason it’s there.
00:05:41 The reason is that this was the second thing that helped my mother
00:05:45 to take a stand for the truth.
00:05:47 There were two beautiful articles in this Watchtower.
00:05:51 The first one was entitled
00:05:53 “Only One Right Religion.”
00:05:57 And notice how it starts off:
00:05:59 “If you pay for wheat will you settle for straw?
00:06:04 “If you buy wine will you accept water?
00:06:07 “Or if you thirst for water will you be satisfied with mud?
00:06:12 “What if someone came to prove
00:06:14 “that you were being defrauded in these ways?
00:06:17 Would you be angry with him or with the one who was cheating you?”
00:06:22 What a great start to the article!
00:06:24 And then it went on to show how the truth of God’s Word
00:06:28 is being taught by Jehovah’s people today.
00:06:31 But there’s a second scripture
00:06:33 that was in this magazine that really helped my mother.
00:06:36 So if you’d like, turn with me to the book of Jeremiah
00:06:41 —Jeremiah chapter 23.
00:06:44 Now, in the context of this,
00:06:47 we’re going to read verses 28 and 29.
00:06:50 But in the previous verses, it mentions false prophets
00:06:54 —those who tell lies, who are dreaming,
00:06:59 and who try to explain their dreams.
00:07:02 And verse 27 says that these are the same ones who teach people
00:07:06 or ‘intend to make them forget my name.’
00:07:10 So, what do verses 28 and 29 say?
00:07:14 “Let the prophet who has a dream relate the dream,
00:07:18 “but the one who has my word
00:07:22 “should speak my word truthfully.
00:07:24 ‘What does the straw have in common with the grain?’ declares Jehovah.”
00:07:29 Do you see how the Watchtower  article was tied in there about grain and straw?
00:07:34 But the point is that we need to speak God’s Word truthfully.
00:07:40 Now, the second article in this magazine, which is equally good,
00:07:45 helps persons to see the need to select the true religion;
00:07:49 it is “Choosing the One Right Religion.”
00:07:54 In this article, it raises the point that sometimes people will say:
00:07:58 ‘Well, I just don’t have time to investigate all the religions in the world.
00:08:03 ‘How can I find the truth?
00:08:06 It’s just like trying to find a needle in a haystack.’
00:08:10 Well, this magazine, building on what was said in Jeremiah, said,
00:08:15 ‘Well, if you go to a haystack looking for a needle,
00:08:18 you don’t have to look at every straw in the haystack.’
00:08:22 Actually, they recommend quite a radical move,
00:08:24 ‘Burn the haystack, and then with a magnet, you can find the needle.’
00:08:28 Now, what’s the point?
00:08:30 Well, as it goes on to say, you see, as Jeremiah said,
00:08:34 ‘God’s Word is like a fire.’
00:08:36 You see, in verse 29, it says it’s like a fire that consumes the rubbish.
00:08:40 So we don’t have to go around investigating
00:08:43 all the various teachings of different religions.
00:08:46 That would be like a huge haystack.
00:08:49 But rather, when we study the Bible
00:08:51 and we see the pure truth in the Scriptures,
00:08:55 then we can identify anything
00:08:57 that’s virtually rubbish or straw.
00:09:00 And we have the real thing.
00:09:02 Yes, that helps to really convince us that we have the truth.
00:09:07 Because if people don’t even know Jehovah’s name,
00:09:11 why would we believe them?
00:09:13 And if they believe that people are going to hellfire,
00:09:17 why would we believe everything that they say
00:09:19 —particularly if they’re criticizing Jehovah’s people?
00:09:24 So, what about you?
00:09:26 What was it that convinced you
00:09:29 that you found the truth?
00:09:31 Well, it’s good from time to time to think about that question.
00:09:35 In my case, I think of those things that my mother taught me.
00:09:40 The first one from the book of Isaiah:
00:09:42 to make sure that what we believe is based on the Bible.
00:09:47 And then the second thing: We don’t have to investigate
00:09:50 every story that’s told to us.
00:09:53 Once we have the truth from the Bible,
00:09:55 we can recognize what’s right and what’s wrong.
00:09:59 Yes, we don’t need to listen to the “father of the lie,”
00:10:03 but we certainly believe in “the God of truth.”

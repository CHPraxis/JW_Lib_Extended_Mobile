00:00:01 The Watchtower  under consideration today
00:00:04 was entitled “‘Your Deliverance
00:00:06 Is Getting Near’!”
00:00:08 And that’s the theme
00:00:10 from which our day’s text
00:00:11 and comments were taken.
00:00:13 And I’m sure you,
00:00:15 like me, “rejoice in the hope.”
00:00:17 You rejoice to think about the blessings
00:00:20 that will come right after the great tribulation and Armageddon.
00:00:24 How encouraging to know that the world,
00:00:27 which to many seems out of control, is soon nearing its end!
00:00:32 The grand finale is close.
00:00:35 How close?
00:00:37 Well, we all recall the stirring concluding talk
00:00:40 at this year’s regional convention.
00:00:42 It summed it up in one word—imminent.
00:00:46 The day and the hour for the judgment against this system of things
00:00:50 has been on Jehovah’s calendar for years.
00:00:54 It’s established.
00:00:56 And as Habakkuk’s prophecy indicates,
00:00:58 there is a “rushing toward” that day.
00:01:02 “It will not be late!”
00:01:04 Well, how does our day’s text today
00:01:06 from Revelation 6:15 help us
00:01:09 to understand details about that fast-approaching great tribulation?
00:01:14 And then how can that advance knowledge
00:01:17 help us to be prepared for what is coming?
00:01:20 Well, I invite you to open up your Bible with me
00:01:23 to read the context found in Revelation chapter 6.
00:01:26 We want to read verses 15-17 together.
00:01:31 And keep in mind, as has been commented on,
00:01:34 that what we’re going to read now in Scripture
00:01:37 takes place right after
00:01:41 the great tribulation begins
00:01:43 and right after false religion has been destroyed.
00:01:47 The question is, How will the majority of mankind respond
00:01:52 to what’s coming next, and why?
00:01:54 Let’s read it together. Revelation 6:15-17:
00:01:59 “Then the kings of the earth, the high officials,
00:02:02 “the military commanders, the rich, the strong,
00:02:06 “every slave, and every free person
00:02:09 “hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
00:02:13 “And they keep saying to the mountains and to the rocks:
00:02:16 “‘Fall over us and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne
00:02:21 “‘and from the wrath of the Lamb,
00:02:23 “‘because the great day of their wrath has come,
00:02:26 and who is able to stand?’”
00:02:31 Did you notice where the majority will turn for refuge?
00:02:36 It’s amazing to think that even after the world empire of false religion
00:02:41 has been completely destroyed,
00:02:43 the majority of people will continue to trust
00:02:46 in human organizations.
00:02:48 At that late hour, after the great tribulation has started
00:02:52 and before Armageddon has begun, the Bible does not indicate
00:02:56 that there is going to be any mass conversion of people
00:02:59 running to Jehovah’s mountain.
00:03:02 At that moment, political and commercial institutions
00:03:06 that will still be standing for a time
00:03:09 will appear to the majority to be rock solid,
00:03:14 like mountains and caves.
00:03:18 Verse 15 outlines the all-inclusive list
00:03:22 of those who will continue to be completely deceived
00:03:26 by Satan the Devil.
00:03:27 Think of it:
00:03:29 All of them, including former adherents
00:03:32 of false religion or the nonreligious,
00:03:37 will go right back to their comfort zone,
00:03:40 looking for protection and salvation from human organizations.
00:03:45 Will their comfort zone be a safe zone?
00:03:49 No.
00:03:50 Notice how the Revelation Climax  book
00:03:52 described this passage of Scripture.
00:03:55 I quote: “Neither caves in the literal mountains
00:03:58 “nor symbolic mountainlike political and commercial organizations
00:04:02 “will provide financial security or any other kind of help.
00:04:06 Nothing will shelter them from Jehovah’s wrath.”
00:04:10 Indeed, exciting
00:04:13 and sobering times are rushing toward us.
00:04:17 Well, how does this advance information,
00:04:20 this inspired message from God,
00:04:23 help us prepare for that coming day?
00:04:26 The Watchtower  under consideration
00:04:28 encouraged us to think about what lies ahead
00:04:32 and described this time period
00:04:34 as a time of judgment and testing.
00:04:37 Of course, when I thought about that future time of testing,
00:04:41 I thought to myself, ‘Today is a time of test, isn’t it?’
00:04:44 Our brothers and sisters, unlike at any other time in history,
00:04:49 are facing failing economies, natural disasters,
00:04:53 health problems, untimely death,
00:04:56 war, persecution.
00:04:59 All of our brothers and sisters are facing a time of test right now.
00:05:04 Even armed raids at Bethel and at Kingdom Halls
00:05:08 are not uncommon today.
00:05:12 Yet, we have not yet entered the great tribulation.
00:05:16 It’s very likely that life will get even more difficult
00:05:20 in the near future.
00:05:22 So it’s good for us to think now:
00:05:24 ‘What do I view as my comfort zone?
00:05:28 ‘Is my trust and confidence, even in little ways,
00:05:32 ‘in material things
00:05:34 ‘or in the assets I have in this system of things?
00:05:39 ‘Does my response to difficulties and challenges today,
00:05:44 ‘even before the great tribulation breaks out,
00:05:46 ‘reveal that Jehovah is my Rock
00:05:48 and not any human institution?’
00:05:51 You know, sadly, some of our brothers and sisters
00:05:54 have been affected by the deception
00:05:57 that there is such a thing as material security.
00:06:01 In 2013, an elder
00:06:04 (his experience was published in the magazine)
00:06:08 said this
00:06:10 — I thought we could relate— those of us who are in full-time service.
00:06:13 He said: “I’m normally very thrifty.
00:06:15 If I pour out a little too much shampoo, I put some back in the bottle.”
00:06:21 Nevertheless, this elder, Alex,
00:06:23 got caught up in trading in the stock market,
00:06:26 thinking he could soon quit his job and enter the pioneer service.
00:06:30 Well, he was well-motivated.
00:06:32 But Alex became ever more engrossed
00:06:35 in studying offerings and the market reports.
00:06:39 Using his savings and money that he borrowed from brokers,
00:06:42 he bought stocks that the analysts
00:06:45 —the experts— predicted would rise in value suddenly.
00:06:49 Instead, they dropped in value.
00:06:52 How did Alex respond?
00:06:54 He said: “I was determined to get my money back.
00:06:56 I felt that if I just held on, the stocks would come back up.”
00:07:02 Can you imagine how Alex was feeling emotionally
00:07:06 for months, waiting for the stocks to go up in value?
00:07:11 Alex found it difficult to focus on spiritual matters.
00:07:14 He lost sleep.
00:07:15 The stocks, as you can imagine, never rebounded.
00:07:19 As a result, Alex lost his savings and he had to sell his house.
00:07:24 He admits, “I caused great pain to my family.”
00:07:28 But notice the powerful conclusion
00:07:31 through a tough experience that he related.
00:07:34 He says, “I now know that anyone
00:07:37 “who puts his trust in Satan’s system
00:07:39 will be profoundly disappointed.”
00:07:43 It’s a good reminder for all of us, isn’t it?
00:07:45 Things in this system of things —human organizations
00:07:49 (whatever source, political or commercial),
00:07:54 institutions of higher education—
00:07:57 cannot provide salvation now nor in the future.
00:08:02 Notice how Proverbs 11:28
00:08:05 harmonizes with the point that Alex made.
00:08:09 Proverbs 11:28:
00:08:13 “The one trusting in his riches will fall,
00:08:17 but the righteous will flourish like the foliage.”
00:08:21 What’s the point?
00:08:23 Resting even a little bit of confidence
00:08:27 or hope on our savings,
00:08:30 perhaps our investments,
00:08:33 or our ability to earn money
00:08:35 in this system of things
00:08:37 amounts to resting our confidence in Satan the Devil.
00:08:42 It’s a comfort zone that is not safe.
00:08:47 No wonder then that the faithful slave has urged us
00:08:50 —all of us, including those of us in full-time service
00:08:53 who perhaps have made a life of sacrifice
00:08:57 to put Kingdom interests first—
00:08:59 to think seriously about the question,
00:09:01 “Am I ready to give up material things?”
00:09:04 Knowing where we run for comfort today
00:09:09 —even when there are little difficulties in our life or challenging circumstances—
00:09:13 gives us a good indication of where we’re going to run
00:09:16 in the future when things get more difficult.
00:09:20 Of course, Jehovah does not want us to face the future with fear.
00:09:23 He wants us to face the future
00:09:26 with confidence—and we can.
00:09:29 Our knowledge of what the near future holds,
00:09:32 the details of how the great tribulation will unfold,
00:09:36 and the instability of this dying system of things convinces us
00:09:41 that there is no comfort zone
00:09:44 in this system of things.
00:09:46 There’s no safer comfort zone
00:09:48 than in trusting in Jehovah day after day.
00:09:53 So may this reminder serve to encourage us
00:09:56 to continue to work diligently to store up “treasures in heaven”
00:09:59 —treasures that will never fail;
00:10:01 treasures that will continue through the great tribulation,
00:10:04 after Armageddon,
00:10:06 and safely lead us into the real life.
00:10:11 It’s even as the apostle Paul was inspired to write to Timothy.
00:10:15 May we continue to put our hope
00:10:17 “not on uncertain riches, but on God,”
00:10:20 who richly provides
00:10:23 for us all today and forever,
00:10:26 even during the great tribulation.
00:10:28 Yes, doing so will convince us
00:10:31 that our “deliverance is getting near,”
00:10:34 and we have nothing to fear.

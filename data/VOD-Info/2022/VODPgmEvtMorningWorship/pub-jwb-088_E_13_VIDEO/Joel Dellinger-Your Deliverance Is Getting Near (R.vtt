The <i>Watchtower</i>  under consideration today

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:06.690 line:10% position:50% align:center
was entitled “‘Your Deliverance

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.692 line:10% position:50% align:center
Is Getting Near’!”

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:10.126 line:10% position:50% align:center
And that’s the theme

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:11.494 line:10% position:50% align:center
from which our day’s text

00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:13.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
and comments were taken.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
And I’m sure you,

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:17.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
like me, “rejoice in the hope.”

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
You rejoice to think about the blessings

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:24.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will come right after
the great tribulation and Armageddon.

00:00:24.974 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
How encouraging to know that the world,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
which to many seems out of control,
is soon nearing its end!

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
The grand finale is close.

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
How close?

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we all recall
the stirring concluding talk

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this year’s regional convention.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
It summed it up in one word—imminent.

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day and the hour for the judgment
against this system of things

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:54.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been on Jehovah’s calendar for years.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s established.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Habakkuk’s prophecy indicates,

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a “rushing toward” that day.

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:04.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not be late!”

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does our day’s text today

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:09.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Revelation 6:15 help us

00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:14.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand details about
that fast-approaching great tribulation?

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then how can that advance knowledge

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to be prepared for what is coming?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I invite you
to open up your Bible with me

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read the context
found in Revelation chapter 6.

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:31.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to read verses 15-17 together.

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:34.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
And keep in mind, as has been commented on,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what we’re going to read
now in Scripture

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
takes place right after

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
the great tribulation begins

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and right after
false religion has been destroyed.

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:52.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is,
How will the majority of mankind respond

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what’s coming next, and why?

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it together.
Revelation 6:15-17:

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:02.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the kings
of the earth, the high officials,

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the military commanders,
the rich, the strong,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“every slave, and every free person

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:13.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“hid in the caves
and among the rocks of the mountains.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they keep saying
to the mountains and to the rocks:

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Fall over us and hide us
from the face of the One seated on the throne

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and from the wrath of the Lamb,

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because the great day
of their wrath has come,

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who is able to stand?’”

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
where the majority will turn for refuge?

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:41.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing to think that even after
the world empire of false religion

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been completely destroyed,

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
the majority of people will continue to trust

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
in human organizations.

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that late hour,
after the great tribulation has started

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:56.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before Armageddon has begun,
the Bible does not indicate

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is going to be
any mass conversion of people

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
running to Jehovah’s mountain.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:06.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment,
political and commercial institutions

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will still be standing for a time

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:14.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
will appear to the majority to be rock solid,

00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:16.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
like mountains and caves.

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 15 outlines the all-inclusive list

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:26.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who will continue
to be completely deceived

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:27.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Satan the Devil.

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of it:

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:32.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of them, including former adherents

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
of false religion or the nonreligious,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
will go right back to their comfort zone,

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:45.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for protection and salvation
from human organizations.

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:49.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will their comfort zone be a safe zone?

00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:50.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the <i>Revelation Climax</i>  book

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
described this passage of Scripture.

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:58.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I quote:
“Neither caves in the literal mountains

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor symbolic mountainlike political
and commercial organizations

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:06.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will provide financial security
or any other kind of help.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing will shelter them
from Jehovah’s wrath.”

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, exciting

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sobering times
are rushing toward us.

00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does this advance information,

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
this inspired message from God,

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us prepare for that coming day? 

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:28.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  under consideration

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:32.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
encouraged us to think
about what lies ahead

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:34.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and described this time period

00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a time of judgment and testing.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:41.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, when I thought
about that future time of testing,

00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:44.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought to myself,
‘Today is a time of test, isn’t it?’

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:49.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters,
unlike at any other time in history,

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing failing economies,
natural disasters,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
health problems, untimely death,

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
war, persecution.

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:04.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of our brothers and sisters
are facing a time of test right now.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even armed raids at Bethel
and at Kingdom Halls

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not uncommon today.

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:16.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we have not yet entered
the great tribulation.

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very likely that life
will get even more difficult

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the near future.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s good for us to think now:

00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do I view as my comfort zone?

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:32.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is my trust and confidence,
even in little ways,

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:34.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘in material things

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘or in the assets I have
in this system of things?

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does my response
to difficulties and challenges today,

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘even before
the great tribulation breaks out,

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘reveal that Jehovah is my Rock

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not any human institution?’

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:54.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, sadly,
some of our brothers and sisters

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been affected by the deception

00:05:57.573 --> 00:06:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is such a thing
as material security.

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2013, an elder

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:08.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
(his experience
was published in the magazine)

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:10.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
said this

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:13.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
— I thought we could relate—
those of us who are in full-time service.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I’m normally very thrifty.

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I pour out a little too much shampoo,
I put some back in the bottle.”

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, this elder, Alex,

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
got caught up in trading in the stock market,

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking he could soon quit his job
and enter the pioneer service.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he was well-motivated.

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Alex became ever more engrossed

00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:39.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
in studying offerings and the market reports.

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:42.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using his savings and money
that he borrowed from brokers,

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
he bought stocks that the analysts

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the experts—
predicted would rise in value suddenly.

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:52.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they dropped in value.

00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Alex respond?

00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:56.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I was determined
to get my money back.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:01.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that if I just held on,
the stocks would come back up.”

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:06.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine how Alex
was feeling emotionally

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:11.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
for months, waiting
for the stocks to go up in value?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alex found it difficult
to focus on spiritual matters.

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:15.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lost sleep.

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:19.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stocks, as you can imagine,
never rebounded.

00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:24.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, Alex lost his savings
and he had to sell his house.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
He admits, “I caused
great pain to my family.”

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice the powerful conclusion

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:34.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
through a tough experience that he related.

00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says, “I now know that anyone

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who puts his trust in Satan’s system

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:43.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be profoundly disappointed.”

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a good reminder for all of us, isn’t it?

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:49.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things in this system of things
—human organizations

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:54.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
(whatever source, political or commercial),

00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:57.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
institutions of higher education—

00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot provide salvation
now nor in the future.

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:05.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Proverbs 11:28

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:09.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
harmonizes with the point that Alex made.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 11:28:

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one trusting in his riches will fall,

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:21.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the righteous
will flourish like the foliage.”

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:23.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Resting even a little bit of confidence

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
or hope on our savings,

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:33.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps our investments,

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our ability to earn money

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this system of things

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:42.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
amounts to resting
our confidence in Satan the Devil.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:47.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a comfort zone that is not safe.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder then
that the faithful slave has urged us

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of us, including
those of us in full-time service

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:57.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
who perhaps have made a life of sacrifice

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:59.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put Kingdom interests first—

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think seriously about the question,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Am I ready to give up material things?”

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing where we run for comfort today

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:13.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even when there are little difficulties
in our life or challenging circumstances—

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us a good indication
of where we’re going to run

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the future
when things get more difficult.

00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah does not want us
to face the future with fear.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us to face the future

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:29.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
with confidence—and we can.

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our knowledge
of what the near future holds,

00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:36.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
the details
of how the great tribulation will unfold,

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:41.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the instability of this dying system
of things convinces us

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is no comfort zone

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this system of things.

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:48.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no safer comfort zone

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:53.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
than in trusting in Jehovah day after day.

00:09:53.042 --> 00:09:56.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may this reminder serve to encourage us

00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to work diligently
to store up “treasures in heaven”

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:01.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
—treasures that will never fail;

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
treasures that will continue
through the great tribulation,

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Armageddon,

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and safely lead us into the real life.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:15.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s even as the apostle Paul
was inspired to write to Timothy.

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:17.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we continue to put our hope

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:20.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not on uncertain riches, but on God,”

00:10:20.603 --> 00:10:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
who richly provides

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us all today and forever,

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:28.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
even during the great tribulation.

00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, doing so will convince us

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our “deliverance is getting near,”

00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have nothing to fear.

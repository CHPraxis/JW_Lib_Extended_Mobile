00:00:13 The Bible book of Daniel
00:00:15 is filled with imagery,
00:00:18 visions,
00:00:21 and amazing scenery and architecture.
00:00:25 All of it serves
00:00:26 to teach readers about the times we live in now
00:00:30 and how we can faithfully serve Jehovah.
00:00:33 The team that made
00:00:34 Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith
00:00:37 had to portray these amazing things on film.
00:00:40 How did they do it?
00:00:44 Early concept art
00:00:46 was made to help in the development
00:00:49 of the many visual effects scenes.
00:01:02 The architecture and aesthetics of Babylon
00:01:05 were quite different
00:01:07 from what the Israelites were used to.
00:01:10 The sets needed to be designed in a way
00:01:13 that helped convey what it was like to be captured
00:01:20 and brought to a foreign land.
00:01:25 The production design and sets
00:01:28 and props departments built 360-degree sets,
00:01:32 which made for an immersive environment.
00:01:40 All of the other wise men are unable to make the interpretation known to me.
00:01:46 But you are able to do so.
00:01:59 Many costumes and props
00:02:02 were carefully handmade for the production.
00:02:08 Spearheads were hand-forged.
00:02:15 Most of the filming was done
00:02:17 at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.
00:02:26 Some additional scenes were filmed in nearby locations
00:02:32 and in Florida.
00:02:35 You need to rest.
00:02:42 Several miniature sets were built,
00:02:44 including a ziggurat,
00:02:50 and then actors were filmed in front of a green screen
00:02:53 and inserted into the final shots.
00:02:59 As filming was completed, scenes were edited together
00:03:04 and the visual-effects team
00:03:05 went to work on many specialized shots.
00:03:14 Digital models of people and animals
00:03:17 were animated and combined
00:03:19 with footage of real environments
00:03:21 to make scenes
00:03:22 that would have been impossible to film otherwise.
00:03:26 For example,
00:03:28 a digital model was made of the immense image
00:03:30 in King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.
00:03:34 The team researched the characteristics
00:03:36 of the actual materials described in the Scriptures,
00:03:39 such as metals and rocks,
00:03:43 so that when the image falls,
00:03:45 it appears realistic and believable.
00:04:03 Just look at the results of thousands of hours
00:04:06 spent modeling,
00:04:08 animating, simulating,
00:04:11 rendering, and compositing!
00:04:31 Music and sound effects add the final touches.
00:04:47 “What do you see?”
00:04:50 Jehovah asked the prophet Amos.
00:04:55 What Amos saw taught him important lessons.
00:05:01 In the drama Daniel: A Lifetime of Faith,
00:05:06 what did you see?
00:05:11 And more important, what did you learn?

There is a God in the heavens

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is a Revealer of secrets,

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:08.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has made known

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is to happen

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the final part of the days.

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:19.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
The divine dream

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Daniel interprets
for King Nebuchadnezzar

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:24.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
constitutes a prophecy

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
crucial for the lasting peace of mankind.

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows the course of history
centuries, even millenniums, in advance.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the toes of the feet

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the kingdom will be partly strong

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and partly fragile.

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
History has shown us how every type

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
of human government imaginable has failed.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only Jehovah who has the ability

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guide humans to real, lasting peace.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has led his people in the past.

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when he prophesies

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:09.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’ll lead his people to real,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
lasting peace in the future,

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:16.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace we seek
is certain under God’s Kingdom.

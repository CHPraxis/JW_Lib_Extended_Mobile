00:00:02 There is a God in the heavens
00:00:04 who is a Revealer of secrets,
00:00:07 and he has made known
00:00:08 to King Nebuchadnezzar
00:00:10 what is to happen
00:00:11 in the final part of the days.
00:00:17 The divine dream
00:00:19 that Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar
00:00:22 constitutes a prophecy
00:00:24 crucial for the lasting peace of mankind.
00:00:28 Jehovah knows the course of history centuries, even millenniums, in advance.
00:00:33 And as the toes of the feet
00:00:36 were partly of iron and partly of clay,
00:00:38 so the kingdom will be partly strong
00:00:41 and partly fragile.
00:00:47 History has shown us how every type
00:00:50 of human government imaginable has failed.
00:00:54 It’s only Jehovah who has the ability
00:00:56 to guide humans to real, lasting peace.
00:01:02 He has led his people in the past.
00:01:05 So when he prophesies
00:01:07 that he’ll lead his people to real,
00:01:09 lasting peace in the future,
00:01:12 this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!
00:01:16 The peace we seek is certain under God’s Kingdom.

Other sheep Jesus has,
and they serve alongside

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:15.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
those anointed to be
Christ’s heavenly bride.

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:21.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the things that are done
for their comfort and aid

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are things he considers
that must be repaid.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, you comforted me
in my hunger and thirst,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and whatever my need,
you came to me first.”

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Tell us, when did we do this?”
these ones will reply.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
The King will then answer them,
telling them why:

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:09.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you comforted them,
you comforted me.

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:16.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you did it for them,
you did it for me.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your labors for them
were your labors for me.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You did it for them;
you did it for me.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:40.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did it for them,
you did it for me.”

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’ve been loyal to me,
doing works that are fine,

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you preach alongside
these brothers of mine.”

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the King will then say
to the sheep on his right:

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Inherit the earth
and perfection of life.”

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you comforted them,
you comforted me.

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:29.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you did it for them,
you did it for me.

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:37.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your labors for them
were your labors for me.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You did it for them;
you did it for me.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:53.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did it for them,
you did it for me.”

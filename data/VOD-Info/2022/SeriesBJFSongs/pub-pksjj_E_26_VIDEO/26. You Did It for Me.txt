00:00:01 Other sheep Jesus has, and they serve alongside
00:00:07 those anointed to be Christ’s heavenly bride.
00:00:15 All the things that are done for their comfort and aid
00:00:21 Are things he considers that must be repaid.
00:00:31 “Yes, you comforted me in my hunger and thirst,
00:00:37 and whatever my need, you came to me first.”
00:00:45 “Tell us, when did we do this?” these ones will reply.
00:00:51 The King will then answer them, telling them why:
00:00:59 “If you comforted them, you comforted me.
00:01:09 “If you did it for them, you did it for me.
00:01:16 “Your labors for them were your labors for me.
00:01:24 “You did it for them; you did it for me.
00:01:32 If you did it for them, you did it for me.”
00:01:43 “You’ve been loyal to me, doing works that are fine,
00:01:50 as you preach alongside these brothers of mine.”
00:01:57 So the King will then say to the sheep on his right:
00:02:04 “Inherit the earth and perfection of life.”
00:02:12 “If you comforted them, you comforted me.
00:02:21 “If you did it for them, you did it for me.
00:02:29 “Your labors for them were your labors for me.
00:02:37 “You did it for them; you did it for me.
00:02:45 If you did it for them, you did it for me.”

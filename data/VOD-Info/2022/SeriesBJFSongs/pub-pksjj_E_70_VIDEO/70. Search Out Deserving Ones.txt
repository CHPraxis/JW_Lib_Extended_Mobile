00:00:14 In preaching the Kingdom and teaching the truth,
00:00:20 Our Lord showed us how to proceed:
00:00:26 ‘Search out those deserving and ready to hear,
00:00:32 ‘Those aware of their spiritual need.
00:00:38 ‘By greeting the household and wishing it peace,
00:00:44 ‘Then it may be that peace you’ll impart.
00:00:50 ‘But when they refuse you or turn you away,
00:00:56 Shake the dust from your feet and depart.’
00:01:16 All those who receive you receive him as well,
00:01:22 Respond when their heart opens wide.
00:01:27 Their right disposition for unending life
00:01:33 Will impel them to serve at your side.
00:01:40 And never be anxious about what to say,
00:01:45 For Jehovah will help you to speak.
00:01:51 Your answer when gracious and seasoned with salt
00:01:57 Will appeal to the humble and meek.

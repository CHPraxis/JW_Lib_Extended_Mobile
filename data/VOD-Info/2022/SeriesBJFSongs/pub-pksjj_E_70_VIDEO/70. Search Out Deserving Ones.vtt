In preaching the Kingdom
and teaching the truth,

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Lord showed us
how to proceed:

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Search out those deserving
and ready to hear,

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Those aware
of their spiritual need.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘By greeting the household
and wishing it peace,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Then it may be
that peace you’ll impart.

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But when they refuse you
or turn you away,

00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:02.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shake the dust
from your feet and depart.’

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
All those who receive you
receive him as well,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Respond when their heart
opens wide.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their right disposition
for unending life

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will impel them
to serve at your side.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
And never be anxious
about what to say,

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Jehovah
will help you to speak.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:57.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your answer when gracious
and seasoned with salt

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will appeal
to the humble and meek.

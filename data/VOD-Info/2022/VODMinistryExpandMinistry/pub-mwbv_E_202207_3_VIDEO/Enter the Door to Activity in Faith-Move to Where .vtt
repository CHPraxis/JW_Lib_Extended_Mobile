If you had told me two years ago that I’d 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be moving to where the need was greater,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would have laughed.

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:16.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started when they announced
a special preaching campaign.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Samuel
encouraged me to apply with him.

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, 

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, but you enjoy that.

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re going to love it.

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:30.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I got you a form as well,
all right?

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:31.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do this!

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do more,
but I was comfortable.

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:46.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to examine my heart.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I read about Abraham’s faith
at Hebrews 11:8,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like the words jumped off the page.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He went out although

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not knowing where he was going.”

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:11.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who better to be in control
of my life than Jehovah?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A door was opened to me.

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just needed to go through it.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do it, man.

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:31.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the campaign were incredible!

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the experience pushed me
out of my comfort zone.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Gabriel is going to try some food.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try, try, try!

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:48.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on, go on, give it a try, Gabriel!

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good, yeah—really good!

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the ministry in a new way,
and I wanted to do more.

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I calculated the cost

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked with my 

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:20.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local elders to write to the branch office.

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:37.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed about it
and did research before choosing.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many unknowns,

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:46.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t wait!

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was ready for whatever
Jehovah had in store for me.

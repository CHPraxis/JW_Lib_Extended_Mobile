00:00:13 All over the world as Jehovah’s people,
00:00:15 we preach to all who will listen
00:00:18 and we receive loving support
00:00:20 from our congregations.
00:00:22 But how is the global preaching work organized?
00:00:26 How do congregations stay united
00:00:29 around the world?
00:00:32 The Service Committee of the Governing Body oversees these tasks.
00:00:36 Their responsibilities
00:00:38 are to oversee the preaching work,
00:00:41 to oversee congregation organization,
00:00:44 and to oversee the Hospital Liaison Committee arrangement.
00:00:50 First, consider how the Service Committee supports you in the preaching work.
00:00:59 Coordinating the worldwide preaching work
00:01:02 is an awesome privilege
00:01:04 for the Service Committee,
00:01:05 but we know that it was Jesus who gave the commission
00:01:09 to “go, . . . and make disciples of people of all the nations.”
00:01:14 And so we recognize that Jesus is the one in charge.
00:01:19 A real effort is made
00:01:21 to provide assistance
00:01:23 so that our brothers and sisters, wherever they are,
00:01:27 can effectively fulfill their personal ministry.
00:01:32 For example, in recent years, we’ve seen the introduction
00:01:34 of special metropolitan public witnessing,
00:01:37 prison witnessing,
00:01:40 harbor witnessing,
00:01:43 and reaching out to displaced individuals —for example, individuals in refugee camps.
00:01:50 And depending on our schedule or our circumstances,
00:01:54 opportunities to witness informally
00:01:56 may present the best way
00:01:59 that we can fulfill our personal ministry.
00:02:05 Well over 3,000 new disciples
00:02:08 are being baptized every week.
00:02:10 And the preaching work is being done in 239 lands
00:02:14 around the globe.
00:02:18 The Service Committee works
00:02:19 under the direction of the Governing Body.
00:02:23 We send significant matters
00:02:25 to the Governing Body for direction.
00:02:28 An example is the establishing of the Teaching Toolbox.
00:02:33 The Service Committee
00:02:34 gives very close attention
00:02:35 to what publications would be considered
00:02:38 as basic tools for the ministry.
00:02:40 And because there are relatively few of those, all of us
00:02:44 can become very well-acquainted with them.
00:02:47 And thus we’re able to become very effective in the ministry in preaching the good news
00:02:52 and in starting and conducting productive Bible studies.
00:02:57 A number of you are moving
00:02:58 to serve where the need is greater.
00:03:01 Many of you are simplifying your life
00:03:03 and, in some cases, a number of you
00:03:06 are learning and adapting to new cultures.
00:03:09 Many thousands have entered into the pioneer service.
00:03:14 Now, this opens up other avenues of service, such as serving where the need is greater,
00:03:18 serving on construction projects,
00:03:21 and even entering into special full-time service.
00:03:25 A special full-time servant does not mean
00:03:28 that they themselves are special.
00:03:30 What is special
00:03:32 is the assignment they receive.
00:03:34 Those in special full-time service
00:03:36 might be assigned to serve as a special pioneer or as a field missionary
00:03:40 or in the circuit work.
00:03:44 We need you young brothers and sisters to set spiritual goals:
00:03:49 to go to SKE,
00:03:51 (for you young brothers) to qualify to be ministerial servants and elders,
00:03:55 and (you sisters) to want to be pioneers and missionaries
00:03:59 to drive the work ahead worldwide.
00:04:03 Brothers and sisters, when we see your love for the preaching work,
00:04:07 it is so heartwarming for us.
00:04:09 No matter what your circumstances,
00:04:11 you’re doing your best to share the good news.
00:04:22 First Corinthians 14:33, 40
00:04:27 tells us that Jehovah wants things to be done ‘orderly’
00:04:32 and “by arrangement.”
00:04:34 The Scriptures confirm that the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization
00:04:38 is well-organized.
00:04:42 The earthly part must be as well.
00:04:46 Our motto is,
00:04:48 “Fast on principles and slow on rules.”
00:04:54 By holding to what is written in the Scriptures,
00:04:57 we uphold Jehovah’s thinking,
00:05:00 knowing that we’re imperfect
00:05:02 —not infallible.
00:05:06 As the Bible clearly says,
00:05:09 we are not ‘the masters over others’ faith.’
00:05:16 Our brothers and sisters are under much pressure these days.
00:05:19 There’s the spirit of the world,
00:05:21 there are health problems,
00:05:23 there’s persecution, and there are disasters.
00:05:26 But the elders are there
00:05:29 with the brothers and sisters, encouraging them
00:05:31 and keeping the congregations clean.
00:05:34 We love you dear elders and circuit overseers
00:05:39 and respect you for the heavy load you carry.
00:05:47 We have congregations in over 200 lands
00:05:50 and in hundreds of languages,
00:05:52 so providing spiritual food in the form of theocratic direction
00:05:57 that meets the needs of the brothers and sisters worldwide
00:06:00 is not an easy task.
00:06:02 So we’re in communication with the branch offices
00:06:05 in over 80 lands.
00:06:07 Those brothers on the Branch Committees are like eyes and ears
00:06:12 to the Governing Body and, as a result, we know what the needs are.
00:06:17 The Service Committee sends out theocratic direction
00:06:21 by means of the Service Departments in all the branch offices.
00:06:26 As soon as the Service Departments get that information,
00:06:28 they begin translating it,
00:06:30 and then they ensure that it’s distributed
00:06:32 to some 7,000 circuit overseers
00:06:35 and over 700,000 elders worldwide.
00:06:40 That means that that announcement
00:06:42 or that information will then reach your congregation.
00:06:48 Like Jesus did with his disciples,
00:06:50 we want to do everything we can to help you
00:06:54 to carry out your personal ministry
00:06:57 to the best of your abilities and, of course, circumstances.
00:07:03 When making headquarters visits or shepherding visits to the branches,
00:07:07 I keep in mind that I’m visiting Jehovah’s sheep
00:07:11 and that they have to be cared for and fed.
00:07:14 It’s very similar to the excitement
00:07:17 that’s generated when congregations have the visit of their circuit overseer.
00:07:20 That same excitement is generated, albeit on a larger scale,
00:07:24 when representatives come to the branches.
00:07:29 It allows for that personal interaction
00:07:32 where you can correspond with the branches to give them the encouragement they need
00:07:35 with things that they may need assistance with.
00:07:38 It has a tremendous unifying effect.
00:07:43 We love you dear brothers for your self-sacrificing spirit
00:07:47 and the hard work that you do.
00:07:50 We know that you’re doing Jehovah’s work,
00:07:52 and we know that it’s not always easy.
00:07:55 Wherever we go in the world,
00:07:58 we see the love that you brothers and sisters have
00:08:01 for Jehovah and for the preaching work.
00:08:04 And when we see what you’re willing to do for Jehovah, it warms our hearts
00:08:08 and encourages us to keep going.
00:08:15 The work of the Hospital Liaison Committees
00:08:18 is something that is very precious.
00:08:22 When we need help,
00:08:25 Jehovah’s organization is there to provide it.
00:08:28 To help us become
00:08:30 better acquainted
00:08:30 with the Hospital Liaison Committee arrangement,
00:08:33 we should all take a look at the video
00:08:35 A Loving Provision for Times of Distress.
00:08:40 There’s nothing more frightening than learning that we have a serious disease
00:08:45 or learning that a loved one has been in a serious accident.
00:08:48 Jehovah has given us the HLC arrangement
00:08:52 to provide the comfort, the encouragement, and the strength
00:08:55 that we need at those difficult times.
00:08:59 We cherish our privilege to preach and worship together.
00:09:04 In this divided world, our peace, love, and unity
00:09:09 are a modern-day miracle.
00:09:12 With Jehovah’s blessing, we are confident
00:09:15 that the preaching work will continue to advance
00:09:18 and that the congregations will “be made firm in the faith.”

00:00:01 Welcome!
00:00:03 We have many updates to share.
00:00:06 Of course, the world’s attention
00:00:09 has been fixed on events
00:00:11 in Russia and Ukraine.
00:00:13 As Jehovah’s people, we are not surprised by such events.
00:00:18 We’re well aware that Russia and its allies
00:00:22 fill the role described in Daniel chapter 11
00:00:25 as “the king of the north.”
00:00:28 When the Governing Body first made this identification
00:00:31 at the annual meeting in 2018,
00:00:34 we mentioned that the king of the north
00:00:37 had already taken possession of Crimea.
00:00:41 When reading Daniel chapter 11,
00:00:44 it’s not surprising to see that the king of the north
00:00:47 is interested in other territories.
00:00:51 Certainly, this is the time
00:00:53 to keep on the watch continually
00:00:57 and to maintain our Christian neutrality!
00:01:02 As of February 28, we have no deaths,
00:01:06 but we have one reported injury among our brothers in Ukraine.
00:01:10 Dozens of their homes have been damaged.
00:01:13 Thousands of our brothers have fled areas of military conflict.
00:01:18 We’re keeping you dear brothers and sisters
00:01:21 in Ukraine and Russia in our prayers.
00:01:25 At the same time, we’re doing everything possible
00:01:29 to be sure that you’ll have the needed spiritual food
00:01:33 as well as the necessities of life.
00:01:37 With regard to legal matters, during the week of February 21,
00:01:42 we had three significant court decisions.
00:01:46 On February 22, a court in Ust-Abakan
00:01:50 ruled to grant parole and release
00:01:54 to 70-year-old Valentina Baranovskaya.
00:01:58 Sister Baranovskaya has been in prison
00:02:02 for the past 12 months.
00:02:04 The prosecutor has until March 4 to appeal.
00:02:08 If there is no appeal,
00:02:10 then she could be released as early as March 5.
00:02:15 Please keep dear Sister Baranovskaya in your prayers.
00:02:21 On February 22, 2022, the European Court of Human Rights
00:02:26 issued two significant judgments
00:02:29 concerning our brothers in Russia.
00:02:32 The cases involved searches and police detention
00:02:36 affecting various brothers from 2010 to 2012.
00:02:41 The court ruled in our favor and awarded damages
00:02:45 to the 15 brothers and sisters who were involved in these cases.
00:02:50 In total, the government of Russia
00:02:53 will be required to pay nearly 100,000 euros.
00:02:58 The court noted that the public ministry
00:03:01 of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:03:03 is a fundamental right
00:03:06 that “a public authority”
00:03:08 should not interfere with.
00:03:10 In many countries,
00:03:12 the number of COVID-19 cases is dropping.
00:03:17 Some governments are starting to relax or eliminate various restrictions.
00:03:23 We hope that conditions will allow us to resume
00:03:27 more of our theocratic activities in person.
00:03:31 Yet, we want to maintain our cautious approach.
00:03:35 The Governing Body has directed Branch Committees
00:03:39 to monitor the situation in each part of their branch territory.
00:03:44 Each Branch Committee may initiate
00:03:47 or expand the pilot program
00:03:50 for in-person meetings when it can be done safely.
00:03:56 Will it be possible to hold an in-person Memorial
00:04:00 for your congregation this year?
00:04:03 Only time will tell.
00:04:07 In any case, this may be a good time for all of us
00:04:11 to consider how we view our congregation meetings.
00:04:16 If we can return to the Kingdom Hall,
00:04:19 will we be ready to do so?
00:04:22 Think about how we reason with our Bible students
00:04:26 on the importance of attending meetings
00:04:29 in lesson 10 of the Enjoy Life Forever!  book.
00:04:33 There it says:
00:04:35 “Effort is required to attend meetings.
00:04:39 “Consider the example of Jesus’ family.
00:04:43 “To attend a yearly event, they had to walk
00:04:46 “some 60 miles (100 km)
00:04:51 “through mountainous terrain
00:04:53 from Nazareth to Jerusalem.”
00:04:57 Then the book asks this question:
00:04:59 “Why might you have to put forth effort
00:05:03 to attend meetings?”
00:05:05 No doubt that soul-searching question
00:05:07 has prompted some Bible students to begin to attend meetings.
00:05:12 But maybe that’s a question that we’ll all have to think about.
00:05:17 Going back to in-person meetings will take some effort on our part.
00:05:22 But, of course, we have to think about the blessings
00:05:26 that come from in-person association with our brothers and sisters.
00:05:31 We can just imagine
00:05:33 how much Joseph and Mary and their children
00:05:37 enjoyed being in person in Jerusalem
00:05:40 when the city was filled with fellow worshippers of Jehovah!
00:05:45 No doubt the joy from being there
00:05:48 helped Joseph and Mary realize
00:05:51 that it was truly worth the effort.
00:05:55 Likewise, our joy in being at the Kingdom Hall
00:05:59 with our dear brothers and sisters
00:06:01 will far outweigh any initial inconvenience.
00:06:07 Until we can return to the Kingdom Hall,
00:06:10 we appreciate the fine effort that you dear brothers and sisters make
00:06:15 to attend the meetings on Zoom.
00:06:18 By connecting early and staying after,
00:06:21 we have more opportunities to do what’s mentioned
00:06:25 at Hebrews 10:24, 25:
00:06:29 “And let us consider one another
00:06:32 “so as to incite to love and fine works,
00:06:36 “not forsaking our meeting together,
00:06:39 “as some have the custom,
00:06:40 “but encouraging one another,
00:06:43 “and all the more so
00:06:45 as you see the day drawing near.”
00:06:48 We can experience the joy of giving
00:06:51 as we actively ‘encourage our brothers and sisters,
00:06:55 inciting them to love and fine works.’
00:07:00 Of course, why do we put forth all of this effort?
00:07:05 Why do we work so hard
00:07:07 to maintain our own spirituality and encourage others?
00:07:12 Because we want to keep our relationship
00:07:16 with Jehovah strong and at the same time
00:07:20 take our stand against
00:07:23 our great adversary, Satan the Devil.
00:07:28 Remember the warning recorded at 1 Peter 5:8.
00:07:33 There we read:
00:07:35 “Keep your senses, be watchful!
00:07:39 “Your adversary, the Devil,
00:07:41 “walks about like a roaring lion,
00:07:44 seeking to devour someone.”
00:07:48 While the Devil doesn’t cause all our problems,
00:07:51 he’s always looking for a way to use them.
00:07:56 He would love to use the stress
00:07:59 and isolation of the pandemic
00:08:01 to weaken our faith
00:08:03 or to sidetrack us with his propaganda.
00:08:08 What can help us?
00:08:10 Note what’s stated in verse 9:
00:08:13 “But take your stand against him,
00:08:17 “firm in the faith,
00:08:19 “knowing that the same kind of sufferings
00:08:22 “are being experienced
00:08:24 “by the entire association
00:08:26 of your brothers in the world.”
00:08:30 Simply put,
00:08:32 all of Jehovah’s people are facing the same attack!
00:08:37 Although our challenges may be different,
00:08:41 no matter where we live on this earth,
00:08:44 we are under attack.
00:08:47 But when we meditate
00:08:49 on what our brothers and sisters in other places are dealing with,
00:08:53 it can help us to see our challenges differently.
00:08:57 For example,
00:08:59 think about our brothers and sisters
00:09:01 facing natural disasters and persecution.
00:09:07 So far this service year,
00:09:09 our brothers have been affected
00:09:11 by over 120 disasters.
00:09:14 Consider a few examples.
00:09:17 In December, Typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette)
00:09:22 devastated the Philippines.
00:09:25 Sadly, four publishers died,
00:09:28 a dozen were injured,
00:09:30 and over 2,000 were displaced.
00:09:34 And can you imagine?
00:09:36 Over 1,700 of our brothers’ homes
00:09:40 were damaged or destroyed!
00:09:44 Then, in January,
00:09:46 Tropical Storm Ana struck
00:09:48 southeastern Africa.
00:09:50 Sadly, one brother lost his wife
00:09:54 and two children.
00:09:56 Three brothers and a child were injured,
00:09:59 over 2,000 were displaced,
00:10:02 and over 400 of our brothers’ homes
00:10:05 were damaged or destroyed.
00:10:08 And on February 15,
00:10:11 heavy rainstorms and mudslides hit Brazil.
00:10:15 Unfortunately, one of our brothers
00:10:18 and his two-year-old son
00:10:20 were swept away by a mudslide.
00:10:23 The father survived despite serious injuries.
00:10:27 But tragically, his son died.
00:10:31 Sadly, another brother also died.
00:10:34 We continue to pray for all who have lost loved ones
00:10:39 or who have been affected by these recent disasters.
00:10:44 In addition to natural disasters,
00:10:47 our brothers also face civil unrest.
00:10:51 In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
00:10:54 many of our brothers and sisters in several regions
00:10:57 have had to flee their villages and fields.
00:11:01 Yet, with Jehovah’s help,
00:11:03 we’ve been able to provide
00:11:05 over 81 tons of food
00:11:08 to assist more than 19,600 people!
00:11:13 We deeply appreciate your support
00:11:17 of our brothers and sisters who are facing disasters.
00:11:20 Your prayers and generous donations
00:11:24 are having a tremendous impact.
00:11:27 Thank you!
00:11:30 Despite all these disasters,
00:11:32 our brothers and sisters remain firm in the faith.
00:11:36 Let’s hear how some in Congo, the Philippines,
00:11:41 and the Caribbean feel about the help they’ve received.
00:11:59 I sincerely thank Jehovah
00:12:02 for the material support to help me
00:12:04 return to my normal life.
00:12:12 For me, thank you is not enough
00:12:14 to express my appreciation
00:12:17 for all the good things that we’ve received,
00:12:22 since I was among those who were helped to have
00:12:25 damaged houses repaired.
00:12:28 The brothers really helped us.
00:12:34 Despite the difficulties
00:12:36 brought on by Typhoon Odette,
00:12:39 Jehovah did not abandon us.
00:12:42 He helped us.
00:12:44 On the very next day, the brothers contacted us
00:12:48 and provided us food and helped us repair our house.
00:12:53 We’re so thankful for Jehovah’s help
00:12:57 and for providing us our needs
00:12:59 so that we can continue with our lives!
00:13:16 I sincerely thank Jehovah
00:13:18 and his organization for the love
00:13:19 they have shown us during this time
00:13:21 that we became victims
00:13:23 of the volcanic eruption.
00:13:25 We don’t know what words
00:13:27 to use to express our gratitude.
00:13:30 It’s like Jehovah is taking us by his hand,
00:13:32 caring for us, and saying: “Do not be afraid.
00:13:36 I will help you.”
00:13:38 Honestly, we are very thankful.
00:13:42 Thank you so much for getting us this house,
00:13:45 because our house burned down.
00:13:48 And to you servants of Jehovah,
00:13:51 I want to tell you
00:13:53 thank you, thank you, thank you.
00:14:10 When I left,
00:14:11 I left with the clothes on my back.
00:14:15 The condition that we left our home in—
00:14:18 And coming back and seeing the work
00:14:20 that the brothers did for us,
00:14:22 I don’t know how
00:14:24 to put it into words.
00:14:27 I love and appreciate
00:14:29 every single one of you
00:14:31 and what you have done for us.
00:14:32 You will never understand just how much
00:14:35 it means to know that we don’t have to do this by ourselves.
00:14:52 I’m very, very thankful to see Jehovah’s blessing.
00:15:05 Another challenge our brothers and sisters are facing is persecution.
00:15:11 Take, for example, Sister Anna Safronova.
00:15:15 On January 25,
00:15:17 56-year-old Anna
00:15:19 was sentenced to six years in a penal colony.
00:15:24 This is the harshest, longest sentence
00:15:27 imposed on a sister in Russia
00:15:29 since the 2017 ban.
00:15:32 The court imprisoned Anna
00:15:34 even though she was the caregiver for her 81-year-old mother.
00:15:40 What challenges do the family members of those imprisoned face?
00:15:45 How is Jehovah helping them?
00:15:48 Let’s watch the following interviews from Russia.
00:15:54 Our trials and hardships
00:15:56 began on June 12, 2018,
00:15:59 when authorities searched our home.
00:16:04 And then we didn’t see Aleksey for 11 months
00:16:07 because he was in the pretrial detention center.
00:16:13 The judge sentenced him to three and a half years
00:16:16 in a general regime prison colony.
00:16:22 Then another terrible thing happened.
00:16:24 It was the fire when our home burned to the ground in the middle of the night.
00:16:30 In October 2020, the children and I got COVID.
00:16:35 And just recently, we came down with COVID for a second time.
00:16:39 I live with my daughter, Anna.
00:16:42 In July 2021,
00:16:45 our home was searched,
00:16:48 and on January 25, 2022,
00:16:52 a court sentenced her to six years in prison.
00:16:57 We were not even allowed
00:17:01 to say goodbye to each other.
00:17:07 My dad has been in a prison for a year and a half already.
00:17:13 In January of this year, he was sentenced
00:17:16 to seven years in a correctional facility.
00:17:19 Along with all of that,
00:17:21 at the end of last year, my mother died unexpectedly from COVID.
00:17:25 One trial is difficult enough,
00:17:28 but when you get two at the same time—
00:17:31 So the two people who are dearest to me are no longer with me.
00:17:39 I pray to Jehovah
00:17:41 and feel that he gives me peace of heart and a sense of calm.
00:17:46 And I don’t worry quite as much.
00:17:49 Friends come over and help me with the cleaning,
00:17:53 and they go shopping for me, and we chat.
00:17:56 In all of that, I see Jehovah’s hand
00:17:59 —his help and his support.
00:18:04 Jehovah constantly strengthened us by means of his Word.
00:18:07 And he used the brothers.
00:18:10 For example, our friends
00:18:12 sent us text messages, quoting the very scriptures
00:18:15 that gave me strength.
00:18:17 These were answers to my prayers.
00:18:19 It was my parent’s wedding anniversary,
00:18:22 and all day it was, like—
00:18:24 Couriers were bringing us gifts, flowers, and parcels.
00:18:28 It was, like—
00:18:30 The whole day the house was full of flowers.
00:18:33 It was as though Jehovah were shouting to us: “I love you.
00:18:36 I’m right with you. I won’t leave you!”
00:18:38 And Sasha said, “Mum, if Dad had been free,
00:18:41 we would have had only one bouquet of flowers at the most!”
00:18:47 Do you remember that time when you were afraid to shout out:
00:18:50 “Dad! I love you!
00:18:51 Hang in there. Jehovah loves you!”?
00:18:54 You mustered up courage, and we prayed as well.
00:19:02 And then he wrote in letters that he cried
00:19:05 because he was so happy that he had heard me.
00:19:08 My faith has only been made stronger.
00:19:11 I’ve started reading the Bible every day.
00:19:13 Also, I’ve taken a big step toward Jehovah—even two.
00:19:17 I dedicated my life to him and was baptized.
00:19:22 Many times I remembered the thought that Jehovah
00:19:24 often embraces us using someone else’s arms.
00:19:27 Well, in these last years,
00:19:29 we have felt Jehovah’s embrace many times.
00:19:32 Jehovah always turns hardships into blessings.
00:19:36 There was the fire, and we lost our home.
00:19:38 But now we have a new home, which is better than the previous one.
00:19:42 I am certain that whatever happens,
00:19:44 we will definitely get through it.
00:19:46 The main thing is to be close to Jehovah.
00:19:54 We are so proud
00:19:56 of all those who are standing firm in the faith
00:20:00 despite persecution.
00:20:03 We’re reminded of 2 Corinthians 4:9:
00:20:07 “We are persecuted, but not abandoned;
00:20:12 we are knocked down, but not destroyed.”
00:20:17 Jehovah will never abandon his faithful servants.
00:20:22 As we’ve been reminded in this update,
00:20:25 our brothers and sisters worldwide
00:20:28 continue to “stand firm in the faith”
00:20:31 despite military actions, a global pandemic,
00:20:36 disasters, and persecution.
00:20:40 Brothers and sisters,
00:20:42 as 1 Peter 5:8 says:
00:20:46 “Keep your senses, be watchful!”
00:20:51 Our adversary, Satan the Devil, has filled this world
00:20:56 with his satanic propaganda.
00:20:59 Be cautious!
00:21:01 “Take your stand against him.”
00:21:04 As the world becomes
00:21:06 more and more nationalistic and divided,
00:21:10 we will not compromise our neutrality.
00:21:14 We will remain united
00:21:17 in our loyalty to God’s Kingdom
00:21:20 and in our love for one another.
00:21:23 Continue to listen to the voice
00:21:27 of our Fine Shepherd, Jesus Christ,
00:21:30 and his appointed channel, “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:21:35 Our almighty God, Jehovah, is with us!
00:21:39 And we have our worldwide brotherhood to support us.
00:21:44 No matter what trials lay ahead,
00:21:46 we have everything we need
00:21:49 to remain faithful to Jehovah.
00:21:53 Dear brothers and sisters, we love you all very much.
00:21:58 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:22:02 this is JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:01 Brothers and sisters,
00:00:03 welcome to this update!
00:00:06 The Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus
00:00:10 has quickly spread throughout the world.
00:00:13 The number of cases has exploded.
00:00:16 We’re saddened to report
00:00:18 that as of Friday, January 21,
00:00:21 26,813 of our brothers
00:00:25 have now died from COVID-19.
00:00:29 But there have been some encouraging developments.
00:00:32 For those who are vaccinated,
00:00:35 cases of Omicron are generally milder
00:00:38 and have not led to hospitalization or death.
00:00:42 For example, you may have heard reports
00:00:45 that there has been a major outbreak of Omicron in Puerto Rico.
00:00:49 You may also know that Puerto Rico
00:00:52 has a very high rate of vaccination.
00:00:55 Although 551 cases were reported
00:00:59 among our brothers during the recent outbreak,
00:01:02 only three of our brothers have died.
00:01:05 And it is our understanding that all of them
00:01:08 had serious underlying health issues.
00:01:12 Even one death is too many,
00:01:15 yet we’re relieved that so few died.
00:01:18 Our hearts go out to all who have lost loved ones.
00:01:23 Please continue to be careful.
00:01:26 The pandemic is not over,
00:01:28 and we need to continue to take practical steps
00:01:31 to protect our lives and our health.
00:01:36 In addition to the pandemic,
00:01:38 it has been sobering to watch recent world events unfold.
00:01:42 We see one natural disaster after another,
00:01:46 and we hear threats of war.
00:01:49 “The king of the north” and “the king of the south”
00:01:52 continue “pushing” one another.
00:01:55 When we hear all these things happening in the world,
00:01:59 it reminds us how vital it is that we “keep on the watch”.
00:02:03 We need to stay awake spiritually
00:02:06 and not doze off or get distracted.
00:02:09 Why?
00:02:11 Because we are living in the most critical time in human history.
00:02:16 Jesus knew that the last days would bring challenges
00:02:20 that would test our spiritual focus.
00:02:23 Out of his deep love, he urged his followers
00:02:27 as recorded at Luke chapter 21
00:02:30 verses 34-36:
00:02:34 “But pay attention to yourselves
00:02:37 “that your hearts never become weighed down
00:02:40 “with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life,
00:02:44 “and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.
00:02:49 “For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.
00:02:54 “Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication
00:02:59 “that you may succeed in escaping all these things
00:03:03 that must occur and in standing before the Son of man.”
00:03:08 We constantly hear encouraging reports
00:03:11 that you dear brothers and sisters are working hard to “keep awake”
00:03:16 and remain busy in your service to Jehovah.
00:03:20 You’re busy in your personal ministry
00:03:22 —writing letters, making phone calls,
00:03:25 and looking for opportunities to share the good news informally—
00:03:30 and many were able to auxiliary pioneer
00:03:33 during the recent campaign.
00:03:35 Staying busy in Jehovah’s service is a protection for us.
00:03:40 But more is required to protect our hearts.
00:03:44 It’s vital for all of us to “keep awake”
00:03:47 —to be watchful of things
00:03:50 that could pose a danger to us spiritually.
00:03:54 What are some of these dangers?
00:03:57 Jesus mentioned things like “overeating and heavy drinking
00:04:01 and anxieties of life.”
00:04:03 What are some ways that these things could cause our hearts
00:04:07 to “become weighed down”?
00:04:10 First, let’s talk about one common cause for anxiety
00:04:15 —social isolation.
00:04:17 No doubt we have never felt as isolated
00:04:21 as we have during this pandemic.
00:04:23 True, it has been necessary to isolate ourselves physically
00:04:28 to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
00:04:31 But if we’re not careful,
00:04:34 we could start to isolate ourselves in other ways.
00:04:38 Maybe at times, we feel Zoom fatigue,
00:04:42 and we even want to isolate ourselves virtually.
00:04:46 What’s the danger?
00:04:49 Proverbs 18:1 says:
00:04:52 “Whoever isolates himself
00:04:55 “pursues his own selfish desires;
00:04:58 he rejects all practical wisdom.”
00:05:01 It takes effort to reach out to our brothers by telephone,
00:05:06 by videoconference, or even with an email or text message,
00:05:11 but so often the encouragement that we receive from doing so
00:05:16 makes the effort so worthwhile.
00:05:19 Often, we receive back more than what we may have given.
00:05:25 Just as Jesus said at Acts 20:35:
00:05:28 “There is more happiness in giving
00:05:31 than there is in receiving.”
00:05:34 An article on jw.org entitled
00:05:38 “How to Deal With Isolation”
00:05:40 made an interesting point under the heading
00:05:43 “Cultivate friendships”:
00:05:46 “Friendships benefit your mental and emotional health
00:05:50 “and are even more important when face-to-face connections are difficult.
00:05:55 “If you are confined at home,
00:05:57 “you may be able to use videoconferencing
00:06:00 “or voice calls to maintain existing friendships
00:06:04 and build new ones.”
00:06:07 We need our brothers and sisters, and they need us!
00:06:11 To have a friend, we must be a friend.
00:06:15 So be a friend!
00:06:17 Could you reach out to someone this week?
00:06:20 Perhaps you can think of a friend
00:06:23 whom you haven’t been able to talk with for some time.
00:06:26 The joy of speaking with your friend
00:06:29 will no doubt calm some of the anxieties in your heart.
00:06:35 We can’t wait to get back to our Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls,
00:06:39 to have our large regional conventions,
00:06:42 special conventions, and even international conventions.
00:06:46 In the meantime, we are grateful that we have other means
00:06:51 to enjoy these programs, such as Zoom,
00:06:54 JW Stream and, in some cases,
00:06:58 TV and radio.
00:07:01 Of course, most congregations are using Zoom for their meetings.
00:07:06 Isn’t it encouraging to see our brothers’ and sisters’ faces?
00:07:11 We appreciate being able to see them comment
00:07:14 and see them singing from the heart.
00:07:17 This also helps us to fight feelings of isolation.
00:07:22 Simply turning your camera on and smiling,
00:07:25 even a simple wave,
00:07:27 can be such an encouragement to others.
00:07:31 And we can make it our goal to connect early
00:07:34 and stay longer after the meeting.
00:07:38 We can enjoy visiting with the friends in breakout rooms.
00:07:42 Brothers and sisters, these are some practical ways
00:07:46 that we can fight back against feelings of isolation
00:07:50 and the anxiety that isolation
00:07:52 can create in our hearts.
00:07:56 Another danger that Jesus mentioned was heavy drinking.
00:08:01 Of course, there’s nothing wrong
00:08:03 with drinking alcohol in moderation.
00:08:06 The Scriptures describe wine as a gift from God,
00:08:11 designed to make the “heart rejoice.”
00:08:14 But some caution is needed.
00:08:16 Why?
00:08:18 Remember, Jesus specifically cautioned
00:08:22 that our hearts could become “weighed down
00:08:25 with . . . heavy drinking.”
00:08:28 Secular reports indicate that many people
00:08:31 have increased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
00:08:37 The article “Alcohol Consumption —How Can You Stay in Control?”
00:08:42 on jw.org states:
00:08:44 “Some people drink more alcohol
00:08:46 “when they feel stressed, lonely, or simply bored.
00:08:50 “Are you drinking more than you used to?
00:08:53 “If so, how can you make sure
00:08:56 “that your drinking does not get out of hand
00:08:59 or lead to alcohol dependence?”
00:09:02 Even if a person does not get drunk,
00:09:05 immoderate drinking can pose spiritual dangers.
00:09:10 Isaiah 5:11 says:
00:09:14 “Woe to those who get up early in the morning to drink alcohol,
00:09:19 “who linger late into the evening darkness
00:09:22 until wine inflames them!”
00:09:26 Why these woes?
00:09:27 Note the spiritual consequences in the second half of verse 12:
00:09:32 “They do not consider the activity of Jehovah,
00:09:35 and they do not see the work of his hands.”
00:09:39 Immoderate drinking can weigh our hearts down
00:09:44 and cause us to neglect spiritual things.
00:09:47 It can cause us to slow down in the race for life
00:09:51 or even to stop running altogether.
00:09:54 No wonder Jesus specifically mentioned it
00:09:57 when discussing the need to keep awake spiritually.
00:10:02 Why not review that article on jw.org,
00:10:07 which features five tips
00:10:09 to help us keep alcohol in its proper place?
00:10:14 What is another potential danger to our spiritual alertness?
00:10:19 Misuse of social media.
00:10:23 There’s been a lot of concern from governmental and medical authorities
00:10:28 about the effect that social media
00:10:30 is having on people’s mental and emotional health.
00:10:34 Even more important are the spiritual concerns:
00:10:38 the content, the people, and the amount of time involved.
00:10:42 It can be addictive.
00:10:45 Brothers and sisters, if you decide to allow your family
00:10:50 to use social media, please be alert.
00:10:54 Make sure you have good association
00:10:56 with those who promote good spiritual habits,
00:11:00 whether on screen or off.
00:11:03 The whiteboard animation Be Social-Network Smart
00:11:08 provides some good reminders
00:11:10 on how to be balanced yet cautious when using social media.
00:11:15 What’s the final challenge we want to consider?
00:11:19 Tests of neutrality.
00:11:21 With so many different challenging situations in the world
00:11:25 and even the threat of war in some countries,
00:11:29 we need to be sure that we are not allowing our hearts
00:11:32 to take sides on these issues.
00:11:35 How sad it has been to see simple public health measures
00:11:39 like wearing masks, handwashing,
00:11:41 physical distancing, and vaccinations
00:11:45 become controversial, even political!
00:11:49 Some of our brothers and sisters
00:11:51 have been influenced by the political views
00:11:54 of those in their community.
00:11:57 Some have turned to the Internet
00:11:59 and have been deeply influenced
00:12:02 by official-appearing websites
00:12:04 filled with highly political propaganda.
00:12:07 Brothers and sisters, be careful.
00:12:11 Just because something appears
00:12:13 on an official-looking web page on the Internet
00:12:16 does not make it true.
00:12:18 We must guard against “the spirit of the world”
00:12:21 and remain neutral.
00:12:24 How appropriate are Jesus’ words:
00:12:28 “Pay attention to yourselves
00:12:31 that your hearts never become weighed down.”
00:12:35 Let’s keep focused on God’s Kingdom
00:12:38 as the only solution to this world’s problems.
00:12:42 What has helped some families to keep awake?
00:12:46 Let’s see as we watch the following video.
00:12:51 During the pandemic,
00:12:52 it was definitely difficult
00:12:54 to keep a good routine
00:12:56 and it was very easy to form bad habits.
00:13:00 During isolation,
00:13:02 I spent more time in front of the computer,
00:13:04 and it disturbed my sleep pattern.
00:13:07 I had to make an adjustment
00:13:09 (because with bad habits, you know, they’re easy to form and hard to break),
00:13:12 so I did a little bit of replacement therapy (I call it),
00:13:15 where you switch from mindless TV watching
00:13:19 to something that’s a little bit more profitable,
00:13:20 which is our own TV station, JW Broadcasting®.
00:13:25 As I spent a lot of time watching television,
00:13:27 I heard a lot of negative information about vaccination.
00:13:31 I was frightened.
00:13:33 I felt pressure from the media,
00:13:35 and I decided not to get vaccinated for some time.
00:13:41 We often asked Jehovah for guidance.
00:13:45 The Governing Body updates were timely
00:13:48 and helped us to make the right decisions.
00:13:53 When the pandemic first started, I had a lot of free time on my hands,
00:13:57 so I was just on social media all the time
00:14:00 or on technology all the time.
00:14:02 Family worship was an excellent opportunity
00:14:04 for us to be able to talk about social media —to really get Jehovah’s thinking on it—
00:14:08 and how we can balance it while not eliminating it completely,
00:14:12 so that we controlled it and it didn’t control us.
00:14:14 It was a slow process, but eventually I deleted my social media
00:14:19 and began setting time limits for other apps
00:14:23 that would take a lot of my time.
00:14:26 Our family decided to spend more time together.
00:14:29 We played music and danced together.
00:14:32 We played board games and went for walks together in the forest.
00:14:36 That helped us to reduce the time we used for social media.
00:14:41 I decided to keep my schedule busy,
00:14:44 so I started a few new hobbies, like knitting and gardening.
00:14:50 I saw a lot of benefit in staying close to the congregation through Zoom,
00:14:55 even though Zoom is not easy for me.
00:14:58 Being able to spend time
00:14:59 with people who were going through the same thing as I was,
00:15:03 was really beneficial.
00:15:04 We could all talk about what we were dealing with
00:15:06 and encourage each other as well.
00:15:08 We arranged online Bible-based games through Zoom.
00:15:13 I found it nice to use Zoom to connect with the congregation
00:15:16 for events that were planned by those in our hall.
00:15:19 Some of them were interviews
00:15:21 with those who have been in our hall for a long time,
00:15:23 so it was nice to hear those experiences
00:15:26 and be able to draw closer to them.
00:15:28 During the pandemic, I would reach out to others
00:15:31 —either a phone call or a little card or a text message
00:15:35 or just dropping something off at someone’s door—
00:15:37 and it helped me to feel closer to my brothers and sisters too.
00:15:40 The Governing Body updates were an absolute lifeline.
00:15:44 They were something that really helped us to focus all of our activity.
00:15:48 As parents, they helped us to have clear direction,
00:15:51 so we felt like we were guided through the whole pandemic
00:15:54 and encouraged at the same time.
00:15:57 I also have been able to see Jehovah answer my personal prayers even more so
00:16:02 and see just how he is holding all of us up
00:16:05 during this difficult time, because I don’t think any of us
00:16:09 could get through this pandemic without him.
00:16:13 We are proud of these families for keeping awake to spiritual dangers.
00:16:18 Did you notice how they counteracted social isolation?
00:16:22 They have reached out to others regularly.
00:16:25 They use videoconferencing
00:16:27 to stay close to their congregations and dear friends.
00:16:31 Did you notice how they addressed their use of social media?
00:16:35 They talked about it as a family
00:16:38 and decided either to reduce the time spent
00:16:41 or eliminate it completely.
00:16:44 They have also increased the time they spend together,
00:16:47 including enjoyable outdoor activities.
00:16:51 And how did they handle tests of neutrality?
00:16:55 They prayed to Jehovah and trusted the information
00:16:59 provided by “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:17:02 in making their own personal decisions.
00:17:08 Very soon, Jehovah’s day will come upon all the earth.
00:17:12 It’s vital that we keep awake.
00:17:16 Now is not the time to become spiritually drowsy or distracted!
00:17:21 Remember Jesus’ words at Luke 21:36:
00:17:26 “Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication
00:17:30 “that you may succeed in escaping all these things
00:17:34 that must occur and in standing before the Son of man.”
00:17:40 By earnestly supplicating Jehovah
00:17:42 and applying the fine direction we are receiving,
00:17:45 we will be successful!
00:17:49 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

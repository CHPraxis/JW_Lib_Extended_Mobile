00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.607 line:10% position:50% align:center
Newly married life came with a lot

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
of unexpected challenges.

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
You dream about the way
your marriage will go,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then the reality is quite different.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
All we ever did was argue,

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we wouldn’t speak to one another.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never ever went to the elders.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:24.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t want to bother them.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:27.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just felt, you know,
we needed to figure it out ourselves.

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided that if the house sold,

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we would separate.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
The separation wasn’t a good thing,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in some respects
it made things worse.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
It did have an impact on the boys.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
They started acting out.

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got into some trouble
with the police one time.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was a loneliness
because you’ve gotten married,

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you don’t have that,
and you’re by yourself.

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same old routine
went on where you’re

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
cooking and cleaning
and doing laundry and working.

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt sick to my stomach.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a hard time getting up every morning
and facing the world.

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point, I felt that I needed

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:22.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have the elders help out a little bit.

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did pray for Jehovah’s help to direct me,

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I kept wondering
why Jehovah wasn’t really

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
answering my prayers.

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I kind of realize now
that it was because we were separated.

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expectations of the separation
were not at all what I was thinking.

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
I reflected on the marriage vows.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the things I thought

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:48.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
about was a sister in our congregation.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:52.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was married to an unbeliever,
and then she learned the truth.

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was so violent.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would beat her; he would burn her books;
he would burn her clothes.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:02.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not allow her children
to attend the meetings.

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought about the problems
that Darrel and I had.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:
‘Well, Darrel is a kind person.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s never done that.’

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:09.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:11.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, this is something

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that we need to really work on.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We need to really put forth the effort

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to start applying Bible principles

00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to put Jehovah first in our life

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can bring our marriage
back in union with Jehovah.’

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted,

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was what Jehovah wanted.

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was just no other choice.

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wasn’t going to bless us
unless we got back together.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got back together,
our marriage was still a work in progress.

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t have
a perfect marriage in this world,

00:02:49.314 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you can sure make it better
when you put Jehovah first.

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoyed the feelings
we had toward each other.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt closer to Debbie.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Debbie and I
have been married now for 48 years.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Separation does not make
anything better at all.

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you even have an inkling of love
for one another,

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:13.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
you want to work on that,
and you want to make it bloom

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jehovah can bless it.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings have been endless.

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our children are all doing

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
fantastic in the truth.

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said:
“Taste and see that [He] is good.”

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ve got to do that.

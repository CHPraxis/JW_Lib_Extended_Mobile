00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:04.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were speechless when they heard

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:08.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would leave home
and join full-time service.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:12.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of pursuing their common goals,
dreams, and hopes,

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would do whatever she was told to do.

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a sacrifice!

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so proud of her.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they started thinking
about what to do in order to support her.

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whom are we talking about?

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:31.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us open to Judges 11,

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s find out who they were

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they did.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear soon-to-be graduates, what they did

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
is something that will help you

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:46.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
to succeed in your assignment.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:51.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read, please, Judges 11:40:

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:53.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From year to year,

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the young women of Israel

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“would go to give commendation

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
four days in the year.”

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young women of Israel

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
went to the sanctuary in Shiloh
in order to give

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
commendation and praise
to the daughter of Jephthah.

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commendation strengthened
this full-time servant of Jehovah.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this not what you want to do too?

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s why we have the question for you,

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often will you “go to Shiloh”?

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:34.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you strengthen others
and stabilize the organization

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
by regularly commending and praising others?

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, therefore, ask
the following questions:

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:47.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
What type of commendation
is effective in strengthening others?

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you imitate
the young women of Israel?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why do you want to give
commendation regularly?

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start with the first question,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
What type of commendation is effective
in strengthening others?

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let us, please, look at the example
that Jesus set

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we turn to Mark chapter 5.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here he commends

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
the frightened, sick woman
who touched his outer garment.

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read Mark 5:34,

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:21.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
please watch out for five elements

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
of effective commendation

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark 5:34:

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to her:

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:36.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Daughter, your faith has made you well.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go in peace, and be healed
from your grievous sickness.’”

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note
what made this commendation effective?

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:50.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, effective commendation is specific.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus commended the woman for what she did.

00:02:53.957 --> 00:02:57.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her faith moved her to act.

00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:01.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Effective commendation is sincere.

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
The woman’s faith was real

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and outstanding.

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:09.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that Jesus
did not use the opportunity

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:13.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counsel her for violating the Law?

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:17.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
This might have made
his commendation sound insincere.

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, effective commendation is personal.

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used the expression “daughter.”

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
That expression emphasized
his tender concern for her.

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:34.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fourth, effective commendation
is more than words.

00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:37.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus acknowledged the needs of the woman

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and followed up with deeds.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
He healed her.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
And fifth,

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
effective commendation is unselfish.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not commend the woman
in order to make himself look good,

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was concerned about her

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wanted to make her feel good.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:03:59.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you do the same?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to Judges 11,

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s look again at verse 40.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:09.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is Judges 11:40,
and let’s answer the second question,

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you imitate
the young women of Israel?

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the verse started here
in verse 40 by saying

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from year to year,”

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
so this means regularly,

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:23.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
repeatedly.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:27.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young women would praise
the same person

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
again and again.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your assignment as you work with others
in Bethel, in the ministry,

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
or watch them in your congregation,

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:40.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you repeatedly praise them?

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:44.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, could you praise them
for their zeal,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
their fine efforts,

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
or for their acts of love?

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:51.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you send
an upbuilding text message saying

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Great job,” “Well done,”
“Thumbs up,” “Loved it,”

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:59.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe along with a brief comment?

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:03.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
These messages do not require
a lot of effort and time,

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:06.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they can go a long way.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
One time is not enough.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it again and again.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:13.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry that the person
could get a big head.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible,

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah praised and commended

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
the persons whom he loved repeatedly.

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:26.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commending others again and again
is a good thing.

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:30.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the verse continues here, saying:

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The young women of Israel
would go to give commendation

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
four days in the year.”

00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being away from their family obligations

00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:45.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
must have been a sacrifice.

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Somebody else must have taken over
their usual work.

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:51.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to travel to Shiloh

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:55.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they may also have brought a gift.

00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, could this serve as a reminder

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:02.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
that giving commendation
might sometimes require

00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little bit more time and effort
and can come at a personal cost?

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Calling somebody or visiting him

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:15.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires time and effort.

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:19.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spending time with your brother and sister
honors them.

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being out with them in the ministry,
working together on a project,

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:28.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
or asking them for advice

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
really makes them feel good
and can be a powerful commendation.

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:36.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s worth all it costs.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Timing is important too.

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:42.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 15:23 states:

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A word spoken

00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:48.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right time—how good it is!”

00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is “the right time”
for commendation?

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verses leading up
to our theme scripture here

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:56.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned that Jephthah’s daughter

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
right away got much needed support.

00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
So generally speaking,
commendation is of greatest value

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:09.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it’s given
as soon as the opportunity comes up,

00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:12.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it’s initially just a brief comment.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sooner somebody receives
positive feedback,

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
the quicker feelings of insecurity or doubts
will vanish

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:24.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sooner the other person
will be happy and feel good.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please do not wait too long,

00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:30.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
but act right away.

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:34.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this leads us
to our third and final question,

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:38.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you want to give
commendation regularly?

00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:40.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you go to your assignments,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will be surrounded
by many “daughters of Jephthah”

00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
—faithful, full-time servants of Jehovah

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made sacrifices to serve.

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:56.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
This auditorium is full of them,
and you are among them.

00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will meet

00:08:00.263 --> 00:08:03.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters in the congregation,

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:08.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of them are insecure—worried.

00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes they doubt
that they are worth anything.

00:08:12.508 --> 00:08:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are giving their very best
to stay faithful despite challenges

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
—fighting with their own imperfection,

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:20.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with the results
of their own mistakes,

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:23.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are sometimes discouraged

00:08:23.853 --> 00:08:26.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of setbacks.

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:30.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need commendation.

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:33.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all need commendation

00:08:33.162 --> 00:08:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
because commendation
enhances a person’s self-esteem,

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
it builds confidence and motivates to action,

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:42.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reinforces our desire

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do good things,

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:48.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it encourages us
to keep on doing our very best.

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.

00:08:53.749 --> 00:08:56.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s another important aspect.

00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:00.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:03.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when you work closely
with brothers and sisters,

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see their flaws and mistakes.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are you going to do?

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:12.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you ignore that person?

00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or will you try to imitate Jehovah,

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is searching for the good in us?

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:22.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make it a habit to search for the good,

00:09:22.211 --> 00:09:25.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then give voice to the positive.

00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:29.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what happens to us

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are doing it that way?

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:35.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can change us.

00:09:35.258 --> 00:09:39.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can change us from being a complainer

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:42.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
to being a commender.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:46.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
A commender focuses on the good in others.

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:48.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees others

00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:51.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s eyes.

00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:56.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
A commender is very happy
because he sees

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the beauty around him.

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:03.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you gain a reputation

00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:06.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
for commending rather than complaining,

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:09.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will succeed in your assignment

00:10:09.492 --> 00:10:12.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
because others will love to work with you.

00:10:12.094 --> 00:10:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear soon-to-be graduates
of the 151st class of Gilead,

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
please make commending and praising others

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:25.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
part of your personality
—something that comes naturally.

00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:29.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how often will you “go to Shiloh”?

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:32.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.

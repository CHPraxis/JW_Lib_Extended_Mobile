WEBVTT

00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at this time, we have the pleasure

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:07.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear from another member
of the Governing Body, Brother David Splane,

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the title of his talk is

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:13.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Course of Humility.”

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of you are humble people.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:25.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you weren’t,
you would never have been invited to Gilead.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever noticed, though,
that where humility is concerned,

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do well in some situations

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:38.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not so well in others?

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:40.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
if someone commends us

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a good job
on a talk in the midweek meeting

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps a comment
on the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
we give all credit to Jehovah
and to the training we’ve received,

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:54.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s good.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in other situations,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might get into trouble.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other situations,

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
our humility might be put to the test.

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at Bethel,
as has been mentioned

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this program already,

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all work with people;

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all work closely with others.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some of you sisters work on a team;
you work with others.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you brothers all have responsibilities

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation
or at Bethel or perhaps both.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:32.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in all situations, humility is needed.

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:34.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I thought that this morning

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might consider
what we can learn about humility

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:40.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah God

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:43.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the apostles of Jesus Christ.

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, humility is a broad term,

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:50.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
so let’s narrow it down a little bit.

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:54.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a couple
of aspects of humility,

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the first one I’m going to mention
might surprise you. 

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i> 
tells us that humility includes

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability to show mercy

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:08.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and compassion to others

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:11.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the ability to show mercy

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and compassion to others—

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:20.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability to make exceptions
where that is warranted.

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:23.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s Jehovah, isn’t it?

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah isn’t rigid.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:33.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows when to make exceptions.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:36.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often did you read in the Bible
as you went through

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:39.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah reconsidered?

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:42.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah makes perfect rules,

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:46.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet at times he reconsiders.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s illustrate:

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:52.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites are getting ready
to conquer the Promised Land.

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the first up is the city of Jericho.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:57.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s a rule

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a rule of engagement—
and it’s very clear.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says:

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not make any covenant with them

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor show them any favor.”

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
No covenant, no favor
—that’s the rule.

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:20.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a perfect rule
because it’s Jehovah’s rule.

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:23.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua sent two spies into the city,

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:28.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they went to the home
of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, wait a minute;

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:33.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s think about that.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pretty easy to say, isn’t it?

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua sent two spies into the city.

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:44.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went into a house
of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we often think about the faith of Rahab.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:53.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the faith of those two spies?

00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:57.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the faith
that it took for those men

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the Bible says they were young men)
to go into that city?

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if they were under 40 years of age,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were born in the wilderness.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many cities had they ever seen?

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Had they ever seen a city before?

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:22.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many actual houses had they entered?

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many foreigners had they ever met?

00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:30.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe not very many—maybe a couple
on the other side of the Jordan,

00:04:30.753 --> 00:04:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not very many.

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:37.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, as soon as they enter the city,
what happens?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone calls the police.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re recognized right away.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:44.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no wonder!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
they weren’t dressed like Canaanites.

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:51.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
You couldn’t order your clothes
from Amazon in those days, you know.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were dressed like Israelites.

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:59.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
They probably had on
40-year-old hand-me-downs

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:02.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their fathers
who had died in the desert.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they didn’t look like Canaanites;
they didn’t blend in.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:12.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as soon as they opened their mouth,
people would say:

00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:14.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’re not from around here, are you?

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t speak the Canaanite language.”

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:20.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no wonder they were discovered.

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:23.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to get off the street.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to get out of sight.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you wonder if Jehovah
directed them to Rahab.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
You wonder if Jehovah
saw something in Rahab,

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
something in her heart
that he could work with.

00:05:37.086 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or do you believe
that it was a coincidence

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the spies were led
to the only family in Jericho

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:46.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was worth saving?

00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be that Jehovah
was involved with that.

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:53.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Rahab decides

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she’s going to hide the spies,
but she has a condition.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’d like to turn
to Joshua chapter 2,

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see what that condition was.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:08.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:06:08.217 --> 00:06:11.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to read Joshua 2:13.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Rahab.

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we don’t know
how she communicated with them

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:20.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
—must have been a lot of sign language.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
We heard about sign language a minute ago.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
There must have been
a lot of sign language going on

00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:28.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Canaanite language
wasn’t quite like Hebrew, you know.

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:30.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
But anyway,
somehow they got the point across.

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:33.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what she says in verse 13:

00:06:33.242 --> 00:06:35.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must spare the lives

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of my father and mother,

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:41.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my brothers and sisters,

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all who belong to them,

00:06:44.353 --> 00:06:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you must save us from death.”

00:06:47.023 --> 00:06:49.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s she asking for?

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s asking for an exception.

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:56.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a rule:

00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:00.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
You must not make any covenant with them;

00:07:00.203 --> 00:07:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must not show them any favor.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she is asking for an exception
—and quite a broad exception.

00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:10.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is asking not just for her own life

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for the lives of all
of her family members as well.

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:17.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some might have thought
that she was pushing it.

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she asked for that.

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the spies showed favor to Rahab.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made an exception.

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they promised that when the time came,

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:32.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rahab and her family would be spared.

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:38.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible doesn’t criticize the spies
for making that exception.

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:40.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it may be that Jehovah
had something to do with it.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Jehovah moved the spies
in that direction.

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Jehovah saw something in Rahab
that he wanted to save.

00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:52.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, later on, Joshua and the elders

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t follow instructions,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they made a covenant
with the Gibeonites.

00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:58.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible does mention that,

00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:01.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it doesn’t mention this
when it comes to the spies here.

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made the exception.

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do know
that Jehovah agreed with that exception.

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know that?

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:12.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when he made
the walls of Jericho fall,

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
he preserved the section of the wall

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Rahab’s family lived.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:23.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah agreed to an exception

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:25.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his perfect rule.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know where I’m going with this.

00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need rules.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:36.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most of the time,
a rule will satisfy our needs.

00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:38.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in a few cases,

00:08:38.134 --> 00:08:43.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
it only makes sense
to make an exception to the rule.

00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:45.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m reminded of the time not too long ago

00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:49.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Bethel family moved out of Brooklyn.

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:51.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there were a lot of Bethelites
in the congregations

00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:54.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were elders and ministerial servants.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so a massive reorganization
of congregations

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:01.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
was necessary in New York City.

00:09:01.057 --> 00:09:03.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the elders and the circuit overseers

00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:05.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to make sure
that each congregation

00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:09.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a balanced number of elders,
ministerial servants, and publishers.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:13.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so publishers were assigned
to various congregations.

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:18.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine hundreds of thousands
of assignments that had to be made?

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:22.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so there was a rule,
and it was a pretty good rule,

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the rule was:
“Go where you’re assigned.

00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We don’t have time
to consider the personal feelings

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:32.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about every publisher in New York City,

00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:35.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
so please go where you’re assigned.”

00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:37.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the rule.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there were two sisters (single sisters)

00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were assigned to a congregation.

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t have a car,

00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:49.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you couldn’t reach
the congregation they were assigned to

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:51.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
by public transportation.

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:56.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they were going to have to walk
to the Kingdom Hall,

00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:59.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the area
where the Kingdom Hall was located

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:02.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very dangerous.

00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:05.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their safety would have been involved.

00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:10.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you had a rule
to go where you were assigned,

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:14.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the circuit overseer
lovingly made an exception.

00:10:14.597 --> 00:10:18.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the point is, we do need rules.

00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most of the time,
our rules, even our imperfect rules,

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:25.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
will serve most of the brothers.

00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:27.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s use common sense.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are times
when we have to consider an exception.

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you think of anyone who is grateful

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah made
an exception for Rahab

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that she didn’t die in Jericho?

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of someone?

00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:43.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was mentioned in this program.

00:10:43.859 --> 00:10:47.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Boaz, the husband of Ruth.

00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rahab was his mother.

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:53.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think of this:

00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:56.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Rahab had died in Jericho,

00:10:56.739 --> 00:11:00.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
would there ever have been a David?

00:11:01.043 --> 00:11:03.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go on.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:06.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah directed
that seven nations in Canaan

00:11:06.615 --> 00:11:10.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
were to be eliminated,
and the Gibeonites were among them.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they had a plan.

00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:14.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pretended to be from a far-off nation

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wasn’t slated for destruction.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the elders,
not consulting Jehovah,

00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:24.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
made a vow that the Gibeonites
would be spared.

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made a covenant with the Gibeonites.

00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:29.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t long,
but what the Israelites realized

00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
is they’d been tricked.

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:35.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even though their oath
had been obtained under false pretenses,

00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
they agreed to keep their word.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s what happens next
that’s interesting.

00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:44.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Five kings of the Amorites find out

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:47.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Israelites and the Gibeonites
have made a covenant,

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are furious.

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:54.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so they are determined
to kill all the Gibeonites,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:59.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was really what Jehovah
had intended in the first place.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:04.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have said:
‘Well, that solves your problem.

00:12:04.407 --> 00:12:07.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You promised the Gibeonites
that you wouldn’t put them to death,

00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:10.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
so you can sit back
and let the Amorites do the job.’

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jehovah do?

00:12:13.916 --> 00:12:17.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua 10:8.

00:12:19.789 --> 00:12:22.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember, he had had a rule.

00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:25.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’d had a rule
that everyone was to be destroyed.

00:12:25.895 --> 00:12:29.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua 10:8:

00:12:32.234 --> 00:12:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah then said to Joshua:

00:12:35.037 --> 00:12:39.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not be afraid of them,
for I have handed them over to you.

00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not one of them will be able
to stand against you.’”

00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:48.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the humility.

00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:53.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helps the Israelites
to keep a promise

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had no business making.

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:57.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is humility.

00:12:57.927 --> 00:13:00.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk about Jesus’ apostles.

00:13:00.095 --> 00:13:03.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can really learn humility
from them as well.

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:06.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we often talk
about the disputes they had,

00:13:06.068 --> 00:13:08.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
but mostly that was before Pentecost.

00:13:08.737 --> 00:13:12.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about it,
after Pentecost was a different story.

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:16.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we find out
about the apostles after Pentecost?

00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they weren’t interested
in taking credit for things,

00:13:19.248 --> 00:13:22.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they weren’t searching for the limelight.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:26.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were really very self-effacing apostles.

00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew wrote the first inspired book

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:33.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the first inspired history of Jesus Christ.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see Matthew’s picture
on every other page?

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:38.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew giving a public talk?

00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:40.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew performing a miracle?

00:13:40.703 --> 00:13:42.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew shepherding?

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:47.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, his name is only mentioned twice
in the whole Gospel,

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:49.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and both times

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:51.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
he describes himself as a tax collector

00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:54.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not a very flattering portrayal.

00:13:54.817 --> 00:13:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the apostle John?

00:13:57.186 --> 00:14:00.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name John appears 23 times

00:14:00.689 --> 00:14:02.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his Gospel,

00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:06.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it never refers to the apostle John.

00:14:07.429 --> 00:14:11.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
It almost always refers to John the Baptist.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostles and older men met
to consider the matter of circumcision,

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that an important meeting?

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:20.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you agree
that that was a landmark meeting?

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:22.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles and older men are there.

00:14:22.578 --> 00:14:24.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who presided?

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of the 12 was jockeying for position?

00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:31.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
James, the brother of Jesus,
wasn’t even an apostle.

00:14:31.353 --> 00:14:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the one who presided.

00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:37.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then later on when the decision was made,

00:14:37.993 --> 00:14:39.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
who announced the decision?

00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:41.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, James.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t find Peter or John saying:

00:14:43.532 --> 00:14:45.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, you know,
this is a pretty important decision.

00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:48.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think that one of us should announce it.”

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles had learned their lesson.

00:14:53.776 --> 00:14:56.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember that
when the circuit overseer visits.

00:14:56.946 --> 00:15:00.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may have
heavy responsibilities at Bethel,

00:15:00.382 --> 00:15:05.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when he visits a congregation,
he’s in charge that week.

00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow his direction.

00:15:07.256 --> 00:15:10.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be critical of the circuit overseer,

00:15:10.025 --> 00:15:13.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and don’t be afraid to let him know
how much you appreciate his service.

00:15:13.963 --> 00:15:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know, our Bethel families
here in the United States

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
are such a wonderful example of that.

00:15:18.601 --> 00:15:21.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the circuit overseers
first visit a Bethel congregation,

00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:25.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re a little bit nervous
for about ten minutes.

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Bethel family shows

00:15:28.143 --> 00:15:31.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they appreciate the counsel so much,

00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:35.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes they talk
about the circuit overseer’s counsel

00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:37.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
for weeks after his visit.

00:15:37.586 --> 00:15:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really deeply appreciate
the visit of the circuit overseer,

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they respect that man.

00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:47.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know
that you’re going to do the same.

00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:51.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble people are happy to contribute
to the Kingdom work in any way they can,

00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:53.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
just so they can contribute.

00:15:53.969 --> 00:15:55.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not hung up on privileges.

00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:59.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not hung up
on prestige or on position.

00:15:59.942 --> 00:16:02.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t seek the limelight.

00:16:02.745 --> 00:16:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this regard, we’re going to talk
a little bit about the apostle Paul.

00:16:06.415 --> 00:16:08.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Lippold mentioned in his talk

00:16:08.784 --> 00:16:13.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Paul was not a man to boast,
and that’s quite true.

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:16.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, Paul was a very humble man.

00:16:16.692 --> 00:16:20.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about this:
At the time Paul was converted,

00:16:20.996 --> 00:16:24.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 34 C.E.,

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:26.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told Ananias

00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:29.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Paul was going
to have a wonderful privilege.

00:16:29.638 --> 00:16:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about it in Acts chapter 9.

00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:39.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 9:15

00:16:46.055 --> 00:16:51.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Acts 9:15
(and this is Jesus to Ananias):

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the Lord said to him:
‘Go! because this man

00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:58.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is a chosen vessel to me

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to bear my name to the nations

00:17:00.969 --> 00:17:04.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.’”

00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:07.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A chosen vessel.”

00:17:07.643 --> 00:17:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about that!

00:17:09.712 --> 00:17:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Paul react?

00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:14.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he let that go to his head?

00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:16.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he immediately go up to Jerusalem

00:17:16.018 --> 00:17:18.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and volunteer to be
on the governing body, saying,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, now that I’m anointed,
I can be on the governing body”?

00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:23.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:23.325 --> 00:17:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stayed where he was in Damascus,

00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:28.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he kept preaching the good news.

00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:33.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 36 C.E., he did go up
to world headquarters in Jerusalem.

00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:35.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did he react?

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:38.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he say: “Here I am, the chosen vessel.

00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:41.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m here to help you run the place”?

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stayed with the apostle Peter
for a couple of weeks.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apparently, Peter had moved to Jerusalem.

00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:50.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he kept preaching.

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:55.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just put his head to the ground,
and he kept preaching the good news

00:17:55.624 --> 00:17:59.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
until one day Jesus appeared to him

00:17:59.862 --> 00:18:02.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul was in the temple.

00:18:02.231 --> 00:18:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he told Paul that he
had to leave Jerusalem immediately

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:10.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Jews were out to kill him.

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:12.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Paul react?

00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:16.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he say:
“But the governing body is going to need me.

00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I leave, how will they manage without me?

00:18:20.749 --> 00:18:23.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need my wisdom”?

00:18:23.118 --> 00:18:26.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul obeyed theocratic direction,

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:28.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he left.

00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:31.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
He accepted a new assignment

00:18:31.627 --> 00:18:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Tarsus.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tarsus?

00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of assignment is that
for a chosen vessel?

00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:43.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was out in the boondocks.

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:48.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was 500 miles (800 km)
from the governing body in Jerusalem.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would the governing body
get to know his wonderful qualities

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:54.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was 500 miles (800 km) from Jerusalem?

00:18:55.984 --> 00:19:00.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul went to Tarsus,
and he kept preaching.

00:19:00.689 --> 00:19:03.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t even know
if there was a congregation of Tarsus

00:19:03.158 --> 00:19:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul got there.

00:19:05.027 --> 00:19:07.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Paul kept preaching.

00:19:07.296 --> 00:19:10.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thinking of the lovely interview
we just heard

00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the brother talked about how he
eventually ended up in the circuit work.

00:19:14.803 --> 00:19:18.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before that time,
Jehovah gave him a little training.

00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:22.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps that’s what happened
to the apostle Paul.

00:19:22.978 --> 00:19:27.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know that Paul
may have remained in Tarsus

00:19:27.716 --> 00:19:30.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
for eight years preaching?

00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:36.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Barnabas came along

00:19:36.558 --> 00:19:39.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
11 years after Paul’s conversion.

00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Barnabas came along
and invited him to Antioch.

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:47.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from that time on,
Paul started to have privileges.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And five years after that,

00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:53.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote his first inspired letter

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:56.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we cherish to this day.

00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:58.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul worked hard all his life.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did more than any of the 12 apostles,

00:20:01.516 --> 00:20:05.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was never upset
that he wasn’t counted among them.

00:20:05.354 --> 00:20:09.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul appreciated the privileges he had.

00:20:09.992 --> 00:20:12.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He viewed them as undeserved kindness.

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:15.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that you brothers and sisters
are going to do the same.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:19.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re invited to conduct
a meeting for field service

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:21.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
—treasure the privilege.

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:23.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any privilege that you receive,

00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
treasure it as an expression
of love from Jehovah.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go to your assignments,

00:20:31.013 --> 00:20:34.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
many situations are going
to test your humility.

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:39.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know that you brothers and sisters
are going to pass the test.

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:42.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch asks you to work on a project,

00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:45.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deep down
you don’t quite agree with it.

00:20:45.861 --> 00:20:48.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep down,
you really wonder if it’s going to work,

00:20:48.597 --> 00:20:52.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you wonder if it’s not going
to be a waste of your time.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re not going to put it
on the back burner and say,

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I’ll get to it someday if I get time.”

00:20:57.572 --> 00:20:59.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not going to do that.

00:20:59.274 --> 00:21:02.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to put
heart and soul into the project.

00:21:02.444 --> 00:21:06.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to pray to Jehovah
to bless the project,

00:21:06.548 --> 00:21:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
the project that you didn’t quite agree with.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or if you’re asked
to make a recommendation

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you favor one option over another,

00:21:18.593 --> 00:21:23.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility is going to move you
to present all of the options,

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:26.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the pros and cons equally.

00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:28.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not going to slant things, thinking:

00:21:28.337 --> 00:21:32.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, you know, I’m going to have to help
these brothers to make this decision.

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:35.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So I’ll put a really heavy weight
on the pros,

00:21:35.344 --> 00:21:37.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m going to make it really light
on the cons.’

00:21:37.346 --> 00:21:38.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t do that.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that you’re going
to present everything honestly,

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re going to recognize
that it’s the holy spirit

00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:46.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps brothers to make decisions.

00:21:47.956 --> 00:21:52.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust the spirit to move the brothers
to do the right thing.

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose you sisters
are working on a team

00:21:55.664 --> 00:21:59.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you brothers are working
on a body of elders.

00:21:59.101 --> 00:22:02.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that not even
in your heart of hearts

00:22:02.704 --> 00:22:06.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
are you going to think
that you have the best judgment on the team

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:10.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that, well, you can listen politely
to the expressions of others

00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:13.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, really,
yours is the only sensible conclusion,

00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:18.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you hope that the brothers and sisters
are going to go along with you.

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:23.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not going to think that,
because nobody is right all the time.

00:22:23.058 --> 00:22:27.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s spirit can work
on any member of the team.

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:32.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t get discouraged
if every suggestion you make in a meeting

00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:34.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
gets shot down.

00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:36.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happens to the best of us.

00:22:36.838 --> 00:22:38.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there will be other meetings,

00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:42.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hopefully some of them
will go better for you.

00:22:42.244 --> 00:22:46.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t get discouraged, and don’t decide:
“Well, I’m not going to say anything anymore.

00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:48.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not going to contribute anymore.”

00:22:48.216 --> 00:22:52.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be humble and recognize that at times

00:22:52.487 --> 00:22:56.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may make suggestions
that don’t make very much sense.

00:22:56.892 --> 00:23:01.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I certainly appreciate the kind way
the Governing Body deals with me

00:23:01.563 --> 00:23:04.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
with some of my lamebrained suggestions.

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:08.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your comments and your assignments
on the midweek meeting,

00:23:08.737 --> 00:23:12.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
use the knowledge
you’ve gained at Gilead to build up.

00:23:12.707 --> 00:23:16.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know you won’t proofread the meetings.

00:23:16.278 --> 00:23:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t think that was a good illustration.

00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:21.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That scripture wasn’t applied right.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
That isn’t the right word.’

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:24.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
You won’t do that.

00:23:24.386 --> 00:23:28.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meetings.

00:23:28.123 --> 00:23:30.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take in the spiritual food.

00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:34.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rejoice in whatever the brothers and sisters
have prepared for you.

00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I haven’t told you anything
you don’t already know.

00:23:40.102 --> 00:23:42.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re all humble people.

00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:46.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are just reminders that all of us need.

00:23:46.708 --> 00:23:51.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us are humble most of the time.

00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:55.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for the day
when we’ll be humble all of the time.

00:23:55.117 --> 00:23:59.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the meantime,
let’s work on it, you and I.

00:23:59.654 --> 00:24:01.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s work on it together.

00:24:01.923 --> 00:24:04.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s follow the course of humility.

00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:08.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we’ll continue

00:24:08.463 --> 00:24:10.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be used by Jehovah.

00:24:10.832 --> 00:24:12.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you.

00:24:12.834 --> 00:24:15.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless you richly.

00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:27.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Splane,

00:24:27.582 --> 00:24:30.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the excellent
Scriptural examples in that talk

00:24:30.585 --> 00:24:33.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
(including, above all, Jehovah’s example)

00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the reminders
that humble people follow rules

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:40.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that humble people,
though, are reasonable

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:44.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
—beautiful reminders and examples
through that talk.

00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:48.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now for the presentation
of the diplomas.

00:24:48.803 --> 00:24:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will be assisted in this

00:24:51.473 --> 00:24:56.011 line:90% position:50% align:center

Now they’re graduates.

00:28:17.479 --> 00:28:21.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this time, we’re pleased to present

00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:25.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
the graduates of the 151st class of Gilead.

00:28:42.837 --> 00:28:44.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a lot of love here today.

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:46.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful.

00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:50.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have a letter to be presented

00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:53.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
by one of the now graduates
of the 151st class.

00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:57.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Davide Vita

00:28:57.719 --> 00:29:00.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Italy and going to Albania
will read that now at this time.

00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:10.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To the Governing Body and Bethel family.

00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:13.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dear Brothers: For the past five months,

00:29:13.868 --> 00:29:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have traveled through the Bible
from the first page to the last.

00:29:18.106 --> 00:29:21.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We experienced the heat of the Sinai

00:29:21.376 --> 00:29:25.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and found ourselves
in the depths of the Red Sea,

00:29:25.547 --> 00:29:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the narrow alleys of Jerusalem,

00:29:28.716 --> 00:29:31.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and high up on Mount Hermon.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We met the prophets, visited the temple,

00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:39.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saw the awesome celestial chariot,

00:29:39.561 --> 00:29:44.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and enjoyed the precious company
of Jesus and the apostles.

00:29:44.432 --> 00:29:47.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What is the result of our journey?

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:50.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The very same that resulted for Job

00:29:50.805 --> 00:29:55.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after he encountered his God
—great astonishment!

00:29:55.243 --> 00:29:59.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although he recognized
that he would only be able to understand

00:29:59.781 --> 00:30:02.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘just the fringes of his ways,’

00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:06.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was enough to make him marvel at Jehovah.

00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:10.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now I know
that you are able to do all things.’

00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:14.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At the same time,
the experience humbled him

00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:17.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that he
‘put [his] hand over [his] mouth.’

00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:20.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is how we feel today.

00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:23.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gilead leaves us in its wake,

00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“filled with awe, humility, and gratitude.

00:30:27.942 --> 00:30:32.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Studying the Bible
is studying about Jehovah himself.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And what we have learned
has impressed on our hearts

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the depth of Jehovah’s love
for each one of his servants.

00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:44.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We saw this love
not only in numerous Bible accounts

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:47.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in those who imitate him
and his Son, Jesus

00:30:47.729 --> 00:30:51.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the Governing Body, our guest instructors,

00:30:51.633 --> 00:30:55.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our Gilead instructors,
and the Bethel family

00:30:55.403 --> 00:30:58.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“here at Patterson and the other complexes.

00:30:58.907 --> 00:31:01.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your example is the living answer

00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:05.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the question of how
to define Christian love.

00:31:05.613 --> 00:31:09.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We express our heartfelt thanks
to you, the Governing Body,

00:31:09.918 --> 00:31:13.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all those who made
this unforgettable experience possible.

00:31:15.023 --> 00:31:19.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We know that our divine education
is not our possession alone.

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We received it to share it.

00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:26.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The end of Gilead School
for our class is the close of a chapter.

00:31:26.734 --> 00:31:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And we are determined
to write the next chapter of our story

00:31:31.472 --> 00:31:33.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by showing the same love

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:36.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and personal interest we have experienced.

00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:41.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is our prayer that as we apply
what we have been taught,

00:31:41.716 --> 00:31:46.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we inspire others
and make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.

00:31:46.588 --> 00:31:51.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As the psalmist expressed at Psalm 106:48:

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘May Jehovah . . . be praised
throughout all eternity. . . . Praise Jah!’

00:31:57.065 --> 00:32:02.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your brothers and sisters,
the 151st class of Gilead.”

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:13.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for that beautiful letter.

00:32:13.815 --> 00:32:18.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those heartfelt expressions
are something we will remember too.

00:32:19.821 --> 00:32:22.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in closing,
we just have a few things to say to you now.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are graduates

00:32:24.726 --> 00:32:28.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
—graduates of the 151st class of Gilead.

00:32:28.229 --> 00:32:30.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used the word “students”
a few times earlier on

00:32:30.598 --> 00:32:32.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you didn’t have
a diploma in hand yet.

00:32:32.634 --> 00:32:34.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you have them.

00:32:34.435 --> 00:32:37.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s just such an encouraging
and wonderful thing to see.

00:32:37.805 --> 00:32:40.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may know that back in 2011,

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:43.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body adjusted the objective

00:32:43.678 --> 00:32:46.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Gilead School training a bit.

00:32:46.147 --> 00:32:48.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the training is even more focused

00:32:48.816 --> 00:32:50.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
on strengthening and stabilizing

00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:54.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
the field and branch organization.

00:32:54.088 --> 00:32:56.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since that time, a good number of graduates

00:32:56.391 --> 00:33:00.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been appointed to a Branch
or a Country Committee.

00:33:00.628 --> 00:33:04.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so with Jehovah’s blessing,
the training is working.

00:33:04.298 --> 00:33:06.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not all graduates from Gilead

00:33:06.534 --> 00:33:11.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
are brothers who may someday receive
such responsibilities.

00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:15.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have many sisters
in each class too, don’t we?

00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:17.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then, how might the goal

00:33:17.111 --> 00:33:21.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
of strengthening and stabilizing
the field and branch organization

00:33:21.315 --> 00:33:23.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
be reached through each one of you

00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:26.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
graduating brothers and sisters?

00:33:26.821 --> 00:33:31.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the goal is reached
when others can look at what you do and say

00:33:31.826 --> 00:33:35.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they see a man or woman of strong faith.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:39.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Paul wrote at 1 Thessalonians 1:8,

00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:41.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he said in part:

00:33:41.869 --> 00:33:45.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not only has the word of [God]
sounded out from you . . .

00:33:45.406 --> 00:33:47.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but your faith in God

00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:50.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
has spread abroad in every place.”

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:53.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what happens, isn’t it?

00:33:53.281 --> 00:33:56.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, such examples are priceless.

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:59.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your schooling was designed
to strengthen your faith,

00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:02.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re confident
that it has done just that.

00:34:02.256 --> 00:34:04.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are ready for what is ahead.

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:07.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our faith keeps us strong, though.

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:10.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at 1 John 5:4,
the apostle John wrote:

00:34:10.098 --> 00:34:13.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the conquest
that has conquered the world,

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:16.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith,” right?

00:34:16.504 --> 00:34:19.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind, for just a few minutes

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s consider
how you can keep your faith strong

00:34:22.376 --> 00:34:24.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you get to your assignments,

00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:28.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can be
that powerful force for good

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
in strengthening and stabilizing
the field and branch organization.

00:34:32.887 --> 00:34:37.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you’re settled into your assignments,
perhaps with new responsibilities,

00:34:37.892 --> 00:34:41.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember to remain focused
on what is most important,

00:34:41.529 --> 00:34:44.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
namely, the doing of God’s will.

00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:48.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
What could cause a person
to forget this if not careful?

00:34:48.703 --> 00:34:53.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we get into danger
if we ever start to feel

00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:56.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
like we have achieved everything

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve wanted to achieve
as our spiritual goals.

00:34:59.814 --> 00:35:02.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, if we allow that to happen,

00:35:02.483 --> 00:35:05.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
our interest could turn to other things.

00:35:05.086 --> 00:35:07.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never want to allow that to happen.

00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:09.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to remain focused on Jehovah
—his work.

00:35:09.757 --> 00:35:14.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always about Jehovah
and helping other people.

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never become distracted
by losing sight of the need

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:21.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep advancing spiritually day by day.

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never become content with what
this empty system of things has to offer.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remain fixed on Jehovah’s promises
and on the doing of his will.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:34.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your “large shield of faith” strong.

00:35:34.682 --> 00:35:39.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bible times, soldiers
repaired their shields between battles.

00:35:39.153 --> 00:35:42.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a soldier found damage
or weakness to his shield,

00:35:42.924 --> 00:35:45.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
he diligently made the needed repairs.

00:35:45.993 --> 00:35:49.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way, he was always ready
to fight the next battle.

00:35:49.997 --> 00:35:52.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
He never let down his guard.

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:54.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to keep this up in a spiritual way.

00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:59.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over time, a brother or sister
might lay down his or her shield of faith

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and go after things
that have no lasting value.

00:36:02.877 --> 00:36:07.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil wants nothing more
than to see us neglect our faith,

00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:11.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that will pull
everything down if he can do that.

00:36:11.752 --> 00:36:15.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
We show that we’re strengthening
our faith in God

00:36:15.122 --> 00:36:19.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we take time
to give attention to our spiritual need.

00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:21.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
The basics always count.

00:36:21.896 --> 00:36:24.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
The basics always count.

00:36:24.332 --> 00:36:28.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then be certain
to regularly attend Christian meetings

00:36:28.035 --> 00:36:31.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which we know you’ll do
and soon in person—right?),

00:36:31.572 --> 00:36:35.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
to zealously speak to others
about Jehovah’s name and his Kingdom,

00:36:35.743 --> 00:36:39.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain strong faith
by reading God’s Word every day,

00:36:39.914 --> 00:36:44.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then to apply its counsel
prayerfully in all that you do.

00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:48.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are the basics that never fail us

00:36:48.155 --> 00:36:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help us to keep our faith strong.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:54.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in summary, don’t take liberties
with your spiritual routine

00:36:54.262 --> 00:36:57.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
now that you’ve graduated
from this wonderful, beautiful school.

00:36:57.431 --> 00:36:59.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never neglect those basic things.

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:02.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never become self-satisfied
because of resting

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a privilege that you may come to enjoy.

00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:10.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, keep growing as a godly person

00:37:10.444 --> 00:37:15.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you remember how kind
Jehovah has been to you and to all of us.

00:37:15.449 --> 00:37:18.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be like the diligent soldier who worked hard

00:37:18.753 --> 00:37:23.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for that shield
and all of his vital armor.

00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you remain focused on what Gilead School
has now strengthened you to do,

00:37:28.195 --> 00:37:30.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will always be ready

00:37:30.464 --> 00:37:33.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “fight the fine fight of the faith.”

00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:38.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
As mentioned earlier, we have confidence
that you will do just that.

00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:42.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah and his dear Son bless you

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
—each one of you—
for it.

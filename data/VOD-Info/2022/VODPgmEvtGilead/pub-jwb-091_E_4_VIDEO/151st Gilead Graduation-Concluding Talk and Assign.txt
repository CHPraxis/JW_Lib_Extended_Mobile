00:00:01 Well, at this time, we have the pleasure
00:00:03 to hear from another member of the Governing Body, Brother David Splane,
00:00:07 and the title of his talk is
00:00:10 “Follow the Course of Humility.”
00:00:17 All of you are humble people.
00:00:22 If you weren’t, you would never have been invited to Gilead.
00:00:27 Have you ever noticed, though, that where humility is concerned,
00:00:31 we do well in some situations
00:00:34 and not so well in others?
00:00:38 For example, if someone commends us
00:00:40 for a good job on a talk in the midweek meeting
00:00:43 or perhaps a comment on the Watchtower  Study,
00:00:47 we give all credit to Jehovah and to the training we’ve received,
00:00:51 and that’s good.
00:00:54 But in other situations,
00:00:56 we might get into trouble.
00:00:59 In other situations,
00:01:01 our humility might be put to the test.
00:01:05 Now, at Bethel, as has been mentioned
00:01:07 on this program already,
00:01:10 we all work with people;
00:01:12 we all work closely with others.
00:01:16 Now, some of you sisters work on a team; you work with others.
00:01:20 And you brothers all have responsibilities
00:01:23 in the congregation or at Bethel or perhaps both.
00:01:27 But in all situations, humility is needed.
00:01:32 So I thought that this morning
00:01:34 we might consider what we can learn about humility
00:01:37 from Jehovah God
00:01:40 and from the apostles of Jesus Christ.
00:01:44 Now, humility is a broad term,
00:01:47 so let’s narrow it down a little bit.
00:01:50 Let’s consider a couple of aspects of humility,
00:01:54 and the first one I’m going to mention might surprise you.
00:01:57 Insight on the Scriptures  tells us that humility includes
00:02:01 the ability to show mercy
00:02:04 and compassion to others
00:02:08 —the ability to show mercy
00:02:11 and compassion to others—
00:02:15 the ability to make exceptions where that is warranted.
00:02:21 Well, that’s Jehovah, isn’t it?
00:02:23 Jehovah isn’t rigid.
00:02:28 Jehovah knows when to make exceptions.
00:02:33 How often did you read in the Bible as you went through
00:02:36 that Jehovah reconsidered?
00:02:39 Jehovah makes perfect rules,
00:02:42 and yet at times he reconsiders.
00:02:46 Now let’s illustrate:
00:02:48 The Israelites are getting ready to conquer the Promised Land.
00:02:52 And the first up is the city of Jericho.
00:02:55 Now, there’s a rule
00:02:57 —a rule of engagement— and it’s very clear.
00:03:00 Jehovah says:
00:03:02 “You must not make any covenant with them
00:03:06 nor show them any favor.”
00:03:11 No covenant, no favor —that’s the rule.
00:03:15 It’s a perfect rule because it’s Jehovah’s rule.
00:03:20 Joshua sent two spies into the city,
00:03:23 and they went to the home of a prostitute named Rahab.
00:03:29 Now, wait a minute;
00:03:31 let’s think about that.
00:03:33 Pretty easy to say, isn’t it?
00:03:36 Joshua sent two spies into the city.
00:03:39 They went into a house of a prostitute named Rahab.
00:03:44 Now, we often think about the faith of Rahab.
00:03:48 But what about the faith of those two spies?
00:03:53 Can you imagine the faith that it took for those men
00:03:57 (the Bible says they were young men) to go into that city?
00:04:02 Now, if they were under 40 years of age,
00:04:05 they were born in the wilderness.
00:04:10 How many cities had they ever seen?
00:04:15 Had they ever seen a city before?
00:04:18 How many actual houses had they entered?
00:04:22 How many foreigners had they ever met?
00:04:27 Maybe not very many—maybe a couple on the other side of the Jordan,
00:04:30 but not very many.
00:04:33 So now, as soon as they enter the city, what happens?
00:04:37 Someone calls the police.
00:04:39 They’re recognized right away.
00:04:42 And no wonder!
00:04:44 First of all, they weren’t dressed like Canaanites.
00:04:47 You couldn’t order your clothes from Amazon in those days, you know.
00:04:51 They were dressed like Israelites.
00:04:55 They probably had on
40-year-old hand-me-downs
00:04:59 from their fathers who had died in the desert.
00:05:04 So they didn’t look like Canaanites; they didn’t blend in.
00:05:07 And as soon as they opened their mouth, people would say:
00:05:12 “You’re not from around here, are you?
00:05:14 You don’t speak the Canaanite language.”
00:05:17 So no wonder they were discovered.
00:05:20 They had to get off the street.
00:05:23 They had to get out of sight.
00:05:26 And you wonder if Jehovah directed them to Rahab.
00:05:30 You wonder if Jehovah saw something in Rahab,
00:05:33 something in her heart that he could work with.
00:05:37 Or do you believe that it was a coincidence
00:05:40 that the spies were led to the only family in Jericho
00:05:44 that was worth saving?
00:05:46 It could be that Jehovah was involved with that.
00:05:50 Well, Rahab decides
00:05:53 that she’s going to hide the spies, but she has a condition.
00:05:57 And if you’d like to turn to Joshua chapter 2,
00:06:03 we’ll see what that condition was.
00:06:06 I’ll give you a moment.
00:06:08 We’re going to read Joshua 2:13.
00:06:13 This is Rahab.
00:06:14 Now, we don’t know how she communicated with them
00:06:18 —must have been a lot of sign language.
00:06:20 We heard about sign language a minute ago.
00:06:22 There must have been a lot of sign language going on
00:06:25 because the Canaanite language wasn’t quite like Hebrew, you know.
00:06:28 But anyway, somehow they got the point across.
00:06:30 And here’s what she says in verse 13:
00:06:33 “You must spare the lives
00:06:35 “of my father and mother,
00:06:39 “my brothers and sisters,
00:06:41 “and all who belong to them,
00:06:44 and you must save us from death.”
00:06:47 What’s she asking for?
00:06:50 She’s asking for an exception.
00:06:54 There’s a rule:
00:06:56 You must not make any covenant with them;
00:07:00 you must not show them any favor.
00:07:04 And she is asking for an exception —and quite a broad exception.
00:07:07 She is asking not just for her own life
00:07:10 but for the lives of all of her family members as well.
00:07:13 Some might have thought that she was pushing it.
00:07:17 But she asked for that.
00:07:19 And the spies showed favor to Rahab.
00:07:24 They made an exception.
00:07:26 And they promised that when the time came,
00:07:28 Rahab and her family would be spared.
00:07:33 The Bible doesn’t criticize the spies for making that exception.
00:07:38 So it may be that Jehovah had something to do with it.
00:07:40 Maybe Jehovah moved the spies in that direction.
00:07:43 Maybe Jehovah saw something in Rahab that he wanted to save.
00:07:48 Now, later on, Joshua and the elders
00:07:52 didn’t follow instructions,
00:07:54 and they made a covenant with the Gibeonites.
00:07:56 The Bible does mention that,
00:07:58 but it doesn’t mention this when it comes to the spies here.
00:08:01 They made the exception.
00:08:03 And we do know that Jehovah agreed with that exception.
00:08:06 How do we know that?
00:08:08 Because when he made the walls of Jericho fall,
00:08:12 he preserved the section of the wall
00:08:15 where Rahab’s family lived.
00:08:19 Jehovah agreed to an exception
00:08:23 to his perfect rule.
00:08:26 Now, you know where I’m going with this.
00:08:30 We need rules.
00:08:32 And most of the time, a rule will satisfy our needs.
00:08:36 But in a few cases,
00:08:38 it only makes sense to make an exception to the rule.
00:08:43 I’m reminded of the time not too long ago
00:08:45 when the Bethel family moved out of Brooklyn.
00:08:49 Now, there were a lot of Bethelites in the congregations
00:08:51 who were elders and ministerial servants.
00:08:54 And so a massive reorganization of congregations
00:08:58 was necessary in New York City.
00:09:01 And the elders and the circuit overseers
00:09:03 had to make sure that each congregation
00:09:05 had a balanced number of elders, ministerial servants, and publishers.
00:09:09 And so publishers were assigned to various congregations.
00:09:13 Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of assignments that had to be made?
00:09:18 And so there was a rule, and it was a pretty good rule,
00:09:22 and the rule was: “Go where you’re assigned.
00:09:25 “We don’t have time to consider the personal feelings
00:09:30 “about every publisher in New York City,
00:09:32 so please go where you’re assigned.”
00:09:35 That was the rule.
00:09:37 Now, there were two sisters (single sisters)
00:09:41 who were assigned to a congregation.
00:09:44 They didn’t have a car,
00:09:46 and you couldn’t reach the congregation they were assigned to
00:09:49 by public transportation.
00:09:51 So they were going to have to walk to the Kingdom Hall,
00:09:56 and the area where the Kingdom Hall was located
00:09:59 was very dangerous.
00:10:02 Their safety would have been involved.
00:10:05 Well, you had a rule to go where you were assigned,
00:10:10 but the circuit overseer lovingly made an exception.
00:10:14 So the point is, we do need rules.
00:10:18 And most of the time, our rules, even our imperfect rules,
00:10:22 will serve most of the brothers.
00:10:25 But let’s use common sense.
00:10:27 And there are times when we have to consider an exception.
00:10:32 Now, can you think of anyone who is grateful
00:10:34 that Jehovah made an exception for Rahab
00:10:37 and that she didn’t die in Jericho?
00:10:40 Can you think of someone?
00:10:41 He was mentioned in this program.
00:10:43 It’s Boaz, the husband of Ruth.
00:10:47 Rahab was his mother.
00:10:51 And think of this:
00:10:53 If Rahab had died in Jericho,
00:10:56 would there ever have been a David?
00:11:01 Let’s go on.
00:11:03 Jehovah directed that seven nations in Canaan
00:11:06 were to be eliminated, and the Gibeonites were among them.
00:11:10 But they had a plan.
00:11:11 They pretended to be from a far-off nation
00:11:14 that wasn’t slated for destruction.
00:11:17 And so the elders, not consulting Jehovah,
00:11:21 made a vow that the Gibeonites would be spared.
00:11:24 They made a covenant with the Gibeonites.
00:11:26 Well, it wasn’t long, but what the Israelites realized
00:11:29 is they’d been tricked.
00:11:31 But even though their oath had been obtained under false pretenses,
00:11:35 they agreed to keep their word.
00:11:37 But it’s what happens next that’s interesting.
00:11:41 Five kings of the Amorites find out
00:11:44 that the Israelites and the Gibeonites have made a covenant,
00:11:47 and they are furious.
00:11:49 And so they are determined to kill all the Gibeonites,
00:11:54 which was really what Jehovah had intended in the first place.
00:11:59 What did Jehovah do?
00:12:01 He could have said: ‘Well, that solves your problem.
00:12:04 ‘You promised the Gibeonites that you wouldn’t put them to death,
00:12:07 so you can sit back and let the Amorites do the job.’
00:12:11 But what did Jehovah do?
00:12:13 Joshua 10:8.
00:12:19 Now, remember, he had had a rule.
00:12:22 He’d had a rule that everyone was to be destroyed.
00:12:25 Joshua 10:8:
00:12:32 “Jehovah then said to Joshua:
00:12:35 “‘Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you.
00:12:39 Not one of them will be able to stand against you.’”
00:12:45 Imagine the humility.
00:12:48 Jehovah helps the Israelites to keep a promise
00:12:53 that they had no business making.
00:12:55 That is humility.
00:12:57 Well, let’s talk about Jesus’ apostles.
00:13:00 We can really learn humility from them as well.
00:13:03 Now, we often talk about the disputes they had,
00:13:06 but mostly that was before Pentecost.
00:13:08 When you think about it, after Pentecost was a different story.
00:13:12 What do we find out about the apostles after Pentecost?
00:13:16 Well, they weren’t interested in taking credit for things,
00:13:19 and they weren’t searching for the limelight.
00:13:22 They were really very self-effacing apostles.
00:13:26 Matthew wrote the first inspired book
00:13:30 —the first inspired history of Jesus Christ.
00:13:33 Do we see Matthew’s picture on every other page?
00:13:36 Matthew giving a public talk?
00:13:38 Matthew performing a miracle?
00:13:40 Matthew shepherding?
00:13:42 No, his name is only mentioned twice in the whole Gospel,
00:13:47 and both times
00:13:49 he describes himself as a tax collector
00:13:51 —not a very flattering portrayal.
00:13:54 And what about the apostle John?
00:13:57 The name John appears 23 times
00:14:00 in his Gospel,
00:14:02 but it never refers to the apostle John.
00:14:07 It almost always refers to John the Baptist.
00:14:11 When the apostles and older men met to consider the matter of circumcision,
00:14:14 was that an important meeting?
00:14:16 Would you agree that that was a landmark meeting?
00:14:20 The apostles and older men are there.
00:14:22 Who presided?
00:14:24 Who of the 12 was jockeying for position?
00:14:28 James, the brother of Jesus, wasn’t even an apostle.
00:14:31 He’s the one who presided.
00:14:33 And then later on when the decision was made,
00:14:37 who announced the decision?
00:14:39 Again, James.
00:14:41 You don’t find Peter or John saying:
00:14:43 “Well, you know, this is a pretty important decision.
00:14:45 We think that one of us should announce it.”
00:14:49 The apostles had learned their lesson.
00:14:53 Well, remember that when the circuit overseer visits.
00:14:56 You may have heavy responsibilities at Bethel,
00:15:00 but when he visits a congregation, he’s in charge that week.
00:15:05 Follow his direction.
00:15:07 Don’t be critical of the circuit overseer,
00:15:10 and don’t be afraid to let him know how much you appreciate his service.
00:15:13 And you know, our Bethel families here in the United States
00:15:16 are such a wonderful example of that.
00:15:18 When the circuit overseers first visit a Bethel congregation,
00:15:21 they’re a little bit nervous for about ten minutes.
00:15:25 But the Bethel family shows
00:15:28 that they appreciate the counsel so much,
00:15:31 and sometimes they talk about the circuit overseer’s counsel
00:15:35 for weeks after his visit.
00:15:37 They really deeply appreciate the visit of the circuit overseer,
00:15:41 and they respect that man.
00:15:43 And we know that you’re going to do the same.
00:15:47 Humble people are happy to contribute to the Kingdom work in any way they can,
00:15:51 just so they can contribute.
00:15:53 They’re not hung up on privileges.
00:15:55 They’re not hung up on prestige or on position.
00:15:59 They don’t seek the limelight.
00:16:02 And in this regard, we’re going to talk a little bit about the apostle Paul.
00:16:06 Now, Brother Lippold mentioned in his talk
00:16:08 that Paul was not a man to boast, and that’s quite true.
00:16:13 Actually, Paul was a very humble man.
00:16:16 Now, think about this: At the time Paul was converted,
00:16:20 about 34 C.E.,
00:16:24 Jesus told Ananias
00:16:26 that Paul was going to have a wonderful privilege.
00:16:29 Let’s read about it in Acts chapter 9.
00:16:34 Acts 9:15
00:16:46 —Acts 9:15 (and this is Jesus to Ananias):
00:16:51 “But the Lord said to him: ‘Go! because this man
00:16:55 “‘is a chosen vessel to me
00:16:58 “‘to bear my name to the nations
00:17:00 as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.’”
00:17:05 “A chosen vessel.”
00:17:07 How about that!
00:17:09 How did Paul react?
00:17:11 Did he let that go to his head?
00:17:14 Did he immediately go up to Jerusalem
00:17:16 and volunteer to be on the governing body, saying,
00:17:18 “Well, now that I’m anointed, I can be on the governing body”?
00:17:22 No.
00:17:23 He stayed where he was in Damascus,
00:17:25 and he kept preaching the good news.
00:17:28 Now, in 36 C.E., he did go up to world headquarters in Jerusalem.
00:17:33 And how did he react?
00:17:35 Did he say: “Here I am, the chosen vessel.
00:17:38 I’m here to help you run the place”?
00:17:42 He stayed with the apostle Peter for a couple of weeks.
00:17:45 Apparently, Peter had moved to Jerusalem.
00:17:48 But he kept preaching.
00:17:50 He just put his head to the ground, and he kept preaching the good news
00:17:55 until one day Jesus appeared to him
00:17:59 when Paul was in the temple.
00:18:02 And he told Paul that he had to leave Jerusalem immediately
00:18:07 because the Jews were out to kill him.
00:18:10 How did Paul react?
00:18:12 Did he say: “But the governing body is going to need me.
00:18:16 “If I leave, how will they manage without me?
00:18:20 They need my wisdom”?
00:18:23 Paul obeyed theocratic direction,
00:18:26 and he left.
00:18:28 He accepted a new assignment
00:18:31 —Tarsus.
00:18:34 Tarsus?
00:18:36 What kind of assignment is that for a chosen vessel?
00:18:40 It was out in the boondocks.
00:18:43 It was 500 miles (800 km) from the governing body in Jerusalem.
00:18:48 How would the governing body get to know his wonderful qualities
00:18:52 if he was 500 miles (800 km) from Jerusalem?
00:18:55 Paul went to Tarsus, and he kept preaching.
00:19:00 We don’t even know if there was a congregation of Tarsus
00:19:03 when Paul got there.
00:19:05 But Paul kept preaching.
00:19:07 I was thinking of the lovely interview we just heard
00:19:10 where the brother talked about how he eventually ended up in the circuit work.
00:19:14 But before that time, Jehovah gave him a little training.
00:19:20 And perhaps that’s what happened to the apostle Paul.
00:19:22 Do you know that Paul may have remained in Tarsus
00:19:27 for eight years preaching?
00:19:32 And then Barnabas came along
00:19:36 11 years after Paul’s conversion.
00:19:39 Barnabas came along and invited him to Antioch.
00:19:43 And from that time on, Paul started to have privileges.
00:19:47 And five years after that,
00:19:49 Paul wrote his first inspired letter
00:19:53 that we cherish to this day.
00:19:56 Paul worked hard all his life.
00:19:58 He did more than any of the 12 apostles,
00:20:01 but he was never upset that he wasn’t counted among them.
00:20:05 Paul appreciated the privileges he had.
00:20:09 He viewed them as undeserved kindness.
00:20:12 And we know that you brothers and sisters are going to do the same.
00:20:15 You’re invited to conduct a meeting for field service
00:20:19 —treasure the privilege.
00:20:21 Any privilege that you receive,
00:20:23 treasure it as an expression of love from Jehovah.
00:20:28 Well, when you go to your assignments,
00:20:31 many situations are going to test your humility.
00:20:34 And I know that you brothers and sisters are going to pass the test.
00:20:39 The branch asks you to work on a project,
00:20:42 and deep down you don’t quite agree with it.
00:20:45 Deep down, you really wonder if it’s going to work,
00:20:48 and you wonder if it’s not going to be a waste of your time.
00:20:52 But you’re not going to put it on the back burner and say,
00:20:55 “Well, I’ll get to it someday if I get time.”
00:20:57 You’re not going to do that.
00:20:59 You’re going to put heart and soul into the project.
00:21:02 You’re going to pray to Jehovah to bless the project,
00:21:06 the project that you didn’t quite agree with.
00:21:11 Or if you’re asked to make a recommendation
00:21:14 and you favor one option over another,
00:21:18 humility is going to move you to present all of the options,
00:21:23 all of the pros and cons equally.
00:21:26 You’re not going to slant things, thinking:
00:21:28 ‘Well, you know, I’m going to have to help these brothers to make this decision.
00:21:32 ‘So I’ll put a really heavy weight on the pros,
00:21:35 and I’m going to make it really light on the cons.’
00:21:37 Don’t do that.
00:21:38 I know that you’re going to present everything honestly,
00:21:41 and you’re going to recognize that it’s the holy spirit
00:21:43 that helps brothers to make decisions.
00:21:47 Trust the spirit to move the brothers to do the right thing.
00:21:52 Suppose you sisters are working on a team
00:21:55 or you brothers are working on a body of elders.
00:21:59 I know that not even in your heart of hearts
00:22:02 are you going to think that you have the best judgment on the team
00:22:06 and that, well, you can listen politely to the expressions of others
00:22:10 but, really, yours is the only sensible conclusion,
00:22:13 and you hope that the brothers and sisters are going to go along with you.
00:22:18 You’re not going to think that, because nobody is right all the time.
00:22:23 Jehovah’s spirit can work on any member of the team.
00:22:27 Don’t get discouraged if every suggestion you make in a meeting
00:22:32 gets shot down.
00:22:34 It happens to the best of us.
00:22:36 And there will be other meetings,
00:22:38 and hopefully some of them will go better for you.
00:22:42 Don’t get discouraged, and don’t decide: “Well, I’m not going to say anything anymore.
00:22:46 I’m not going to contribute anymore.”
00:22:48 Be humble and recognize that at times
00:22:52 we may make suggestions that don’t make very much sense.
00:22:56 I certainly appreciate the kind way the Governing Body deals with me
00:23:01 with some of my lamebrained suggestions.
00:23:05 In your comments and your assignments on the midweek meeting,
00:23:08 use the knowledge you’ve gained at Gilead to build up.
00:23:12 And I know you won’t proofread the meetings.
00:23:16 ‘I don’t think that was a good illustration.
00:23:19 ‘That scripture wasn’t applied right.
00:23:21 That isn’t the right word.’
00:23:22 You won’t do that.
00:23:24 Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meetings.
00:23:28 Take in the spiritual food.
00:23:30 Rejoice in whatever the brothers and sisters have prepared for you.
00:23:36 Well, I haven’t told you anything you don’t already know.
00:23:40 You’re all humble people.
00:23:42 These are just reminders that all of us need.
00:23:46 All of us are humble most of the time.
00:23:51 We pray for the day when we’ll be humble all of the time.
00:23:55 And in the meantime, let’s work on it, you and I.
00:23:59 Let’s work on it together.
00:24:01 Let’s follow the course of humility.
00:24:04 If we do, we’ll continue
00:24:08 to be used by Jehovah.
00:24:10 We love you.
00:24:12 May Jehovah bless you richly.
00:24:24 Well, thank you very much, Brother Splane,
00:24:27 for the excellent Scriptural examples in that talk
00:24:30 (including, above all, Jehovah’s example)
00:24:33 and for the reminders that humble people follow rules
00:24:37 and that humble people, though, are reasonable
00:24:40 —beautiful reminders and examples through that talk.
00:24:44 Well, now for the presentation of the diplomas.
00:24:48 And I will be assisted in this
00:24:51 by Brother William Malenfant, a helper to the Teaching Committee.

00:27:51 Brother Weaver has been appointed to serve on the Branch Committee.
00:28:12 OK. Well, that was wonderful to share in.
00:28:15 Now they’re graduates.
00:28:17 So at this time, we’re pleased to present
00:28:21 the graduates of the 151st class of Gilead.
00:28:42 There’s a lot of love here today.
00:28:44 That’s wonderful.
00:28:46 Well, we have a letter to be presented
00:28:50 by one of the now graduates of the 151st class.
00:28:53 Brother Davide Vita
00:28:57 from Italy and going to Albania will read that now at this time.
00:29:07 “To the Governing Body and Bethel family.
00:29:10 “Dear Brothers: For the past five months,
00:29:13 “we have traveled through the Bible from the first page to the last.
00:29:18 “We experienced the heat of the Sinai
00:29:21 “and found ourselves in the depths of the Red Sea,
00:29:25 “in the narrow alleys of Jerusalem,
00:29:28 “and high up on Mount Hermon.
00:29:31 “We met the prophets, visited the temple,
00:29:36 “saw the awesome celestial chariot,
00:29:39 “and enjoyed the precious company of Jesus and the apostles.
00:29:44 “What is the result of our journey?
00:29:47 “The very same that resulted for Job
00:29:50 “after he encountered his God —great astonishment!
00:29:55 “Although he recognized that he would only be able to understand
00:29:59 “‘just the fringes of his ways,’
00:30:02 “it was enough to make him marvel at Jehovah.
00:30:06 “‘Now I know that you are able to do all things.’
00:30:10 “At the same time, the experience humbled him
00:30:14 “so that he ‘put [his] hand over [his] mouth.’
00:30:17 “That is how we feel today.
00:30:20 “Gilead leaves us in its wake,
00:30:23 “filled with awe, humility, and gratitude.
00:30:27 “Studying the Bible is studying about Jehovah himself.
00:30:32 “And what we have learned has impressed on our hearts
00:30:35 “the depth of Jehovah’s love for each one of his servants.
00:30:40 “We saw this love not only in numerous Bible accounts
00:30:44 “but in those who imitate him and his Son, Jesus
00:30:47 “—the Governing Body, our guest instructors,
00:30:51 “our Gilead instructors, and the Bethel family
00:30:55 “here at Patterson and the other complexes.
00:30:58 “Your example is the living answer
00:31:01 “to the question of how to define Christian love.
00:31:05 “We express our heartfelt thanks to you, the Governing Body,
00:31:09 “and all those who made this unforgettable experience possible.
00:31:15 “We know that our divine education is not our possession alone.
00:31:19 “We received it to share it.
00:31:21 “The end of Gilead School for our class is the close of a chapter.
00:31:26 “And we are determined to write the next chapter of our story
00:31:31 “by showing the same love
00:31:33 “and personal interest we have experienced.
00:31:36 “It is our prayer that as we apply what we have been taught,
00:31:41 “we inspire others and make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.
00:31:46 “As the psalmist expressed at Psalm 106:48:
00:31:51 “‘May Jehovah . . . be praised throughout all eternity. . . . Praise Jah!’
00:31:57 Your brothers and sisters, the 151st class of Gilead.”
00:32:11 Thank you for that beautiful letter.
00:32:13 And those heartfelt expressions are something we will remember too.
00:32:19 Well, in closing, we just have a few things to say to you now.
00:32:22 You are graduates
00:32:24 —graduates of the 151st class of Gilead.
00:32:28 I used the word “students” a few times earlier on
00:32:30 because you didn’t have a diploma in hand yet.
00:32:32 Now you have them.
00:32:34 And that’s just such an encouraging and wonderful thing to see.
00:32:37 You may know that back in 2011,
00:32:40 the Governing Body adjusted the objective
00:32:43 of Gilead School training a bit.
00:32:46 Now the training is even more focused
00:32:48 on strengthening and stabilizing
00:32:50 the field and branch organization.
00:32:54 Since that time, a good number of graduates
00:32:56 have been appointed to a Branch or a Country Committee.
00:33:00 And so with Jehovah’s blessing, the training is working.
00:33:04 But not all graduates from Gilead
00:33:06 are brothers who may someday receive such responsibilities.
00:33:11 We have many sisters in each class too, don’t we?
00:33:15 So then, how might the goal
00:33:17 of strengthening and stabilizing the field and branch organization
00:33:21 be reached through each one of you
00:33:23 graduating brothers and sisters?
00:33:26 Well, the goal is reached when others can look at what you do and say
00:33:31 and they see a man or woman of strong faith.
00:33:35 Just as Paul wrote at 1 Thessalonians 1:8,
00:33:39 where he said in part:
00:33:41 “Not only has the word of [God] sounded out from you . . .
00:33:45 “but your faith in God
00:33:47 has spread abroad in every place.”
00:33:50 And that’s exactly what happens, isn’t it?
00:33:53 Yes, such examples are priceless.
00:33:56 Your schooling was designed to strengthen your faith,
00:33:59 and we’re confident that it has done just that.
00:34:02 You are ready for what is ahead.
00:34:04 Our faith keeps us strong, though.
00:34:07 And at 1 John 5:4, the apostle John wrote:
00:34:10 “This is the conquest that has conquered the world,
00:34:13 our faith,” right?
00:34:16 With that in mind, for just a few minutes
00:34:19 let’s consider how you can keep your faith strong
00:34:22 when you get to your assignments,
00:34:24 so that you can be that powerful force for good
00:34:28 in strengthening and stabilizing the field and branch organization.
00:34:32 So when you’re settled into your assignments, perhaps with new responsibilities,
00:34:37 remember to remain focused on what is most important,
00:34:41 namely, the doing of God’s will.
00:34:44 What could cause a person to forget this if not careful?
00:34:48 Well, we get into danger if we ever start to feel
00:34:53 like we have achieved everything
00:34:56 that we’ve wanted to achieve as our spiritual goals.
00:34:59 See, if we allow that to happen,
00:35:02 our interest could turn to other things.
00:35:05 We never want to allow that to happen.
00:35:07 We want to remain focused on Jehovah —his work.
00:35:09 It’s always about Jehovah and helping other people.
00:35:14 Never become distracted by losing sight of the need
00:35:18 to keep advancing spiritually day by day.
00:35:21 Never become content with what this empty system of things has to offer.
00:35:25 Remain fixed on Jehovah’s promises and on the doing of his will.
00:35:29 Keep your “large shield of faith” strong.
00:35:34 In Bible times, soldiers repaired their shields between battles.
00:35:39 If a soldier found damage or weakness to his shield,
00:35:42 he diligently made the needed repairs.
00:35:45 In this way, he was always ready to fight the next battle.
00:35:49 He never let down his guard.
00:35:52 We need to keep this up in a spiritual way.
00:35:54 Over time, a brother or sister might lay down his or her shield of faith
00:35:59 and go after things that have no lasting value.
00:36:02 The Devil wants nothing more than to see us neglect our faith,
00:36:07 because that will pull everything down if he can do that.
00:36:11 We show that we’re strengthening our faith in God
00:36:15 when we take time to give attention to our spiritual need.
00:36:19 The basics always count.
00:36:21 The basics always count.
00:36:24 So then be certain to regularly attend Christian meetings
00:36:28 (which we know you’ll do and soon in person—right?),
00:36:31 to zealously speak to others about Jehovah’s name and his Kingdom,
00:36:35 to maintain strong faith by reading God’s Word every day,
00:36:39 and then to apply its counsel prayerfully in all that you do.
00:36:45 Those are the basics that never fail us
00:36:48 and help us to keep our faith strong.
00:36:50 So in summary, don’t take liberties with your spiritual routine
00:36:54 now that you’ve graduated from this wonderful, beautiful school.
00:36:57 Never neglect those basic things.
00:36:59 Never become self-satisfied because of resting
00:37:02 on a privilege that you may come to enjoy.
00:37:06 And finally, keep growing as a godly person
00:37:10 because you remember how kind Jehovah has been to you and to all of us.
00:37:15 Be like the diligent soldier who worked hard
00:37:18 to care for that shield and all of his vital armor.
00:37:23 As you remain focused on what Gilead School has now strengthened you to do,
00:37:28 you will always be ready
00:37:30 to “fight the fine fight of the faith.”
00:37:33 As mentioned earlier, we have confidence that you will do just that.
00:37:38 May Jehovah and his dear Son bless you
00:37:42 —each one of you— for it.

00:00:01 Do you want to be loved by others?
00:00:05 Naturally, we all want to be loved.
00:00:09 Love is a basic human need.
00:00:12 Babies thrive on it. Teenagers thrive on it.
00:00:15 Marriage mates thrive on it.
00:00:17 Bethelites and Gilead students thrive on it.
00:00:20 It makes us happy to be loved.
00:00:24 What about loving others?
00:00:26 Love is unselfish.
00:00:28 Loving others makes the receivers happy,
00:00:31 but it also makes us as givers happy.
00:00:35 Love is the reason why we exist.
00:00:39 Jehovah created us out of unselfish love
00:00:43 to let us share not only life
00:00:45 but also the privilege to love him.
00:00:49 Jehovah does not need our love since he does not depend on anybody else,
00:00:53 but he appreciates our love.
00:00:56 He loves to be loved by us.
00:01:00 He created us also with the ability
00:01:03 to love others besides him.
00:01:06 We love to do good to others.
00:01:08 We love to love them.
00:01:12 Since when does love exist?
00:01:15 It always existed.
00:01:17 It had no beginning.
00:01:20 Why?
00:01:21 Because “God is love.”
00:01:23 And we know God had no beginning,
00:01:26 so God’s love had no beginning.
00:01:30 There was no time in the past when God existed but love did not.
00:01:35 Jehovah not only has love,
00:01:37 but he is love personified.
00:01:42 Jehovah created us in his image.
00:01:45 This is why we have this superb privilege
00:01:48 to reflect his love.
00:01:52 In the world, books, movies, and songs often deal with love.
00:01:56 But what kind of love?
00:01:58 Usually romantic love—love that often fails.
00:02:03 Genuine love of God and of neighbor
00:02:05 is widely lacking today.
00:02:08 When describing “the last days,”
00:02:11 the prophecy at 2 Timothy 3:2 has come true
00:02:15 that people are often “lovers of themselves.”
00:02:20 Me-ism and egotism is widespread.
00:02:24 One journal carries the title Self.
00:02:28 People think, ‘First me, then nothing,
00:02:31 and then me again, and then perhaps somebody else.’
00:02:36 At 2 Timothy 3:2, Paul also wrote
00:02:40 that people would be “lovers of money.”
00:02:44 In the same prophecy, it says that the majority
00:02:47 would be “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”
00:02:52 For many, entertainment and sports
00:02:55 have become the dominant aspect of their lives.
00:02:59 Furthermore, 1 John 2:15 indicates
00:03:02 that there is a battle between two loves
00:03:06 —love of Jehovah and love of the world.
00:03:10 The stronger our love for Jehovah is,
00:03:12 the better we will be able to resist the love of the world.
00:03:18 At Matthew 22:37,
00:03:20 Jesus encouraged cultivating love for God
00:03:23 to the fullest extent possible.
00:03:27 “You must love Jehovah your God
00:03:31 “with your whole heart and with your whole soul
00:03:34 and with your whole mind.”
00:03:37 How does love for Jehovah grow?
00:03:40 We must tend to the good soil of our heart
00:03:43 where the seed of Kingdom truth was sown.
00:03:48 How does love between two persons grow?
00:03:52 One way is by communication.
00:03:55 We communicate with Jehovah through prayer.
00:03:59 Jehovah communicates with us
00:04:01 through the Bible and his organization.
00:04:05 If we study the Bible and read it daily
00:04:08 as well as attend the congregation meetings,
00:04:11 our love for him will continue to grow.
00:04:15 Love needs to grow.
00:04:18 It is not a matter of how much we know
00:04:21 but how much we love what we know.
00:04:25 Head knowledge is not enough.
00:04:28 There needs to be heart knowledge.
00:04:32 Growing in love is a process.
00:04:35 A plant grows when it is watered;
00:04:37 love grows if it is watered with the water of truth.
00:04:42 At Philippians 1:9, Paul says:
00:04:47 “And this is what I continue praying,
00:04:49 that your love may abound yet more and more.”
00:04:55 Love grows gradually.
00:04:57 It is not enough to have a little love;
00:05:00 we should abound in love.
00:05:03 Jehovah sets the example.
00:05:05 He expressed his love by providing the ransom.
00:05:10 In Matthew chapter 18,
00:05:12 Jesus compares Jehovah with a king who was willing to forgive a debt
00:05:17 of 60 million denarii,
00:05:20 or 10,000 silver talents.
00:05:23 This certainly impresses his love for us.
00:05:28 Jesus expressed his love by being willing
00:05:30 to die for our sins.
00:05:33 This stirs our love in return.
00:05:35 The more one has been forgiven, the more one will love.
00:05:40 But love is not dependent on having one’s sins forgiven.
00:05:45 Jesus loved Jehovah so much
00:05:48 but had not a single sin that needed to be forgiven.
00:05:53 But he loved Jehovah, and he loved us.
00:05:57 The night before he died, he said at John 14:31:
00:06:02 “I love the Father.”
00:06:05 Do we not (all of us) feel the same?
00:06:09 How can we demonstrate our love of God in return?
00:06:15 We can do so by serving Jehovah with all our heart.
00:06:20 This includes preaching and teaching.
00:06:24 True or false?
00:06:26 The most important reason for preaching and teaching is
00:06:29 love of neighbor.
00:06:31 It sounds good, but it is wrong.
00:06:35 The most important motive for preaching
00:06:37 is, first of all, love for Jehovah.
00:06:40 And the most important objective
00:06:43 is to praise Jehovah.
00:06:46 We want to glorify him and to support the vindication of his sovereignty.
00:06:52 Love of neighbor comes second.
00:06:55 But we also need to show love to our brothers.
00:06:58 In one congregation, several sisters
00:07:01 took daily turns to prepare a hot meal
00:07:04 for a quadriplegic brother.
00:07:07 This shows that our love extends beyond preaching.
00:07:11 It is like with the parable of the Samaritan
00:07:15 who cared for the man who was assaulted and hurt by robbers.
00:07:19 The Samaritan did not preach to the man who fell among the robbers.
00:07:23 He just showed unselfish love to him.
00:07:28 Jesus emphasized that our neighborly love
00:07:30 should include even enemies.
00:07:34 At Matthew 5:44, he said:
00:07:38 “I say to you: Continue to love your enemies
00:07:41 and to pray for those persecuting you.”
00:07:46 Our love will be perfect
00:07:48 if we love even our enemies.
00:07:51 Jehovah gives sunshine and rain
00:07:54 even to wicked opposers.
00:07:56 One publisher went to a hospital to visit an opposing husband.
00:08:01 The man appreciated this kind gesture very much.
00:08:07 Think of what Jesus has endured.
00:08:10 He was hated without cause, persecuted, reviled, and murdered.
00:08:15 Help people to develop their appreciation
00:08:18 for what Jesus did for us.
00:08:22 Show interested ones that because of the ransom,
00:08:25 Jehovah forgives us our sins
00:08:28 and opens the way to everlasting life.
00:08:32 When you talk about the ransom, don’t do it just in a legalistic way
00:08:36 by saying: “See, like on scales,
00:08:39 “on one side was Adam and on the other side was Jesus.
00:08:44 “God’s justice required that by giving his life,
00:08:46 Jesus restored what Adam had lost.”
00:08:50 Rather, make the student meditate
00:08:53 and develop heart appreciation and love for what Jesus did.
00:08:57 Review with a student what Jesus went through prior to his execution.
00:09:02 Help him picture in his mind how Jesus was flogged,
00:09:06 producing quivering ribbons of bleeding flesh.
00:09:11 Help the student sense how Jesus was mocked.
00:09:15 After his tortured beating,
00:09:18 soldiers said to him mockingly:
00:09:20 “Good day, you King of the Jews!”
00:09:24 Also, they spit on him and slapped him in the face.
00:09:30 Remind the student how the soldiers later pounded large nails
00:09:34 into his hands and into his feet.
00:09:37 With the stake swung upright, the pain was excruciating,
00:09:41 for the weight of the body tore all the nail wounds.
00:09:46 Yet, rather than threaten, Jesus prayed for the Roman soldiers:
00:09:51 “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
00:09:57 Meditating on what Jesus did for us,
00:10:00 does this not greatly deepen our love for him?
00:10:05 At Ephesians 3:19, Paul wrote:
00:10:08 “The love of the Christ . . . surpasses knowledge.”
00:10:13 It is not the love for the Christ but the love that Jesus displayed
00:10:18 that surpasses head knowledge
00:10:20 and strikes a wonderful chord in our figurative heart.
00:10:25 Jesus’ course stimulates a response in us.
00:10:29 As we think about what Christ has done for us,
00:10:32 our love for him deepens.
00:10:34 In fact, 2 Corinthians 5:14 says:
00:10:38 “For the love the Christ has compels us.”
00:10:43 After mentioning gifts of the spirit, such as healing and speaking in tongues,
00:10:48 Paul explained at 1 Corinthians 12:31:
00:10:52 “Yet I will show you a surpassing way.”
00:10:56 What is this “way”?
00:10:58 The way of love.
00:11:02 In what way is it surpassing?
00:11:05 In the sense that the gifts of the spirit,
00:11:07 including prophesying, would be “done away with.”
00:11:11 But love would always be there.
00:11:14 Jehovah is eternal.
00:11:17 His love will never fail, never end,
00:11:20 but will continue forever and ever and ever.
00:11:26 Therefore, Paul wrote: “There remain
00:11:29 “faith, hope, love, these three;
00:11:32 but the greatest of these is love.”
00:11:36 He also wrote: “Love never fails.”
00:11:40 Love “endures all things.”
00:11:43 Many brothers suffered a lot during World War II
00:11:46 and also today in Russia and other countries.
00:11:49 Today, there are a number of governments in the world that suppress the truth.
00:11:54 As we live in the time of the end, this is not surprising to us.
00:11:58 It will get worse as the great tribulation comes closer.
00:12:03 World conditions are also getting worse in many parts of the world,
00:12:07 and COVID has claimed many human victims.
00:12:11 But we Witnesses keep enduring
00:12:14 by pursuing the surpassing way of love
00:12:18 that never fails.
00:12:19 We shall not only live forever
00:12:22 but also love forever and be loved forever.

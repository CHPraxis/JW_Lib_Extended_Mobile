00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:05.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to be loved by others?

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:09.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally, we all want to be loved.

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is a basic human need.

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babies thrive on it.
Teenagers thrive on it.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marriage mates thrive on it.

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethelites and Gilead students thrive on it.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes us happy to be loved.

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:26.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about loving others?

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is unselfish.

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:31.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loving others makes the receivers happy,

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it also makes us as givers happy.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is the reason why we exist.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:43.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created us out of unselfish love

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:45.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let us share not only life

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also the privilege to love him.

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:53.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not need our love
since he does not depend on anybody else,

00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:56.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he appreciates our love.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves to be loved by us.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
He created us also with the ability

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love others besides him.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to do good to others.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to love them.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since when does love exist?

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
It always existed.

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had no beginning.

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:21.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because “God is love.”

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know God had no beginning,

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
so God’s love had no beginning.

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no time in the past
when God existed but love did not.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah not only has love,

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:41.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he is love personified.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created us in his image.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is why we have this superb privilege

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reflect his love.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:56.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world, books, movies, and songs
often deal with love.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what kind of love?

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:03.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually romantic love—love that often fails.

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:05.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine love of God and of neighbor

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:08.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
is widely lacking today.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
When describing “the last days,”

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:15.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophecy at 2 Timothy 3:2 has come true

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people are often “lovers of themselves.”

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:23.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me-ism and egotism is widespread.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:28.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
One journal carries the title <i>Self.</i>

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:31.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
People think, ‘First me, then nothing,

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:35.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then me again,
and then perhaps somebody else.’

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Timothy 3:2, Paul also wrote

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people would be “lovers of money.”

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same prophecy,
it says that the majority

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be “lovers of pleasures
rather than lovers of God.”

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:55.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
For many, entertainment and sports

00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
have become the dominant aspect
of their lives.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:02.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Furthermore, 1 John 2:15 indicates

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is a battle between two loves

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:10.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love of Jehovah and love of the world.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stronger our love for Jehovah is,

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:16.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
the better we will be able to resist
the love of the world.

00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:20.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 22:37,

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:23.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus encouraged cultivating love for God

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the fullest extent possible.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:34.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:36.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with your whole mind.”

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does love for Jehovah grow?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must tend to the good soil of our heart

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the seed of Kingdom truth was sown.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does love between two persons grow?

00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is by communication.

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:59.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
We communicate with Jehovah through prayer.

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:01.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah communicates with us

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the Bible and his organization.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we study the Bible and read it daily

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as attend the congregation meetings,

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for him will continue to grow.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love needs to grow.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not a matter of how much we know

00:04:21.778 --> 00:04:24.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how much we love what we know.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Head knowledge is not enough.

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
There needs to be heart knowledge.

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:35.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing in love is a process.

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:37.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
A plant grows when it is watered;

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:42.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
love grows if it is watered
with the water of truth.

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:46.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 1:9, Paul says:

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this is what I continue praying,

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your love may abound yet more and more.”

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love grows gradually.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not enough to have a little love;

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should abound in love.

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:05.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sets the example.

00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
He expressed his love
by providing the ransom.

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:12.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Matthew chapter 18,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:17.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus compares Jehovah with a king
who was willing to forgive a debt

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 60 million denarii,

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:23.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 10,000 silver talents.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
This certainly impresses his love for us.

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus expressed his love by being willing

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
to die for our sins.

00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:35.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
This stirs our love in return.

00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more one has been forgiven,
the more one will love.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
But love is not dependent
on having one’s sins forgiven.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus loved Jehovah so much

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had not a single sin
that needed to be forgiven.

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he loved Jehovah, and he loved us.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
The night before he died,
he said at John 14:31:

00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:05.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love the Father.”

00:06:05.214 --> 00:06:08.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we not (all of us) feel the same?

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:14.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we demonstrate
our love of God in return?

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do so by serving Jehovah
with all our heart.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes preaching and teaching.

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:26.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
True or false?

00:06:26.002 --> 00:06:29.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most important reason
for preaching and teaching is

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
love of neighbor.

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:35.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sounds good, but it is wrong.

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most important motive for preaching

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
is, first of all, love for Jehovah.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the most important objective

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to praise Jehovah.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:51.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to glorify him and to support
the vindication of his sovereignty.

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:55.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love of neighbor comes second.

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:58.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also need to show love
to our brothers.

00:06:58.534 --> 00:07:01.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one congregation, several sisters

00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
took daily turns to prepare a hot meal

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a quadriplegic brother.

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
This shows that our love
extends beyond preaching.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is like with the parable of the Samaritan

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cared for the man
who was assaulted and hurt by robbers.

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:23.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Samaritan did not preach to the man
who fell among the robbers.

00:07:23.493 --> 00:07:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just showed unselfish love to him.

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus emphasized that our neighborly love

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
should include even enemies.

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:36.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 5:44, he said:

00:07:38.407 --> 00:07:41.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I say to you: Continue to love your enemies

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to pray for those persecuting you.”

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:48.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love will be perfect

00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we love even our enemies.

00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives sunshine and rain

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:56.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
even to wicked opposers.

00:07:56.993 --> 00:08:01.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
One publisher went to a hospital
to visit an opposing husband.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man appreciated this kind gesture
very much.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of what Jesus has endured.

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:14.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was hated without cause,
persecuted, reviled, and murdered.

00:08:15.511 --> 00:08:18.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help people to develop their appreciation

00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what Jesus did for us.

00:08:22.618 --> 00:08:25.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show interested ones
that because of the ransom,

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:28.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah forgives us our sins

00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:31.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and opens the way to everlasting life.

00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:36.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you talk about the ransom,
don’t do it just in a legalistic way

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
by saying: “See, like on scales,

00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:44.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on one side was Adam
and on the other side was Jesus.

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God’s justice required
that by giving his life,

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:49.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus restored what Adam had lost.”

00:08:50.413 --> 00:08:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, make the student meditate

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:57.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and develop heart appreciation and love
for what Jesus did.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:02.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Review with a student what Jesus
went through prior to his execution.

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help him picture in his mind
how Jesus was flogged,

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:10.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
producing quivering ribbons
of bleeding flesh.

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:15.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help the student sense how Jesus was mocked.

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
After his tortured beating,

00:09:18.107 --> 00:09:20.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
soldiers said to him mockingly:

00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:23.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Good day, you King of the Jews!”

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:28.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, they spit on him
and slapped him in the face.

00:09:30.553 --> 00:09:34.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remind the student
how the soldiers later pounded large nails

00:09:34.557 --> 00:09:37.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
into his hands and into his feet.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the stake swung upright,
the pain was excruciating,

00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:46.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the weight of the body
tore all the nail wounds.

00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:51.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, rather than threaten,
Jesus prayed for the Roman soldiers:

00:09:51.107 --> 00:09:55.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Father, forgive them,
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on what Jesus did for us,

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:04.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
does this not greatly deepen
our love for him?

00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 3:19, Paul wrote:

00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:13.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The love of the Christ
. . . surpasses knowledge.”

00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not the love for the Christ
but the love that Jesus displayed

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
that surpasses head knowledge

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:24.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strikes a wonderful chord
in our figurative heart.

00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:29.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ course stimulates a response in us.

00:10:29.478 --> 00:10:32.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we think about what Christ
has done for us,

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for him deepens.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, 2 Corinthians 5:14 says:

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the love the Christ has compels us.”

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
After mentioning gifts of the spirit,
such as healing and speaking in tongues,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul explained at 1 Corinthians 12:31:

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:56.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet I will show you a surpassing way.”

00:10:56.772 --> 00:10:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is this “way”?

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way of love.

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:05.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way is it surpassing?

00:11:05.114 --> 00:11:07.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the sense that the gifts of the spirit,

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
including prophesying,
would be “done away with.”

00:11:11.287 --> 00:11:14.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
But love would always be there.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is eternal.

00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:20.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
His love will never fail, never end,

00:11:20.496 --> 00:11:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will continue forever and ever and ever.

00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:29.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, Paul wrote: “There remain

00:11:29.338 --> 00:11:32.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“faith, hope, love, these three;

00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:36.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the greatest of these is love.”

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:40.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also wrote: “Love never fails.”

00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love “endures all things.”

00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers suffered a lot
during World War II

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also today in Russia and other countries.

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:53.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are a number of governments
in the world that suppress the truth.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we live in the time of the end,
this is not surprising to us.

00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:03.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will get worse as the great tribulation
comes closer.

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:07.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
World conditions are also getting worse
in many parts of the world,

00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:11.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and COVID has claimed many human victims.

00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:14.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we Witnesses keep enduring

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
by pursuing the surpassing way of love

00:12:18.087 --> 00:12:19.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that never fails.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:22.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
We shall not only live forever

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:26.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also love forever and be loved forever.

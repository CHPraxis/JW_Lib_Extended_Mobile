WEBVTT

00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of you are humble people.

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you weren’t,
you would never have been invited to Gilead.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:15.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever noticed, though,
that where humility is concerned,

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do well in some situations

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not so well in others?

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:24.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
if someone commends us

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a good job
on a talk in the midweek meeting

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:31.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps a comment
on the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study,

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
we give all credit to Jehovah
and to the training we’ve received,

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s good.

00:00:38.054 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in other situations,

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might get into trouble.

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other situations,

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
our humility might be put to the test.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at Bethel,
as has been mentioned

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:54.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this program already,

00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all work with people;

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all work closely with others.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some of you sisters work on a team;
you work with others.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you brothers all have responsibilities

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:11.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation
or at Bethel or perhaps both.

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in all situations, humility is needed.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I thought that this morning

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might consider
what we can learn about humility

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah God

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the apostles of Jesus Christ.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, humility is a broad term,

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
so let’s narrow it down a little bit.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a couple
of aspects of humility,

00:01:38.648 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the first one I’m going to mention
might surprise you.

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:45.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i>
tells us that humility includes

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:48.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability to show mercy

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:52.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and compassion to others

00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:55.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the ability to show mercy

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:59.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and compassion to others—

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability to make exceptions
where that is warranted.

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:07.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s Jehovah, isn’t it?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah isn’t rigid.

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:17.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows when to make exceptions.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often did you read in the Bible
as you went through

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:23.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah reconsidered?

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah makes perfect rules,

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:30.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet at times he reconsiders.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s illustrate:

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:36.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites are getting ready
to conquer the Promised Land.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the first up is the city of Jericho.

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:41.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s a rule

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a rule of engagement—
and it’s very clear.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says:

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:50.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not make any covenant with them

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor show them any favor.”

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
No covenant, no favor
—that’s the rule.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:04.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a perfect rule
because it’s Jehovah’s rule.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua sent two spies into the city,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they went to the home
of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, wait a minute;

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:17.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s think about that.

00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:20.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pretty easy to say, isn’t it?

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua sent two spies into the city.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:28.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went into a house
of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we often think about the faith of Rahab.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:37.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the faith of those two spies?

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:41.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the faith
that it took for those men

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:46.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the Bible says they were young men)
to go into that city?

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:49.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if they were under 40 years of age,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were born in the wilderness.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many cities had they ever seen?

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Had they ever seen a city before?

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:06.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many actual houses had they entered?

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:10.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many foreigners had they ever met?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe not very many—maybe a couple
on the other side of the Jordan,

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not very many.

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:21.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now, as soon as they enter the city,
what happens?

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone calls the police.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re recognized right away.

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:27.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no wonder!

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:31.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
they weren’t dressed like Canaanites.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
You couldn’t order your clothes
from Amazon in those days, you know.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:39.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were dressed like Israelites.

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
They probably had on
40-year-old hand-me-downs

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:46.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their fathers
who had died in the desert.

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:51.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they didn’t look like Canaanites;
they didn’t blend in.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:56.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as soon as they opened their mouth,
people would say:

00:04:56.012 --> 00:04:58.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’re not from around here, are you?

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:01.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t speak the Canaanite language.”

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:04.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no wonder they were discovered.

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:07.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to get off the street.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to get out of sight.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you wonder if Jehovah
directed them to Rahab.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
You wonder if Jehovah
saw something in Rahab,

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
something in her heart
that he could work with.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or do you believe
that it was a coincidence

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the spies were led
to the only family in Jericho

00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:30.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was worth saving?

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:34.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be that Jehovah
was involved with that.

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:37.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Rahab decides

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she’s going to hide the spies,
but she has a condition.

00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’d like to turn
to Joshua chapter 2,

00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see what that condition was.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to read Joshua 2:13.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Rahab.

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:02.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we don’t know
how she communicated with them

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:04.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
—must have been a lot of sign language.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We heard about sign language a minute ago.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
There must have been
a lot of sign language going on

00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:12.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Canaanite language
wasn’t quite like Hebrew, you know.

00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:14.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
But anyway,
somehow they got the point across.

00:06:14.857 --> 00:06:17.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what she says in verse 13:

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:19.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must spare the lives

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of my father and mother,

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my brothers and sisters,

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all who belong to them,

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:31.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you must save us from death.”

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:33.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s she asking for?

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s asking for an exception.

00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:40.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a rule:

00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:44.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
You must not make any covenant with them;

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:48.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must not show them any favor.

00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:51.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she is asking for an exception
—and quite a broad exception.

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:54.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is asking not just for her own life

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for the lives of all
of her family members as well.

00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:01.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some might have thought
that she was pushing it.

00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:03.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she asked for that.

00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:08.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the spies showed favor to Rahab.

00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made an exception.

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they promised that when the time came,

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:16.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rahab and her family would be spared.

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible doesn’t criticize the spies
for making that exception.

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:24.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it may be that Jehovah
had something to do with it.

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:27.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Jehovah moved the spies
in that direction.

00:07:27.497 --> 00:07:32.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Jehovah saw something in Rahab
that he wanted to save.

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:36.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, later on, Joshua and the elders

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t follow instructions,

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:40.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they made a covenant
with the Gibeonites.

00:07:40.676 --> 00:07:42.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible does mention that,

00:07:42.678 --> 00:07:45.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it doesn’t mention this
when it comes to the spies here.

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made the exception.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we do know
that Jehovah agreed with that exception.

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:52.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know that?

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:56.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when he made
the walls of Jericho fall,

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:59.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
he preserved the section of the wall

00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Rahab’s family lived.

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:07.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah agreed to an exception

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his perfect rule.

00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:12.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know where I’m going with this.

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:16.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need rules.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:20.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most of the time,
a rule will satisfy our needs.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in a few cases,

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
it only makes sense
to make an exception to the rule.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m reminded of the time not too long ago

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:33.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Bethel family moved out of Brooklyn.

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there were a lot of Bethelites
in the congregations

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were elders and ministerial servants.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so a massive reorganization
of congregations

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:45.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
was necessary in New York City.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the elders and the circuit overseers

00:08:47.977 --> 00:08:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to make sure
that each congregation

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a balanced number of elders,
ministerial servants, and publishers.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so publishers were assigned
to various congregations.

00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:02.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine hundreds of thousands
of assignments that had to be made?

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:05.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so there was a rule,
and it was a pretty good rule,

00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:09.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the rule was:
“Go where you’re assigned.

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We don’t have time
to consider the personal feelings

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:16.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about every publisher in New York City,

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:19.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
so please go where you’re assigned.”

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:21.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the rule.

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:25.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there were two sisters (single sisters)

00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:28.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were assigned to a congregation.

00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t have a car,

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you couldn’t reach
the congregation they were assigned to

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:35.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
by public transportation.

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:40.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they were going to have to walk
to the Kingdom Hall,

00:09:40.196 --> 00:09:42.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the area
where the Kingdom Hall was located

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very dangerous.

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their safety would have been involved.

00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:54.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you had a rule
to go where you were assigned,

00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:58.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the circuit overseer
lovingly made an exception.

00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:02.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the point is, we do need rules.

00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:06.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most of the time,
our rules, even our imperfect rules,

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:09.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
will serve most of the brothers.

00:10:09.325 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s use common sense.

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:16.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are times
when we have to consider an exception.

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you think of anyone who is grateful

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah made
an exception for Rahab

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that she didn’t die in Jericho?

00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:25.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of someone?

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:27.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was mentioned in this program.

00:10:27.843 --> 00:10:31.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Boaz, the husband of Ruth.

00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:34.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rahab was his mother.

00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think of this:

00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:40.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Rahab had died in Jericho,

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
would there ever have been a David?

00:10:45.027 --> 00:10:47.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go on.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:50.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah directed
that seven nations in Canaan

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:54.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
were to be eliminated,
and the Gibeonites were among them.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they had a plan.

00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:58.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
They pretended to be from a far-off nation

00:10:58.674 --> 00:11:01.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wasn’t slated for destruction.

00:11:01.344 --> 00:11:05.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the elders,
not consulting Jehovah,

00:11:05.047 --> 00:11:08.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
made a vow that the Gibeonites
would be spared.

00:11:08.617 --> 00:11:10.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made a covenant with the Gibeonites.

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:13.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t long,
but what the Israelites realized

00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:15.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
is they’d been tricked.

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:19.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even though their oath
had been obtained under false pretenses,

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:21.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
they agreed to keep their word.

00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:24.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s what happens next
that’s interesting.

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:28.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Five kings of the Amorites find out

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Israelites and the Gibeonites
have made a covenant,

00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:33.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are furious.

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:38.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so they are determined
to kill all the Gibeonites,

00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:43.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was really what Jehovah
had intended in the first place.

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have said:
‘Well, that solves your problem.

00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:51.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You promised the Gibeonites
that you wouldn’t put them to death,

00:11:51.727 --> 00:11:54.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
so you can sit back
and let the Amorites do the job.’

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:57.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jehovah do?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua 10:8.

00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:06.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember, he had had a rule.

00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:09.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’d had a rule
that everyone was to be destroyed.

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:13.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua 10:8:

00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:19.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah then said to Joshua:

00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:23.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not be afraid of them,
for I have handed them over to you.

00:12:23.893 --> 00:12:28.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not one of them will be able
to stand against you.’”

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:32.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the humility.

00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:37.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helps the Israelites
to keep a promise

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had no business making.

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is humility.

00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:44.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk about Jesus’ apostles.

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can really learn humility
from them as well.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we often talk
about the disputes they had,

00:12:50.052 --> 00:12:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
but mostly that was before Pentecost.

00:12:52.721 --> 00:12:56.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about it,
after Pentecost was a different story.

00:12:56.325 --> 00:13:00.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we find out
about the apostles after Pentecost?

00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they weren’t interested
in taking credit for things,

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:06.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they weren’t searching for the limelight.

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were really very self-effacing apostles.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:14.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew wrote the first inspired book

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the first inspired history of Jesus Christ.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:20.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see Matthew’s picture
on every other page?

00:13:20.683 --> 00:13:22.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew giving a public talk?

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:24.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew performing a miracle?

00:13:24.687 --> 00:13:26.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew shepherding?

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:30.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, his name is only mentioned twice
in the whole Gospel,

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:33.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and both times

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
he describes himself as a tax collector

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:38.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not a very flattering portrayal.

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the apostle John?

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name John appears 23 times

00:13:44.673 --> 00:13:46.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his Gospel,

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:50.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it never refers to the apostle John.

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
It almost always refers to John the Baptist.

00:13:55.184 --> 00:13:58.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostles and older men met
to consider the matter of circumcision,

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that an important meeting?

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:04.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you agree
that that was a landmark meeting?

00:14:04.026 --> 00:14:06.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles and older men are there.

00:14:06.562 --> 00:14:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who presided?

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:12.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of the 12 was jockeying for position?

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:15.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
James, the brother of Jesus,
wasn’t even an apostle.

00:14:15.337 --> 00:14:17.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the one who presided.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then later on when the decision was made,

00:14:21.977 --> 00:14:23.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
who announced the decision?

00:14:23.979 --> 00:14:25.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, James.

00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t find Peter or John saying:

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:29.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, you know,
this is a pretty important decision.

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think that one of us should announce it.”

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:36.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles had learned their lesson.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember that
when the circuit overseer visits.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may have
heavy responsibilities at Bethel,

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when he visits a congregation,
he’s in charge that week.

00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow his direction.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be critical of the circuit overseer,

00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:57.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
and don’t be afraid to let him know
how much you appreciate his service.

00:14:57.947 --> 00:15:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know, our Bethel families
here in the United States

00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
are such a wonderful example of that.

00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:05.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the circuit overseers
first visit a Bethel congregation,

00:15:05.588 --> 00:15:09.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re a little bit nervous
for about ten minutes.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:12.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Bethel family shows

00:15:12.127 --> 00:15:15.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they appreciate the counsel so much,

00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:19.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes they talk
about the circuit overseer’s counsel

00:15:19.368 --> 00:15:21.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
for weeks after his visit.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really deeply appreciate
the visit of the circuit overseer,

00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:27.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they respect that man.

00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:31.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know
that you’re going to do the same.

00:15:31.447 --> 00:15:35.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble people are happy to contribute
to the Kingdom work in any way they can,

00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:37.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
just so they can contribute.

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:39.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not hung up on privileges.

00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:43.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not hung up
on prestige or on position.

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:46.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t seek the limelight.

00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this regard, we’re going to talk
a little bit about the apostle Paul.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Lippold mentioned in his talk

00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:57.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Paul was not a man to boast,
and that’s quite true.

00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, Paul was a very humble man.

00:16:00.743 --> 00:16:04.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about this:
At the time Paul was converted,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 34 C.E.,

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus told Ananias

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:13.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Paul was going
to have a wonderful privilege.

00:16:13.622 --> 00:16:16.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about it in Acts chapter 9.

00:16:18.293 --> 00:16:23.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 9:15

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:35.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Acts 9:15
(and this is Jesus to Ananias):

00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:39.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the Lord said to him:
‘Go! because this man

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:42.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘is a chosen vessel to me

00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to bear my name to the nations

00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:48.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.’”

00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A chosen vessel.”

00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:53.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about that!

00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:55.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Paul react?

00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he let that go to his head?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he immediately go up to Jerusalem

00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:02.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and volunteer to be
on the governing body, saying,

00:17:02.504 --> 00:17:05.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, now that I’m anointed,
I can be on the governing body”?

00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:07.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stayed where he was in Damascus,

00:17:09.812 --> 00:17:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he kept preaching the good news.

00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:17.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in 36 C.E., he did go up
to world headquarters in Jerusalem.

00:17:17.653 --> 00:17:19.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did he react?

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:22.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he say: “Here I am, the chosen vessel.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m here to help you run the place”?

00:17:26.562 --> 00:17:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stayed with the apostle Peter
for a couple of weeks.

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:32.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apparently, Peter had moved to Jerusalem.

00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:34.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he kept preaching.

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:39.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just put his head to the ground,
and he kept preaching the good news

00:17:39.608 --> 00:17:43.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
until one day Jesus appeared to him

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:46.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul was in the temple.

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:51.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he told Paul that he
had to leave Jerusalem immediately

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:54.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Jews were out to kill him.

00:17:54.523 --> 00:17:56.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Paul react?

00:17:56.525 --> 00:18:00.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he say:
“But the governing body is going to need me.

00:18:00.929 --> 00:18:04.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I leave, how will they manage without me?

00:18:04.733 --> 00:18:07.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need my wisdom”?

00:18:07.102 --> 00:18:10.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul obeyed theocratic direction,

00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:12.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he left.

00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:15.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
He accepted a new assignment

00:18:15.611 --> 00:18:17.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Tarsus.

00:18:18.714 --> 00:18:20.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tarsus?

00:18:20.716 --> 00:18:24.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of assignment is that
for a chosen vessel?

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was out in the boondocks.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:32.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was 500 miles (800 km)
from the governing body in Jerusalem.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:36.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would the governing body
get to know his wonderful qualities

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:38.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he was 500 miles (800 km) from Jerusalem?

00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:44.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul went to Tarsus,
and he kept preaching.

00:18:44.673 --> 00:18:47.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t even know
if there was a congregation of Tarsus

00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:49.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul got there.

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Paul kept preaching.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thinking of the lovely interview
we just heard

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the brother talked about how he
eventually ended up in the circuit work.

00:18:58.787 --> 00:19:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before that time,
Jehovah gave him a little training.

00:19:04.026 --> 00:19:06.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps that’s what happened
to the apostle Paul.

00:19:06.962 --> 00:19:11.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know that Paul
may have remained in Tarsus

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
for eight years preaching?

00:19:16.205 --> 00:19:20.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Barnabas came along

00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:23.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
11 years after Paul’s conversion.

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:27.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Barnabas came along
and invited him to Antioch.

00:19:27.382 --> 00:19:31.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from that time on,
Paul started to have privileges.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
And five years after that,

00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:37.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote his first inspired letter

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:39.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we cherish to this day.

00:19:39.995 --> 00:19:42.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul worked hard all his life.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:45.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did more than any of the 12 apostles,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was never upset
that he wasn’t counted among them.

00:19:49.338 --> 00:19:53.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul appreciated the privileges he had.

00:19:53.976 --> 00:19:56.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
He viewed them as undeserved kindness.

00:19:56.378 --> 00:19:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that you brothers and sisters
are going to do the same.

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:03.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re invited to conduct
a meeting for field service

00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:05.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
—treasure the privilege.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any privilege that you receive,

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:11.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
treasure it as an expression
of love from Jehovah.

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:14.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you go to your assignments,

00:20:14.997 --> 00:20:18.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
many situations are going
to test your humility.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:23.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know that you brothers and sisters
are going to pass the test.

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:26.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch asks you to work on a project,

00:20:26.675 --> 00:20:29.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deep down
you don’t quite agree with it.

00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:32.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep down,
you really wonder if it’s going to work,

00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:36.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you wonder if it’s not going
to be a waste of your time.

00:20:36.084 --> 00:20:39.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re not going to put it
on the back burner and say,

00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:41.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I’ll get to it someday if I get time.”

00:20:41.556 --> 00:20:43.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not going to do that.

00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:46.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to put
heart and soul into the project.

00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:50.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to pray to Jehovah
to bless the project,

00:20:50.532 --> 00:20:54.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
the project that you didn’t quite agree with.

00:20:55.904 --> 00:20:58.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or if you’re asked
to make a recommendation

00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:02.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you favor one option over another,

00:21:02.577 --> 00:21:07.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility is going to move you
to present all of the options,

00:21:07.449 --> 00:21:10.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the pros and cons equally.

00:21:10.085 --> 00:21:12.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not going to slant things, thinking:

00:21:12.321 --> 00:21:16.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, you know, I’m going to have to help
these brothers to make this decision.

00:21:16.191 --> 00:21:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So I’ll put a really heavy weight
on the pros,

00:21:19.328 --> 00:21:21.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m going to make it really light
on the cons.’

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t do that.

00:21:22.764 --> 00:21:25.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that you’re going
to present everything honestly,

00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:27.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re going to recognize
that it’s the holy spirit

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:30.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps brothers to make decisions.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:36.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust the spirit to move the brothers
to do the right thing.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose you sisters
are working on a team

00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you brothers are working
on a body of elders.

00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:46.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that not even
in your heart of hearts

00:21:46.688 --> 00:21:50.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
are you going to think
that you have the best judgment on the team

00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:54.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that, well, you can listen politely
to the expressions of others

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:57.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, really,
yours is the only sensible conclusion,

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:02.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you hope that the brothers and sisters
are going to go along with you.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:07.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not going to think that,
because nobody is right all the time.

00:22:07.042 --> 00:22:11.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s spirit can work
on any member of the team.

00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:16.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t get discouraged
if every suggestion you make in a meeting

00:22:16.551 --> 00:22:18.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
gets shot down.

00:22:18.553 --> 00:22:20.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happens to the best of us.

00:22:20.822 --> 00:22:22.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there will be other meetings,

00:22:22.891 --> 00:22:26.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hopefully some of them
will go better for you.

00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:30.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t get discouraged, and don’t decide:
“Well, I’m not going to say anything anymore.

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:32.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not going to contribute anymore.”

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be humble and recognize that at times

00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:40.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may make suggestions
that don’t make very much sense.

00:22:40.876 --> 00:22:45.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I certainly appreciate the kind way
the Governing Body deals with me

00:22:45.547 --> 00:22:48.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
with some of my lamebrained suggestions.

00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your comments and your assignments
on the midweek meeting,

00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:56.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
use the knowledge
you’ve gained at Gilead to build up.

00:22:56.691 --> 00:23:00.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know you won’t proofread the meetings.

00:23:00.262 --> 00:23:02.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t think that was a good illustration.

00:23:02.998 --> 00:23:05.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That scripture wasn’t applied right.

00:23:05.434 --> 00:23:06.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
That isn’t the right word.’

00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:08.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
You won’t do that.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meetings.

00:23:12.107 --> 00:23:14.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take in the spiritual food.

00:23:14.142 --> 00:23:18.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rejoice in whatever the brothers and sisters
have prepared for you.

00:23:20.749 --> 00:23:24.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I haven’t told you anything
you don’t already know.

00:23:24.086 --> 00:23:26.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re all humble people.

00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:30.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are just reminders that all of us need.

00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:34.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us are humble most of the time.

00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:39.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for the day
when we’ll be humble all of the time.

00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the meantime,
let’s work on it, you and I.

00:23:43.638 --> 00:23:45.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s work on it together.

00:23:45.907 --> 00:23:48.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s follow the course of humility.

00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:52.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we’ll continue

00:23:52.447 --> 00:23:54.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be used by Jehovah.

00:23:54.816 --> 00:23:56.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you.

00:23:56.818 --> 00:23:59.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless you richly.

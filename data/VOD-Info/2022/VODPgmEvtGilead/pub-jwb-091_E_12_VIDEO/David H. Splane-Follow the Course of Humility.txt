00:00:01 All of you are humble people.
00:00:06 If you weren’t, you would never have been invited to Gilead.
00:00:11 Have you ever noticed, though, that where humility is concerned,
00:00:15 we do well in some situations
00:00:18 and not so well in others?
00:00:22 For example, if someone commends us
00:00:24 for a good job on a talk in the midweek meeting
00:00:27 or perhaps a comment on the Watchtower  Study,
00:00:31 we give all credit to Jehovah and to the training we’ve received,
00:00:35 and that’s good.
00:00:38 But in other situations,
00:00:40 we might get into trouble.
00:00:43 In other situations,
00:00:45 our humility might be put to the test.
00:00:48 Now, at Bethel, as has been mentioned
00:00:51 on this program already,
00:00:54 we all work with people;
00:00:56 we all work closely with others.
00:01:00 Now, some of you sisters work on a team; you work with others.
00:01:04 And you brothers all have responsibilities
00:01:07 in the congregation or at Bethel or perhaps both.
00:01:11 But in all situations, humility is needed.
00:01:16 So I thought that this morning
00:01:18 we might consider what we can learn about humility
00:01:21 from Jehovah God
00:01:24 and from the apostles of Jesus Christ.
00:01:28 Now, humility is a broad term,
00:01:31 so let’s narrow it down a little bit.
00:01:34 Let’s consider a couple of aspects of humility,
00:01:38 and the first one I’m going to mention might surprise you.
00:01:41 Insight on the Scriptures tells us that humility includes
00:01:45 the ability to show mercy
00:01:48 and compassion to others
00:01:52 —the ability to show mercy
00:01:55 and compassion to others—
00:01:59 the ability to make exceptions where that is warranted.
00:02:05 Well, that’s Jehovah, isn’t it?
00:02:07 Jehovah isn’t rigid.
00:02:12 Jehovah knows when to make exceptions.
00:02:17 How often did you read in the Bible as you went through
00:02:20 that Jehovah reconsidered?
00:02:23 Jehovah makes perfect rules,
00:02:26 and yet at times he reconsiders.
00:02:30 Now let’s illustrate:
00:02:32 The Israelites are getting ready to conquer the Promised Land.
00:02:36 And the first up is the city of Jericho.
00:02:39 Now, there’s a rule
00:02:41 —a rule of engagement— and it’s very clear.
00:02:44 Jehovah says:
00:02:46 “You must not make any covenant with them
00:02:50 nor show them any favor.”
00:02:55 No covenant, no favor —that’s the rule.
00:02:59 It’s a perfect rule because it’s Jehovah’s rule.
00:03:04 Joshua sent two spies into the city,
00:03:07 and they went to the home of a prostitute named Rahab.
00:03:13 Now, wait a minute;
00:03:15 let’s think about that.
00:03:17 Pretty easy to say, isn’t it?
00:03:20 Joshua sent two spies into the city.
00:03:23 They went into a house of a prostitute named Rahab.
00:03:28 Now, we often think about the faith of Rahab.
00:03:32 But what about the faith of those two spies?
00:03:37 Can you imagine the faith that it took for those men
00:03:41 (the Bible says they were young men) to go into that city?
00:03:46 Now, if they were under 40 years of age,
00:03:49 they were born in the wilderness.
00:03:54 How many cities had they ever seen?
00:03:59 Had they ever seen a city before?
00:04:02 How many actual houses had they entered?
00:04:06 How many foreigners had they ever met?
00:04:11 Maybe not very many—maybe a couple on the other side of the Jordan,
00:04:14 but not very many.
00:04:17 So now, as soon as they enter the city, what happens?
00:04:21 Someone calls the police.
00:04:23 They’re recognized right away.
00:04:26 And no wonder!
00:04:27 First of all, they weren’t dressed like Canaanites.
00:04:31 You couldn’t order your clothes from Amazon in those days, you know.
00:04:35 They were dressed like Israelites.
00:04:39 They probably had on
40-year-old hand-me-downs
00:04:43 from their fathers who had died in the desert.
00:04:48 So they didn’t look like Canaanites; they didn’t blend in.
00:04:51 And as soon as they opened their mouth, people would say:
00:04:56 “You’re not from around here, are you?
00:04:58 You don’t speak the Canaanite language.”
00:05:01 So no wonder they were discovered.
00:05:04 They had to get off the street.
00:05:07 They had to get out of sight.
00:05:10 And you wonder if Jehovah directed them to Rahab.
00:05:14 You wonder if Jehovah saw something in Rahab,
00:05:17 something in her heart that he could work with.
00:05:21 Or do you believe that it was a coincidence
00:05:24 that the spies were led to the only family in Jericho
00:05:28 that was worth saving?
00:05:30 It could be that Jehovah was involved with that.
00:05:34 Well, Rahab decides
00:05:37 that she’s going to hide the spies, but she has a condition.
00:05:41 And if you’d like to turn to Joshua chapter 2,
00:05:47 we’ll see what that condition was.
00:05:50 I’ll give you a moment.
00:05:52 We’re going to read Joshua 2:13.
00:05:57 This is Rahab.
00:05:58 Now, we don’t know how she communicated with them
00:06:02 —must have been a lot of sign language.
00:06:04 We heard about sign language a minute ago.
00:06:06 There must have been a lot of sign language going on
00:06:09 because the Canaanite language wasn’t quite like Hebrew, you know.
00:06:12 But anyway, somehow they got the point across.
00:06:14 And here’s what she says in verse 13:
00:06:17 “You must spare the lives
00:06:19 “of my father and mother,
00:06:22 “my brothers and sisters,
00:06:25 “and all who belong to them,
00:06:28 and you must save us from death.”
00:06:31 What’s she asking for?
00:06:34 She’s asking for an exception.
00:06:38 There’s a rule:
00:06:40 You must not make any covenant with them;
00:06:44 you must not show them any favor.
00:06:48 And she is asking for an exception —and quite a broad exception.
00:06:51 She is asking not just for her own life
00:06:54 but for the lives of all of her family members as well.
00:06:57 Some might have thought that she was pushing it.
00:07:01 But she asked for that.
00:07:03 And the spies showed favor to Rahab.
00:07:08 They made an exception.
00:07:10 And they promised that when the time came,
00:07:12 Rahab and her family would be spared.
00:07:17 The Bible doesn’t criticize the spies for making that exception.
00:07:22 So it may be that Jehovah had something to do with it.
00:07:24 Maybe Jehovah moved the spies in that direction.
00:07:27 Maybe Jehovah saw something in Rahab that he wanted to save.
00:07:32 Now, later on, Joshua and the elders
00:07:36 didn’t follow instructions,
00:07:38 and they made a covenant with the Gibeonites.
00:07:40 The Bible does mention that,
00:07:42 but it doesn’t mention this when it comes to the spies here.
00:07:45 They made the exception.
00:07:47 And we do know that Jehovah agreed with that exception.
00:07:50 How do we know that?
00:07:52 Because when he made the walls of Jericho fall,
00:07:56 he preserved the section of the wall
00:07:59 where Rahab’s family lived.
00:08:03 Jehovah agreed to an exception
00:08:07 to his perfect rule.
00:08:10 Now, you know where I’m going with this.
00:08:14 We need rules.
00:08:16 And most of the time, a rule will satisfy our needs.
00:08:20 But in a few cases,
00:08:22 it only makes sense to make an exception to the rule.
00:08:27 I’m reminded of the time not too long ago
00:08:29 when the Bethel family moved out of Brooklyn.
00:08:33 Now, there were a lot of Bethelites in the congregations
00:08:35 who were elders and ministerial servants.
00:08:38 And so a massive reorganization of congregations
00:08:42 was necessary in New York City.
00:08:45 And the elders and the circuit overseers
00:08:47 had to make sure that each congregation
00:08:49 had a balanced number of elders, ministerial servants, and publishers.
00:08:53 And so publishers were assigned to various congregations.
00:08:57 Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of assignments that had to be made?
00:09:02 And so there was a rule, and it was a pretty good rule,
00:09:05 and the rule was: “Go where you’re assigned.
00:09:09 “We don’t have time to consider the personal feelings
00:09:14 “about every publisher in New York City,
00:09:16 so please go where you’re assigned.”
00:09:19 That was the rule.
00:09:21 Now, there were two sisters (single sisters)
00:09:25 who were assigned to a congregation.
00:09:28 They didn’t have a car,
00:09:30 and you couldn’t reach the congregation they were assigned to
00:09:33 by public transportation.
00:09:35 So they were going to have to walk to the Kingdom Hall,
00:09:40 and the area where the Kingdom Hall was located
00:09:42 was very dangerous.
00:09:46 Their safety would have been involved.
00:09:49 Well, you had a rule to go where you were assigned,
00:09:54 but the circuit overseer lovingly made an exception.
00:09:58 So the point is, we do need rules.
00:10:02 And most of the time, our rules, even our imperfect rules,
00:10:06 will serve most of the brothers.
00:10:09 But let’s use common sense.
00:10:11 And there are times when we have to consider an exception.
00:10:16 Now, can you think of anyone who is grateful
00:10:18 that Jehovah made an exception for Rahab
00:10:21 and that she didn’t die in Jericho?
00:10:24 Can you think of someone?
00:10:25 He was mentioned in this program.
00:10:27 It’s Boaz, the husband of Ruth.
00:10:31 Rahab was his mother.
00:10:35 And think of this:
00:10:37 If Rahab had died in Jericho,
00:10:40 would there ever have been a David?
00:10:45 Let’s go on.
00:10:47 Jehovah directed that seven nations in Canaan
00:10:50 were to be eliminated, and the Gibeonites were among them.
00:10:54 But they had a plan.
00:10:55 They pretended to be from a far-off nation
00:10:58 that wasn’t slated for destruction.
00:11:01 And so the elders, not consulting Jehovah,
00:11:05 made a vow that the Gibeonites would be spared.
00:11:08 They made a covenant with the Gibeonites.
00:11:10 Well, it wasn’t long, but what the Israelites realized
00:11:13 is they’d been tricked.
00:11:15 But even though their oath had been obtained under false pretenses,
00:11:19 they agreed to keep their word.
00:11:21 But it’s what happens next that’s interesting.
00:11:25 Five kings of the Amorites find out
00:11:28 that the Israelites and the Gibeonites have made a covenant,
00:11:31 and they are furious.
00:11:33 And so they are determined to kill all the Gibeonites,
00:11:38 which was really what Jehovah had intended in the first place.
00:11:43 What did Jehovah do?
00:11:45 He could have said: ‘Well, that solves your problem.
00:11:48 ‘You promised the Gibeonites that you wouldn’t put them to death,
00:11:51 so you can sit back and let the Amorites do the job.’
00:11:55 But what did Jehovah do?
00:11:57 Joshua 10:8.
00:12:03 Now, remember, he had had a rule.
00:12:06 He’d had a rule that everyone was to be destroyed.
00:12:09 Joshua 10:8:
00:12:16 “Jehovah then said to Joshua:
00:12:19 “‘Do not be afraid of them, for I have handed them over to you.
00:12:23 Not one of them will be able to stand against you.’”
00:12:29 Imagine the humility.
00:12:32 Jehovah helps the Israelites to keep a promise
00:12:37 that they had no business making.
00:12:39 That is humility.
00:12:41 Well, let’s talk about Jesus’ apostles.
00:12:44 We can really learn humility from them as well.
00:12:47 Now, we often talk about the disputes they had,
00:12:50 but mostly that was before Pentecost.
00:12:52 When you think about it, after Pentecost was a different story.
00:12:56 What do we find out about the apostles after Pentecost?
00:13:00 Well, they weren’t interested in taking credit for things,
00:13:03 and they weren’t searching for the limelight.
00:13:06 They were really very self-effacing apostles.
00:13:10 Matthew wrote the first inspired book
00:13:14 —the first inspired history of Jesus Christ.
00:13:17 Do we see Matthew’s picture on every other page?
00:13:20 Matthew giving a public talk?
00:13:22 Matthew performing a miracle?
00:13:24 Matthew shepherding?
00:13:26 No, his name is only mentioned twice in the whole Gospel,
00:13:30 and both times
00:13:33 he describes himself as a tax collector
00:13:35 —not a very flattering portrayal.
00:13:38 And what about the apostle John?
00:13:41 The name John appears 23 times
00:13:44 in his Gospel,
00:13:46 but it never refers to the apostle John.
00:13:51 It almost always refers to John the Baptist.
00:13:55 When the apostles and older men met to consider the matter of circumcision,
00:13:58 was that an important meeting?
00:14:00 Would you agree that that was a landmark meeting?
00:14:04 The apostles and older men are there.
00:14:06 Who presided?
00:14:08 Who of the 12 was jockeying for position?
00:14:12 James, the brother of Jesus, wasn’t even an apostle.
00:14:15 He’s the one who presided.
00:14:17 And then later on when the decision was made,
00:14:21 who announced the decision?
00:14:23 Again, James.
00:14:25 You don’t find Peter or John saying:
00:14:27 “Well, you know, this is a pretty important decision.
00:14:29 We think that one of us should announce it.”
00:14:33 The apostles had learned their lesson.
00:14:37 Well, remember that when the circuit overseer visits.
00:14:40 You may have heavy responsibilities at Bethel,
00:14:44 but when he visits a congregation, he’s in charge that week.
00:14:49 Follow his direction.
00:14:51 Don’t be critical of the circuit overseer,
00:14:54 and don’t be afraid to let him know how much you appreciate his service.
00:14:57 And you know, our Bethel families here in the United States
00:15:00 are such a wonderful example of that.
00:15:02 When the circuit overseers first visit a Bethel congregation,
00:15:05 they’re a little bit nervous for about ten minutes.
00:15:09 But the Bethel family shows
00:15:12 that they appreciate the counsel so much,
00:15:15 and sometimes they talk about the circuit overseer’s counsel
00:15:19 for weeks after his visit.
00:15:21 They really deeply appreciate the visit of the circuit overseer,
00:15:25 and they respect that man.
00:15:27 And we know that you’re going to do the same.
00:15:31 Humble people are happy to contribute to the Kingdom work in any way they can,
00:15:35 just so they can contribute.
00:15:37 They’re not hung up on privileges.
00:15:39 They’re not hung up on prestige or on position.
00:15:43 They don’t seek the limelight.
00:15:46 And in this regard, we’re going to talk a little bit about the apostle Paul.
00:15:50 Now, Brother Lippold mentioned in his talk
00:15:52 that Paul was not a man to boast, and that’s quite true.
00:15:57 Actually, Paul was a very humble man.
00:16:00 Now, think about this: At the time Paul was converted,
00:16:04 about 34 C.E.,
00:16:08 Jesus told Ananias
00:16:10 that Paul was going to have a wonderful privilege.
00:16:13 Let’s read about it in Acts chapter 9.
00:16:18 Acts 9:15
00:16:30 —Acts 9:15 (and this is Jesus to Ananias):
00:16:35 “But the Lord said to him: ‘Go! because this man
00:16:39 “‘is a chosen vessel to me
00:16:42 “‘to bear my name to the nations
00:16:44 as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.’”
00:16:49 “A chosen vessel.”
00:16:51 How about that!
00:16:53 How did Paul react?
00:16:55 Did he let that go to his head?
00:16:58 Did he immediately go up to Jerusalem
00:17:00 and volunteer to be on the governing body, saying,
00:17:02 “Well, now that I’m anointed, I can be on the governing body”?
00:17:06 No.
00:17:07 He stayed where he was in Damascus,
00:17:09 and he kept preaching the good news.
00:17:12 Now, in 36 C.E., he did go up to world headquarters in Jerusalem.
00:17:17 And how did he react?
00:17:19 Did he say: “Here I am, the chosen vessel.
00:17:22 I’m here to help you run the place”?
00:17:26 He stayed with the apostle Peter for a couple of weeks.
00:17:29 Apparently, Peter had moved to Jerusalem.
00:17:32 But he kept preaching.
00:17:34 He just put his head to the ground, and he kept preaching the good news
00:17:39 until one day Jesus appeared to him
00:17:43 when Paul was in the temple.
00:17:46 And he told Paul that he had to leave Jerusalem immediately
00:17:51 because the Jews were out to kill him.
00:17:54 How did Paul react?
00:17:56 Did he say: “But the governing body is going to need me.
00:18:00 “If I leave, how will they manage without me?
00:18:04 They need my wisdom”?
00:18:07 Paul obeyed theocratic direction,
00:18:10 and he left.
00:18:12 He accepted a new assignment
00:18:15 —Tarsus.
00:18:18 Tarsus?
00:18:20 What kind of assignment is that for a chosen vessel?
00:18:24 It was out in the boondocks.
00:18:27 It was 500 miles (800 km) from the governing body in Jerusalem.
00:18:32 How would the governing body get to know his wonderful qualities
00:18:36 if he was 500 miles (800 km) from Jerusalem?
00:18:39 Paul went to Tarsus, and he kept preaching.
00:18:44 We don’t even know if there was a congregation of Tarsus
00:18:47 when Paul got there.
00:18:49 But Paul kept preaching.
00:18:51 I was thinking of the lovely interview we just heard
00:18:54 where the brother talked about how he eventually ended up in the circuit work.
00:18:58 But before that time, Jehovah gave him a little training.
00:19:04 And perhaps that’s what happened to the apostle Paul.
00:19:06 Do you know that Paul may have remained in Tarsus
00:19:11 for eight years preaching?
00:19:16 And then Barnabas came along
00:19:20 11 years after Paul’s conversion.
00:19:23 Barnabas came along and invited him to Antioch.
00:19:27 And from that time on, Paul started to have privileges.
00:19:31 And five years after that,
00:19:33 Paul wrote his first inspired letter
00:19:37 that we cherish to this day.
00:19:39 Paul worked hard all his life.
00:19:42 He did more than any of the 12 apostles,
00:19:45 but he was never upset that he wasn’t counted among them.
00:19:49 Paul appreciated the privileges he had.
00:19:53 He viewed them as undeserved kindness.
00:19:56 And we know that you brothers and sisters are going to do the same.
00:19:59 You’re invited to conduct a meeting for field service
00:20:03 —treasure the privilege.
00:20:05 Any privilege that you receive,
00:20:07 treasure it as an expression of love from Jehovah.
00:20:12 Well, when you go to your assignments,
00:20:14 many situations are going to test your humility.
00:20:18 And I know that you brothers and sisters are going to pass the test.
00:20:23 The branch asks you to work on a project,
00:20:26 and deep down you don’t quite agree with it.
00:20:29 Deep down, you really wonder if it’s going to work,
00:20:32 and you wonder if it’s not going to be a waste of your time.
00:20:36 But you’re not going to put it on the back burner and say,
00:20:39 “Well, I’ll get to it someday if I get time.”
00:20:41 You’re not going to do that.
00:20:43 You’re going to put heart and soul into the project.
00:20:46 You’re going to pray to Jehovah to bless the project,
00:20:50 the project that you didn’t quite agree with.
00:20:55 Or if you’re asked to make a recommendation
00:20:58 and you favor one option over another,
00:21:02 humility is going to move you to present all of the options,
00:21:07 all of the pros and cons equally.
00:21:10 You’re not going to slant things, thinking:
00:21:12 ‘Well, you know, I’m going to have to help these brothers to make this decision.
00:21:16 ‘So I’ll put a really heavy weight on the pros,
00:21:19 and I’m going to make it really light on the cons.’
00:21:21 Don’t do that.
00:21:22 I know that you’re going to present everything honestly,
00:21:25 and you’re going to recognize that it’s the holy spirit
00:21:27 that helps brothers to make decisions.
00:21:31 Trust the spirit to move the brothers to do the right thing.
00:21:36 Suppose you sisters are working on a team
00:21:39 or you brothers are working on a body of elders.
00:21:43 I know that not even in your heart of hearts
00:21:46 are you going to think that you have the best judgment on the team
00:21:50 and that, well, you can listen politely to the expressions of others
00:21:54 but, really, yours is the only sensible conclusion,
00:21:57 and you hope that the brothers and sisters are going to go along with you.
00:22:02 You’re not going to think that, because nobody is right all the time.
00:22:07 Jehovah’s spirit can work on any member of the team.
00:22:11 Don’t get discouraged if every suggestion you make in a meeting
00:22:16 gets shot down.
00:22:18 It happens to the best of us.
00:22:20 And there will be other meetings,
00:22:22 and hopefully some of them will go better for you.
00:22:26 Don’t get discouraged, and don’t decide: “Well, I’m not going to say anything anymore.
00:22:30 I’m not going to contribute anymore.”
00:22:32 Be humble and recognize that at times
00:22:36 we may make suggestions that don’t make very much sense.
00:22:40 I certainly appreciate the kind way the Governing Body deals with me
00:22:45 with some of my lamebrained suggestions.
00:22:49 In your comments and your assignments on the midweek meeting,
00:22:52 use the knowledge you’ve gained at Gilead to build up.
00:22:56 And I know you won’t proofread the meetings.
00:23:00 ‘I don’t think that was a good illustration.
00:23:02 ‘That scripture wasn’t applied right.
00:23:05 That isn’t the right word.’
00:23:06 You won’t do that.
00:23:08 Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meetings.
00:23:12 Take in the spiritual food.
00:23:14 Rejoice in whatever the brothers and sisters have prepared for you.
00:23:20 Well, I haven’t told you anything you don’t already know.
00:23:24 You’re all humble people.
00:23:26 These are just reminders that all of us need.
00:23:30 All of us are humble most of the time.
00:23:34 We pray for the day when we’ll be humble all of the time.
00:23:39 And in the meantime, let’s work on it, you and I.
00:23:43 Let’s work on it together.
00:23:45 Let’s follow the course of humility.
00:23:48 If we do, we’ll continue
00:23:52 to be used by Jehovah.
00:23:54 We love you.
00:23:56 May Jehovah bless you richly.

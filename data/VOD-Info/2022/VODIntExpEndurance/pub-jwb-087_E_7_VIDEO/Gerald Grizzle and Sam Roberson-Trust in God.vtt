Some time ago,

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:04.521 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we interviewed two longtime members

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:07.090 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the United States Bethel family:

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.192 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerald Grizzle,

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:11.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Sam Roberson.

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These two brothers served
as traveling overseers

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many years prior to coming to Bethel.

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle has served
at Bethel since 1978,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Roberson
has served here for nearly 20 years.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been assigned
by the Governing Body

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist them in shepherding
the United States Bethel family.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Shepherding the Bethel family?’ you may ask.

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:42.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘After all, Bethelites
don’t have any distressing trials!’

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to what our dear brothers have to say.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle,
what are some of the challenges

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that members of the Bethel family face?

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:54.938 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The worldwide Bethel family

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:59.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is a representation of the brotherhood.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that I mean that

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:06.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as 1 Peter 5:9 says,

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face ‘the same kind of sufferings

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘being experienced by the entire association

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers in the world.’

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some deal with serious health problems,

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they continue to serve.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:23.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:27.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have concerns over aging parents,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some have to give up
their beloved Bethel service.

00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:37.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still others contend
with bouts of depression.

00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:41.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the spirit
of these dear brothers and sisters

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
impels them to have the determination

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow these challenges
to dominate them.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, their faith in Jehovah

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:55.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthens their resolve

00:01:55.965 --> 00:01:58.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on their assignments.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:00.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that insight,

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Roberson, how have you been able
to comfort such ones?

00:02:06.342 --> 00:02:09.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When we find out a Bethelite

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:11.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is going through a tragedy,

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:13.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there are four things that we do.

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, we pray for them

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and develop specific spiritual points

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:22.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to their needs.

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s before we make the call.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two, when we actually make the call,

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:29.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we really listen.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t mean
we just listen with our ears.

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to listen with our hearts.

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to feel what they feel.

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to have compassion.

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three, when we use God’s Word

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind them
they’re not facing their crisis alone,

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:51.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is very effective.

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
we called on a brother recently

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:57.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was going through a great trial,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we shared, among other things,

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 3:7, 12.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look at that:

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:08.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have certainly seen the affliction

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of my people who are in Egypt,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I have heard their outcry

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of those who force them to work.”

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:20.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And note the ending point here
—it’s very beautiful.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t say,
‘I know how my people feel’;

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:27.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “I <i>well </i> know

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pains [of my people].”

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in giving assurance

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dealing with Moses
fearing to go before Pharaoh,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 12, just the <i>A</i>  part:

00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:45.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this he said:
‘I will prove to be with you.’”

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just a few words but so powerful,

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah is guaranteeing

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s going to give them undeniable proof

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s backing them up
and never moving away from them one inch.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this gives us comfort.

00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:06.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, number four,

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we conclude the call,

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:12.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have an ending prayer with them.

00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we use their names,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is very comforting
since we’re calling on Jehovah,

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:20.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Great Shepherd.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 5:14,

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:25.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “We urge you, brothers, to . . .

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“speak consolingly to those
who are depressed,

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[to] support the weak,
be patient toward all.”

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is exactly what we’re trying to do.

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:39.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for sharing those thoughts
—very interesting.

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers Grizzle and Roberson:

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:45.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has comforting others affected you?

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:47.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle first, please.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these challenging times,

00:04:50.907 --> 00:04:55.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sense Jehovah’s love for his people.

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen and experienced his care

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when facing difficult times.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago,

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my mother, my brother,

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:15.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father in death all within a year.

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:18.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2017,

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my dear wife, Bonnie,

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after we had served Jehovah together

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for nearly 65 years.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with much prayer,

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:34.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
research, and love of the friends,

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has comforted me.

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, thankfully,

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:42.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been able
to offer encouragement to others.

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very touching, Brother Grizzle,

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thank you.

00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:49.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Roberson,
how has comforting others

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:51.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affected you?

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most memorable challenges

00:05:53.736 --> 00:05:56.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was while my wife, Linda, and I
were in the circuit work

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several years ago.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my voice.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have surgery on my vocal cords,

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:06.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for six weeks, I could not talk.

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a circuit overseer,
that’s like being a bird without its wings.

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:15.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote more notes in that six weeks

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than I had written in my whole life!

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in spite of that
and along with other situations and tragedies

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we faced similar to Gerald’s,

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has seen us through them all.

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:30.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me say, it’s been a real pleasure

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share Jehovah’s comfort with so many.

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do,
we see the Governing Body’s interest

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of Jehovah’s people,

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including those with added responsibility.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They truly reflect Jehovah’s feelings

00:06:46.122 --> 00:06:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the God of all comfort.”

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you, brothers.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate your comments.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more than the shepherding that you do

00:06:57.366 --> 00:07:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the example that you have set

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in enduring trials,

00:07:02.605 --> 00:07:04.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in experiencing Jehovah’s comfort,

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:06.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in comforting others.

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:07.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

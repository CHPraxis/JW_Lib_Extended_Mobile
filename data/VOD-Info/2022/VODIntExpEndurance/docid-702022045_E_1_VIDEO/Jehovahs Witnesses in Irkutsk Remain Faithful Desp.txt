00:00:01 Russian authorities have raided
00:00:04 over 1,600 homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:05 since 2017.
00:00:09 In the early morning hours of October 4, 2021,
00:00:12 dozens of law-enforcement officers
00:00:14 burst into homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:17 in the city of Irkutsk, Siberia.
00:00:19 Several were beaten and humiliated.
00:00:25 At 6:15 a.m., they
00:00:27 smashed the window and knocked it out.
00:00:29 My husband thought burglars had broken in.
00:00:32 He went to check the window
00:00:33 and was immediately thrown down to the floor,
00:00:36 which was covered with glass.
00:00:37 His feet, elbows, and hands were bloodied.
00:00:41 My wife and I were woken up
00:00:43 by persistent ringing
00:00:44 of our doorbell.
00:00:46 I remember opening the door.
00:00:48 Then suddenly I was forced to the floor.
00:00:51 I felt that my front tooth had been partially broken off.
00:00:54 I heard the officers starting to beat him.
00:00:59 My wife was crying and shouting so that they would stop beating me.
00:01:03 They broke into our apartment
00:01:06 through the window.
00:01:07 They started shouting at me to lie facedown on the floor.
00:01:11 I replied: “What’s happening?
00:01:13 “I’ve got a small child here.
00:01:15 Why have you broken in like this?”
00:01:17 My child was terrified.
00:01:19 In some cases, the officers resorted to torture to try to force the Witnesses
00:01:23 to incriminate themselves or to divulge personal information.
00:01:27 At the Razdobarov home, officers
00:01:30 stripped Anatoly naked and forced him to lie on the floor.
00:01:34 I tried to raise my head.
00:01:36 They hit me in the face.
00:01:38 They kicked me in the area of my kidneys and my head.
00:01:41 And then masked men came up behind me
00:01:44 and lifted me up.
00:01:46 They twisted my arms like this
00:01:49 and started hoisting me up from the ground.
00:01:52 It was incredibly painful.
00:01:54 One sat on my leg,
00:01:56 and the other tried to further
00:01:58 torture me by trying to force a glass bottle
00:02:01 into my buttocks.
00:02:03 They finally left me for a while just lying naked on the floor.
00:02:06 The door was open.
00:02:07 It was freezing cold.
00:02:09 After the raids,
00:02:10 seven other Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:02:12 (Sergey Kosteev, Nikolay Martynov,
00:02:14 Yaroslav Kalin, Mikhail Moish,
00:02:16 Alexsey Solnechny, Sergey Vasilyev,
00:02:18 and Andrey Tolmachev)
00:02:20 were detained and sent
00:02:21 to a temporary holding cell.
00:02:23 On the following day,
00:02:24 a court hearing took place to decide
00:02:27 what restrictive measures would be imposed on the men.
00:02:29 Around 300 friends
00:02:31 turned up at the courthouse to show support for the men.
00:02:35 I am very grateful
00:02:37 to the brothers and sisters who stood
00:02:39 outside the court
00:02:42 in the cold for 12 hours,
00:02:44 even with children, in order to support the brothers
00:02:48 who were in the court while the judges were deciding on the restrictive measures.
00:02:53 It was something special.
00:02:55 I immediately felt
00:02:56 that we are part of a brotherhood.
00:02:59 It was so obvious that the words of the friends
00:03:02 came from the depths of their hearts and that they were right there with us.
00:03:07 The judges ruled to send six men to a pretrial detention center.
00:03:11 The violent raids in Irkutsk tested the faith
00:03:14 of the local Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:15 However, they firmly believe
00:03:18 that what took place has drawn them closer together
00:03:20 and strengthened their faith.
00:03:22 When I would read about what happened in other cities,
00:03:24 I often wondered
00:03:25 how I would react in that situation.
00:03:28 Now it has happened to me,
00:03:29 and I have seen how Jehovah has really supported me.
00:03:32 I felt that there were angels with us
00:03:34 because of the way we endured throughout the whole search.
00:03:38 I know it was only possible with Jehovah.
00:03:41 I was completely calm and felt total inner peace during the search.
00:03:45 After this experience, I am certain
00:03:48 that any brother or sister who serves Jehovah today
00:03:51 and does so sincerely and wholeheartedly can endure
00:03:54 no matter what trials he faces in life.
00:03:57 That’s for sure.

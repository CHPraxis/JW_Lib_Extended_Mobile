00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Russian authorities
have raided

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 1,600 homes
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
since 2017.

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the early morning hours
of October 4, 2021,

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
dozens of law-enforcement officers

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
burst into homes of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Irkutsk, Siberia.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several were beaten and humiliated.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 6:15 a.m., they

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
smashed the window
and knocked it out.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband thought burglars had broken in.

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.679 line:10% position:50% align:center
He went to check the window

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
and was immediately thrown down to the floor,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was covered with glass.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
His feet, elbows, and hands were bloodied.

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:43.689 line:10% position:50% align:center
My wife and I were woken up

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:44.982 line:10% position:50% align:center
by persistent ringing

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our doorbell.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember opening the door.

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then suddenly I was forced to the floor.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that my front tooth
had been partially broken off.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
I heard the officers starting to beat him.

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife was crying and shouting
so that they would stop beating me.

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.253 line:10% position:50% align:center
They broke into our apartment

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the window.

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:11.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
They started shouting at me
to lie facedown on the floor.

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
I replied: “What’s happening?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve got a small child here.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why have you broken in like this?”

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
My child was terrified.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases, the officers resorted
to torture to try to force the Witnesses

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
to incriminate themselves
or to divulge personal information.

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the Razdobarov home, officers

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
stripped Anatoly naked
and forced him to lie on the floor.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.450 line:10% position:50% align:center
I tried to raise my head.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.077 line:10% position:50% align:center
They hit me in the face.

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:41.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
They kicked me in the area
of my kidneys and my head.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then masked men
came up behind me

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lifted me up.

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
They twisted my arms like this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started hoisting me up from the ground.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was incredibly painful.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sat on my leg,

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the other tried to further

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
torture me by trying to force a glass bottle

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
into my buttocks.

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
They finally left me for a while
just lying naked on the floor.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
The door was open.

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was freezing cold.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the raids,

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
seven other Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
(Sergey Kosteev,
Nikolay Martynov,

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yaroslav Kalin, Mikhail Moish,

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:18.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alexsey Solnechny, Sergey Vasilyev,

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Andrey Tolmachev)

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:21.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
were detained and sent

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:23.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a temporary holding cell.

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the following day,

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
a court hearing took place to decide

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
what restrictive measures
would be imposed on the men.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around 300 friends

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
turned up at the courthouse
to show support for the men.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:37.469 line:10% position:50% align:center
I am very grateful

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.722 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the brothers and sisters who stood

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
outside the court 

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:44.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the cold for 12 hours,

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
even with children, in order
to support the brothers

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:52.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were in the court while the judges
were deciding on the restrictive measures.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:55.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was something special.

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:56.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
I immediately felt

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.158 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we are part of a brotherhood.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so obvious
that the words of the friends

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:06.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
came from the depths of their hearts
and that they were right there with us.

00:03:07.082 --> 00:03:10.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
The judges ruled to send six men
to a pretrial detention center.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:14.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
The violent raids in Irkutsk tested the faith

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the local Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, they firmly believe

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what took place
has drawn them closer together

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:22.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthened their faith.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I would read about
what happened in other cities,

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often wondered

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:28.103 line:10% position:50% align:center
how I would react in that situation.

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:29.104 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now it has happened to me,

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:32.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have seen how Jehovah
has really supported me.

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that there were angels with us

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:38.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the way we endured
throughout the whole search.

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:41.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know it was only possible with Jehovah.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was completely calm
and felt total inner peace during the search.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
After this experience, I am certain

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
that any brother or sister
who serves Jehovah today

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and does so sincerely
and wholeheartedly can endure

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what trials he faces in life.

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s for sure.

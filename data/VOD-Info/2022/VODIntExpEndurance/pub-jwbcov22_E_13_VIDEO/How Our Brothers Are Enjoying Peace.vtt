00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.442 line:10% position:50% align:center
As long as we live in Satan’s world,

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us will face situations

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can rob us of our peace.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regaining that peace can be difficult

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:17.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not impossible.

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this video, we will hear

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
from three sisters and two couples

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will speak candidly about their trials

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they struggled to cope with them.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:33.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in spite of what they have endured,

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
please take note of their smiles, their joy,

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:42.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they did to regain
and maintain their peace.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
And take special note
of how Jehovah helped them.

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body knows that many of you

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:55.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
are suffering circumstances

00:00:55.993 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
not unlike the ones we will hear about,

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:03.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they trust that the examples
in this video

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:06.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help each of you to maintain your peace

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:09.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you endure various trials.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters all over the world
are facing

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:24.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic collapse,

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
illness,

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persecution.

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite all that,

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
they keep joy and peace.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can learn a lot from them.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Antoinette.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.920 line:10% position:50% align:center
I live here in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
with my supermom

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:51.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
and my troublemaking sister.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family and friends have always been
important to me.

00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a child, I lived with my mom and dad

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was very close
to my dad’s side of the family.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very loving, unified, and fun.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was pretty happy.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I already was starting to feel
the effects of my cancer.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:19.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t know what it was really.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day I was OK, and then the next day
I started feeling bad, you know.

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.047 line:10% position:50% align:center
In my childhood,

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:34.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
I played an unusual game.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would catch insects,

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
put them in a jar, and then bring them home.

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:48.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, I would get books,
such as the Criminal Procedural Code,

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
open them up,
and start judging one of the bugs.

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would play the role
of investigator and judge at the same time.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:01.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born into a family where everyone,

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting with my grandparents,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
was either wearing an officer’s uniform
or a judge’s robe.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:13.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why I had
this strong sense of justice.

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1989,

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:22.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mother was in a tragic car accident,

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
she got severe burns

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
on her face, hands, and body.

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then my father,

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:36.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
at seeing my mom’s condition,

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:40.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
decided to leave us.

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:42.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:47.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was at that moment, I guess,

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:51.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my world, my ideals,

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
they crumbled.

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a little kid, I always wanted, like,
one big happy family.

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once we moved to New York for my treatment,

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
I no longer had that big family bond anymore.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was feeling back then in New York was

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
just sadness,

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:15.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
never really peace.

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:22.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in California,

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.912 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’re used to fires.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I got the call to evacuate
that morning,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never knew that by that evening,

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:39.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
the whole town of Paradise would be gone.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just before the fire,
we had the needs of the congregation

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:01.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they instructed us
what to do in the case of a disaster.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:04.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the truck full of gas,

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:07.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had my go bag ready,

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I had a map of where I was going.

00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:14.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was ready.

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:18.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers, also in their instructions,

00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:21.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
said to obey the traffic instructors.

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:23.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
The instructor told us to turn right,

00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:25.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t want to turn right,

00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they said obey them.

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:30.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I turned right,

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
though I thought it would be really bad.

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:40.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
The smoke got darker and darker,

00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:48.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finally it got black.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
You couldn’t see anything.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:00.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom has always told me

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:03.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve always been

00:06:03.508 --> 00:06:05.802 line:10% position:50% align:center
a caregiver ever since I was a little girl;

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:09.473 line:10% position:50% align:center
it was just part of who I was.

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:13.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t like to see people suffer;
it’s very difficult for me.

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:21.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember that when I first started working
as a nurse,

00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:24.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would always cry.

00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cried—
Literally I cried

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day that I had to go to work.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:35.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only was I overwhelmed
being a new nurse

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:41.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was battling my depression.

00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:46.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2017,

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:48.220 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was the treasurer

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
for a prestigious bank in Nicaragua,

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:53.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was the father of a one-year-old son.

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:54.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very happy.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then I lost my job.

00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:03.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said, ‘I have the experience,

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:07.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah will help me find another job,
something similar.’

00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:11.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I kept looking for jobs,
but doors kept closing.

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:14.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt very tense;

00:07:14.913 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
it made me feel very useless,

00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
like

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:21.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t even provide for my family.

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:24.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was something very difficult for me.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
These dear brothers and sisters

00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:37.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
faced serious challenges.

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:41.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may have had moments
when they felt like Job

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said: “I loathe my life.”

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:49.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not an unusual human emotion.

00:07:50.866 --> 00:07:53.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes things in life

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t work out as we had hoped,

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can hurt us deeply.

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:04.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this mean that we are helpless victims
of our circumstances?

00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:06.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:11.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take note of why we can say

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:14.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Margaret, Feliks,

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:17.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miguel, Nikki, and Antoinette

00:08:17.642 --> 00:08:20.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not helpless victims.

00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:22.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary,

00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:25.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are conquerors.

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:28.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch and listen,

00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for specific actions they took

00:08:31.531 --> 00:08:34.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain their peace

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:37.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and please give thoughtful attention

00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:40.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ways that you can imitate their faith.

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:47.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up, I wondered,

00:08:47.214 --> 00:08:50.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why does the Supreme Judge, God,

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:53.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
allow injustice and suffering?’

00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:58.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
And inside of me,
I had this need to restore justice.

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:01.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such a burning desire within me.

00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:04.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with that in mind,

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:07.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
I moved to Russia to stay with my sister.

00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:11.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
She started to study the Bible

00:09:12.322 --> 00:09:14.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was overflowing with the truth.

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:19.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked for hours till late into the night.

00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s when my special relationship
with Jehovah began.

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:30.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when I got a taste of what it’s like

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:31.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a caring Father.

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:35.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had been a while
since I was able to feel that.

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:40.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
My baptism date was very exciting.

00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:50.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual family I inherited
was very vast.

00:09:50.652 --> 00:09:54.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can instantly feel the love.

00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:57.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got baptized,
and it seemed like miracles happened

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:00.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
one after the other.

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:09.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a great life.

00:10:13.717 --> 00:10:16.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:10:16.052 --> 00:10:19.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
the persecution started
with Brother Christensen,

00:10:19.264 --> 00:10:22.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then there was a ripple effect
of arrests, one after the other.

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:24.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it was our turn.

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:27.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
In June of 2018,

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:31.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge group of armed men came to us,
to our home.

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:38.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:10:38.617 --> 00:10:40.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now these people,

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:44.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
this judicial system,

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:49.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the source of injustice to me.

00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:55.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sitting in a cage,
the same way my bugs used to be in a jar.

00:10:59.137 --> 00:11:02.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I felt like they did.

00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:08.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your head
at that moment when you hear the verdict

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:11.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ll stay in prison,

00:11:11.316 --> 00:11:13.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like you’ve been knocked unconscious.

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:16.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been hit in the head with something,

00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:18.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s just a ringing sound
in your ears.

00:11:21.743 --> 00:11:25.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I was taken away in handcuffs.

00:11:26.289 --> 00:11:29.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, I wasn’t in the best mood.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then

00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:40.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doors of the elevator opened up,
and in front of us,

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of brothers and sisters

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
were clapping their hands
as hard as they could.

00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:01.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some were crying,

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:04.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not crying
because they felt sorry for me.

00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:07.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
They cried because they loved us

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because they were proud of us.

00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:12.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what always happens.

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:15.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just about to lose
all your strength,

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:20.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you
that gives you a second wind.

00:12:21.136 --> 00:12:25.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, the applause, the love,

00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:26.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tears,

00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:29.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
the shouts,
“Hang in there; everything will be OK!”

00:12:29.978 --> 00:12:34.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they gave me a second wind.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with renewed strength,
I could run the next part of the race.

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:45.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the guards was so surprised
that he said,

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now that’s some support you’ve got!”

00:12:49.748 --> 00:12:51.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:55.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without friends, I would be very lonely.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would constantly be focusing on my illness.

00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:01.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day I met Marissa was at a convention.

00:13:01.635 --> 00:13:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a really great friend,
a spiritual friend.

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:07.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
When she’d take me
to my hospital appointments,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would eat out.

00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:13.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think food is just the common language
between everyone, you know.

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:14.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you talk about food, you know,
it’s like:

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:17.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ah! Yes, we have something to talk about,”
you know.

00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:20.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be excited when she would take me
to my hospital appointment.

00:13:20.737 --> 00:13:22.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always makes me laugh, you know.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always helps me have a good time
no matter what.

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:31.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, friends really help encourage me.

00:13:31.665 --> 00:13:35.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 17:17 says:

00:13:35.251 --> 00:13:38.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A true friend shows love at all times

00:13:38.129 --> 00:13:41.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is a brother who is born
for times of distress.”

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have seen this come true in my life.

00:13:45.845 --> 00:13:47.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I lost my job at the bank,

00:13:47.847 --> 00:13:52.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, I felt very depressed, troubled, tense.

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:55.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have a good friend who I can talk to,

00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:58.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I told him how I was feeling,
he told me:

00:13:58.608 --> 00:14:02.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look, Miguel, don’t look for the same

00:14:02.112 --> 00:14:04.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“line of work.

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:08.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe what you need to do
is make a change in your life.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why don’t you find some simple work
outside of an office for a time?

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That can help you to keep your eye simple

00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:19.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allow you to provide for your family.”

00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
I watched my wife make bread for our family,

00:14:26.428 --> 00:14:28.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one day I told her:

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m going to make that bread,
but not for our family.

00:14:31.349 --> 00:14:33.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to make it to sell.”

00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she told me, “No, are you crazy?”

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:38.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a big change—right?—

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:42.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
from having a position at a bank

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:44.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and handling a lot of money

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
to selling on the street.

00:14:46.072 --> 00:14:49.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I told her,
“Look, I’m going to put this hat on,”

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:52.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I put like a chef’s hat on.

00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:54.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I told her,

00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:58.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll be back in less than an hour,
whether I sell or not.”

00:14:58.084 --> 00:14:59.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what happened.

00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:02.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to her surprise,
I came back without any bread.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I got ready
to leave the second time to sell,

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
she said: “OK. Go, but leave the hat here.”

00:15:29.073 --> 00:15:32.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also started to iron clothes
for people in their homes,

00:15:32.952 --> 00:15:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it looked strange
because normally where we live

00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:37.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
that type of work is done by a woman.

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:42.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for a man to go and iron clothes
at someone’s home,

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:43.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
you don’t see that.

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:46.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I didn’t want to just sit back
with my arms crossed

00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:47.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see what would happen.

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:48.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:52.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to put my hands to work
to earn a living for my family.

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:58.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I would preach one day,
and the next day I would iron clothes.

00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:02.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next day I would preach, and the day
after that I would go out and sell bread.

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mind was always occupied
on doing something,

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:06.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
either for the Kingdom or my family.

00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that helped me a lot.

00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:14.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was feeling so sad.

00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:17.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really needed Jehovah’s help
to figure out what was going on with me.

00:16:17.956 --> 00:16:20.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remember

00:16:20.124 --> 00:16:25.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the 2009 article about depression
came out.

00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:31.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized: ‘OK, Jehovah,
you’re telling me this is what I have.

00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:34.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So now that I realize I have this,

00:16:34.556 --> 00:16:37.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to figure out how I can manage it.’

00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:40.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I changed my eating habits.

00:16:40.395 --> 00:16:42.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started exercising a lot more.

00:16:42.438 --> 00:16:45.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that exercising and eating healthy

00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:47.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
really, really did help.

00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:50.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, I made a journal,

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:55.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I made different sections

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the different aspects of my depression
that I dealt with.

00:16:59.038 --> 00:17:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each section, I would put scriptures;

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:04.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would put articles.

00:17:04.252 --> 00:17:06.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the illustrations, the pictures,

00:17:06.254 --> 00:17:11.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
they speak a lot without saying anything.

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:14.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hears us.

00:17:15.722 --> 00:17:17.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cares.

00:17:24.022 --> 00:17:26.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some time in prison,

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
they transferred me to a different cell.

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:32.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
In it were inmates who followed the orders

00:17:32.614 --> 00:17:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the investigators.

00:17:35.658 --> 00:17:38.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did everything they could
to other inmates

00:17:38.786 --> 00:17:42.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make life unbearable.

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did they do this?

00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:48.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
To break a person

00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:51.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they would start to collaborate
with the investigators,

00:17:51.424 --> 00:17:55.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
confess to everything, and then be able
to get transferred to another area.

00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:06.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 37:3:
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.”

00:18:06.814 --> 00:18:11.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Jehovah, please help me
to stay loyal to you.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please help me.”

00:18:12.528 --> 00:18:14.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
My prayers were really simple

00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:16.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actually like two words: “Jehovah, help!

00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:19.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, help! Jehovah, help!”

00:18:19.327 --> 00:18:21.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite how they treated me,

00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:25.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I dealt with others,
I tried to treat them with kindness.

00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:29.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
These people,

00:18:29.212 --> 00:18:31.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
they made life

00:18:31.214 --> 00:18:34.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
uncomfortable, unbearable,

00:18:34.592 --> 00:18:37.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when they were treated kindly,

00:18:37.178 --> 00:18:39.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
they started to soften.

00:18:39.597 --> 00:18:41.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to treat me differently.

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:44.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was being transferred

00:18:44.852 --> 00:18:46.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of that cell,

00:18:46.896 --> 00:18:51.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inmate who ran the area
called me over to him and said,

00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Come sit beside me.”

00:18:54.862 --> 00:18:56.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I sat down.

00:18:56.114 --> 00:19:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he said, “If anybody in this prison
touches you,

00:19:00.743 --> 00:19:03.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell him that I’ll come looking for him.”

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:10.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he said, “Get his things”

00:19:10.003 --> 00:19:12.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
(he told the other prisoners).

00:19:12.422 --> 00:19:14.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cell doors opened

00:19:16.134 --> 00:19:18.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the guards saw

00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
a crowd of inmates

00:19:20.596 --> 00:19:24.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
grabbing my things
and putting them out into the hallway.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I left the cell
without having to carry a thing!

00:19:30.064 --> 00:19:32.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
The guard quietly closed the door.

00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:35.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And before the inmates
returned to their cells,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
they even said goodbye, hugged me,
and said: “Hang in there!

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to be OK.”

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went into the cell, and the guard
closed the door and asked me,

00:19:44.412 --> 00:19:47.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boy, how long have you been in there?”

00:19:47.498 --> 00:19:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Three weeks.”

00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:54.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Well, normally
people leave this cell beaten up,

00:19:54.422 --> 00:19:56.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they’re thrown out by the other inmates.

00:19:56.758 --> 00:19:59.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They have to carry their own things,
and that’s if the other inmates

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:01.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
haven’t thrown their stuff out the door.”

00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:05.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
He couldn’t believe what had just happened.

00:20:05.058 --> 00:20:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Jehovah.

00:20:09.645 --> 00:20:12.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exercising, changing my diet,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
the publications, journaling
—that was my lifeline.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really actually helped me
for a long time.

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:24.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it came to a point
where it stopped working as effectively.

00:20:25.495 --> 00:20:28.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember getting ready,
dressing for the meeting,

00:20:28.748 --> 00:20:30.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was fine.

00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:33.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was getting dressed for the meeting
and about to walk out the door,

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I couldn’t.

00:20:35.254 --> 00:20:38.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was this overwhelming fear
that came over me

00:20:38.466 --> 00:20:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an overwhelming sadness
that came over me.

00:20:41.677 --> 00:20:45.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just lost it; I just started crying.

00:20:45.431 --> 00:20:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t get myself together.

00:20:49.018 --> 00:20:50.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was bad.

00:20:50.061 --> 00:20:53.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got really bad;
my depression got really bad.

00:20:56.859 --> 00:20:59.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was very difficult for me

00:20:59.487 --> 00:21:02.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
to approach the brothers
to ask them for help.

00:21:02.406 --> 00:21:06.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at that time, I knew that if I didn’t,

00:21:06.327 --> 00:21:09.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
that

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
something bad would happen.

00:21:13.584 --> 00:21:15.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided: ‘You know what?

00:21:15.294 --> 00:21:17.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to ask for a shepherding call
with my brothers,’

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’d never talked about my depression
with the elders at all.

00:21:20.466 --> 00:21:23.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was my first time speaking with them.

00:21:23.928 --> 00:21:27.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was one brother, one of the elders,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
who also battled depression.

00:21:29.517 --> 00:21:32.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he suggested,

00:21:32.603 --> 00:21:34.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you thought
about seeking medical help?”

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:42.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeking professional help
was something I never wanted to do.

00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:45.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that I didn’t need to do it,

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:49.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes there comes a point where

00:21:49.328 --> 00:21:52.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need additional help

00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:56.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what you’re doing is not enough.

00:21:56.169 --> 00:22:00.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world, they make you feel
that it’s a bad thing,

00:22:00.047 --> 00:22:02.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that depression is a dirty word,

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:05.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that seeking medical help
is something that you don’t do.

00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:07.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I realized also

00:22:07.847 --> 00:22:10.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seeking medical help

00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:13.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
was part of my being able
to worship Jehovah effectively.

00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:15.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s me doing my part.

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:20.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone needs to take that step,
but for me, this is what I need to do.

00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:22.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m glad I did it because of the fact

00:22:22.778 --> 00:22:27.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve never ever felt this good

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:29.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
in my life.

00:22:32.038 --> 00:22:34.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
About a year later,

00:22:34.832 --> 00:22:36.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were released.

00:22:38.961 --> 00:22:41.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my wife and I understood

00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:44.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could put me back in prison again,

00:22:44.425 --> 00:22:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
so

00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:49.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed to use
the time until then to the full

00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:51.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the best way possible.

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:56.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did we do?

00:22:56.354 --> 00:23:00.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 119:165:

00:23:00.107 --> 00:23:04.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abundant peace belongs to those
who love your law.”

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:09.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had family worship,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
read the Bible, and prayed together.

00:23:12.536 --> 00:23:17.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how I spent my four months of freedom.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was put into prison

00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
for three years.

00:23:30.805 --> 00:23:35.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they told me
about my cancer being gone,

00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:36.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really happy; I was ecstatic.

00:23:36.519 --> 00:23:39.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was like: ‘Finally I’m going
to get to do normal things

00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:42.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that a kid my age should be able to do.

00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:46.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t need to be afraid
or anxious anymore.’

00:23:50.992 --> 00:23:54.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I did relapse again,

00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:58.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basically right now
my present condition is

00:23:58.749 --> 00:24:00.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s nothing really more to do.

00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:05.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re just waiting
to let nature take its course basically,

00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:10.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s it.

00:24:13.264 --> 00:24:17.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with Ephesians 4:26,

00:24:17.852 --> 00:24:20.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to let myself process the news

00:24:20.563 --> 00:24:23.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let myself be sad and be angry.

00:24:25.943 --> 00:24:29.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let yourself feel those feelings;

00:24:29.071 --> 00:24:31.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not try to repress them.

00:24:31.073 --> 00:24:35.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you can control
your thoughts and your actions.

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:39.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pretty much my whole life
has revolved around my illness,

00:24:39.582 --> 00:24:41.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’ve learned how to shift focus.

00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:44.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just don’t focus on myself all the time.

00:24:44.545 --> 00:24:47.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
I focus on others and their trials,

00:24:47.173 --> 00:24:49.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are different but just as hard.

00:24:51.385 --> 00:24:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
You read the stories
on jw.org in the Newsroom.

00:24:55.806 --> 00:24:58.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian brothers and sisters,

00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:02.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pray for them constantly because

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are going through a very tough time.

00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:11.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is [definitely] more happiness
in giving than receiving.”

00:25:11.364 --> 00:25:14.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in our situation, this proved true.

00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:18.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say

00:25:18.037 --> 00:25:21.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
this really helps to relieve your pain.

00:25:21.582 --> 00:25:24.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you focus on yourself,
your pain gets worse.

00:25:25.628 --> 00:25:28.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you focus on others
and on their problems,

00:25:28.964 --> 00:25:31.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
your pain lessens, diminishes.

00:25:48.692 --> 00:25:50.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:25:54.198 --> 00:25:58.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Antoinette, I was so—

00:25:58.327 --> 00:26:02.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was told
that we would talk with each other,

00:26:02.623 --> 00:26:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was something very special for me.

00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:07.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Same for me too.

00:26:07.253 --> 00:26:09.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the brothers told me as well

00:26:09.755 --> 00:26:12.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
about meeting you, I was really excited.

00:26:12.258 --> 00:26:16.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for your prayers
in behalf of the brothers in Russia.

00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:18.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are precious.

00:26:19.932 --> 00:26:22.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can learn so much from you.

00:26:24.103 --> 00:26:26.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really nice of you to say that.

00:26:29.942 --> 00:26:34.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve both been through very many hardships.

00:26:34.238 --> 00:26:36.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure prison was super hard.

00:26:37.867 --> 00:26:41.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, in prison,
us brothers had a saying,

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:48.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you ask: ‘How much worse can it get?’

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
you won’t have to wait long to find out.”

00:26:52.173 --> 00:26:56.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or in other words, when you think,
‘How much worse can it get?’

00:26:56.177 --> 00:26:59.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
for sure something worse is bound to happen.

00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:03.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we received our sentence,
we thought:

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:06.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, that’s it.
That’s the worst that could happen.’

00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:19.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course, it got worse.

00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:23.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon arrival at the prison,

00:27:23.746 --> 00:27:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were beaten up

00:27:26.582 --> 00:27:29.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for hours we were humiliated.

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:43.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought, ‘How much worse can it get?’

00:27:43.432 --> 00:27:45.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the next day, we were told,

00:27:45.851 --> 00:27:47.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are going to the punishment cell.”

00:27:47.937 --> 00:27:49.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought,

00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:54.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, how much worse can it get?’

00:27:54.568 --> 00:27:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, it started with one floor,

00:27:57.279 --> 00:28:01.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it went to another floor,
and then the whole entire hospital.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every floor had COVID patients.

00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:11.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was some of the hardest nursing
that I’ve ever done in my life

00:28:11.794 --> 00:28:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of my years of nursing.

00:28:14.463 --> 00:28:18.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we lost a lot of good nurses

00:28:18.634 --> 00:28:23.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were right in the trenches with me
who were in there doing their best.

00:28:23.222 --> 00:28:25.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
We lost a lot of good people.

00:28:25.224 --> 00:28:29.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was on medication to help me,

00:28:29.186 --> 00:28:31.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
it still didn’t take the depression away.

00:28:31.397 --> 00:28:33.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re like: ‘What’s the point?

00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:35.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I can’t save anyone.

00:28:35.484 --> 00:28:38.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t, I can’t help anyone.’

00:28:39.697 --> 00:28:44.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was devastating.
It truly, truly was devastating.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:52.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever felt as Feliks did
when he asked,

00:28:52.459 --> 00:28:55.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How much worse can it get?”

00:28:56.255 --> 00:28:59.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, a spiritual person

00:28:59.717 --> 00:29:02.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
can see each new challenge

00:29:02.094 --> 00:29:06.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an opportunity to rely on Jehovah.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:11.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we watch
the concluding part of this video,

00:29:11.103 --> 00:29:14.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
please take note of how Jehovah strengthened

00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:16.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
these brothers and sisters

00:29:16.567 --> 00:29:20.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deepened their friendship with him.

00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:23.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about your own circumstances

00:29:23.407 --> 00:29:27.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ways that Jehovah
has helped you through trials,

00:29:27.995 --> 00:29:30.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have full confidence

00:29:30.998 --> 00:29:34.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will continue to do so.

00:29:38.756 --> 00:29:41.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I decided
that I was going to stop asking,

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:43.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How much worse could it get?”

00:29:45.471 --> 00:29:47.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Jehovah for endurance

00:29:47.848 --> 00:29:52.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joy for that day—just for that day.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at those times, I just

00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:00.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
cry to Jehovah,

00:30:00.986 --> 00:30:05.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to Jehovah about how I’m feeling,

00:30:05.574 --> 00:30:09.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just ask for his peace
to help me to deal.

00:30:11.997 --> 00:30:16.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve talked to Jehovah
very intimately and personally

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:21.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never like I have
when I was so alone there.

00:30:24.134 --> 00:30:27.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I was going to die.

00:30:29.807 --> 00:30:34.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Jehovah if he saw enough good in me,

00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would just resurrect me

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:39.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I’d love to be in his new world

00:30:39.858 --> 00:30:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see my husband again and my children.

00:30:44.196 --> 00:30:48.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thanked him so much
for the life that I had.

00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:53.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I felt such a peace

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I’d never felt before.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:31:02.464 --> 00:31:05.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just knew it was Jehovah getting me out.

00:31:06.844 --> 00:31:09.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
The obedience, just doing what we were told,

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:12.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
it came from Jehovah, and it was so simple.

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gave him something to bless,
and it may have saved my life.

00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:26.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just never wanted to be a burden on people,

00:31:26.989 --> 00:31:28.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:31:28.615 --> 00:31:32.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters
had come from all over the country

00:31:32.161 --> 00:31:36.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do work for this house
and the other houses—all of them.

00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:41.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made me feel wanted,

00:31:41.253 --> 00:31:43.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they made me feel loved.

00:31:45.299 --> 00:31:49.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feel like Jehovah cared enough
to give attention to me,

00:31:51.764 --> 00:31:54.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
I

00:31:54.391 --> 00:31:56.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
just felt so unworthy.

00:31:56.477 --> 00:31:59.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here all these people

00:31:59.188 --> 00:32:01.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
are here taking care of me.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you just look at them,
and then you think:

00:32:05.694 --> 00:32:08.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m part of this organization.
I’ve got to do better.

00:32:08.906 --> 00:32:11.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to be like them
and make other people happy.’

00:32:18.999 --> 00:32:22.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m able to help people
who are battling depression,

00:32:22.002 --> 00:32:24.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like Jehovah is using me in that way,

00:32:24.588 --> 00:32:28.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it makes me happy
that I can be of use to Jehovah.

00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:32.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to feel—
It’s so nice to feel good again,

00:32:32.763 --> 00:32:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel happy again, to be able to smile,

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:38.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to take in enjoyment

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the small things, you know,
in Jehovah’s creation

00:32:41.104 --> 00:32:46.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and, you know, just be happy that I’m alive.

00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:48.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
So

00:32:49.613 --> 00:32:53.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
yeah, yeah.

00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:01.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I have a stable job.

00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:03.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work at a hardware store.

00:33:05.087 --> 00:33:06.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I feel at peace.

00:33:06.463 --> 00:33:09.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
The adversities have made me stronger,

00:33:09.132 --> 00:33:13.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and overall, I have
a much closer relationship with Jehovah.

00:33:13.095 --> 00:33:16.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m still making bread.

00:33:16.473 --> 00:33:19.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at home, yeah,
I’m the one who irons the clothes.

00:33:23.438 --> 00:33:28.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a while, I found out
that I was being deported.

00:33:28.443 --> 00:33:31.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember getting off the train.

00:33:32.739 --> 00:33:34.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took me through the back door,

00:33:34.741 --> 00:33:37.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my wife, Zhenya,
was standing at the main entrance.

00:33:37.286 --> 00:33:39.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was on the phone. She couldn’t see me.

00:33:39.955 --> 00:33:42.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was looking at the main entrance.

00:33:43.458 --> 00:33:47.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I threw my bag down as I ran to her.

00:33:49.464 --> 00:33:53.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could see from the corner of her eyes
someone was running.

00:33:53.719 --> 00:33:56.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was a little confused, even scared.

00:34:03.395 --> 00:34:05.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there I was

00:34:09.443 --> 00:34:12.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
hugging the person I loved the most.

00:34:12.654 --> 00:34:16.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was one
of the most beautiful days of my life.

00:34:23.999 --> 00:34:26.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:34:26.209 --> 00:34:27.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Privet.</i>

00:34:29.046 --> 00:34:30.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:39.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard that you were praying for us

00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:42.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the brothers and sisters in Russia,

00:34:43.727 --> 00:34:45.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really encouraged me and Feliks.

00:34:45.729 --> 00:34:48.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s such an example for me personally.

00:34:49.816 --> 00:34:51.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We mentioned it in our prayer yesterday;

00:34:51.818 --> 00:34:53.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feliks was saying

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are a great example
of how we need

00:34:56.907 --> 00:35:01.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to genuinely care
for our brothers and sisters.

00:35:02.287 --> 00:35:05.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you very much.

00:35:17.678 --> 00:35:18.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:35:18.637 --> 00:35:19.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:35:19.596 --> 00:35:20.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was nice meeting you.

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:22.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:35:25.978 --> 00:35:27.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
My cancer is uncurable,

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I know the cure is in the new system.

00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:33.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the cure!

00:35:38.448 --> 00:35:42.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like to imagine, ‘When that time happens,
what will I be doing?’

00:35:43.203 --> 00:35:45.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, I’m going to be jumping for joy

00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:48.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m going to be rid of my cancer.

00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:51.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to enjoy food
that we never really got to enjoy,

00:35:51.586 --> 00:35:55.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m going to have so many animals.

00:35:55.007 --> 00:35:59.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to make a house.
I’m going to learn how to make a house.

00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:03.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace in this world is not the absence

00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
of illness,

00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:08.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
danger,

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
persecution,

00:36:12.774 --> 00:36:15.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
or economic problems.

00:36:16.153 --> 00:36:20.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace in this world
is listening to Jehovah’s guidance,

00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:24.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
praying to Jehovah constantly,

00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:30.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditating on Jehovah’s Word
and his promises.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:36.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace in this world is also

00:36:36.423 --> 00:36:38.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
having good friends by our side

00:36:40.844 --> 00:36:43.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and having a good sense of humor.

00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:50.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I’ve learned from all of this

00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:55.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace isn’t from what’s outside,

00:36:55.025 --> 00:36:58.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what’s going on,
or from what you’re experiencing.

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:02.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that peace is on the inside,

00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:05.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that comes from Jehovah.

00:37:11.249 --> 00:37:14.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
These examples we’ve just seen

00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:16.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
are of ordinary people

00:37:16.838 --> 00:37:19.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with feelings like ours.”

00:37:19.257 --> 00:37:22.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they felt peace

00:37:22.052 --> 00:37:25.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when confronting serious trials.

00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:28.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they do it?

00:37:28.391 --> 00:37:30.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Miguel lost his job,

00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:34.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
he kept his focus on serving Jehovah

00:37:34.564 --> 00:37:38.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was not too proud to do humble work

00:37:38.235 --> 00:37:40.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide for his family.

00:37:41.238 --> 00:37:45.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Margaret was prepared for a natural disaster,

00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:48.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and throughout her ordeal,

00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:51.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
she prayed to Jehovah.

00:37:51.498 --> 00:37:54.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
While struggling with depression,

00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:58.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nikki did research using our publications

00:37:58.255 --> 00:38:02.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked for help from the elders.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when facing brutal persecution,

00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:10.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feliks showed kindness to his persecutors.

00:38:10.142 --> 00:38:13.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that the way he responded

00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:16.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
would reflect Christian qualities.

00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:18.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
And dear Antoinette,

00:38:18.859 --> 00:38:21.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite her diagnosis,

00:38:21.653 --> 00:38:24.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
focuses not on herself

00:38:24.823 --> 00:38:27.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on helping others.

00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:30.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she said, the cure for her

00:38:30.996 --> 00:38:33.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as it is for all of us—

00:38:33.123 --> 00:38:35.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
is God’s Kingdom.

00:38:36.918 --> 00:38:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are experiencing trials,

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on what you can control,

00:38:44.593 --> 00:38:46.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
help others,

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:48.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
be grateful,

Many years ago, I started working at a firm,

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and I helped a sister to get a position

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the same firm.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time went on, I may have come

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the wrong conclusion, but I felt

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this sister wanted to be in charge.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel very happy about it.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:27.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few months later,
I was retrenched from work.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt very hurt.

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother always told me

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the “lesser one”
and just to let things go.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept quiet, and I left the firm.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of certain circumstances,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we changed congregations,
so we didn’t see each other anymore.

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those years, at the meetings

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or reading the Bible,

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were regularly reminded to be forgiving.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt to me like a stab in my heart

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I knew we had to apply this counsel.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being at the convention, every time,

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a bit nervous

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I basically had to prepare myself.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should I bump into her,

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how was I going to handle it?

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did ruin the spiritual atmosphere
of the convention.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after my mother passed away,

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had our regional convention.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very emotional.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw this sister standing there,
and I wondered to myself,

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What is going to happen now?’

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:47.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She came up to me;

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she gave me a hug and a small present.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That particular day,

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I definitely felt relieved and I felt

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I could now make peace.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:05.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If both of us had applied earlier

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the advice given at Colossians 3:13

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:11.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by being forgiving,

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neither of us
would have had to carry

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:17.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this emotional burden for so many years.

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:21.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am very happy to say,

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:24.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mona and I are good friends today.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We serve together in the same congregation

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as elders, and the relationship

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I have today
with Luis is that we’re friends.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:37.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But when we transferred it to the workplace,

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that beautiful friendship began to fade.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.268 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, as a builder,

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.688 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m old-school and used to being in charge.

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps I was too proud.

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But somebody couldn’t come and tell me
how to do certain things.

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since I was the crew leader,
I said right from the start:

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, what is he doing here?

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he have any right
to an opinion about this?”

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I made sure to push
the brother aside completely.

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:10.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can remember that when I entered
the Kingdom Hall through one door

00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saw Brother Luis,

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would look
for any possible excuse to avoid him.

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t even say hello.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither of us said hello.

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:25.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, the internal battle
between the fleshly-minded person

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the spiritual person
was a very tough battle.

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like that for several years.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I think, ‘I wasted time.’

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that would have helped me
to maintain peace and unity

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my brother would have been
to be obedient to what Jehovah says,

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what the Bible says,
and to what we hear at the meetings.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, I wasn’t obedient.

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:57.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson that I have learned from this
is that Jehovah is always right.

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:00.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the exact moment when something happens,

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should immediately act.

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Carlos Henry himself was the one
that then stopped me and told me,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We can’t keep going on like this.”

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:13.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took a very important step

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could sort things out.

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:20.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be happy, you have to apply
the principles you find in God’s Word.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words at Romans 14:19

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:28.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourage us
to “pursue the things making for peace.”

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I would’ve done differently
is that I wouldn’t have let time go by.

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, I should have sought out the brother

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:41.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more promptly
and restored that friendship again.

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:44.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it’s true
that you can’t recover time,

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:46.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can recover a brother.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship, once again,
with Luis is that we are friends,

00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s a true friend.

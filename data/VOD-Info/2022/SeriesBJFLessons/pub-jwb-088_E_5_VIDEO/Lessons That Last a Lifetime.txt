00:00:13 It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost a decade
00:00:17 since that first release in 2012.
00:00:21 In that time,
00:00:23 the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series
00:00:26 has proved to be a real gift from Jehovah.
00:00:31 Through these Bible lessons, children can learn to be kind,
00:00:36 to be honest,
00:00:38 to be respectful,
00:00:40 and to develop other godly qualities
00:00:42 that help them see and obey
00:00:46 “the One who is invisible.”
00:00:49 How can we begin to understand
00:00:51 the far-reaching impact
00:00:54 this series has had on Christian families?
00:00:57 We’re going to let Christian parents tell
00:01:00 how these videos have helped their children
00:01:04 to become Jehovah’s friend.
00:01:09 Kady-Ann had a really hard time
00:01:12 working together with the older brothers
00:01:14 and sisters in the congregation.
00:01:16 I had a really hard time because
00:01:21 they’re kind of slow.
00:01:25 But Lesson 25: Making Friends
00:01:29 was just what I needed.
00:01:32 We spent a few weeks discussing the videos
00:01:35 during our Family Worship evening.
00:01:38 The videos helped her to be more open-minded
00:01:41 —to be more respectful to the elderly brothers and sisters
00:01:45 and want to work with them in field service.
00:01:50 Sophia liked chatting with Sister Elsa,
00:01:52 even though she’s so old.
00:01:55 So I can do that too.
00:01:57 These videos strengthened
00:02:00 my relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:03 I know that he hasn’t forgotten me as a single parent.
00:02:08 It can be so hard for single parents
00:02:11 because they are trying to take on the role of both parents.
00:02:18 I got baptized because I love Jehovah
00:02:21 with my whole heart.
00:02:23 Jehovah still loves me, even though I’m made from dust,
00:02:27 and I’m so little.
00:02:30 He took some of the weight off my shoulders.
00:02:40 Laura,
00:02:41 our middle child,
00:02:43 was perfectly healthy
00:02:45 until she turned four years old.
00:02:48 That’s when she was diagnosed with a rare tumor
00:02:50 in her central nervous system.
00:02:53 Unfortunately, when the treatment was over, Laura passed away.
00:03:00 Even while she was sick,
00:03:02 she just loved watching the videos.
00:03:05 Her favorite one was Let’s Go in Service.
00:03:09 This video really made her want to talk about Jehovah.
00:03:13 During the time that she was receiving
00:03:15 chemotherapy treatments, which lowered her immunity,
00:03:18 we couldn’t even leave the house with her.
00:03:23 But sometimes we’d bring her to get a checkup or get an exam done,
00:03:28 and the doctor would say that everything was fine for now
00:03:31 —that her immunity was OK.
00:03:33 And the very first thing that she’d say to the doctor was,
00:03:36 “So I can go in the ministry, right?”
00:03:39 And the doctor would laugh and say, “Sure you can.”
00:03:41 And our family would take advantage of those times
00:03:44 to go in field service together as a family —all together.
00:03:48 That made Laura so happy.
00:03:55 It does us good to remember
00:03:57 why the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series was created.
00:04:03 These videos were not designed as mere entertainment
00:04:08 to simply pacify children for a short period of time.
00:04:14 These lessons were designed to help children
00:04:17 build a relationship with Jehovah
00:04:20 so that they can live and serve him forever.
00:04:25 Jehovah loves children.
00:04:29 That love was evident in how his Son, Jesus Christ,
00:04:33 treated children.
00:04:35 The Governing Body shares that love as well.
00:04:40 Also,
00:04:42 Jehovah loves Christian parents.
00:04:46 He sees how hard you work to impress
00:04:48 a love for God deep in your child’s heart.
00:04:53 No doubt you look forward to sharing
00:04:56 every new video with your child
00:04:59 to help him learn to love and respect Jehovah,
00:05:03 Jesus, and God’s Word.
00:05:07 But more important,
00:05:09 how do you think Jehovah feels
00:05:12 knowing that a young child can come to know him
00:05:16 through this animated series
00:05:18 and grow up to become his dedicated servant?
00:05:23 That is truly special.
00:05:28 We will continue to pray
00:05:30 that this series reaches the hearts of our young ones
00:05:34 and draws them closer to Jehovah
00:05:37 —their Friend now and forever.

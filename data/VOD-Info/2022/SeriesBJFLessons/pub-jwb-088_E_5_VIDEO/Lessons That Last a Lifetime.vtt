It’s hard to believe
that it’s been almost a decade

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since that first release in 2012.

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that time,

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:26.297 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend </i> series

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.759 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has proved to be a real gift from Jehovah.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through these Bible lessons,
children can learn to be kind,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be honest,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be respectful,

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to develop other godly qualities

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help them see and obey

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One who is invisible.”

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we begin to understand

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the far-reaching impact

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this series has had on Christian families?

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to let Christian parents tell

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how these videos have helped their children

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become Jehovah’s friend.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.217 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Kady-Ann had a really hard time

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:14.219 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
working together with the older brothers

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and sisters in the congregation.

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a really hard time because

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re kind of slow.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But <i>Lesson 25: Making Friends </i>

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:32.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was just what I needed.

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent a few weeks discussing the videos

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during our Family Worship evening.

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The videos helped her to be more open-minded

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be more respectful
to the elderly brothers and sisters

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and want to work with them in field service.

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia liked chatting with Sister Elsa,

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though she’s so old.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I can do that too.

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These videos strengthened

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:03.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that he hasn’t forgotten me
as a single parent.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be so hard for single parents

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they are trying to take on
the role of both parents.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:21.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized because I love Jehovah

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my whole heart.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah still loves me,
even though I’m made from dust,

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m so little.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took some of the weight off my shoulders.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laura,

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our middle child,

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.269 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was perfectly healthy

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.063 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until she turned four years old.

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when she was diagnosed
with a rare tumor

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in her central nervous system.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately, when the treatment was over,
Laura passed away.

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even while she was sick,

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:05.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she just loved watching the videos.

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her favorite one was <i>Let’s Go in Service.</i>

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video really made her
want to talk about Jehovah.

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:15.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the time that she was receiving

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:18.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chemotherapy treatments,
which lowered her immunity,

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we couldn’t even leave the house with her.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:28.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes we’d bring her
to get a checkup or get an exam done,

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the doctor would say
that everything was fine for now

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that her immunity was OK.

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the very first thing
that she’d say to the doctor was,

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So I can go in the ministry, right?”

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the doctor would laugh and say,
“Sure you can.”

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our family would take advantage
of those times

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:48.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go in field service together as a family
—all together.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made Laura so happy.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does us good to remember

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:02.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  series
was created.

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These videos were not designed
as mere entertainment

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to simply pacify children
for a short period of time.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These lessons were designed to help children

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build a relationship with Jehovah

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can live and serve him forever.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:29.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves children.

00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That love was evident
in how his Son, Jesus Christ,

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:35.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
treated children.

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body shares that love as well.

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also,

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves Christian parents.

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees how hard you work to impress

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a love for God deep in your child’s heart.

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:56.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you look forward to sharing

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every new video with your child

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:03.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help him learn
to love and respect Jehovah,

00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:07.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, and God’s Word.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more important,

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:12.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you think Jehovah feels

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that a young child
can come to know him

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:18.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through this animated series

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grow up to become his dedicated servant?

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is truly special.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will continue to pray

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this series reaches the hearts
of our young ones

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:37.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draws them closer to Jehovah

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:41.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—their Friend now and forever.

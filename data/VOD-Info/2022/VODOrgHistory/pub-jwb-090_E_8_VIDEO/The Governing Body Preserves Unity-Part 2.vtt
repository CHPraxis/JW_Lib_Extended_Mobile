WEBVTT

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know I’ve had an illness,

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m getting along all right.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a little tumor here in the brain,

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
which the doctors are treating.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whatever comes, one way or the other,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, it has been wonderful
to work with you all these years,

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I enjoyed it tremendously.

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m very grateful to Jehovah

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:45.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could come to this meeting

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be with you.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like C. T. Russell before him,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr had an exceptional gift

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:07.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
for organizing the Kingdom work.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
That set the stage for the amazing growth

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:14.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the organization experienced
during the closing decades

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 20th century.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
Nathan Knorr died on June 8, 1977.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.395 line:10% position:50% align:center
Note what Brother Albert Schroeder,

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.105 line:10% position:50% align:center
a fellow member of the Governing Body,

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:26.899 line:10% position:50% align:center
wrote about him:

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As the Society’s principal administrator,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there have come to be over 90 branches.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brother Knorr has proved to be

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the right theocratic entrepreneur

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this period of Jehovah’s Kingdom work.”

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:44.249 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr helped to clarify the role

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.627 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body and its committees.

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:48.629 line:10% position:50% align:center
Headquarters representatives

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
were sent out to various branches,

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.550 line:10% position:50% align:center
branches were better organized,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.928 line:10% position:50% align:center
bodies of elders were appointed

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.180 line:10% position:50% align:center
in various congregations,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.766 line:10% position:50% align:center
training programs were instituted,

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.810 line:10% position:50% align:center
and schools were established.

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:05.020 line:10% position:50% align:center
Because of the organizational growth,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
the number of conventions

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:08.148 line:10% position:50% align:center
being held worldwide

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.275 line:10% position:50% align:center
now numbered into the hundreds,

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.319 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the Governing Body members

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.529 line:10% position:50% align:center
wanted to be present

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.906 line:10% position:50% align:center
at as many of those conventions as possible.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the 1969 “Peace on Earth”
International Convention,

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:22.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Governing Body member

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
would fly to the convention city

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:25.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the opening day,

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
catch a flight to another convention city,

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then return to the original city

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could speak on the closing day.

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1970’s and 1980’s,

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
many existing branches

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
with printing and shipping capabilities

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to expand to ensure

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:43.851 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the worldwide supply of spiritual food

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.602 line:10% position:50% align:center
would flow uninterrupted

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what happened on the world scene.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times,

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were more than 20 branch construction

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
or expansion projects

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
going on simultaneously.

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:56.071 line:10% position:50% align:center
And the Governing Body

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.115 line:10% position:50% align:center
was very interested in each one

00:02:58.115 --> 00:02:59.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
and eager to dedicate

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:02.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
the new facilities once completed.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.875 line:10% position:50% align:center
For me, it was always very encouraging

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have contact
with the brothers of the Governing Body,

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see their great zeal

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their loving interests

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the brothers behind the Iron Curtain.

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:21.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1977,

00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:24.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
something outstanding happened.

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1977,

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was possible

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:33.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Brothers Jaracz, Franz, and Sydlik

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visit the brothers in Poland.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was the first time

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the first time—

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
that members of the Governing Body

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
could visit the country

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:46.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind the Iron Curtain.

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spoke to many overseers,

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:53.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
pioneers, and longtime Witnesses.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was, of course, a wonderful experience.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
One year after this visit,

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Jaracz along with Brother Henschel

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to get an appointment
with government officials

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote a more tolerant attitude
of Jehovah’s organization

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the work
that Jehovah’s Witnesses were doing

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:13.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Eastern Europe and especially in Poland.

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:15.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, mind you, this was all taking place

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
some ten years prior

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.158 line:10% position:50% align:center
They took various steps

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:25.244 line:10% position:50% align:center
to meet with the local brothers in person.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Barry of the Governing Body

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the opportunity to hold a secret meeting

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Leningrad with Brother Kose,

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was responsible
for the activity in the territory.

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:37.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kose said that he received

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
tremendous encouragement
from that discussion,

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:42.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the conversation with Brother Barry.

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:47.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was interesting
that it wasn’t until after that meeting

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:50.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Brother Kose found out
that he had been talking

00:04:50.018 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a member of the Governing Body.

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:54.523 line:10% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Eastern Europe

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:56.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
really needed help to resist

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.235 line:10% position:50% align:center
decades of satanic efforts

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:00.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy their faith in Jehovah

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
and weaken the unity
and confidence in His organization.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:07.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
The members of the Governing Body

00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:09.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed very deep appreciation

00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:11.915 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the brothers

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:14.585 line:10% position:50% align:center
who kept the communication

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.879 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the brothers behind the Iron Curtain.

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you have to imagine

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:21.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
that to get the spiritual food there,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had to be willing
to take a personal risk

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:28.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visit

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:32.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to bring the spiritual food
to the brothers there,

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:36.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just to the countries right close

00:05:36.273 --> 00:05:39.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
but down there to the brothers

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:42.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
—down there to Siberia.

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:45.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the second half of the 1980’s,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Iron Curtain began to open up.

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a sense of freedom in the air.

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:56.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers in Eastern Europe
could feel that freedom.

00:05:56.293 --> 00:05:58.795 line:10% position:50% align:center
As governments granted permission,

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:00.547 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body organized

00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:04.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions in Eastern-bloc countries

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, in Poland and Czechoslovakia.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:10.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when bans were lifted,

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
the members of the Governing Body

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:17.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled many times
to all the countries that were possible

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Poland, Hungary, Romania,

00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:22.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Czechoslovakia, Russia, Ukraine,

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:24.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to the Baltic States,

00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to Belarus.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
In November 1989,

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Berlin Wall came down.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this was a great turning point

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:35.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the history of the 20th century.

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:38.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it also meant greater freedom
for our brothers.

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:41.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body really sprung into action.

00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:42.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted to go

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:43.548 line:10% position:50% align:center
and accelerate the work there.

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:45.550 line:10% position:50% align:center
So Brother Jaracz as well as other members

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.593 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:48.303 line:10% position:50% align:center
closely supervised the work.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:49.888 line:10% position:50% align:center
Therefore, the number of visits they made,

00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:51.974 line:10% position:50% align:center
well, just skyrocketed.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the fall of 1989,

00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:56.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Milton Henschel and Theodore Jaracz

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the unique opportunity of visiting

00:06:58.897 --> 00:07:00.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers in the Soviet Union

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:02.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the first time.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:06.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers really wanted
to study the situation on the ground.

00:07:07.698 --> 00:07:11.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
They met with all of the elders,
circuit overseers,

00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:14.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
district overseers,
and members of the Country Committee.

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like one big shepherding visit.

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:25.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Eastern Europe,
1991 was the stage

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
for three international conventions

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:31.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the subject
“Lovers of Godly Freedom.”

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:35.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course,
besides these international conventions,

00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:37.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
other open conventions

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:41.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
(so not in secret, no, open conventions)

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
were held for the first time

00:07:44.192 --> 00:07:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the former Soviet Union

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:51.074 line:10% position:50% align:center
—in Estonia, in Russia, and in the Ukraine.

00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:53.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just imagine!

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:56.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
After decades of such difficult persecution,

00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:59.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
we experienced the opportunity to be together

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our worldwide brotherhood

00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:04.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see the brothers
from the Governing Body.

00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:07.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was an unforgettable time.

00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:10.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the happiest of times.

00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:12.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was super!

00:08:12.763 --> 00:08:17.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
One outstanding convention
was held in Zagreb.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it was a loving
and a courageous decision

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body to go there

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:29.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the uncertainty

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:32.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the political situation in the country

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:36.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe (coming up) a civil war.

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:40.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention was the only public event

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was allowed by the government

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:45.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Zagreb.

00:08:45.003 --> 00:08:47.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
All other public events

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:49.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
were canceled,

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:52.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the convention
of Jehovah’s Witnesses was not.

00:08:52.803 --> 00:08:54.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Policemen and soldiers

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:58.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
assigned to keep security
and order in the stadium

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
were astonished that Serbians, Croats,

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:05.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slovenians, Montenegrins, and Bosnians

00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:10.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
were sitting together in peace and in unity.

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:13.573 line:10% position:50% align:center
At those international conventions

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:14.741 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Eastern Europe,

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:18.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
members of the Governing Body
gave the final motivating talk.

00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:22.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those talks,
given less than five months

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the thrill
of obtaining legal recognition

00:09:25.293 --> 00:09:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our work in the Soviet Union,

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthened and encouraged our brothers

00:09:30.173 --> 00:09:32.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
for trials they would face in the future.

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:36.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s plain to see
that the Governing Body of years past

00:09:36.513 --> 00:09:38.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
expended themselves

00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:40.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “know well the appearance of [the] flock.”

00:09:40.684 --> 00:09:42.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
They poured themselves out

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:44.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like a drink offering”

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:46.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to “take good care of [the] sheep.”

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same deep love

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:51.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tender concern for you,

00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:53.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sheep of the Great Shepherd’s flock,

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:56.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been evident throughout modern times

00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
right down to this day.

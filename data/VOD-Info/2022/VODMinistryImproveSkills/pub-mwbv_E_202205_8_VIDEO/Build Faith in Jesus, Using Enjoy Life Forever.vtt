OK, Gene,

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last review question is,
How can Jesus’ death benefit you?

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose I should say
that it means forgiveness from my sins,

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:18.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God is not going to forgive me.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes you feel that way?

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t feel; I know.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made better choices in my business
than I did at home.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gene,

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scroll down to where it says “Explore”

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and click under
“Can Jehovah forgive even serious sins?”

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, got it.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some people have committed gross sins
and wonder

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether God can forgive them.

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happily, the Word of God says:

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from <i>all</i>  sin.’

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have a proper, repentant attitude.”

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even serious ones—
and he draws us to him.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s not free.

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah 1:18?

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:26.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see it.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read it, please?

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, now, and let us set matters straight
between us,’ says Jehovah.

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Though your sins are like scarlet,
they will be made as white as snow;

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘though they are as red as crimson cloth,

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will become like wool.’”

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So forgiveness of our sins is possible

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:48.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we “set matters straight.”

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:52.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you, Gene,

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think that means?

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to do what’s right.

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m trying.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s good.

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:04.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also involves how we feel.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should feel sorry.
I am.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s a good sign, Gene.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:16.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lastly, let Jehovah help you with the step
that’s the hardest for many of us.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help you forgive yourself.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus died for me.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ron, I think I’m going to need
a little more time to process this.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all do.

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go ahead and conclude with a prayer,

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll specifically ask Jehovah
to strengthen your faith in the ransom

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:46.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his forgiveness.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, when you pray,
you can beg him for the same thing.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say a prayer.

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, our heavenly Father . . .

Neeta and I talked about it.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of me felt a bit scared,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
part a bit crazy.

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me knocking on doors?

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew
this was the right thing to do.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A minister should also be free

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘from all nonmedical use of addictive

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or mind-altering substances.’

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonmedical?

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking something
when I’m feeling a little stressed,

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like maybe, I don’t know, a little weed

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s OK, right?

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s for the stress.

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I didn’t quite understand
what “medical” meant.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will we see you during the week?

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jade.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be back.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can guess what
our next few studies were about.

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue
to be made new

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing it was wrong was easy.

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Figuring out how to cope
without it wasn’t.

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beating it

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt impossible.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being free of it
to serve Jehovah

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt amazing!

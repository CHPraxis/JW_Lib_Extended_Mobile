OK, good.

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:06.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Point 6,
“What Jehovah does for his friends.”

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:09.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, can you tap that link

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:11.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Has Done So Much For Me”?

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 14,

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that happened in the past

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like everything
that happened in my life

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was my fault.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning from the Bible that God says

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will take my right hand,

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will fortify me,
that he will really help me

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it blew me away!

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She mentioned a Bible passage

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah takes our hand.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:01:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read that at Isaiah 41:10, 13,

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please?

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:11.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on to you
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 13: “For I, Jehovah your God,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will help you.’”

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:28.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Cassie,

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to these verses,
what does Jehovah promise to do

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of his friends?

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help us when we’re down or scared.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look a little closer, though.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify . . . ,

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:42.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will help . . . ,

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:45.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on . . .”

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—does that sound like a Friend who can help

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a Friend who wants to help?

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:56.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought of God, Jehovah,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that.

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Jehovah
would make a good Friend?

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:02.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10, Jehovah
stretches out his hand to you.

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:14.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His right.

00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 13,
he takes your hand.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My right.

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:25.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, come here.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is Jehovah

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beside you

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:35.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holding your hand?

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is he—

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:42.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In front.

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his right hand

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking your right hand.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s facing you

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pull you up and out.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, what has Jehovah
pulled you out of?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um,

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hopelessness.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a direct result
of friendship with Jehovah.

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It grows stronger

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we talk to him.

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that in the next section, OK?

But, Mum, listen.

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:05.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jade, you listen!

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t this just another
one of your phases?

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to move on, Love.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holidays are our time.

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all I get from you.

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:18.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise me you’ll be here.

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise!

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really don’t want to disappoint her,

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t disappoint Jehovah.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You love them both.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you think he can help you?

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to him.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent a long time
pouring out my heart to him.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remembered something
from one of the Psalms:

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will walk in your truth.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart
to fear your name.”

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember someone once claiming
to be “all about the promises.”

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Made any good ones lately?

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:04.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“If it is your will, I would be happy

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enter pioneer service.”

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had to work really hard
to provide for the needs of my family

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because my father had died
when he was 45 years old.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elder that I talked to

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave me advice not to be picky
about what kind of job I could get.

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:28.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminded me of Matthew 6:33,
and told me

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be overly anxious.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of our good communication
within the family,

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were able to find solutions.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My other siblings realized
that they also shared

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responsibility in providing
for the needs of the family.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After one year of pioneering,
I was encouraged to apply for Bethel service,

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now I am in Bethel.

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that Jehovah really cares for me,
loves me,

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciates all my efforts.

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they love me, my cousins
pressured me to choose a secular career.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I went against

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.469 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
their wishes, it would hurt them

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.013 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and put a strain on our relationship.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really anxious.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to show my trust
in Jehovah by pioneering

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:26.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give him an opportunity to show me
that I can be happy in his service.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to express my appreciation
for my cousins by what 

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said and did

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showed them love.

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve realized
that I have changed for the better.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I show more concern for others now.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they understand that we have been
learning good things and that we have

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a happier and more meaningful life.

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:00.015 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to try serving

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:01.684 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where the need was great.

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:03.394 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I first arrived,

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:06.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was so cool being there.

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had expected the poverty,
but when I saw it,

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it hit home more than what I had expected.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then I started to feel really homesick.

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my brothers and sisters—

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d go to the Kingdom Hall and they
were able to cope with the challenges

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were facing because they had
Jehovah in their life.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So their example really helped me to see
that my circumstances

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:31.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t need to change
for my attitude to change.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 15:15 stood out to me,

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is about having “a cheerful heart”

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being able to have “a continual feast”
no matter what my circumstances are.

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I found an article about that scripture.

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:50.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so from there, I decided to ask myself,
‘How can I use my situation

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what I’m learning to help others?’

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I got to start helping
with a foreign-language group there.

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:57.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That whole experience

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:02.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just made my love for people grow so much

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:04.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and definitely changed my life.

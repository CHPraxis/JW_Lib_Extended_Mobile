00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.607 line:10% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5, 6

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.734 line:10% position:50% align:center
made a tremendous impression on me:

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:10.281 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart.”

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was younger, I probably said:

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All right.
Let me try it and see if it works.”

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:17.705 line:10% position:50% align:center
As much as I loved

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.415 line:10% position:50% align:center
what I was learning from Jehovah,

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:20.833 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was still leaning a lot

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.168 line:10% position:50% align:center
on my own understanding.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
Obviously, when we make

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.881 line:10% position:50% align:center
decisions in our lives—

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.965 line:10% position:50% align:center
A spiritual person

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.134 line:10% position:50% align:center
will review and think,

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:31.886 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘Let’s do this Jehovah’s way.’

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was something
that I had lost sight of

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
at that moment in my life.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was considerable opposition
to the work.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
We expected that when we did street work,

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:51.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might be picked up and taken to jail.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s organization
had explained to us

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we were to handle it.

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do remember
when the police finally picked me up,

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they drove me down to Chicago.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about an hour’s drive,

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they asked me,
“So, what did you do wrong?”

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had one hour to witness to them.

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as I recall, I kept track of it,
and I counted the time too.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things didn’t disturb us

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we were being trained
by Jehovah’s organization.

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew what to do.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I ended up in a jail
in Chicago for a weekend,

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was nothing I could do about it,

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I put up with it.

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was home for a day or two.

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I went back to my assignment,
and I kept on working.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
I left the rest in Jehovah’s hands,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he handled it very nicely,

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we were in jail
or whether we were not.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, I stumbled
upon the punk rock anarchist scene.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this really called out to me
because here I could be myself;

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could establish my own standards.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that scene eventually led me down

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a very dark path of immorality,

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:18.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
drug abuse, drunkenness,
and a lot of violence.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:22.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt lonely.

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt betrayed.

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that nothing made sense.

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:30.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember thinking back

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:35.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
to when I was learning about Jehovah
and how simple things were.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to give Jehovah another shot.

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:43.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading Matthew 16:24 hit me really hard,

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says to ‘disown yourself,’

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I knew that scripture,
but I still hadn’t really focused

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what it meant for me.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew I had to let go
of certain parts of my personality

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of my old lifestyle.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d never really given Jehovah
a completely fair chance.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started applying more fully
the principles I found,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started trusting Jehovah more.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very quickly things
started falling into place:

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
the determination that I had to serve him,

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
the changes that I needed to make
—changes that I never thought I could make.

00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt that spiritual progress was

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
appointments and assignments.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think pride got the best of me there.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:38.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very shortly after we got
to the congregation in Brooklyn,

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m out in service with the coordinator,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he says to me:

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The letter came back,
and you weren’t recommended as a servant.

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:51.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know what happened?”

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said,
“Well, you know,

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think those brothers
have some problems over there.”

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said:
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop for a second here.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You don’t need to tell me anything negative
about the brothers in that hall.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:09.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Focus on what you need to do,

00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:11.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah
will take care of the rest of it.”

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really did feel like Jehovah
was just saying: ‘OK, stop.

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now you need to focus on you.’

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really just allowed me to relax

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focus on what
was really a lot more important

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
than whether I had a certain position
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
The humility and the patience

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:36.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love and the adjustments
that I needed to make

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:38.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being a more obedient servant of Jehovah—

00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:40.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
those were the things that were so important

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had forgotten about for a while.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the time that I spent pursuing
my own interests

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
always led to disappointment.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:54.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now that I’ve learned about Jehovah

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and living by his principles,

00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:59.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have been having the time of my life.

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:01.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
To know that Jehovah just simply wants

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:03.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make me the best version of me

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:07.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teach me to enhance my personality

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:09.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to become better,

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really endeared me to Jehovah.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah really cared about me enough

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:19.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
to mold my thinking.

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:23.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was kind of like my life
was back in focus,

00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:28.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was able to just relax
and serve Jehovah happily.

00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:33.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course, the blessings
started really pouring in after that.

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:37.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything I’ve done
connected with the truth,

00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have enjoyed every speck of it.

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:46.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might have some great idea,
but

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found out:
You do things Jehovah’s way

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the end result is nothing but good.

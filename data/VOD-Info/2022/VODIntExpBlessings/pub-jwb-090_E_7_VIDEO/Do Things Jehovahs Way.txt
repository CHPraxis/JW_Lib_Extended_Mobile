00:00:01 Proverbs 3:5, 6
00:00:03 made a tremendous impression on me:
00:00:05 “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart.”
00:00:10 When I was younger, I probably said:
00:00:12 “All right. Let me try it and see if it works.”
00:00:16 As much as I loved
00:00:17 what I was learning from Jehovah,
00:00:19 I was still leaning a lot
00:00:20 on my own understanding.
00:00:23 Obviously, when we make
00:00:25 decisions in our lives—
00:00:26 A spiritual person
00:00:27 will review and think,
00:00:30 ‘Let’s do this Jehovah’s way.’
00:00:31 And that was something that I had lost sight of
00:00:34 at that moment in my life.
00:00:40 There was considerable opposition to the work.
00:00:43 We expected that when we did street work,
00:00:47 we might be picked up and taken to jail.
00:00:51 But Jehovah’s organization had explained to us
00:00:56 how we were to handle it.
00:00:59 I do remember when the police finally picked me up,
00:01:02 and they drove me down to Chicago.
00:01:05 It was about an hour’s drive,
00:01:07 and they asked me, “So, what did you do wrong?”
00:01:10 So I had one hour to witness to them.
00:01:13 And as I recall, I kept track of it, and I counted the time too.
00:01:18 Things didn’t disturb us
00:01:20 because we were being trained by Jehovah’s organization.
00:01:24 We knew what to do.
00:01:26 So I ended up in a jail in Chicago for a weekend,
00:01:31 and there was nothing I could do about it,
00:01:35 so I put up with it.
00:01:38 So I was home for a day or two.
00:01:40 And then I went back to my assignment, and I kept on working.
00:01:43 I left the rest in Jehovah’s hands,
00:01:45 and he handled it very nicely,
00:01:48 whether we were in jail or whether we were not.
00:01:57 Eventually, I stumbled upon the punk rock anarchist scene.
00:02:02 And this really called out to me because here I could be myself;
00:02:07 I could establish my own standards.
00:02:09 But that scene eventually led me down
00:02:11 to a very dark path of immorality,
00:02:14 drug abuse, drunkenness, and a lot of violence.
00:02:20 I felt lonely.
00:02:22 I felt betrayed.
00:02:23 I felt that nothing made sense.
00:02:28 I remember thinking back
00:02:30 to when I was learning about Jehovah and how simple things were.
00:02:35 I decided to give Jehovah another shot.
00:02:39 Reading Matthew 16:24 hit me really hard,
00:02:43 where it says to ‘disown yourself,’
00:02:46 because I knew that scripture, but I still hadn’t really focused
00:02:49 on what it meant for me.
00:02:53 I knew I had to let go of certain parts of my personality
00:02:57 and of my old lifestyle.
00:02:59 I’d never really given Jehovah a completely fair chance.
00:03:03 So I started applying more fully the principles I found,
00:03:06 and I started trusting Jehovah more.
00:03:09 Very quickly things started falling into place:
00:03:11 the determination that I had to serve him,
00:03:13 the changes that I needed to make —changes that I never thought I could make.
00:03:22 I felt that spiritual progress was
00:03:26 appointments and assignments.
00:03:28 I think pride got the best of me there.
00:03:35 Very shortly after we got to the congregation in Brooklyn,
00:03:38 I’m out in service with the coordinator,
00:03:41 and he says to me:
00:03:43 “The letter came back, and you weren’t recommended as a servant.
00:03:49 Do you know what happened?”
00:03:51 So I said, “Well, you know,
00:03:53 I think those brothers have some problems over there.”
00:03:57 And he said: “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
00:03:59 “Stop for a second here.
00:04:01 “You don’t need to tell me anything negative about the brothers in that hall.
00:04:06 “Focus on what you need to do,
00:04:09 and Jehovah will take care of the rest of it.”
00:04:12 It really did feel like Jehovah was just saying: ‘OK, stop.
00:04:16 Right now you need to focus on you.’
00:04:19 And that really just allowed me to relax
00:04:22 and focus on what was really a lot more important
00:04:25 than whether I had a certain position in Jehovah’s organization.
00:04:30 The humility and the patience
00:04:32 and the love and the adjustments that I needed to make
00:04:36 —being a more obedient servant of Jehovah—
00:04:38 those were the things that were so important
00:04:40 that I had forgotten about for a while.
00:04:45 All the time that I spent pursuing my own interests
00:04:49 always led to disappointment.
00:04:51 And now that I’ve learned about Jehovah
00:04:54 and living by his principles,
00:04:57 I have been having the time of my life.
00:04:59 To know that Jehovah just simply wants
00:05:01 to make me the best version of me
00:05:03 and teach me to enhance my personality
00:05:07 and to become better,
00:05:09 that really endeared me to Jehovah.
00:05:12 Jehovah really cared about me enough
00:05:17 to mold my thinking.
00:05:20 It was kind of like my life was back in focus,
00:05:23 and I was able to just relax and serve Jehovah happily.
00:05:29 And then, of course, the blessings started really pouring in after that.
00:05:33 Everything I’ve done connected with the truth,
00:05:37 I have enjoyed every speck of it.
00:05:42 You might have some great idea, but
00:05:46 I found out: You do things Jehovah’s way
00:05:51 and the end result is nothing but good.

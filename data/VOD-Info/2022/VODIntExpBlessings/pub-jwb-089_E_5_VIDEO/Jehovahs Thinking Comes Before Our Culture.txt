00:00:01 Growing up in Canada,
00:00:02 I had a view of what hospitality was.
00:00:05 Hospitality was
00:00:07 to have the brothers and sisters over,
00:00:08 get to know them, and share a meal together
00:00:10 —something that I planned to offer to them.
00:00:14 I don’t think I ever realized
00:00:15 how much I had been influenced
00:00:17 by my own culture
00:00:20 in defining what I thought hospitality was.
00:00:25 Culture has a very big effect on us.
00:00:29 In our culture
00:00:30 young ones are not trusted very much.
00:00:32 They are not given responsibility.
00:00:34 I have seen the effect of the culture
00:00:38 inside the congregation, especially when the question
00:00:41 of giving younger ones more privileges of service,
00:00:44 or assignments, came up.
00:00:46 When it was discussed among the elders,
00:00:48 it would not really be considered.
00:00:51 And so the desire would be for him to wait a little bit longer
00:00:54 —mature a little more and gain more life experience.
00:00:58 I also thought the same way.
00:01:00 When I look back now, I realize that it really wasn’t right
00:01:04 because Jehovah’s thinking isn’t like that.
00:01:07 So when I attended the special convention in Ukraine,
00:01:10 my view of what hospitality was changed completely.
00:01:15 We get off the plane; all the brothers are there;
00:01:19 we see the love.
00:01:20 We’re overwhelmed by just the quantity of brothers that are there
00:01:24 —their smiles, their expressions.
00:01:27 As the days went on,
00:01:31 it was clear that they were just looking
00:01:33 for what we needed.
00:01:35 And it was more than, you know, just giving us some food
00:01:38 and spending some time with us.
00:01:40 There were so many other things that they did
00:01:44 that covered every one of our needs
00:01:46 when I was not sure that their own needs were being covered at times.
00:01:50 They knew they just wanted
00:01:52 to be there, and they’d figure out the rest when they got there.
00:01:55 And that really impressed me and my wife.
00:01:59 I do remember one night getting back to the hotel,
00:02:03 and we had a moment
00:02:08 to just really think about what we’d seen that day
00:02:12 and started to ask ourselves if we’d ever gone to the same extent.
00:02:16 Where I’m from,
00:02:19 we tend to stick with what we’re very comfortable with.
00:02:22 I realized that I really had unknowingly been putting limits
00:02:27 on hospitality because of what I was comfortable with
00:02:30 —because of the culture where I grew up—
00:02:33 whereas the experience in Ukraine helped me to see
00:02:37 that we can break that barrier down so much faster.
00:02:41 We could definitely feel that this was what Jehovah’s view of hospitality was.
00:02:46 It was about looking for what others need and filling those needs.
00:02:52 In time, my thinking changed
00:02:54 because I realized Jehovah’s way of thinking.
00:02:58 The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization and what I watched in them
00:03:02 helped my view to change.
00:03:06 I could actually see what a young brother or a young elder could do.
00:03:12 In the past, we used to focus on experience.
00:03:14 I would too.
00:03:16 But now Jehovah’s viewpoint is more important than just experience.
00:03:20 Jehovah doesn’t only focus on experience
00:03:24 but also on spiritual qualities.
00:03:26 I came to realize that.
00:03:29 So after we experienced
00:03:32 the special convention in Ukraine and returned home,
00:03:35 we decided that we needed to consider this more as a Family Worship project.
00:03:39 We realized we did have to make some adjustments.
00:03:42 We realized we did want to do more.
00:03:45 So we had to set specific goals
00:03:47 to be able to strip away
00:03:50 our previous definition of hospitality
00:03:53 and start extending it beyond what we were comfortable with.
00:03:57 It takes work
00:03:59 to continually break free from the limits
00:04:04 that we might set for ourselves.
00:04:06 And it was something that we realized
00:04:10 —we needed to make some changes if we were going to maintain
00:04:13 Jehovah’s view of hospitality moving forward.
00:04:16 Of course, the influence of the culture doesn’t go away overnight.
00:04:21 We still need to work hard on it.
00:04:23 We still have to change
00:04:26 because traces of the culture can still be left over.
00:04:29 But I realized we definitely need to get rid of it.
00:04:35 Now I’m really pleased to serve with those young brothers,
00:04:38 to talk with them,
00:04:39 and to see their potential as Jehovah sees it.
00:04:44 We can also see that Jehovah is very pleased too.
00:04:49 Jehovah is overjoyed.
00:04:52 He’s proud to see what those young brothers do.

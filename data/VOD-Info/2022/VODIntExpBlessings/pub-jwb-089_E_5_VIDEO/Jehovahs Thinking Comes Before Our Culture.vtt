Growing up in Canada,

00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had a view of what hospitality was.

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Hospitality was

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:08.654 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to have the brothers and sisters over,

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:10.906 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
get to know them, and share a meal together

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:14.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something that I planned to offer to them.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:15.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think I ever realized

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much I had been influenced

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by my own culture

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:24.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in defining what I thought
hospitality was.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:29.049 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Culture has a very big effect on us.

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:30.426 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In our culture

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:32.636 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
young ones are not trusted very much.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are not given responsibility.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen the effect of the culture

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside the congregation,
especially when the question

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving younger ones
more privileges of service,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or assignments, came up.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it was discussed among the elders,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would not really be considered.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the desire would be
for him to wait a little bit longer

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—mature a little more
and gain more life experience.

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also thought the same way.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look back now,
I realize that it really wasn’t right

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah’s thinking isn’t like that.

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I attended
the special convention in Ukraine,

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my view of what hospitality was
changed completely.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get off the plane;
all the brothers are there;

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see the love.

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re overwhelmed by just the quantity
of brothers that are there

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—their smiles, their expressions.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:31.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the days went on,

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was clear
that they were just looking

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what we needed.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was more than, you know,
just giving us some food

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spending some time with us.

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were so many
other things that they did

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that covered every one
of our needs

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was not sure that their own needs
were being covered at times.

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew they just wanted

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be there, and they’d figure out
the rest when they got there.

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really impressed me and my wife.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do remember one night
getting back to the hotel,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a moment

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:12.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to just really think
about what we’d seen that day

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to ask ourselves
if we’d ever gone to the same extent.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where I’m from,

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we tend to stick
with what we’re very comfortable with.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I really
had unknowingly been putting limits

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on hospitality
because of what I was comfortable with

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—because of the culture where I grew up—

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas the experience in Ukraine
helped me to see

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can break
that barrier down so much faster.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could definitely feel that this was
what Jehovah’s view of hospitality was.

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was about looking
for what others need and filling those needs.

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:54.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, my thinking changed

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I realized Jehovah’s way of thinking.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization
and what I watched in them

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped my view to change.

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could actually see what a young brother
or a young elder could do.

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, we used to focus on experience.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would too.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now Jehovah’s viewpoint
is more important than just experience.

00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:24.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t only focus on experience

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also on spiritual qualities.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize that.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after we experienced

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the special convention in Ukraine
and returned home,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we decided that we needed to consider
this more as a Family Worship project.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized we did have to make
some adjustments.

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:45.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized we did want to do more.

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had to set specific goals

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to strip away

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our previous definition of hospitality

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and start extending it
beyond what we were comfortable with.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes work

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:04.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continually break free from the limits

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we might set for ourselves.

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:10.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was something that we realized

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we needed to make some changes
if we were going to maintain

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s view of hospitality moving forward.

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:21.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the influence
of the culture doesn’t go away overnight.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still need to work hard on it.

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still have to change

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because traces of the culture
can still be left over.

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I realized
we definitely need to get rid of it.

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:38.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m really pleased
to serve with those young brothers,

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to talk with them,

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see their potential
as Jehovah sees it.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:49.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also see
that Jehovah is very pleased too.

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:52.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is overjoyed.

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:56.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s proud to see
what those young brothers do.

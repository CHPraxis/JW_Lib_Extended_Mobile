00:00:06 On September 18, 2020,
00:00:08 Medicane Ianos,
00:00:10 a rare Mediterranean cyclone, struck Greece
00:00:13 and flooded a Roma settlement in Mavrika,
00:00:16 just outside the city of Karditsa.
00:00:21 Local authorities worked alongside emergency services to evacuate
00:00:25 over 1,000 Roma who lived there.
00:00:27 But a family of seven
00:00:29 who are studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:31 were left behind.
00:00:35 It was raining hard,
00:00:36 and the floodwaters were rising quickly.
00:00:39 I took my wife by the hand
00:00:40 and carried my child on my back.
00:00:43 With great difficulty, we managed to make it to a neighboring house.
00:00:47 We were unable to contact the authorities.
00:00:50 We were terrified and had no option but to stay there.
00:00:53 We didn’t know what to do.
00:00:56 We were so scared and worried.
00:00:58 We had never experienced
00:01:00 anything like this before.
00:01:01 The floodwaters had risen a lot,
00:01:04 and we stood waiting for hours.
00:01:07 I asked my father to pray for us.
00:01:09 He did many times.
00:01:13 There were lots of people in the house, both young and old.
00:01:17 They were afraid, and they were crying.
00:01:25 Video messages from the family started to come through, asking for help.
00:01:30 We could see their fear.
00:01:32 We wanted to help them,
00:01:34 but there was no way for us to go there because access was impossible.
00:01:39 All we could do was pray to Jehovah for them
00:01:42 and send messages of encouragement.
00:01:45 We were very distressed.
00:01:47 Children were crying.
00:01:49 I prayed to Jehovah, begging him for peace of mind.
00:01:53 I threw all of my burdens and anxiety of my heart on Jehovah.
00:01:57 Soon, I felt calm and had no anxiety.
00:02:02 I felt his spirit giving me strength during the hours that followed until dawn.
00:02:23 The situation was very difficult.
00:02:25 They had suffered a lot,
00:02:27 and their clothes were dirty.
00:02:29 There was no way
00:02:30 that I could leave them there.
00:02:34 We were given a house to stay in.
00:02:37 We were able to calm down and sleep.
00:02:40 The brothers gave us food.
00:02:42 I thanked Jehovah for teaching us and taking care of us.
00:02:47 He is our Savior.
00:02:51 When I attended the first meeting after the flood, I felt calm again.
00:02:56 I tried to keep my routine as normal:
00:02:59 study, meetings, preparing comments.
00:03:04 I felt joy and contentment.
00:03:07 My legal documents, such as my ID, were saved from the flood.
00:03:11 Our neighbors were not prepared.
00:03:14 But we, thanks to Jehovah’s direction,
00:03:17 had packed emergency bags.
00:03:20 About a week later, we were able to return to Mavrika.
00:03:23 The houses were in terrible condition, full of mud.
00:03:29 The Disaster Relief Committee helped us immediately.
00:03:32 Brothers from 300 kilometers (190 mi) away sent emergency supplies.
00:03:38 The brotherhood showed us love in practice.
00:03:41 They worked hard and helped us because they love us.
00:03:45 I was deeply touched and found myself in awe.
00:03:48 We are united.
00:03:50 All of this brought glory and praise to Jehovah.
00:03:55 When we went there to help, the Roma neighbors were very surprised.
00:03:59 They asked if we could help them too.
00:04:02 We replied that we have to help our family first, our brothers.
00:04:06 They were very puzzled that we called our Roma brothers family
00:04:10 since we were not from their tribe.
00:04:14 Ephesians 4:16 finds a good application in this story.
00:04:19 Just as every joint in the body offers help,
00:04:23 so did the brothers.
00:04:26 We all worked together
00:04:28 to provide help to our brothers in need.
00:04:33 Jehovah is teaching me and helping me.
00:04:36 I really trust in him.
00:04:38 He has blessed me personally.
00:04:41 I have seen how good he is to me.
00:04:44 In a miserable world, Jehovah brings me joy.
00:04:48 I know that he chooses according to a person’s heart.
00:04:51 All glory belongs to Jehovah!

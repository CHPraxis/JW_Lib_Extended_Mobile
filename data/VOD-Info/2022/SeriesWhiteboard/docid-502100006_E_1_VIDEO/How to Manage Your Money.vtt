Hey there!

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:09.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You both landed jobs, eh?

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Dad will be proud!

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First payday?

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you going to do with all that money?

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:19.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody needs it.

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, every job has its difficulties

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inconveniences.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our hard-earned money can give us
the power to buy and do lots of things.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can help us meet our physical needs

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.475 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and can buy other things that we might want.

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a few things you’ll want
to keep in mind about money.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep money in its place.

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:49.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we’re not talking
about a physical place like a bank.

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your priorities straight.

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be ‘rich with God,’ the Bible says.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Take time to get to know him,

00:00:57.453 --> 00:00:59.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be his friend.

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:01.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help you be content with what you have.

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be happier—whether you have a lot

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:06.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a little—

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll make him happy too.

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 23:5, the Bible says
that money can “sprout wings like an eagle

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fly off into the sky!”

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s important to learn now
how to take care of your money

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when you need it

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s there to take care of you!

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, make a plan for your money,

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:28.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
otherwise called a budget.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a list of the things you need

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much each costs.

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:33.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, add a few things you want

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much each costs.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add it all up.

00:01:41.914 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, compare that with how much money
you’ll earn each week.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are these things so important
that you need to spend

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most, or all, of your money on them?

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might need to put off some of those wants

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s also good to save some money.

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, put money away
for a time when you’ll need it.

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ecclesiastes 9:11,

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says “time and unexpected events”
can overtake any of us.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s smart to have something set aside
for yourself just in case you need it

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to help someone else.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may need something
that costs more than you can earn

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:20.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a week

00:02:20.035 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a month

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even a year.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:26.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each week, save some money so that

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—wait.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t want to wait?

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, credit.

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you could do that.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But credit carries a cost called interest,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can really add up.

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:43.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you lose track of the things
you buy on credit,

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can easily end up paying much more
for everything you buy.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it can take years

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and years

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and years to pay off credit-card debt.

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So have a plan for your money,

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay within your budget,

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
save for the unexpected,

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid unnecessary debt

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can spend more time
getting to know God.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that’s how to manage your money!

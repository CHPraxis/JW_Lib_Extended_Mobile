00:00:01 There is no doubt that we’re living
00:00:03 in “critical times hard to deal with,”
00:00:06 just as the apostle Paul prophesied
00:00:09 under inspiration in 2 Timothy chapter 3.
00:00:14 Many times, we’ve read Matthew chapter 24,
00:00:18 Mark chapter 13, Luke chapter 21,
00:00:21 and Revelation chapter 6.
00:00:24 But who would ever have known
00:00:27 how deeply a pandemic,
00:00:30 so-called natural disasters, violence, and unrest
00:00:35 would affect us economically,
00:00:37 physically, and even emotionally?
00:00:42 Some of you dear friends face unimaginable hardships.
00:00:47 Many have experienced loss of loved ones,
00:00:51 imprisonment, physical abuse,
00:00:54 sickness, financial problems,
00:00:56 and sometimes a number of these
00:00:59 or other circumstances all at the same time.
00:01:04 You dear brothers and sisters are in our prayers.
00:01:09 With this in mind, the theme for our program
00:01:11 is “In Difficult Times,
00:01:15 Jehovah Always Comforts.”
00:01:19 A scripture that’s become familiar to Jehovah’s people
00:01:22 is 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:
00:01:28 “Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
00:01:33 “the Father of tender mercies
00:01:36 “and the God of all comfort,
00:01:38 “who comforts us in all our trials
00:01:41 “so that we may be able to comfort others
00:01:44 “in any sort of trial with the comfort
00:01:47 that we receive from God.”
00:01:50 The Study Bible  says this
00:01:53 regarding the expression “the Father of tender mercies”:
00:01:58 “The Greek noun rendered ‘tender mercies’ . . .
00:02:01 “is here used to describe a feeling of compassion,
00:02:05 “or pity, for others.
00:02:07 “God is called the Father, or the Source, of tender mercies
00:02:12 “because compassion emanates from him and is part of his nature.
00:02:18 “Such tender feelings move him
00:02:20 “to act mercifully in behalf of his faithful servants
00:02:24 who are suffering tribulation.”
00:02:28 Regarding the phrase, “the God of all comfort,”
00:02:31 it continues: “The Greek noun . . . here rendered ‘comfort,’
00:02:36 “literally means ‘a calling to one’s side.’
00:02:39 “It conveys the idea of standing next to a person,
00:02:43 “helping or encouraging him
00:02:45 “when he is undergoing trials or feeling sad. . . .
00:02:48 “God uses his powerful active force
00:02:51 “to give comfort and help in situations
00:02:55 that from a human viewpoint seem hopeless.”
00:03:00 Think about what that means.
00:03:02 Jehovah wants us to know that whatever we face,
00:03:07 he is by our side, helping us
00:03:10 when we’re undergoing any sort of trial.
00:03:12 No, he did not promise that he’d remove our trials.
00:03:16 Rather, he eases our misery, or grief,
00:03:20 whenever we undergo difficulties.
00:03:24 What a beautiful word picture of God standing next to us,
00:03:28 especially when things seem hopeless!
00:03:32 We invite you to do a personal study project.
00:03:36 Using the publication Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:03:40 or the Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™,
00:03:43 do a word search on “comfort.”
00:03:46 You will be drawn even closer to Jehovah
00:03:50 and appreciate his unmatched desire
00:03:53 and ability to comfort.
00:03:58 Jehovah also inspired Paul to show
00:04:01 how he would stand by us to comfort us.
00:04:06 Notice Romans 15:4:
00:04:11 “For all the things that were written beforehand
00:04:15 “were written for our instruction,
00:04:18 “so that through our endurance
00:04:20 “and through the comfort from the Scriptures
00:04:24 we might have hope.”
00:04:26 “Comfort from the Scriptures”
00:04:30 —time limits us from going into all of the ways
00:04:33 that the Bible does this.
00:04:35 But let’s take some examples.
00:04:38 A scripture that Jehovah’s people have often meditated on in recent times
00:04:43 is found in Jeremiah chapter 29.
00:04:49 When Jehovah inspired Jeremiah to convey his message to the Jews,
00:04:54 they had been taken from Jerusalem
00:04:56 and were captives in Babylon.
00:04:59 They were downhearted.
00:05:01 But even while in captivity,
00:05:04 Jehovah provided a comforting message.
00:05:07 Notice his words
00:05:09 at Jeremiah 29:10:
00:05:12 “When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,
00:05:16 I will turn my attention to you.”
00:05:20 God told these Jewish exiles
00:05:23 that they would remain in captivity for a long time.
00:05:27 Then he made it clear to them that he had a peaceful future in mind.
00:05:32 The latter part of that verse says:
00:05:35 “And I will make good my promise
00:05:38 by bringing you back to this place.”
00:05:40 In verse 11, he says:
00:05:42 “‘I well know the thoughts
00:05:44 “that I am thinking toward you,’
00:05:46 “declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace,
00:05:49 “‘and not of calamity,
00:05:51 to give you a future and a hope.’”
00:05:55 God did make good on his promise to those Israelites.
00:05:59 He let them know that their future was to be a bright one.
00:06:03 Regarding Jeremiah 29:11,
00:06:08 one commentary states:
00:06:11 “It is difficult to find a more wonderful promise
00:06:16 “anywhere in Scripture that expresses the tender compassion
00:06:20 “of Yahweh [Jehovah]
00:06:23 “toward these exiles and setting before them, at last,
00:06:26 a real reason for optimism and expectation.”
00:06:31 Jehovah’s promise strengthened men
00:06:34 such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.
00:06:39 Jehovah reassured the Jews by repeating his promise
00:06:43 at Jeremiah 31:17:
00:06:47 “And there is a hope for your future . . .
00:06:50 Your sons will return to their own territory.”
00:06:55 Sure enough, just as Jehovah foretold,
00:07:00 Babylon was conquered by the Persian King Cyrus,
00:07:03 who allowed the exiled Jews to return to their homeland.
00:07:07 After 70 years of captivity,
00:07:10 they were back in Jerusalem.
00:07:13 Jehovah ‘made good on his promise.’
00:07:18 What does that have to do with us today?
00:07:22 The fulfilled promises of Jehovah assure us
00:07:26 that his promises to us will come true
00:07:30 in spite of surrounding circumstances.
00:07:33 As he said: “I will make good my promise.”
00:07:37 How comforting to know that!
00:07:39 But we know that the greatest expression of Jehovah’s comfort
00:07:44 is his only-begotten Son, Jesus.
00:07:49 During his time on earth, he gave people hope.
00:07:52 Jesus engaged in a marvelous ministry
00:07:56 —healing the sick, performing powerful works
00:07:59 and, most important, teaching people about God’s Kingdom.
00:08:05 However, the greatest expression of hope to us humans
00:08:10 is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.
00:08:14 Through his inspired Word,
00:08:17 we can see that Jehovah assures us
00:08:20 that he not only understands what we face
00:08:24 but also desires to console and strengthen us.
00:08:29 Our loving heavenly Father
00:08:31 especially watches over all who endeavor to do his will.
00:08:35 But in all of his mercy,
00:08:38 he also draws humble people who may not yet know him.
00:08:43 How many of us were in dire straits
00:08:46 only to be introduced to the truth
00:08:49 and to get to know Jehovah at the right time?
00:08:53 That was no coincidence.
00:08:55 That’s a consequence of Jehovah’s love
00:08:58 and his desire to give people comfort through the hope he provides.
00:09:05 Dear brothers and sisters,
00:09:07 as we get closer to the great tribulation,
00:09:12 we will face more distressing circumstances.
00:09:15 And during the great tribulation,
00:09:17 our trust in Jehovah must be solid.
00:09:21 We need to be sensitive and receptive to the ways
00:09:24 in which he consoles and strengthens us.
00:09:27 We need to keep in mind what Paul says
00:09:30 at 2 Corinthians 1:4,
00:09:33 perhaps even memorizing it.
00:09:35 Jehovah is a God
00:09:38 “who comforts us in all our trials.”
00:09:45 Some time ago, we interviewed two longtime members
00:09:48 of the United States Bethel family:
00:09:51 Brother Gerald Grizzle,
00:09:53 a helper to the Personnel Committee,
00:09:55 and Brother Sam Roberson.
00:09:58 These two brothers served as traveling overseers
00:10:00 for many years prior to coming to Bethel.
00:10:03 Brother Grizzle has served at Bethel since 1978,
00:10:07 and Brother Roberson has served here for nearly 20 years.
00:10:12 They’ve been assigned by the Governing Body
00:10:15 to assist them in shepherding the United States Bethel family.
00:10:19 ‘Shepherding the Bethel family?’ you may ask.
00:10:22 ‘After all, Bethelites don’t have any distressing trials!’
00:10:26 Listen to what our dear brothers have to say.
00:10:29 Brother Grizzle, what are some of the challenges
00:10:33 that members of the Bethel family face?
00:10:36 The worldwide Bethel family
00:10:38 is a representation of the brotherhood.
00:10:43 By that I mean that
00:10:45 just as 1 Peter 5:9 says,
00:10:49 they face ‘the same kind of sufferings
00:10:52 ‘being experienced by the entire association
00:10:56 of our brothers in the world.’
00:10:58 Some deal with serious health problems,
00:11:02 but they continue to serve.
00:11:05 Others
00:11:07 have concerns over aging parents,
00:11:11 and some have to give up their beloved Bethel service.
00:11:16 Still others contend with bouts of depression.
00:11:21 But the spirit of these dear brothers and sisters
00:11:25 impels them to have the determination
00:11:30 not to allow these challenges to dominate them.
00:11:34 Rather, their faith in Jehovah
00:11:36 strengthens their resolve
00:11:39 to focus on their assignments.
00:11:42 Thank you for that insight,
00:11:43 Brother Grizzle.
00:11:45 Brother Roberson, how have you been able to comfort such ones?
00:11:50 When we find out a Bethelite
00:11:52 is going through a tragedy,
00:11:54 there are four things that we do.
00:11:57 Number one, we pray for them
00:12:00 and develop specific spiritual points
00:12:03 according to their needs.
00:12:06 And that’s before we make the call.
00:12:09 Number two, when we actually make the call,
00:12:12 we really listen.
00:12:13 And I don’t mean we just listen with our ears.
00:12:17 We try to listen with our hearts.
00:12:19 We try to feel what they feel.
00:12:22 We try to have compassion.
00:12:25 Number three, when we use God’s Word
00:12:29 to remind them they’re not facing their crisis alone,
00:12:33 this is very effective.
00:12:35 As an example, we called on a brother recently
00:12:38 who was going through a great trial,
00:12:41 and we shared, among other things,
00:12:43 Exodus 3:7, 12.
00:12:47 Let’s take a look at that:
00:12:49 “I have certainly seen the affliction
00:12:52 “of my people who are in Egypt,
00:12:54 “and I have heard their outcry
00:12:56 because of those who force them to work.”
00:12:59 And note the ending point here —it’s very beautiful.
00:13:04 Jehovah doesn’t say, ‘I know how my people feel’;
00:13:09 he says: “I well  know
00:13:11 the pains [of my people].”
00:13:14 And then in giving assurance
00:13:17 dealing with Moses fearing to go before Pharaoh,
00:13:20 in verse 12, just the A  part:
00:13:24 “To this he said: ‘I will prove to be with you.’”
00:13:30 It’s just a few words but so powerful,
00:13:33 where Jehovah is guaranteeing
00:13:36 that he’s going to give them undeniable proof
00:13:41 that he’s backing them up and never moving away from them one inch.
00:13:46 And this gives us comfort.
00:13:48 Now, number four,
00:13:50 before we conclude the call,
00:13:53 we have an ending prayer with them.
00:13:56 And we use their names,
00:13:58 and this is very comforting since we’re calling on Jehovah,
00:14:01 the Great Shepherd.
00:14:03 At 1 Thessalonians 5:14,
00:14:06 Paul says: “We urge you, brothers, to . . .
00:14:09 “speak consolingly to those who are depressed,
00:14:12 [to] support the weak, be patient toward all.”
00:14:16 And this is exactly what we’re trying to do.
00:14:19 Thanks for sharing those thoughts —very interesting.
00:14:23 Brothers Grizzle and Roberson:
00:14:26 How has comforting others affected you?
00:14:29 Brother Grizzle first, please.
00:14:31 During these challenging times,
00:14:34 I sense Jehovah’s love for his people.
00:14:38 Over the years,
00:14:40 I have seen and experienced his care
00:14:45 when facing difficult times.
00:14:48 Some years ago,
00:14:50 I lost my mother, my brother,
00:14:54 and my father in death all within a year.
00:14:59 And in 2017,
00:15:02 I lost my dear wife, Bonnie,
00:15:06 after we had served Jehovah together
00:15:08 for nearly 65 years.
00:15:12 But with much prayer,
00:15:14 research, and love of the friends,
00:15:18 Jehovah has comforted me.
00:15:20 And now, thankfully,
00:15:23 I have been able to offer encouragement to others.
00:15:26 Very touching, Brother Grizzle,
00:15:27 thank you.
00:15:29 Brother Roberson, how has comforting others
00:15:32 affected you?
00:15:34 One of the most memorable challenges
00:15:37 was while my wife, Linda, and I were in the circuit work
00:15:39 several years ago.
00:15:41 I lost my voice.
00:15:44 I had to have surgery on my vocal cords,
00:15:47 and for six weeks, I could not talk.
00:15:50 For a circuit overseer, that’s like being a bird without its wings.
00:15:55 I wrote more notes in that six weeks
00:15:58 than I had written in my whole life!
00:16:01 But in spite of that and along with other situations and tragedies
00:16:06 that we faced similar to Gerald’s,
00:16:09 Jehovah has seen us through them all.
00:16:12 And let me say, it’s been a real pleasure
00:16:14 to share Jehovah’s comfort with so many.
00:16:18 And as we do, we see the Governing Body’s interest
00:16:21 in all of Jehovah’s people,
00:16:23 including those with added responsibility.
00:16:26 They truly reflect Jehovah’s feelings
00:16:29 as “the God of all comfort.”
00:16:32 Well, thank you, brothers.
00:16:34 We really appreciate your comments.
00:16:37 And more than the shepherding that you do
00:16:41 is the example that you have set
00:16:44 in enduring trials,
00:16:46 in experiencing Jehovah’s comfort,
00:16:48 and in comforting others.
00:16:50 Thank you so much.
00:16:53 The Governing Body has instituted similar shepherding arrangements
00:16:57 in branch offices around the world.
00:17:02 Now we want to talk to some of you in our audience.
00:17:07 Because of stresses, disappointments,
00:17:11 and hurt feelings caused by fellow believers,
00:17:14 some have strayed from Jehovah’s organization.
00:17:18 Others may have been removed from the congregation
00:17:22 but now would like to return.
00:17:25 To you we say:
00:17:27 “Allow Jehovah to comfort and strengthen you.
00:17:31 He wants you to draw close to him, and he will help you.”
00:17:37 James 4:8 says:
00:17:40 “Draw close to God,
00:17:43 and he will draw close to you.”
00:17:47 Jehovah has great care for such ones.
00:17:51 Let’s read what he says
00:17:53 at Ezekiel 34:16:
00:17:57 “The stray I will bring back,
00:18:02 “the injured I will bandage,
00:18:05 and the weak I will strengthen.”
00:18:08 Some who have recovered have said
00:18:10 that one of the most difficult things for them to do
00:18:13 was to cross the threshold of the Kingdom Hall.
00:18:16 But remember, it’s Jehovah who bandages you,
00:18:21 his sheep, helping you to heal.
00:18:25 In the same chapter, in verse 12, he says:
00:18:29 “I will care for my sheep . . .
00:18:33 “I will rescue them from all the places
00:18:37 where they were scattered.”
00:18:40 In imitation of that love, the faithful slave says,
00:18:45 “We view you as lost sheep,
00:18:49 not a lost cause.”
00:18:52 To all we say,
00:18:54 “No matter what you face, remember:
00:18:57 “In difficult times,
00:18:59 Jehovah always comforts.”

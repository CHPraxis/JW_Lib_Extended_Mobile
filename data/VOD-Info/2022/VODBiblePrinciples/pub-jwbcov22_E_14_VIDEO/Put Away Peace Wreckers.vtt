“Put away from yourselves every kind

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:09.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath,

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:12.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“screaming, and abusive speech,

00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:15.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as everything injurious.”

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:18.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did anyone start the day thinking,

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:23.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I believe I’ll show malicious bitterness
to my brother today’?

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:25.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not! 

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet the potential is there, isn’t it?

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:32.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
But genuine affection fights peace wreckers.

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:37.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
And affection grows when we really know
our brothers and sisters well.

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember their joys

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:44.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pains,

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
their selfless zeal,

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:51.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they came to love Jehovah,

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:55.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they endure.

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:01.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll get back as soon as I can.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love you. Bye.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, love?

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:10.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
So sorry, I’ve got to run.

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:12.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. I’ll ring you about this week.

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:13.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks. Love you both.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you!

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
The afternoon would look better.

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:19.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nana!

00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:21.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, Haley, darling.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so, so sorry.

00:01:24.068 --> 00:01:26.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it’s not too bad.

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:29.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got this.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:30.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:31.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are you though?

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you. I’m so sorry.

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:34.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, poor thing.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:35.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me clear this up.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:46.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, Nana, it’s Sunday today, isn’t it?

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one.

00:01:52.097 --> 00:01:53.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s felt like such a long day, hasn’t it?

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:54.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has felt like a long day.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sleep well.

00:02:41.608 --> 00:02:42.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.407 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:51.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to welcome my new followers

for subscribing to this channel.

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:57.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first up, I’ve got
this gorgeous earring and necklace set.

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:02.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you can see, the first disc I’ve done
is in this warm nude tone,

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:03.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s great because it goes . . .

00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:05.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe her?

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:08.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley’s business feed?

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what makes this set is really special.

00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s giving you
that understated elegant look.

when you look this good, you feel great.

00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:50.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?

00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:52.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad news?

00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:57.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a sweetie.

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds me that I want to speak to her
about a necklace.

00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:00.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too?

00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:02.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:04.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:04.112 --> 00:04:07.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone thinks she’s “Miss Wonderful”;

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:09.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’s starting to agree.

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:13.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:17.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems it’s all about Haley.

00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:22.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your tea is getting cold.

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re changing the subject.

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:28.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:31.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’ve brought this up before.

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:34.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:39.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re friends; you pioneer together.

00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:41.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, and that’s why I’m concerned.

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:45.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concern is good,

00:04:45.948 --> 00:04:48.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:51.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:05:02.924 --> 00:05:04.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
You pioneer together.

00:05:04.092 --> 00:05:07.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, and that’s why I’m concerned.

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:09.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concern is good,

00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:10.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:14.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:18.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought you would understand.

00:05:20.484 --> 00:05:22.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I understand your feelings.

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:24.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not about Haley?

00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:28.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t seen all her posts.

00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:30.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing immoral, is there?

00:05:31.413 --> 00:05:32.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:05:33.915 --> 00:05:35.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good. That’s not like her.

00:05:36.877 --> 00:05:39.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:42.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a case of her being more careful
how she comes across,

00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:44.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s another matter.

00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:46.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you talk to her?

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily, you are a beautiful, spiritual sister.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
for years,

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:12.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a bad habit
of comparing myself to others.

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
My own insecurity hurt me

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my closest friends.

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you don’t think
I should’ve spoken to Celia?

00:06:34.396 --> 00:06:37.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I’m glad you asked Celia about it

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone you trust.

00:06:41.028 --> 00:06:42.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she say?

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:44.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she definitely understands how I feel.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And about Haley’s posts?

00:06:52.165 --> 00:06:55.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she hasn’t seen
everything she has out there.

00:06:56.044 --> 00:06:57.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:06:58.963 --> 00:07:02.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did say that Haley

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs to be more careful

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
how she comes across.

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:12.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she suggest?

00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:16.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I should tell her
that she needs to stop,

00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:19.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m too worked up.

00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:23.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look,

00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:29.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Celia agrees
that Haley is doing something she shouldn’t,

00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:34.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should talk to her.

00:07:38.213 --> 00:07:40.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll find the right time.

00:07:48.766 --> 00:07:51.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for understanding.

00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:53.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m hungry.

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:54.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you say the prayer?

00:07:54.773 --> 00:07:56.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:58.193 --> 00:08:00.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, we’d like to praise you

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your generosity and kindness . . .

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:13.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially as a pioneer,

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of example is she setting?

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has Emily stopped following her?

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:20.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not yet, but she probably will.

00:08:20.341 --> 00:08:22.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alistair, what do you think?

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
About what?

00:08:24.012 --> 00:08:27.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley’s posts on QuicPost.

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a problem?

00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:31.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily has told me

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re all just, “Look at me

00:08:33.772 --> 00:08:37.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my clothes, my hair, my makeup.”

00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even Celia agrees with her.

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:45.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s very easy to take things
out of context on social media.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that I’ve done that and realized later

00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:54.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was wrong.

00:08:54.544 --> 00:08:56.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s a good point.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen, I don’t want to pull you away,

00:09:01.218 --> 00:09:04.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if you have a minute, would you mind
giving me a hand with these boxes?

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:05.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:09:15.316 --> 00:09:16.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help.

00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:18.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
No problem.

00:09:18.486 --> 00:09:23.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake, back in the hall,
I know you were just expressing concern,

00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here’s something to consider.

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:29.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
This principle is one of my favorites.

00:09:29.831 --> 00:09:32.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Proverbs

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:35.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:09:37.756 --> 00:09:41.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The first to state his case seems right,

00:09:41.177 --> 00:09:44.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the other party comes
and cross-examines him.”

00:09:49.185 --> 00:09:50.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not sure I understand.

00:09:52.022 --> 00:09:54.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just means that sometimes

00:09:54.816 --> 00:09:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
we only hear one side of a story.

00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:01.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
And until we personally hear both,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s best not to draw any conclusions.

00:10:04.868 --> 00:10:09.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even then, if it’s something negative,

00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:11.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t want to spread it

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:14.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
any more than we’d want something spread
about ourselves.

00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:20.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I hadn’t considered that.

00:10:20.427 --> 00:10:21.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:25.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to apologize to Harry and Marie

00:10:28.143 --> 00:10:31.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have Emily talk directly to Haley.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Nana?

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:49.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t forget eggs, dear.

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:51.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, I didn’t forget.

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:52.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you sure, love?

00:10:52.127 --> 00:10:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I won’t forget. OK.

00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:53.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:54.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Love you.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:06.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:11:10.146 --> 00:11:12.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, finally, I’ve caught you.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have a minute?

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:15.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Emily.

00:11:15.235 --> 00:11:15.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we talk later?

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:18.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really struggling this morning.

00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:22.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, it’s just that you’ve been so busy,
and I’ve been waiting for the right moment;

00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:25.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d really just like to address it.

00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:28.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. What’s up?

00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:32.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just that I’ve noticed
your posts lately on QuicPost.

00:11:33.504 --> 00:11:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about them?

00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:39.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do you really think they’re something
that a pioneer should be posting?

00:11:39.677 --> 00:11:42.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
What? What are you talking about?

00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:45.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think you’re bragging.

00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:47.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people? What people?

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:49.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a business account.
I’ve got to show off my products.

00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:50.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know. I get that.

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:51.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just—
I don’t know.

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could feel like you’re drawing
a little too much attention to yourself.

00:11:54.318 --> 00:11:57.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would think like that? You?

00:11:57.029 --> 00:11:59.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not just me; Celia felt the same.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
You spoke to Celia about this?

00:12:03.452 --> 00:12:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to upset you.

00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:06.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake said that I needed to take . . .

00:12:06.163 --> 00:12:09.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake! So everyone thinks
my posts are inappropriate?

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone, Haley.

00:12:11.628 --> 00:12:14.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:12:14.172 --> 00:12:15.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:17.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! I can’t believe you.

00:12:17.676 --> 00:12:19.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who else have you spoken to?

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are just such a gossip!

00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not gossiping. I was trying to . . .

00:12:22.347 --> 00:12:23.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are!

00:12:23.223 --> 00:12:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just trying to help you,
if you would just listen to me.

00:12:26.477 --> 00:12:27.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so jealous!

00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:28.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d just listen to me.

00:12:28.228 --> 00:12:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, listen to this.

00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:34.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I expected more from you.

00:12:34.443 --> 00:12:36.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossiping about my posts!

00:12:40.116 --> 00:12:43.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:12:47.457 --> 00:12:48.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley,

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:54.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
wait, please!

Olivia!

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:23.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia!

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurry, you’re going to be late for school!

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:31.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:32.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, Mom. I’m going to preach.

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:33.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you.

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:34.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love you.

00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:36.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye, Mom. Love you.

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:38.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have a good day.

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:42.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, Mom.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:54.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would never; she’s an angel.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all a front.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:00:59.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, she totally just saw us.

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:02.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. I’m totally posting that.

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:04.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it.

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:05.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. It’s up.

00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:07.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone . . .

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:08.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you just get that?

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:09.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:10.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:10.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone . . .

00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the craziest.

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:01:15.477 --> 00:01:17.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:19.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:21.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:27.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:30.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all an act.

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:33.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, she saw us.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
She saw us.

00:01:34.873 --> 00:01:35.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t believe it.

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to comment?

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:38.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:41.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even think she likes guys.

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:43.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she’s into girls?

00:01:43.382 --> 00:01:44.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.
Yeah.

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:45.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Comments!

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:47.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody is getting it.

00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:49.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bet she’s still a virgin.

00:02:03.237 --> 00:02:04.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, can I see that?

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:06.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:09.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:11.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how are you going to do that?

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:15.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a very good question, actually.

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:15.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, God promises . . .

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no, not God, you!

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:18.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:21.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me? Well, I try to help others . . .

00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:23.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try?

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man, all you do
is stand next to your little cart

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:26.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the rest of us
stand up for your rights, bro.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:29.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m actually neutral when it . . .

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neutral?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ain’t no neutral.
You’re just a coward.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:53.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did it go?

00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:56.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a tough day at the cart, but I’m OK.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:10.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:12.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:14.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:03:14.897 --> 00:03:15.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:17.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia,

00:03:18.818 --> 00:03:20.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s wrong?

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:28.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:29.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:03:29.914 --> 00:03:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:36.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:38.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:40.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:42.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all an act.

00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:44.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:46.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, she saw us.

00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:52.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry that happened to you.

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:04.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:09.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reminds me of a situation Paul was in.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it was at Acts chapter 16

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 23:

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:29.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After they had inflicted many blows on them,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they threw them into prison

00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:39.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and ordered the jailer
to guard them securely.

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:44.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because he got such an order, he threw them

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:46.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into the inner prison

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and fastened their feet in the stocks.

00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But about the middle of the night,

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul and Silas were praying

00:04:55.798 --> 00:04:59.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and praising God with song,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prisoners were listening to them.”

00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:06.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think made them want to sing?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
They loved Jehovah.

00:05:11.732 --> 00:05:15.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when they focused on that,
how do you think they felt?

00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:21.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:26.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
they felt some peace.

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:27.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about we dig a little bit deeper?

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:32.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:05:32.337 --> 00:05:33.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:38.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to do?

00:05:38.302 --> 00:05:39.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man, all you do
is stand next to your little cart.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t do anything.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:05:41.806 --> 00:05:42.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just stand next to your little cart.

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:44.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ain’t no neutral.
Stand up for your rights.

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:45.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:46.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe,

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:48.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened today?

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just that I’ve been yelled at
in service before, but

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time I wanted to—I don’t know.

00:06:01.035 --> 00:06:04.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to go up to the girls
and smash their phones.

00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:07.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so glad that you didn’t.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:13.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel guilty

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was like—I was like so angry.

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep reading.

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:30.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had left off in verse 26.

00:06:34.947 --> 00:06:38.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Suddenly a great earthquake occurred,

00:06:38.993 --> 00:06:42.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the foundations of the jail
were shaken.

00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:45.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, all the doors
were instantly opened,

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:48.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and everyone’s bonds came loose.

00:06:48.503 --> 00:06:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the jailer woke up
and saw that the prison doors were open,

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:54.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he drew his sword

00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:56.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and was about to kill himself,

00:06:56.971 --> 00:06:59.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“assuming that the prisoners had escaped.

00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:02.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Paul called out with a loud voice:

00:07:02.977 --> 00:07:05.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here!’

00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:09.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he asked for lights and rushed in,

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and seized with trembling,

00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:15.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fell down before Paul and Silas.”

00:07:19.578 --> 00:07:21.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about what the jailer
had done to Paul.

00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:29.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have hated him for it.

00:07:29.672 --> 00:07:31.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he could have.

00:07:32.884 --> 00:07:37.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess he saw the jailer’s pain
instead of just his own.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, Paul loved his neighbor.

00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:47.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t hold back
from trying to save his life.

00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:00.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, man.

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:09.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, how do you have the nerve
to keep coming out here?

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:13.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, you were right

00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what you said.

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:19.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one should stand around
while other people suffer injustice.

00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:21.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do something.
Fight like we do.

00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:23.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my way of making a difference

00:08:23.898 --> 00:08:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the only way that I know
the world can really change.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, man, the Bible?

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:33.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I get what you’re thinking,
but let me show you just one scripture.

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:35.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, one scripture.

00:08:35.702 --> 00:08:37.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is a verse in the Bible
that convinced me

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:40.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how I can make a difference.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at Matthew 24:14.

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:45.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here it says:

00:08:45.588 --> 00:08:48.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom
will be preached

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:50.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all the inhabited earth

00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:53.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:55.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the end will come.”

00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:00.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:01.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:02.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:09:02.898 --> 00:09:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she ever?

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:04.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even think she likes guys.

00:09:05.818 --> 00:09:06.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she’s into girls?

00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bet she’s still a virgin.

00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:12.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia, what are you thinking?

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t—I don’t know how they could do that.

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:20.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even follow them.

00:09:21.543 --> 00:09:23.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this doesn’t stop,

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if I can . . .

00:09:30.845 --> 00:09:33.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re strong, OK.

00:09:33.097 --> 00:09:35.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just can’t let them get to you.

00:09:41.565 --> 00:09:43.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels out of your control, doesn’t it?

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:59.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, I think we need another Bible example.

00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:03.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when we studied
about the Shulammite girl?

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I remember.

00:10:10.346 --> 00:10:12.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who was pressuring her?

00:10:15.685 --> 00:10:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon.

00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:25.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she wasn’t interested in him,

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:29.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like I’m not interested
in that boy Jake, so . . .

00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:32.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it wasn’t just him;

00:10:32.745 --> 00:10:36.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were the daughters of Jerusalem
in Solomon’s court.

00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
They urged her to accept his attentions.

00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:47.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you remember what she said

00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:49.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Song of Solomon chapter 2?

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:54.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “I put you under oath,

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O daughters of Jerusalem,

00:10:56.604 --> 00:10:59.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the gazelles and the does of the field:

00:10:59.357 --> 00:11:03.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me

00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:05.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it feels inclined.”

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:10.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
So despite all of the pressure,
who was really in control?

00:11:13.164 --> 00:11:15.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was.

00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one was going to push her
into something that she didn’t want to do.

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:27.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
She even said: “I am a wall.”

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the same power.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you believe that,
it’ll change how you handle the pressure.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now give me a hug.

00:11:55.543 --> 00:11:58.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, update on yesterday’s topic.

00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:00.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess she still needs a man.

00:12:00.298 --> 00:12:01.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
She needs something.

00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:09.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just posted it. 
Go like my video.

00:12:10.684 --> 00:12:13.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
All they want is to see me give in.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, update on yesterday’s topic.
I guess she still needs . . .

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would I give them the satisfaction?

00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:25.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody can make me stumble.

00:12:33.876 --> 00:12:36.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a wall.”

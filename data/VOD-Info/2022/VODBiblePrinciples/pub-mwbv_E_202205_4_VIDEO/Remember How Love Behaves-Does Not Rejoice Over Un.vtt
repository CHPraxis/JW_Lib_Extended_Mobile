I’ve escaped from the camp of Israel.

Many have fallen and died.

Even Saul and his son Jonathan have died.

How do you know?

I stood above him and put him to death.

Teach all of our people this dirge

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Saul and Jonathan:

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:00.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul and Jonathan,

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beloved and cherished during their life.

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How the mighty have fallen

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:16.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the weapons of war have perished!”

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not once did David

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mention Saul’s hurtful acts.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To David, the assassination of Saul

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an unrighteous act,

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:32.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and David could never rejoice over that.

“I am no part of the world.”

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is the world a part of me?

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m pressured every day

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get involved in political issues
that affect me socially,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . environmentally,

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and economically.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
That pressure could rob me
of my peace of mind

00:00:57.578 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and influence how I think.

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could take sides in my heart,

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if I’m not aware of it.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know that Jehovah

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
will care for all of mankind’s concerns

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . by means of his Kingdom

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:51.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
ruled by his Son, Jesus Christ.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
I show my support for him
in my prayers,

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . in how I think and feel,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and by teaching others

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the Kingdom will do for mankind.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know there are millions

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
of brothers and sisters
all over the world

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . who loyally support
the “Prince of Peace”

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like me, because I

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I

00:02:33.298 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I am no part of the world.

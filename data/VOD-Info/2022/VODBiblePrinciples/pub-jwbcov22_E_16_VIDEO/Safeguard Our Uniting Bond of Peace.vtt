00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Japan,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
religious rituals are associated
with each stage of life

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with each season of the year.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.369 line:10% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.205 line:10% position:50% align:center
we want to keep the cleanliness and unity

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the congregation.

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard,
one of the most delicate areas

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the decision on whether to attend
a non-Witness funeral or not.

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first thing we must consider
regarding funerals is not to be involved

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
in religious rituals and acts of worship
that are condemned by the Bible.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.147 line:10% position:50% align:center
In harmony with the principle

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:46.442 line:10% position:50% align:center
at 2 Corinthians 6:14,

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:48.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
we need to keep completely separate

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.654 line:10% position:50% align:center
from pagan acts of worship.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, even if we don’t participate
in the worship of other religions,

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:01.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to consider if our decisions
could stumble someone in the congregation.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.170 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we consider the Bible principle

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Luke 17:2,

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:11.050 line:10% position:50% align:center
we do not want our decisions to hinder

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.427 line:10% position:50% align:center
the faith of someone in the congregation.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third point to think about
is our conscience.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to seriously think
about the Bible principle

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:29.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 6:5, where it says

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.738 line:10% position:50% align:center
that each must “carry his own load.”

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.658 line:10% position:50% align:center
This Bible principle

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
also applies when elders
want to support others.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, those in the congregation
can ask the elders for support

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
in issues related to funerals.

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in matters of conscience,

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders cannot force decisions on others.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it would be wrong
to make some kind of rule

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding attending non-Witness funerals.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.602 line:10% position:50% align:center
If each person can make

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
decisions based on Bible principles,

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:08.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can have a truly peaceful

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and free atmosphere

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
where each individual’s differing situation

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:14.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
is respected.

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:20.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
This would really contribute
to the unity of the congregation.

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all can maintain a clean conscience

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve happily before Jehovah.

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my culture,

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifically the Namibian Oshiwambo
culture,

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
like in many African cultures,

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:39.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many spiritistic customs
related to weddings

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are included in wedding celebrations.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, for Ben and I,

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.023 line:10% position:50% align:center
that was one of the main concerns.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.692 line:10% position:50% align:center
They don’t understand our worship of Jehovah,

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:54.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they don’t understand
that we apply Bible principles

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the traditions of men.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got engaged before the pandemic,

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
but obviously, now that our wedding
was to be over videoconferencing,

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
it meant that we didn’t have control
over many things.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to imagine situations

00:03:07.916 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could stumble our brothers or disrupt

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:11.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unity in the congregation.

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to, in advance,

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
think of Bible principles
that would apply in our case,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
but particularly what we also found helpful
was speaking to a mature elder.

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:28.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave us a principle at Proverbs 14:15.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told us to be very careful
when people say,

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will do this” or “I won’t do this”
at your wedding.

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:40.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, it was up to us to make sure
that the proceedings

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:42.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
or things that happen at our wedding

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be in order and in harmony
with Bible principles.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another principle that came to mind was

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Corinthians 10:23.

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:55.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, we knew
that we had the right to do many things,

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:57.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were also very conscious

00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:01.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how our brothers would view our wedding.

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want anybody to be at our wedding
and feel embarrassed

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even stumbled to be there.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now looking back at our wedding,

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
we look back with fond memories.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
So applying Bible principles
didn’t restrict our fun.

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, it contributed to the unity
among our brothers

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all of us
—those present, those who were invited—

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to enjoy the wedding.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not worried about thinking,
‘Oh, did that thing offend anybody?’

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:36.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re able to enjoy the day
without any bad memories.

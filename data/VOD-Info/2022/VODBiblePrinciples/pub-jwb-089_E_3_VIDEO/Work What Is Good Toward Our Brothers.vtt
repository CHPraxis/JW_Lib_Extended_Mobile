Everything I know
about Kingdom Hall maintenance,

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned from Brother Ho-jin Kang.

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged me when I needed a little push,

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught me the right way to do things,

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continued to teach me

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with kindness and love.

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he asked to borrow a ladder,

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was happy to lend him mine.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey,

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here are some things I need

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our lunch today with the Youngs.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:28.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mhm.

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the ladder for?

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, Ho-jin needs it.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:33.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ho-jin?

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s he doing?

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard something about a cane.

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:38.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ho-jin?

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A cane?

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way!

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s still as strong as an ox.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, but it seems like—

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ll see how he’s doing.

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget to stop at the store.

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ho-jin?

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A cane?

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way.

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m coming!

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here I come!

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:17.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, sorry.

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s OK.

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:19.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is everything OK?

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just can’t dash down the stairs.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was on my way to the store
and thought I’d drop off the ladder.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:29.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just leave it by the garage.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s almost time for lunch.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:35.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gutters can wait.

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:37.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve waited this long.

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Will do.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Drive safe!

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gutters?

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Honey.

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:25.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
But what about lunch?

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:27.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Youngs will be here in an hour.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I picked up the items you asked for,
but I can’t just leave.

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:35.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It got me thinking
about the neighborly Samaritan.

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:40.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When we see a need,

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:43.368 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we can’t be like the priest and Levite

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:45.412 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who just walked away.

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:54.505 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Samaritan cared enough to stop,

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.341 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
examine the need,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took the time to help the poor man

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:12.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a man he didn’t even know.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . a man he didn’t even know.
Of course!

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Work what is good toward all,

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but especially toward those
related to us in the faith.”

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you.

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:24.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have an idea.

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s not cancel with the Youngs.

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go back and pick up my ladder
and tell Ho-jin

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:34.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’ll come back Saturday afternoon
to help him clean out the gutters.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s such a blessing

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:48.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to care
for the needs of our brothers

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel their loving care for us.

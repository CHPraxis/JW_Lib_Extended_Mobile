00:00:03 My father always taught me that we needed God in our life
00:00:06 in order for there to be peace.
00:00:11 And he always wanted to know,
00:00:13 Can Christians go to war?
00:00:16 How is this consistent with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?
00:00:21 But the pastor could never give us an answer,
00:00:24 and so I thought I’d have to look to politics to find it.
00:00:28 A lot of peace movements were being formed at that time,
00:00:31 so I joined one of them.
00:00:35 We decided where the protest marches would be
00:00:38 and which pamphlets we would use.
00:00:44 But after the protests were over,
00:00:46 everyone was so excited
00:00:49 and they all started applauding
00:00:51 and cheering for the leaders.
00:00:53 I thought: ‘That’s not what I wanted.
00:00:57 ‘I don’t want to honor people.
00:00:59 ‘I want to have world peace.
00:01:02 And that still hasn’t happened yet.’
00:01:09 Then I started to feel very alone,
00:01:12 and it made me feel unsafe in this world.
00:01:15 With no peace in sight,
00:01:17 I thought, ‘What is the purpose of life?’
00:01:21 While visiting friends for coffee, I saw a man I’d never met before.
00:01:27 My friends told me he wanted to talk to us about the Bible.
00:01:33 So I asked him:
00:01:35 “Sir, what do you think?
00:01:37 Can Christians join the military?”
00:01:40 And the man said, “No, that’s not allowed
00:01:43 because the Bible says you should ‘love your [enemy].’”
00:01:49 It made me think about what my father always said
00:01:52 —that we need God to bring peace.
00:01:58 Then a really nice lady came to my door,
00:02:00 and she had an orange book in her hand.
00:02:03 And it said: True Peace and Security.
00:02:10 After reading it, I thought:
00:02:12 ‘This is it!
00:02:14 This is the organization that truly wants peace.’
00:02:20 So I went to those involved in the peace movement.
00:02:25 I told them that I believe that God will change this world
00:02:28 into a beautiful earth where there’ll be true peace.
00:02:33 They all looked at me like I had lost my mind.
00:02:37 I was so happy with my new life.
00:02:39 I felt like I was part of a family
00:02:41 who truly cared about one another
00:02:43 and really wanted peace with each other.
00:02:50 Isaiah 14:7 had a major impact on my life
00:02:54 because there God promises
00:02:56 a calm and peaceful world.

My father always taught me
that we needed God in our life

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for there to be peace.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.450 line:10% position:50% align:center
And he always wanted to know,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.494 line:10% position:50% align:center
Can Christians go to war?

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is this consistent
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the pastor could never give us an answer,

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so I thought I’d have to look
to politics to find it.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of peace movements
were being formed at that time,

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I joined one of them.

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided where
the protest marches would be

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and which pamphlets we would use.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the protests were over,

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone was so excited

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:51.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they all started applauding

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cheering for the leaders.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought:
‘That’s not what I wanted.

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t want to honor people.

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I want to have world peace.

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that still hasn’t happened yet.’

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I started to feel very alone,

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it made me feel unsafe in this world.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
With no peace in sight,

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘What is the purpose of life?’

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
While visiting friends for coffee,
I saw a man I’d never met before.

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
My friends told me he wanted
to talk to us about the Bible.

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I asked him:

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sir, what do you think?

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can Christians join the military?”

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the man said,
“No, that’s not allowed

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Bible says
you should ‘love your [enemy].’”

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me think
about what my father always said

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that we need God to bring peace.

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a really nice lady came to my door,

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she had an orange book in her hand.

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it said:
<i>True Peace and Security.</i>

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reading it, I thought:

00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This is it!

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the organization
that truly wants peace.’

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I went to those involved
in the peace movement.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told them that I believe
that God will change this world

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a beautiful earth
where there’ll be true peace.

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all looked at me
like I had lost my mind.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy with my new life.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like I was part of a family

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:43.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
who truly cared about one another

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really wanted peace with each other.

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:54.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 14:7 had a major impact on my life

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there God promises

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
a calm and peaceful world.

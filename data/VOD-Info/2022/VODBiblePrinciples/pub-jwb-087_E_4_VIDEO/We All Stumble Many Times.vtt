When I was growing up,
my parents always used to say:

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pray about your spiritual goals.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Work hard.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then let Jehovah do the rest.”

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what I did.

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wow, did Jehovah pour out the blessings!

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even got invited
to a branch construction project.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was pretty excited

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at first.

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get me wrong.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a privilege to be there,

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the work was harder
than I thought it would be.

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were a lot of new skills to learn.

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to admit,
I really wanted to impress my overseer.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I pushed hard,

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe a little too hard.

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see all that up there?

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That all needs to come down.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think you can wrap this up
before tomorrow?

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure thing. I’m on it.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can grab Jin and Young
to give you a hand with the lift.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jin’s a pro; he’ll help you out.

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The job didn’t look that hard.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, I mean, I had the training.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if I had waited for them,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no way
we were going to get this done today.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is, I had caused some real damage,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:35.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I made more work for everyone.

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ian, are you OK?

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’m fine.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a minute to talk in my office?

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:45.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:53.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like such a loser.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers talked to me,
and they were nice about it.

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:07.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was still left thinking:

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What am I doing here?

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I should just go home.’

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:14.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 3:2 says:

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:18.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For we all stumble many times.”

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the real question is,

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:24.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we stumble
—and it is going to happen—

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should we do then?

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jake.

00:03:31.648 --> 00:03:35.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when Dad was teaching me
to ride my bike,

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I fell a lot.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:38.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was hard.

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:41.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just kept getting up and trying again.

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I can ride pretty fast!

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you just have to get back up
when you fall.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that’s right!
That was a great comment.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, Jake, that’s it!

00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:00.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to swallow my pride
and just get back up.

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized I needed to be more focused

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:13.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the seriousness of my assignment
and not so focused on myself.

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of trying to do
everything myself,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I set more realistic expectations

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:25.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what I could do and what I couldn’t.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a lot to learn.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept working and learning.

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after a while,

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even got to help train
some of the new volunteers.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I was so thankful to Jehovah

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:51.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for helping me understand
that in the race for life,

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:55.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of us are going to cross the finish line
without stumbling.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The important thing
is to get back up and just keep going.

00:00:02 David was sick.
00:00:04 Absalom saw this
00:00:06 as an opportunity to seize power.
00:00:10 Like his father David,
00:00:12 he had many gifts.
00:00:14 He was born into a wealthy and powerful family.
00:00:20 He turned heads wherever he went,
00:00:23 and he relished the attention.
00:00:26 Men would come to the city gate
00:00:30 so that the king would hear their legal case.
00:00:39 If I were appointed judge in the land, every man
00:00:42 with a legal case or judgment could come to me
00:00:45 and I would see that he receives justice.
00:00:48 You are from the royal house, my lord.
00:00:52 My mother too has royal blood.
00:00:56 It seems that I was born to lead.
00:00:59 But God will do whatâ€™s best for his people.
00:01:07 Absalom seemed to be interested
00:01:09 in the people who came to David,
00:01:11 but he was only interested in himself.

Through Isaiah,

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:07.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised to feed his servants

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:16.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritually.

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:27.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah invites us to a banquet

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:31.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is spiritually nourishing.

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:38.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible-based videos and publications

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:45.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
draw us close to God

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satisfy our hunger for truth.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
abundant, healthy food will be more

00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:04.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
than a promise

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:10.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it will be a reality.

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:36.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:39.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.”

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you long for a home of your own?

00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised the returning exiles

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:57.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they would build
and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:10.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah likewise cares for us,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we lose our home

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we’re taken from it.

00:02:21.342 --> 00:02:23.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all,

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:26.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
true worship provides spiritual security

00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:29.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is found nowhere else.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual home we have now

00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:40.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us that Jehovah will give us

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:42.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
a physical place to call home

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new world.

00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:15.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses and live in them.”

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:22.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel during a long journey

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:27.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you might meet
wild animals and criminals along the road?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:33.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured the returning exiles
that they would return

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
in safety and dwell in peace.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who were once violent

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
have learned to be humble,

00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:54.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving, and peaceable.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:11.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the peace
that will reign in God’s new world,

00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:23.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we can wander this beautiful globe,

00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:31.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
explore every corner,

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:48.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and admire the handiwork of the true God

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:59.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no fear.

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:07.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:12.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all my holy mountain,’ says Jehovah.”

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:21.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clear instruction from Jehovah

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us close to him

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintains spiritual health.

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:36.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
While false teachings hold many

00:05:36.807 --> 00:05:38.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the grip of spiritual darkness,

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:43.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah offers true freedom.

00:06:01.418 --> 00:06:03.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us
that perfect physical and mental health

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:19.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
await us in Paradise.

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:30.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine waking every day

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
feeling clean,

00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:39.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
healthy,

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy,

00:06:45.174 --> 00:06:47.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full of the joy of life.

00:07:02.568 --> 00:07:04.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises:

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:09.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.

00:07:18.586 --> 00:07:22.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
He restored that ruined nation

00:07:22.716 --> 00:07:25.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if bringing it back to life.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1919,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:34.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did something similar.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:39.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
He released his modern-day people
from spiritual captivity

00:07:42.904 --> 00:07:46.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and energized them to preach.

00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:55.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Jehovah raised his people
from figurative death,

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:00.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
so will he reverse
the effects of literal death.

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:27.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Indeed, God “will swallow up death forever.”

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:36.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine living longer than any tree

00:08:56.277 --> 00:09:00.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
because “death will be no more.”

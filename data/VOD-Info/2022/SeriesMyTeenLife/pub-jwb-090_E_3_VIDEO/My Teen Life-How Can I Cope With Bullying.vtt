My experience with bullying

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:11.240 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
ultimately started

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in physical education

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when this kid who shared a locker
a few spaces away from me

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took that opportunity
and started to verbally attack me.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.086 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I first experienced bullying

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in elementary school,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was little stuff, nothing too big.

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In middle school is when
it was really, really something.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was upsetting that I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was being bullied; it made me feel

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like I was doing something wrong.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did I have to be the target?

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It got really personal.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would call me names.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would say that, you know,

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t good at anything, that no one
cared about me, that I was 

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dumb, that I was weak.

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially after he found out
that I was a Witness,

00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the texts just got even more intense.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one day specifically
that was really bad.

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It started in a classroom.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard one girl

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk to another girl about me,

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right in front of me, and these were lies.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to lunch, and I was cornered again.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is this how middle school is going to be?

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:20.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t have anybody to be with,

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hang out with during school,
because everybody doesn’t like me.’

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt no one liked me.

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the worst day ever.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:32.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I no longer felt
that I was valuable at that point.

00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was starting to feel more that I was

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this weak person, that I was

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
defenseless, that no one cared about me,

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was worthless to anybody.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So hearing that over and over
really took a toll 

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on my mental health and my emotional health.

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think at my lowest point,
after receiving so many

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these vicious attacks,
I started to have really,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really dark feelings.

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that I shouldn’t let this go
any further than it already had.

00:01:58.347 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment
when I knew I had to get help.

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told my parents about it, of course.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And especially on the worst day,
I told them everything.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents always brought up scriptures

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 27:12.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anytime I saw the bullies,

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would avoid them as much as possible.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another thing that I was always doing

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was praying constantly
—always praying—

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before school, during school, after school.

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times
that I would go into the library

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just read books, just stay to myself.

00:02:31.797 --> 00:02:33.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those times, I would also pray

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah, and he was a Friend to me.

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was Somebody that I could speak

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to on this matter.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did end up talking to my parents about it.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They let me get my side of the story out.

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were listening,
and they wanted to help out.

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they made me feel loved.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:53.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I definitely took this time
to reach out to the elders.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:58.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they really encouraged me and assured me

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was not only somewhere
where I was needed

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that I was also somewhere
where I was wanted.

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:03.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took some practical steps.

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I moved my locker;
I made sure not to retaliate.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Walking away is something very powerful.

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:14.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Retaliation is something that’s weak

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’re giving in to your emotions,
and you’re just lashing out.

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:20.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the bully got suspended,

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which gave me some peace.

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He ended up coming back after a week,

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he started up again with the attack.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed that he hadn’t changed at all,
but I had.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was much more confident.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that change, I began to fear him less.

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t scared of him.

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just saw him as this person
who wanted attention from me.

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the principles that you read

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about whether in “Young People Ask”
or scriptures that you pick out

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything really, really helps.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can either see the situation

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
die down or that it’s not that bad.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can deal with it, or it just stops.

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was so encouraging for me,
and it helped strengthen

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my faith in seeing how Jehovah
really is there to help.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:04.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t keep this to yourself.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t bottle it up,
because that’ll make things worse.

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a problem that won’t go away
because you ignore it.

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to talk to someone.

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to your parents, talk to your friend,

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:17.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk to Jehovah, talk to someone
in the congregation.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if you don’t know what to do,
they’ll help you find out

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what to do and they’ll give you guidance.

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:26.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll be so impressed
by how much Jehovah takes care of you,

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’ll show you that you are loved by him.

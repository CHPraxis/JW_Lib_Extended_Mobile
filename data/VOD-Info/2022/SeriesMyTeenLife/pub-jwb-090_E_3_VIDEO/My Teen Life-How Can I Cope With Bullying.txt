00:00:08 My experience with bullying
00:00:09 ultimately started
00:00:11 in physical education
00:00:13 when this kid who shared a locker a few spaces away from me
00:00:18 took that opportunity and started to verbally attack me.
00:00:21 I first experienced bullying
00:00:24 in elementary school,
00:00:26 but it was little stuff, nothing too big.
00:00:29 In middle school is when it was really, really something.
00:00:35 It was upsetting that I
00:00:38 was being bullied; it made me feel
00:00:40 like I was doing something wrong.
00:00:44 Why did I have to be the target?
00:00:47 It got really personal.
00:00:48 He would call me names.
00:00:50 He would say that, you know,
00:00:52 I wasn’t good at anything, that no one cared about me, that I was
00:00:54 dumb, that I was weak.
00:00:55 Especially after he found out that I was a Witness,
00:00:57 the texts just got even more intense.
00:00:59 It was one day specifically that was really bad.
00:01:03 It started in a classroom.
00:01:05 I heard one girl
00:01:07 talk to another girl about me,
00:01:09 right in front of me, and these were lies.
00:01:12 We went to lunch, and I was cornered again.
00:01:15 ‘Is this how middle school is going to be?
00:01:18 ‘I don’t have anybody to be with,
00:01:20 to hang out with during school, because everybody doesn’t like me.’
00:01:24 I felt no one liked me.
00:01:26 It was the worst day ever.
00:01:28 I no longer felt that I was valuable at that point.
00:01:32 I was starting to feel more that I was
00:01:35 this weak person, that I was
00:01:38 defenseless, that no one cared about me,
00:01:40 and that I was worthless to anybody.
00:01:42 So hearing that over and over really took a toll
00:01:46 on my mental health and my emotional health.
00:01:47 I think at my lowest point, after receiving so many
00:01:50 of these vicious attacks, I started to have really,
00:01:52 really dark feelings.
00:01:54 And I realized that I shouldn’t let this go any further than it already had.
00:01:58 That was the moment when I knew I had to get help.
00:02:00 I told my parents about it, of course.
00:02:03 And especially on the worst day, I told them everything.
00:02:07 My parents always brought up scriptures
00:02:09 —Proverbs 27:12.
00:02:11 Anytime I saw the bullies,
00:02:14 I would avoid them as much as possible.
00:02:16 Another thing that I was always doing
00:02:18 was praying constantly —always praying—
00:02:21 before school, during school, after school.
00:02:25 There were times that I would go into the library
00:02:27 and just read books, just stay to myself.
00:02:31 During those times, I would also pray
00:02:33 to Jehovah, and he was a Friend to me.
00:02:36 He was Somebody that I could speak
00:02:37 to on this matter.
00:02:39 I did end up talking to my parents about it.
00:02:41 They let me get my side of the story out.
00:02:43 They were listening, and they wanted to help out.
00:02:45 And they made me feel loved.
00:02:49 I definitely took this time to reach out to the elders.
00:02:54 And they really encouraged me and assured me
00:02:58 that I was not only somewhere where I was needed
00:03:00 but that I was also somewhere where I was wanted.
00:03:02 I took some practical steps.
00:03:03 I moved my locker; I made sure not to retaliate.
00:03:10 Walking away is something very powerful.
00:03:12 Retaliation is something that’s weak
00:03:14 because you’re giving in to your emotions, and you’re just lashing out.
00:03:17 Eventually, the bully got suspended,
00:03:20 which gave me some peace.
00:03:22 He ended up coming back after a week,
00:03:25 and he started up again with the attack.
00:03:27 I noticed that he hadn’t changed at all, but I had.
00:03:30 I was much more confident.
00:03:32 With that change, I began to fear him less.
00:03:35 I wasn’t scared of him.
00:03:37 I just saw him as this person who wanted attention from me.
00:03:39 All the principles that you read
00:03:41 about whether in “Young People Ask” or scriptures that you pick out
00:03:44 —everything really, really helps.
00:03:47 And you can either see the situation
00:03:49 die down or that it’s not that bad.
00:03:51 You can deal with it, or it just stops.
00:03:55 And it was so encouraging for me, and it helped strengthen
00:03:58 my faith in seeing how Jehovah really is there to help.
00:04:03 Don’t keep this to yourself.
00:04:04 Don’t bottle it up, because that’ll make things worse.
00:04:07 This is a problem that won’t go away because you ignore it.
00:04:12 You need to talk to someone.
00:04:13 Talk to your parents, talk to your friend,
00:04:16 talk to Jehovah, talk to someone in the congregation.
00:04:18 Because if you don’t know what to do, they’ll help you find out
00:04:21 what to do and they’ll give you guidance.
00:04:23 And you’ll be so impressed by how much Jehovah takes care of you,
00:04:26 and he’ll show you that you are loved by him.

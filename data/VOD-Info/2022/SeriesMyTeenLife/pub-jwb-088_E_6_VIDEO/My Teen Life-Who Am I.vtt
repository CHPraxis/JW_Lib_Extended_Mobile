00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:11.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Me and my mum started attending meetings

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and studying the Bible
when I was five years old.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 13, I decided to get baptized.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:21.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I decided to dedicate my life

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah when I was 14.

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, Jehovah is a wonderful God.

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not just a Friend that you can count on 
but also a Father.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have a spiritual father
here on earth,

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I have Jehovah as my Father.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was always something that I had in mind

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to let the truth convince me

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not serve Jehovah
just because my family does,

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to serve Jehovah
because of the love I feel for him.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having that clearly in mind is very important

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will make all the difference 
when a problem arises,

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when we have to deal
with something, in the future.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the truths that convinced me

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was really my God

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were mainly basic truths.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe that they’re like
the foundation of a house.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a good base, a good foundation,

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a house will not remain standing.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, I wanted to understand better

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a more scientific standpoint

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really created all things.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I read a lesson
from the brochure <i>Origin of Life.</i>

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that, I saw how Jehovah
really made everything

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very complex way
and that there was no other explanation.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was doubts like that
that moved me to study the Bible more,

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helped me to build
a better friendship with Jehovah

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:53.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to be more convinced
that he was the true God.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always enjoyed and made a great effort

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:59.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed myself
in a spiritual sense in the morning.

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:01.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a teenager,

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went through some problems
that were pretty tough.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt better in the morning.

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a time of day when my problems

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t seem so big in my mind.

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very important to have spiritual goals.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if we don’t have goals,

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like going on a journey
with no direction, no destination.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’ve got a purpose before leaving,
we know where we are going 

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can get there safely.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always think in terms
of setting short-range goals,

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
medium-range goals, and long-range goals.

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:36.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So some goals that I was able to reach

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were getting baptized
and becoming a regular pioneer.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had the privilege 
of serving in construction groups.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter the choices that I had to make,

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always thought about how
they would affect my goals in the future.

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 17,

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found out that my mum had cancer.

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a heartbreaking situation.

00:02:57.698 --> 00:03:01.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, my life was turned upside down.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to learn how to care for our home,
how to cook,

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to care for someone sick,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to give emotional support
to that person.

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The biggest challenge that I faced
when I was a teenager

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:19.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when my parents got divorced,

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:22.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then my mum stopped serving Jehovah.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time in my life,
I was 15 or 16 years old.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that age, you need a lot of support

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:31.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and guidance from your parents.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:34.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a time when I didn’t get
that guidance and that support.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:39.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mum was my best friend, and I lost her.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was always so loving.

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:47.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She always helped me.

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:50.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She always read the publications with me.

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved to study the Bible together.

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know when problems
will suddenly come up.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s important that we take

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s side before the challenges,

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before problems, arise.

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A text that really helped me

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was Romans 8:37-39.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says that ‘neither death

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:20.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nor life nor height nor depth

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:22.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nor anything else

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can separate us from Jehovah’s love.’

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that really helped me
face those challenges.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having a strong Christian identity

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:35.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means having values and principles

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:37.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are the same as Jehovah’s.

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You clearly make up your mind
to please Jehovah,

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:45.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even with what’s happening all around you.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very important to make
the choice to serve Jehovah

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter the situation we face

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:55.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or no matter if our family
serves Jehovah or not,

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s when we face
challenging situations

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:01.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll see if we can continue
to be loyal to Jehovah or not.

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt about it,

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very proud
to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can help us in amazing ways.

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is our Friend,
our Father, our Comforter.

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really good to be friends
with a God that is so powerful

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:22.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have the chance to defend his name.

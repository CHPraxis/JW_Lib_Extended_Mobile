00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do many people react

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:06.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they see corruption and injustice?

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
They become incensed,
and they want to fix the problem.

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do they try to fix the problem?

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:16.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
By becoming involved
in political efforts or social movements

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:21.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
that claim to fight corruption and injustice.

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:23.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do Jehovah’s Witnesses not get involved

00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:29.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
in political efforts or social movements?

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:33.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simple answer is
because they’ve learned from God’s Word

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:37.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the problems of this world
cannot be corrected.

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:41.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 1:15 says:

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:45.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What is crooked cannot be made straight.”

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:49.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan’s world around us
is like the trunk of a tree

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has grown so crooked, twisted, gnarled

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it cannot be made straight.

00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have learned

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it would be futile
to spend our time and energy

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:06.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to correct what Jehovah tells us
cannot be corrected.

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:11.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, Jehovah’s Witnesses
have learned how and where

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
real peace can be found even now.

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:17.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s consider two modern-day examples

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:23.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
of ones who came
to acquire Jehovah’s thinking

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:25.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this matter.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:29.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about Egidio Nahakbria

00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:31.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Frede Bruun.

00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:33.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first Egidio

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:36.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
—born in a remote part of East Timor,

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:40.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
he experienced horrible
guerrilla warfare during his childhood.

00:01:40.877 --> 00:01:44.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of his neighbors
disappeared or were killed,

00:01:44.214 --> 00:01:46.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he feared he would be next.

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:50.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some years later,
he moved to the capital city

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and entered a university

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:57.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he met many other youths
with backgrounds similar to his.

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:02.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
He became part of a student group
that was trying to achieve social change

00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:04.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
through political action.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:08.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many political demonstrations were organized,

00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:12.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
but most ended up in riots,

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many of his friends injured.

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:16.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were even killed.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then through a relative
who was studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:23.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Egidio started to study.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s what he said
as he started this study:

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As I studied the Bible,

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:33.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I began to feel that I had 
never really known love.

00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:37.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Despite my rough
appearance and disposition,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Witnesses treated me
with ‘fellow feeling’

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:42.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ‘brotherly affection.’”

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:46.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, soon he was baptized,
became a regular pioneer,

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:48.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was so happy because now he knew

00:02:48.908 --> 00:02:51.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was truly helping people.

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:55.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
He ended his life story with these words:

00:02:55.874 --> 00:03:00.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the past,
 I felt angry, unloved, and unlovable.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But thanks to Jehovah,

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
at last I have found true love and peace!”

00:03:08.804 --> 00:03:11.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s talk about Frede.

00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:13.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
From an early age,
he was very upset

00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
by all the hatred, bloodshed,
and war he saw around him.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:22.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
But especially was he disturbed
by religion’s role in all of this.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:26.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
He observed that much
of this hatred, bloodshed, and war

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
was encouraged, supported,

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:31.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at least condoned by religion.

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:36.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1955, he attended
a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:41.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after the convention,
he accepted a Bible study.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:44.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, during his studies,
he learned many wonderful things,

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
but something he learned
really motivated him.

00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:49.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned the identity

00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:52.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the “great prostitute,”
Babylon the Great,

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:56.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Revelation chapters 17 and 18.

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:59.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned that this prostitute

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:02.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the world empire of false religion.

00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:04.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he was really amazed

00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:08.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was shown Revelation 18:24,

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:13.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:
“In her [the prostitute] was found the blood

00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:17.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those
who have been slaughtered on the earth.”

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:20.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he learned that the world’s religions

00:04:20.588 --> 00:04:24.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
could never be a force
for international peace

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they take sides,
they’re divided,

00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:30.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they go to war.

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:33.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
he saw that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:33.602 --> 00:04:36.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
are an international brotherhood

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:39.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
that truly practices what Jesus taught.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frede’s progress was very fast.

00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:47.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
He got baptized, started pioneering, 
attended the 50th class of Gilead,

00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:50.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has served many years in Guatemala,

00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:52.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping people (as he was helped)

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:56.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find the true Source of peace.

00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:02.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are lessons we can learn
from Egidio and Frede?

00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:05.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many,
but here are three big ones.

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:07.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:10.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can never correct the corruption

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and injustice of this world

00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:18.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of political efforts
or social movements.

00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:21.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
That reminds me
of the illustration a brother used

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:23.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
about trying to get rid of a problem

00:05:23.238 --> 00:05:27.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
with spiderwebs but being unable 
to get rid of the spider.

00:05:27.242 --> 00:05:28.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knock the webs down;

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:30.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spider builds them right back.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
You knock them down;
it builds them back.

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
You never get rid of the problem.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this illustration,
Satan is the spider.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:43.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since he’s the source
of corruption and injustice,

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:47.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
as long as he exists,
the problem will exist.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little puny humans can’t get rid of Satan.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:51.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s superhuman,

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:55.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the solution must also be superhuman.

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s where God’s Kingdom comes in.

00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:03.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom can and will
not only get rid of the webs

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:07.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the old spider Satan himself too.

00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now here’s our second lesson:

00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must remember that political activism

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:18.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
often leads to violence,
which is the opposite of peace.

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:20.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pursue peace
—don’t we?—

00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:24.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
not conduct that often leads to violence.

00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our third lesson:

00:06:26.263 --> 00:06:29.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the religions of this world,

00:06:29.517 --> 00:06:33.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must promote peace with all people,

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:38.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
which definitely means
we refuse to get involved in any way

00:06:38.193 --> 00:06:41.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the wars of Satan’s world.

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:45.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
That reminds me of an experience
a young brother had in the ministry.

00:06:45.576 --> 00:06:48.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
A very emotional woman said to him:

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:51.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My son died

00:06:51.332 --> 00:06:54.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you to have the freedom you have.

00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:58.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why won’t you fight for your country?”

00:06:58.422 --> 00:07:01.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, very calmly,
the young brother said:

00:07:01.217 --> 00:07:05.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m very sorry
about the loss of your dear son.

00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:07.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But one thing I can guarantee you

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:11.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is that it was not
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who killed your son.

00:07:13.772 --> 00:07:16.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I don’t know if you can make
that guarantee about your religion,

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:19.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I can make that guarantee.”

00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:21.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as it turned out,
she was Catholic,

00:07:21.906 --> 00:07:25.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she definitely was unable
to make that guarantee.

00:07:25.993 --> 00:07:29.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s remember
these three powerful lessons

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have discussed.

00:07:31.833 --> 00:07:35.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we’d like to say
to you dear interested ones in attendance,

00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:38.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you’re not yet one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:41.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
we warmly invite you to please

00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:44.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
study the Bible with us.

00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:49.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
See for yourself how genuine love 
is the best way of life

00:07:49.477 --> 00:07:52.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is the best way to deal with the problems

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
that divide society today.

00:07:55.483 --> 00:07:57.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus made it crystal clear

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:02.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the identifying mark
of true Christians is love.

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 13:35, he said:

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:10.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By this all will know
that you are my disciples

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:14.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if you have love among yourselves.”

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So dear interested ones,

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:19.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
see for yourself whether this genuine love

00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:22.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
exists among Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:27.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we say to those of you
who are already Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:08:27.892 --> 00:08:30.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
please continue to cultivate and show

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:35.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“love for the whole association of brothers.”

00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:39.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing so will require
that you remain strictly neutral

00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the world’s political affairs
and other controversies,

00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:47.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as our Leader remained neutral.

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:52.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 17:14,
Jesus said of his disciples:

00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:55.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are no part of the world,

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as I am no part of the world.”

00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:03.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
So during discussions in the ministry
or anywhere for that matter,

00:09:03.513 --> 00:09:06.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
remain strictly neutral

00:09:06.558 --> 00:09:09.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
on political topics.

00:09:09.311 --> 00:09:13.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take no position regarding what laws 
should be enacted,

00:09:13.566 --> 00:09:16.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
repealed, or changed.

00:09:16.194 --> 00:09:20.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t pressure others
to agree with your view.

00:09:20.406 --> 00:09:22.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to succeed in this,

00:09:22.617 --> 00:09:25.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be careful not to allow
the media of this world

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:28.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
to manipulate our thinking.

00:09:28.415 --> 00:09:31.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
News broadcasts are often presented

00:09:31.084 --> 00:09:34.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a biased, opinionated way.

00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:37.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ve got to be careful
not to adopt the bias of a commentator.

00:09:37.508 --> 00:09:40.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only if we keep our thinking neutral

00:09:40.886 --> 00:09:45.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
will we be able to keep
our speech and actions neutral also.

00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:50.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, your good example
of showing love in Christian neutrality

00:09:50.397 --> 00:09:54.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
may attract honest-hearted ones to the truth.

00:09:55.652 --> 00:09:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:01.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned from this symposium?

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s highlight just one
valuable takeaway lesson

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
from each of our six parts.

00:10:07.665 --> 00:10:11.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first part,
“Joseph and His Brothers”:

00:10:11.085 --> 00:10:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our lesson is sow peace

00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:18.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
by letting go of resentment.

00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second part,
“The Gibeonites”:

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:24.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly submit to Jehovah’s will,

00:10:24.016 --> 00:10:28.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it differs from what you prefer.

00:10:28.187 --> 00:10:30.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third part,
“Gideon”:

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:33.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prevent conflicts from escalating

00:10:33.442 --> 00:10:36.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
by choosing words that calm,

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:39.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
reassure, and heal.

00:10:39.657 --> 00:10:42.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fourth part,
“Abigail”:

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:44.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do what you can to promote peace,

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then leave matters with Jehovah.

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:50.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fifth part,
“Mephibosheth”:

00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:53.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be willing to suffer loss

00:10:53.213 --> 00:10:56.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than disturb the peace
in the congregation.

00:10:56.884 --> 00:10:59.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just another thought on this:
Let’s always remember

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
that defending Jehovah’s name and reputation

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
is far more important

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:08.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
than trying to defend
our own name and reputation.

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:10.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be willing to suffer loss

00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than disturb the peace
in the congregation.

00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:17.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sixth part (this part),
“Modern-Day Examples”:

00:11:17.406 --> 00:11:21.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serve the God of peace with his people,

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:24.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have peace.

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:26.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, during this symposium,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve learned many valuable lessons
as to how we can sow peace.

00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:34.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s all be determined to do so
with all our heart.

00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:37.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what will be the final result?

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the answer,

00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:43.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s watch the final dramatization
of this symposium.

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s one more story to tell.

00:11:52.318 --> 00:11:55.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know it at the time,

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:57.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
but seeds of truth

00:11:57.823 --> 00:11:59.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
were being planted in my heart.

00:12:05.623 --> 00:12:07.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were all so different.

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:10.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand it.

00:12:14.841 --> 00:12:17.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
You were prisoners, yes,

00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:19.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you felt free

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
—truly free.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:32.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
After you were released,

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:36.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
it became clear to me

00:12:36.865 --> 00:12:40.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have God’s blessing,

00:12:40.077 --> 00:12:42.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted to know why.

00:12:45.207 --> 00:12:47.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil helped me find the answer.

00:12:49.378 --> 00:12:52.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you will know the truth,

00:12:52.465 --> 00:12:55.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truth will set you free.”

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil encouraged me to make the truth my own.

00:13:01.683 --> 00:13:05.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had real trouble at first.

00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:08.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
With all the turmoil going on at the time,

00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:11.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea of being peaceable

00:13:11.276 --> 00:13:14.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waiting on God’s Kingdom

00:13:16.407 --> 00:13:18.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was hard to grasp.

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah’s help

00:13:29.504 --> 00:13:31.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the patience of these good people,

00:13:33.925 --> 00:13:37.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized
before the start of the great tribulation.

00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:50.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph, during our time in prison,

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
the story of your life

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
—your time in prison

00:13:54.614 --> 00:13:55.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah was always with you—

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:57.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
became a real source of strength

00:13:57.909 --> 00:13:59.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us.

00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:01.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one day,

00:14:02.247 --> 00:14:04.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Carl said—

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:14:06.418 --> 00:14:11.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “One day,
we’ll have a meal with Joseph,

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:14.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll say ‘thank you.’”

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we are!

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:19.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, it’s I who should thank you.

00:14:19.974 --> 00:14:23.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each and every one
of your stories

00:14:23.603 --> 00:14:25.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
touches my heart.

00:14:25.647 --> 00:14:27.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know a lot about my life,

00:14:27.732 --> 00:14:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
but would it be all right
if I shared a few more stories?

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please!

00:14:32.362 --> 00:14:33.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have so many questions.

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:35.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about Egypt?

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:36.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Pharaoh really like?

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:37.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dreams!

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:39.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to talk about those dreams.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:44.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
You do have many questions!

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have many details to share.

00:14:47.962 --> 00:14:50.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thanks to our God, Jehovah,

00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:53.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have all the time we need.

00:15:02.227 --> 00:15:04.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a touching video!

00:15:04.772 --> 00:15:07.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we wholeheartedly sow peace,

00:15:07.733 --> 00:15:12.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll ‘save ourselves
and those who listen to us.’

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what fundamental truth from our great God

00:15:15.867 --> 00:15:18.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
have we discussed during this symposium?

00:15:18.912 --> 00:15:23.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s expressed at Galatians 6:7:

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:26.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For whatever a person is sowing,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
this he will also reap.”

00:15:29.923 --> 00:15:32.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we sow a tomato seed,

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will always get tomato plants.

00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:39.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this unfailing fundamental truth
applies to peace.

00:15:39.183 --> 00:15:43.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we sow peace,
we will always reap peace.

00:15:43.563 --> 00:15:45.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although in some cases,

00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may take some time
for the peace we sowed to bring good results.

00:15:50.362 --> 00:15:53.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we persevere in sowing peace,

00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:56.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will reap peace of mind,

00:15:56.201 --> 00:16:00.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace with others and, most important,
peace with Jehovah.

00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:04.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll reap the reward
of living forever in a world

00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there will be an abundance of peace.

00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:12.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s be determined to sow peace now

00:16:12.343 --> 00:16:15.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can reap peace forever.

00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:16.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,

00:16:16.681 --> 00:16:20.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s a pretty good investment
of our time and effort, isn’t it?

00:16:20.686 --> 00:16:23.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sow peace now

00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:26.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reap peace forever.

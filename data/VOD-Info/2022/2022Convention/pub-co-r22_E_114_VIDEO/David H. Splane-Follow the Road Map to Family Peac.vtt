00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:05.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah intended married couples
to work together.

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Jesus used the expression we find

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 19:6.

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read this from the Bible
—Matthew 19.

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ll give you a moment.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 19
—now, we’re going to read verse 6.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first of all, Jesus quotes

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Genesis 2:24.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of married couples, he says:

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:37.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.”

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you remember, Jehovah
made that comment in the garden of Eden.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Jesus adds something
that isn’t in Genesis.

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Therefore, what God has yoked

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[yoked] together,

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
let no man put apart.”

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:01.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think of a yoke,
we may think of a team of horses

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
plowing a field or pulling a heavy wagon.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if they pull together,
they can be a powerful force.

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true
when family members work together.

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, Dad

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you have excellent reasons to work together.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you work together,
you contribute to the peace of the family.

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think of the effect
it has on the children.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
By working together, you’re teaching
that fine young son of yours

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to be a caring husband and father,

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your beautiful daughter how to be
a supportive wife and mother.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happens when teammates
begin pulling in opposite directions

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when one puts on the brakes?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch a video.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the setup.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a long time, a sister raised
her two children as a single parent,

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she did a great job of it.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she married a very kind brother.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
The family has a new head.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how well the sister
is adapting to her new role.

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last few weeks of family worship
have been nice,

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
right?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:23.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these things we ask and pray
in Jesus’ name, Amen.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amen.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:29.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, this week . . .

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are in chapter 5.

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:33.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yep, that’s right.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last week, Gabe read, so this week . . .

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Sue’s turn.

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.
It’s Sue’s turn.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, the point here is
that when it comes . . .

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honey, maybe an illustration would be better.

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, OK.

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:54.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like a bird . . .

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, hopefully I was able to clear that up
for you a little bit, Olivia.

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thank you.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, actually, Max, that’s not true.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had an updated understanding
in the recent <i>Watchtower.</i>

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think they went really well, right?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, actually . . .

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:03:27.728 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we can talk about it later.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister isn’t a bad person.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:52.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can ask:
What is she teaching her daughter

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the wife’s role in the family?

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:56.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is her son learning
about taking the lead

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the man of the house?

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hasn’t had a man
in his life for a long time.

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now there is one.

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s safe to say that the kids
will stand a better chance

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
of having a successful marriage themselves

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:13.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they see their parents pulling together.

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:17.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little later, we’ll see how
the husband handles the situation,

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:20.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we brothers
are going to want to pay attention.

00:04:20.197 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a classic.

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family life is more pleasant when Dad, Mom,

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the kids work together as a team.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
The family head is the captain.

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
He needs to make sure that everyone knows

00:04:35.254 --> 00:04:37.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
what goals the family is working toward

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:42.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how each one can contribute
toward achieving those goals.

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:45.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it’s your family’s turn
to help clean the Kingdom Hall

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a convention venue, for example,

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t leave the kids at home.

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re part of the team.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t go there with half the team.

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:58.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let them experience the joy
that comes from serving others.

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:00.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let them work along with you.

00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:02.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re assigned to clean the restrooms,

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t complain about it—a very fine example.

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:10.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your children will learn that when
there’s work to be done, we just do it.

00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:15.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
We aren’t picky about what we will
and will not do.

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t feel
that some jobs are beneath us.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is in line with Paul’s counsel

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Philippians 2:3, 4.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look that up.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good exercise

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:33.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Philippians chapter 2,

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:36.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 3, 4.

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:41.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re thinking about the family
as a team here.

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:44.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Do nothing out of contentiousness

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or out of egotism,

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but with humility consider
others superior to you,

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:56.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as you look out
not only for your own interests,

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:59.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
When there’s work to be done,
someone has to do it.

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:08.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do I think that I’m so special
that someone else has to look after it?

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some families volunteer
to help with Kingdom Hall maintenance.

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:15.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the kids are old enough,
they can work on other projects

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:17.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
like working on an Assembly Hall.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:19.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a ball!

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:22.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
The friendships that you
and your young people will forge

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:24.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
can last a lifetime.

00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:26.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s a bonus: When the young people

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:29.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to a circuit assembly
or a regional convention,

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:32.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll have good friends to associate with

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:37.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both young and old—
people they’ve been working with.

00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:42.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about working around the house?

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:46.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some parents feel that the children
shouldn’t have to help out at all

00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:48.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they have their schoolwork to do.

00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:51.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
But their schoolwork is something
they do for themselves.

00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:55.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are they contributing
to the welfare of the family?

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:59.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are they learning
to serve others unselfishly?

00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:03.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good for a child to feel that he has
an important role in the household

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:06.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that people are counting on him.

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:09.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think what that does for his self-respect.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:12.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
A father named Steven said,

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:14.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When nothing is expected of them,

00:07:14.997 --> 00:07:17.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“children learn that they
are here to be served,

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:20.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they grow up with a distorted view

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what life will require of them.”

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might ask, Would a young person

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that attitude
even be able to keep a job?

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:33.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
When some in the world lose their job,

00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:36.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
they remain unemployed for a long time.

00:07:36.393 --> 00:07:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can’t pay the bills.

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:41.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, there are job opportunities
all around them,

00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:45.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they consider those jobs beneath them.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s one of the most annoying traits
an employee can have?

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:51.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask any boss.

00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:54.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the worker is asked to do something,
he replies,

00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:56.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That’s not my job.”

00:07:57.414 --> 00:08:01.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teach your child that anything
that needs to be done

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:05.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
is his job if he’s old enough
and capable of doing it.

00:08:07.215 --> 00:08:11.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
How early should parents
start to assign chores to their children?

00:08:11.428 --> 00:08:14.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some experts have found that children who are

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:17.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
three years old or even younger

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:20.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be taught to help out.

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:24.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can learn to pick up their toys,
clean up spills, sort laundry.

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:27.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Older children can vacuum,

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:30.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
wash the car, prepare a meal.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m happy to say that many young brothers
here at Bethel

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
are excellent cooks,
which is often the result

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
of fine parental training.

00:08:39.956 --> 00:08:42.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember the video where Caleb

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:45.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
is taught to clean his room
and put away his toys?

00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:48.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
That video was a game changer
for many children.

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to be just like Caleb.

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:55.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now when you enter their room,
you can find the bed.

00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:02.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
When problems arise,
attack the problem, not each other.

00:09:02.687 --> 00:09:06.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not ‘How can I win?’
but ‘How can we win?’

00:09:06.942 --> 00:09:11.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll see an excellent example of that
in the follow-up video.

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:12.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:25.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:27.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Want some tea?

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:28.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:37.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, babe,

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:40.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
you and me, we’re a team, right?

00:09:40.058 --> 00:09:41.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course!

00:09:43.186 --> 00:09:46.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I read this, I thought about us.

00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:54.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.”

00:09:56.158 --> 00:10:00.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that before, you had to shoulder
everything yourself for so long.

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:03.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you did great.

00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:08.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been raising two beautiful,
spiritual kids on your own.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now you have me.

00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:17.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do you think
sometimes we’re not a team?

00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:19.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s just that sometimes
during family worship . . .

00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:22.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I get excited, and I jump in. I know!

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:26.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m just so used to doing it
after all these years.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re not trying to take over.

00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:31.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
And listen, I love the way you teach.

00:10:31.318 --> 00:10:33.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see how you can reach the kids

00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:35.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that I can’t.

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just let me guide it,
and I’ll make sure you can do that.

00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, honey. Thanks for your patience.

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:46.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, thank you for your patience.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a work in progress,
but we make a great team.

00:10:52.547 --> 00:10:56.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we look at what we’re going
to cover before our next family worship?

00:10:56.426 --> 00:10:58.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds great.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that a fine example

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:08.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how to attack a problem and not your mate?

00:11:08.813 --> 00:11:12.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
No arguments, no raised voices,

00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:17.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
no accusations
—the husband had empathy for his wife.

00:11:17.322 --> 00:11:19.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t question her motives.

00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:21.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
He realized that as a single parent,

00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:24.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
she’d been taking the lead for a long time.

00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:29.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice how she responded
to her husband’s kind counsel.

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:33.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt it’s going to be easy
for the kids to respect their stepfather,

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re going to learn
how a husband and wife

00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:40.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
should treat each other
and how they should pull together.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometime soon, you might want
to consider these questions:

00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:50.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what aspects of our marriage
do we work well as a team?

00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:55.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, how can we improve?

00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:57.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
It pleases Jehovah

00:11:57.237 --> 00:12:00.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
when family members work together as a team.

00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:02.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
That promotes peace in the family.

00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:06.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our God is a “God of peace.”

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:11.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now Brother John Ekrann

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:14.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
will consider the final talk
of this symposium,

00:12:14.337 --> 00:12:17.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace

00:12:17.382 --> 00:12:20.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Worship Jehovah Together.”

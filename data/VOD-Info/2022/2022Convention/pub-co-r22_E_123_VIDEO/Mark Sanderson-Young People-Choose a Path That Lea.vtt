00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:03.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
An 18-year-old brother

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:07.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
was trying to decide
what he wanted to do after high school.

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:11.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was raised in the truth, and in his heart,

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:13.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wanted to be a pioneer.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he also had a scholarship
to go to university

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some other grants,
and he had been accepted to attend.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had many questions
(how was he going to support himself?)

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and much pressure from his teachers

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:32.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and counselors to go to university.

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
What decision would he make?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe many of you young ones
who are listening to this talk right now

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing that same decision,

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe you will be in a year or two.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
What path will you take?

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, here’s what we know:

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you to have,
not just a good life,

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just an average life,

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he wants you to have an awesome,
wonderful life

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both now during your youth

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really for your entire life.

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the Bible says

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ecclesiastes 11:9:

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rejoice, young man, while you are young,

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let your heart be glad
in the days of your youth.”

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many young people
have found real joy and peace

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
by choosing a career
in the full-time service.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, when we say full-time service,
what are we talking about?

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, full-time service
is not just one thing.

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
It actually includes many things.

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes pioneering,
maybe in your home congregation

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe in another area

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe in another city, state,
province or even in another country.

00:01:56.428 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might mean assisting
with theocratic construction projects,

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe building Kingdom Halls
or Assembly Halls 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
or building remote translation offices

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even working at building
at Bethel facilities.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it also could mean
submitting an application

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Bethel service and becoming a Bethelite.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, there are

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
so many wonderful opportunities

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are available for you young ones

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
in full-time service.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
What challenges could prevent you

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
from starting or continuing

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the path of full-time service?

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more important,

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can you overcome those challenges?

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk about three obstacles.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the first one:
It’s financial concerns.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
How am I going to support myself?

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at something that Jesus said

00:02:56.947 --> 00:03:00.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew chapter 6

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 33

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:33.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Keep on, then,
seeking first the Kingdom

00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his righteousness,

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:18.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all these other things
will be added to you.”

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, OK.

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:23.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says “all these other things.”

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:24.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
What other things?

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Jesus talking about here?

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to find out,
why don’t we go back up to verse 25?

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s read a little bit more
of what Jesus

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:37.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
was talking about when he said
those famous words

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
—verse 25:

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:41.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On this account I say to you:

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop being anxious about your lives

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as to what you will eat
or what you will drink,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or about your bodies
as to what you will wear.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does not life mean more than food

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the body than clothing?”

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now (after identifying)—

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:03.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know what Jesus is talking about:
He’s talking about our necessities

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
—food, shelter, clothing.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, look at the illustrations
Jesus goes on to give now,

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning here in verse 26:

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:14.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Observe intently the birds of heaven;

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they do not sow seed or reap
or gather into storehouses,

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:22.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you not worth more than they are?

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:30.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who of you by being anxious
can add one cubit to his life span?

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:37.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,

00:04:37.214 --> 00:04:41.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“how they grow;
they do not toil, nor do they spin;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I tell you that not even Solomon

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all his glory was arrayed
as one of these.

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:52.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if this is how God clothes
the vegetation of the field

00:04:52.563 --> 00:04:56.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is here today and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven,

00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will he not much rather clothe you,

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:01.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you with little faith?

00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:05.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So never be anxious and say,
‘What are we to eat?’

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or, ‘What are we to drink?’
or, ‘What are we to wear?’

00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all these are the things
the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your heavenly Father knows

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:18.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you need all these things.”

00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:21.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do you get the sense of this?

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was trying to reason

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:25.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
that just as Jehovah provides

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:28.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of his creation,

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:31.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
he can provide for you too.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just need to develop our faith

00:05:33.937 --> 00:05:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will provide the things we need

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:41.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we put his service first.

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:44.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, does that mean
that Jehovah is just going to drop

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:46.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
into our lap everything that we need?

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:48.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, no.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:51.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah expects
that we’re going to use the things

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:54.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s given us
to be able to support ourselves.

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:57.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s very wise when you’re young

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:01.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
to plan ahead so that you can obtain

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
the skills you need
to be able to support yourself.

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:06.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in some lands,

00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:09.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may be that as you’re growing up,

00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can learn a trade from your father

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
or from your mother
or maybe even from another relative.

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other lands, you might be able
while you’re still in high school

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:22.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take some vocational courses

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would help you to learn
a skill or learn a trade.

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:30.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the point: We need to plan.

00:06:30.452 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
So ask yourself, ‘What abilities and skills

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:37.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
do I have that I could use
to support myself?’

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:39.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister named Kelly

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a very clear goal in mind
of becoming a pioneer.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:45.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did she do?

00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:48.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this is what she says:
“I had to choose something

00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:51.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow me
to support myself in my ministry.”

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kelly enrolled in a vocational program
in her high school,

00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:59.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that helped her
to achieve her primary goal.

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what she said:

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:05.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The full-time ministry
was what I wanted to do.

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:08.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything else was secondary.”

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does Kelly feel now
about the decision that she made?

00:07:12.703 --> 00:07:15.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says: “I feel my decision

00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:18.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the best one that I could have made.”

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:20.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
You young brothers and sisters,

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:25.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can overcome that challenge
just by planning ahead

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making sure
that you have practical skills

00:07:28.135 --> 00:07:31.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can use to support yourself.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:35.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the second obstacle:
pressure from others.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:39.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My relatives want me
to focus on making money.’

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if that’s the case,

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
explain your spiritual goals

00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:48.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a calm, respectful way.

00:07:48.405 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 4:6 says:

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your words always be gracious,

00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
seasoned with salt.”

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we all know
when we eat food with no salt,

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t taste very good, does it?

00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:06.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
We put a little salt on it
—now it becomes delicious.

00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:10.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
So make sure that when you
speak to your relatives,

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:12.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
you put a little salt on those words

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:16.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can reason with them
and help them to see the wisdom

00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:19.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the decision that you want to make.

00:08:19.227 --> 00:08:23.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it could be
that your relatives will not agree with you.

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:25.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s look at something that Jesus said

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:30.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
here at Luke 7:35.

00:08:32.616 --> 00:08:34.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “All the same,

00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wisdom is proved righteous

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:42.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or, now, if you look at the footnote,
it says, ‘or “is vindicated”’]

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:45.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
by all its children.”

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:47.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, what’s the point?

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:50.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, sometimes when people make a decision,

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:53.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not sure if it
was the right one or not.

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when the decision works out well,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it leads to success,
when people see how happy you are 

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:05.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how successful you are
—the joy, the satisfaction you have—

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:07.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, then, what happens?

00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:09.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe your relatives will see

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:12.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your decision has been vindicated.

00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:16.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been “proved righteous”
by the way things have turned out.

00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:22.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s obstacle number three:
unexpected challenges.

00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:26.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I thought it was going
to be easier than this.’

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those unexpected challenges
can be many.

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:34.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be just trying
to get used to new roommates,

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:37.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with personality challenges,

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:40.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even just coping with homesickness.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the point: Don’t give up!

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what James said here

00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:49.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
in James chapter 1

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:51.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
—James chapter 1

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:54.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 4.

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:57.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice as you look at verse 2,

00:09:57.742 --> 00:10:00.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
James is talking about trials,

00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:05.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s talking about how trials
can have a positive effect on us.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now look what he says in verse 4:

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:11.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But let endurance complete its work,

00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:15.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may be complete
and sound in all respects,

00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:18.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
not lacking in anything.”

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s James trying to say?

00:10:21.683 --> 00:10:23.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s his point?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, have you ever heard the expression

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:28.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No pain, no gain”?

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you want to reach
a certain fitness goal

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:35.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if you want to be very good
at playing a certain sport,

00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt you’re going to have
some aching muscles.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:42.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt you’re going to have
some hurt pride along the way too.

00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:44.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you won’t be very good
when you first start.

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do you do?

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:49.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you want to become good,

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you want to reach your goal,
you can’t give up.

00:10:52.255 --> 00:10:54.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to keep trying.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:59.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the same could be said
about reaching our spiritual goals.

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:01.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, James mentions

00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:05.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
that trials often reveal our weaknesses.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it’s some aspect of our personality
that needs improvement.

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:14.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it’s something
in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we need greater faith;
maybe we need greater trust.

00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:23.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we endure even during periods of trial

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:28.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we refuse to give up,
we become stronger.

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:31.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
We become stronger in our spirituality

00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:33.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our relationship with Jehovah

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our love for him,
our faith in him, our trust in him

00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:39.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
just continues to grow.

00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:42.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
As James says there in verse 4,

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become “complete
and sound in all respects,

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
not lacking in anything.”

00:11:49.187 --> 00:11:52.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when those trials come

00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and they will come—

00:11:54.317 --> 00:11:57.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t look for a quick way out.

00:11:57.153 --> 00:12:01.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Endure, keep going, don’t give up!

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:05.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seek advice from brothers and sisters
who have successfully coped

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
with similar challenges,
and you too will be successful.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:16.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how some full-time servants
have found real peace

00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:20.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite those three obstacles:
financial concerns,

00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:24.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
pressure from others,
and unexpected challenges.

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:28.143 line:10% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

00:12:28.143 --> 00:12:29.936 line:10% position:50% align:center
“If it is your will, I would be happy

00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:31.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enter pioneer service.”

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:37.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I had to work really hard
to provide for the needs of my family

00:12:38.903 --> 00:12:43.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my father had died
when he was 45 years old.

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:46.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elder that I talked to

00:12:46.453 --> 00:12:50.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave me advice not to be picky
about what kind of job I could get.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reminded me of Matthew 6:33,
and told me

00:12:53.627 --> 00:12:55.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be overly anxious.

00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our good communication
within the family,

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:02.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were able to find solutions.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
My other siblings realized
that they also shared

00:13:05.347 --> 00:13:08.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
responsibility in providing
for the needs of the family.

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:13.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
After one year of pioneering,
I was encouraged to apply for Bethel service,

00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:16.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now I am in Bethel.

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:21.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that Jehovah really cares for me,
loves me,

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:24.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciates all my efforts.

00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:32.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because they love me, my cousins
pressured me to choose a secular career.

00:13:35.043 --> 00:13:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I went against

00:13:36.252 --> 00:13:38.546 line:10% position:50% align:center
their wishes, it would hurt them

00:13:38.546 --> 00:13:41.091 line:10% position:50% align:center
and put a strain on our relationship.

00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:43.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really anxious.

00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:47.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to show my trust
in Jehovah by pioneering

00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:51.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give him an opportunity to show me
that I can be happy in his service.

00:13:54.688 --> 00:13:58.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to express my appreciation
for my cousins by what 

00:13:58.483 --> 00:14:00.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said and did

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed them love.

00:14:06.282 --> 00:14:10.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve realized
that I have changed for the better.

00:14:10.453 --> 00:14:13.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
I show more concern for others now.

00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:18.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they understand that we have been
learning good things and that we have

00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:20.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
a happier and more meaningful life.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.093 line:10% position:50% align:center
I wanted to try serving

00:14:25.093 --> 00:14:26.761 line:10% position:50% align:center
where the need was greater.

00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:28.471 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I first arrived,

00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:31.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it was so cool being there.

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:33.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had expected the poverty,
but when I saw it,

00:14:33.768 --> 00:14:36.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
it hit home more than what I had expected.

00:14:36.688 --> 00:14:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then I started to feel really homesick.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my brothers and sisters—

00:14:41.484 --> 00:14:44.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d go to the Kingdom Hall and they
were able to cope with the challenges

00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they were facing because they had
Jehovah in their life.

00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:52.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
So their example really helped me to see
that my circumstances

00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:56.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t need to change
for my attitude to change.

00:14:57.542 --> 00:15:00.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 15:15 stood out to me,

00:15:00.003 --> 00:15:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is about having “a cheerful heart”

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:06.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being able to have “a continual feast”
no matter what my circumstances are.

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:09.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I found an article about that scripture.

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so from there, I decided to ask myself,
‘How can I use my situation

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what I’m learning to help others?’

00:15:17.937 --> 00:15:20.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I got to start helping
with a foreign-language group there.

00:15:20.732 --> 00:15:22.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
That whole experience

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:27.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
just made my love for people grow so much

00:15:27.155 --> 00:15:29.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and definitely changed my life.

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:35.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of your non-Witness family members

00:15:35.497 --> 00:15:39.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
might offer you secular or financial advice.

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:41.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know they mean well

00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:44.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they feel that they’re giving you
the best advice

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they love you.

00:15:46.633 --> 00:15:49.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, young brothers and sisters,

00:15:49.219 --> 00:15:53.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are convinced that the blessings
of full-time service

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:57.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
far outweigh any challenges

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might go along with it.

00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:04.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think of the experiences
that we heard in the video.

00:16:04.025 --> 00:16:07.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Harley’s choices allowed him to go to Bethel

00:16:07.487 --> 00:16:11.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped him to feel
that Jehovah really loved him.

00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:14.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anjil’s choices took courage,

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:18.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
but those choices helped him
to be more concerned about other people

00:16:18.623 --> 00:16:21.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped his relatives to see

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:23.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had made a good decision.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Carlee did not give up
when the trials came.

00:16:27.715 --> 00:16:32.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, she learned
to love other people even more

00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:36.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and became a more powerful, strong Christian.

00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:42.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, why are we so convinced

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:45.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
that full-time service
will lead you young ones

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a wonderful life?

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:50.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s because that’s the decision

00:16:50.113 --> 00:16:53.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
that so many of us made when we were young.

00:16:53.074 --> 00:16:56.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
that 18-year-old young brother

00:16:56.077 --> 00:16:59.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was trying to decide which path to take?

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:03.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was me some years ago.

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:05.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so glad

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:08.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
that with the help of Jehovah and my parents

00:17:08.798 --> 00:17:12.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other mature friends in the congregation,

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:14.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made the decision

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:18.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like so many other brothers
and sisters around the world

00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:20.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
to turn down that scholarship,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give up university,

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:27.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to go directly
into the full-time service.

00:17:27.233 --> 00:17:31.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is a decision
that I have never regretted;

00:17:31.112 --> 00:17:35.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is a decision that I will never regret.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young people, Jehovah loves you.

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:43.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants you to have
a wonderful, awesome life.

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:47.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Choose the path
of full-time service if you can.

00:17:47.503 --> 00:17:49.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never regret it.

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:54.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will put you on a path
that leads to joy and peace

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:58.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our marvelous, wonderful God, Jehovah.

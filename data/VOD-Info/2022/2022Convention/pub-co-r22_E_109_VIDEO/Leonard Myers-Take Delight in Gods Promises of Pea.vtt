00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we continue our consideration

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:06.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the promises of peace
in Isaiah’s prophecies,

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like you to imagine
an Israelite living in Babylon.

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:14.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he’s just learned
that Jews can return to Jerusalem

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help to rebuild the temple.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he must decide
if he and his family will leave Babylon

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the long trip to his homeland.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
What might he consider?

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after 70 years,
the land must have changed.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fields would be overgrown with weeds.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wolves, leopards, lions, and bears
must freely walk in the fields.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Snakes make their home there.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he might ask himself:

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:45.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will my domestic animals
be killed by predators?

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:48.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will my small children be bitten by snakes?

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the danger of fierce men
attacking us on the journey home?’

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, any such fears could be dispelled

00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
by considering the prophecy at Isaiah 11:6-9.

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that together.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah chapter 11

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and notice this promise of peace—

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting in verse 6:

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wolf will reside for a while
with the lamb,

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with the young goat
the leopard will lie down,

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the calf and the lion
and the fattened animal will all be together;

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:26.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a little boy will lead them.

00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The cow and the bear will feed together,

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their young will lie down together.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:35.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The lion will eat straw like the bull.

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The nursing child
will play over the lair of a cobra,

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a weaned child will put his hand
over the den of a poisonous snake.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will not cause any harm or any ruin

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all my holy mountain,

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the earth will certainly be filled
with the knowledge of Jehovah

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the waters cover the sea.”

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful promise of peace!

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jews wouldn’t need to fear
wild animals or fierce men

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their journey home
or in their restored land.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
With these poetic words,

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:14.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured the exiles
that they and their livestock would be safe.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:17.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would bless them with peace.

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice, according to verse 7,

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:23.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the lion would symbolically eat straw,

00:02:23.497 --> 00:02:27.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrating that lions
wouldn’t kill the Jews’ cattle?

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithful ones would have nothing to fear
from animal or human predators.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:37.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see this prophecy
being fulfilled in our day?

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not with the literal animals,

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:42.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do see a spiritual fulfillment.

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice again, the end of verse 9.

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:50.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “The earth will certainly be filled
with the knowledge of Jehovah.”

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, does the knowledge of Jehovah
change the behavior of animals?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but the knowledge of God
does change people.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our day, the knowledge of Jehovah
helps people who are violent

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:07.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
to transform their personality
and become peaceable.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with Colossians 3:10,

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
these ones have ‘clothed themselves
with the new personality.’

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve stripped off
animalistic, violent tendencies

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and transformed their lives
in harmony with what the Bible teaches.

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:26.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
They get along peaceably with others.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you know someone
who made such changes.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps you made these changes,

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:35.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving behind a violent way of life.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me share with you such an experience.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
A man named José

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:45.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
was trained in the martial arts
and in the use of weapons.

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had broken the law so many times

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was brought to trial on 22 counts

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:58.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was so violent
that even fellow inmates were afraid of him,

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was kept in a high-security cell.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
For seven years, his fleshly sister,

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
visited him.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he always rejected the Bible’s message.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:14.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, though,
he accepted one of our publications,

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:17.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a Bible study was started.

00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:20.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away,
he made tremendous changes in his conduct.

00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:25.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
One week later,
he gave a personal witness to 200 prisoners

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:28.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the following week to 600 more.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even received permission
to visit the inmates in other prison blocks.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, because of the remarkable change
in his behavior,

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:40.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
his sentence was reduced to 15 years.

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, after serving just ten years,
he was released from prison.

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:49.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
José was eventually baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
truly a case
of ‘the wolf residing with the lamb.’

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:59.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the future fulfillment
of Isaiah 11:6-9?

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the earthly Paradise
that God has promised,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be delightful peace among humans

00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:08.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and between humans and animals.

00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:10.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you long for that time?

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:14.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:17.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the peace we enjoy
with fellow believers now

00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just imagine the peace
that we’ll enjoy in Paradise.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel during a long journey

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:32.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you might meet
wild animals and criminals along the road?

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured the returning exiles
that they would return

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
in safety and dwell in peace.

00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:46.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who were once violent

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:56.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
have learned to be humble,

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:59.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving, and peaceable.

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:16.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the peace
that will reign in God’s new world,

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:28.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we can wander this beautiful globe,

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
explore every corner,

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and admire the handiwork of the true God

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no fear.

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:13.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:07:13.036 --> 00:07:17.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all my holy mountain,’ says Jehovah.”

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the video showed,
people who were once violent

00:07:26.341 --> 00:07:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
have learned to be
humble, loving, and peaceable.

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:33.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did you feel
when you saw scenes in the video

00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:37.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
of humans so close to wild animals?

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promise of peace among humans

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace between humans and animals
is thrilling!

00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:47.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice
what Isaiah further wrote about this peace

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:50.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah chapter 65.

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:52.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn there with me
—Isaiah 65.

00:07:52.993 --> 00:07:57.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these are words similar to those
we read earlier in Isaiah chapter 11.

00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:00.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 65:25:

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:05.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The wolf and the lamb will feed together,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the lion will eat straw just like the bull,

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:11.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the serpent’s food will be dust.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:14.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘They will do no harm nor cause any ruin

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:17.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all my holy mountain,’ says Jehovah.”

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:22.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Skilled artists in the Art Department
at world headquarters

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautifully illustrate such scenes,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the images can be found
in our publications.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what Isaiah describes
is no artist’s rendition.

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will be real.

00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:38.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how you’ll feel
when you’re not afraid of wild animals

00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:41.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the animals aren’t afraid of you.

00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:46.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we look forward
to that future promise of peace,

00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:49.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
what can we do now to pursue peace?

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing is to contribute
to the peace of our spiritual paradise,

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:58.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
the secure,
spiritually prosperous environment

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:00.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which we worship Jehovah.

00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:04.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus stated at Matthew 5:9:

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:07.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the peacemakers.”

00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:11.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
A peacemaker is skilled
at restoring peace among brothers

00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:13.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
when peace is disturbed.

00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:16.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more important,
a peacemaker strives

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
to avoid disturbing peace in the first place.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does “peacemaker” describe you?

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you contributing
to our spiritual paradise in that way?

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:32.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else we can do
as we await the future fulfillment

00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:35.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the wolf and the lamb feeding together

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to meditate on what it will be like

00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:40.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help resurrected ones who were violent

00:09:40.892 --> 00:09:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become peaceable.

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:47.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine studying with a resurrected one
who had a violent background,

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
who perhaps experienced a violent death
because of a fierce personality.

00:09:52.696 --> 00:09:55.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will you reason with the person
from God’s Word

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:58.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him see the need to be a peacemaker?

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
What examples of such transformations
will you share?

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:06.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how will you explain
the prophecies of peace

00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:09.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah chapter 11, verses 6 through 9

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:12.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chapter 65, verse 25?

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:17.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage all of you to think deeply

00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:21.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how this promise of peace
was fulfilled for the ancient Jews,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the promise is being fulfilled today,

00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:28.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what life on earth will be like
when it’s fulfilled in the future.

00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:33.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us take delight
in the peaceful promise

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the wolf and the lamb feeding together.

00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:41.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother James Mantz,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:44.915 line:90% position:50% align:center

of this symposium,

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:48.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:52.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘No Resident Will Say: “I am Sick.”’”

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:03.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think of unity,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
the words of Psalm 133:1 may come to mind.

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:08.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read them.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the words
aren’t going to be on the screen,

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:12.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
so let’s look them up in the Bible.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Psalm 133

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 1.

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Look!

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:25.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How good and how pleasant it is

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:34.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we certainly agree
with these words of David.

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:39.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, speaking of David,
he knew the value of unity.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we may remember
that he didn’t always get

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:44.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
to experience it in his own life.

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:48.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beginning and the end
of his reign were marked by civil war

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the very opposite of unity.

00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:53.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’d think it would have been easy

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:56.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Israelites to remain united.

00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:59.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, they came from the same roots;

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:02.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were all children of Abraham;

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:05.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spoke a common language—Hebrew;

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they came
from a similar social background.

00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:11.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their ancestors had all been slaves in Egypt.

00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:16.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there was no basis
for anybody to brag about his heritage.

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:21.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, the Israelites
found reasons to hate one another.

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:24.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel’s first king was from Benjamin.

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:27.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its second king was from Judah.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:31.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was reason enough
to start a war in Israel.

00:01:31.948 --> 00:01:35.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s fast-forward now to the first century.

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:39.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unity is so important
that it was on Jesus’ mind

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the night before he died.

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember that he prayed to his Father

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:46.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his disciples ‘might be one

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:50.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he and the Father are one.’

00:01:50.717 --> 00:01:53.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that could have been a challenge.

00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:57.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
From a human standpoint,

00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:01.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was no reason
for Jesus’ disciples to be united.

00:02:01.103 --> 00:02:03.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the Israelites,

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not have a common ancestor,

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:09.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
they did not have a common mother tongue,

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:12.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they came
from a variety of social backgrounds.

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:17.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of it: The first Christians
were Jews or Jewish proselytes.

00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:21.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up, they were taught
that Gentiles were unclean,

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they wouldn’t even
enter the home of a Gentile,

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:26.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
let alone preach to one.

00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:32.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for Gentile Christians,
they came “from every nation under heaven.”

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of them knew nothing
of the Hebrew language

00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:36.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:39.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d worshipped false gods.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:42.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some had been highly educated at Athens,

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alexandria, or some other
center of worldly wisdom.

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:50.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others had little formal education.

00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:52.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, when they accepted the truth,

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:56.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians became united
and at peace with one another.

00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul wanted to help them

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
to safeguard that bond of peace.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s the theme
of our discussion this morning.

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:08.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to look at his words

00:03:08.797 --> 00:03:13.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Ephesians 4:3-6,

00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:18.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going
to focus in on a particular expression

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:20.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
in these verses.

00:03:20.893 --> 00:03:22.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Ephesians chapter 4.

00:03:22.812 --> 00:03:25.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:27.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians chapter 4

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:30.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 3-6.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:36.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul is interested in unity here,

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:40.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
so let’s see how he frames his discussion.

00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:43.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Earnestly endeavoring

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so an effort is involved,
earnestly endeavoring]

00:03:48.213 --> 00:03:51.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to maintain the oneness of the spirit

00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:55.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the uniting bond of peace.

00:03:55.512 --> 00:03:58.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One body there is, and one spirit,

00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:01.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you were called
to the one hope of your calling;

00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:06.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and then he emphasizes]
one Lord, one faith,

00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:09.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one baptism; one God

00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:12.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Father of all.”

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:15.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s go back to verse 3
and look at the expression

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the uniting bond of peace.”

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:24.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our discussion
is “Safeguard Our ‘Uniting Bond of Peace’!”

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:27.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>Study Bible</i>
has an interesting note on that expression.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us that the word
translated “uniting bond”

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:37.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be translated “ligament”
—ligament.

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:41.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is translated
“ligament” in other verses.

00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:43.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know what a ligament is.

00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:48.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a band of strong tissue
that holds our bones together.

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:52.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we talk
about the uniting bond of peace,

00:04:52.487 --> 00:04:55.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
we mean that peace is the ligament.

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:59.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the tissue
that holds God’s people together.

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:04.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was true in the first century
and is true today.

00:05:04.457 --> 00:05:06.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the early Christians,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
we come from different backgrounds;

00:05:08.837 --> 00:05:10.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
we speak different languages.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Jehovah has shown us
how to remain united

00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:17.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at peace.

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:21.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s explain
what we mean by being united.

00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:25.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be united doesn’t mean
that we all have to like the same things

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we all have
to think the same on every subject.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s room
for a variety of tastes and opinions.

00:05:32.236 --> 00:05:34.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s variety on this convention program.

00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:37.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t all wear the same style of suit

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
or have the same color of tie.

00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:43.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your favorite color?

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:49.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
your favorite food?

00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:51.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
your favorite pet?

00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:55.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jehovah’s organization,
there are dog lovers and cat lovers.

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:59.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not everyone
likes the same breed of dog or cat.

00:05:59.597 --> 00:06:01.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever visited someone

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has a pet
that he thinks is just adorable?

00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:06.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take one look at the animal,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you wonder
how anyone could love a face like that.

00:06:09.608 --> 00:06:11.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he does.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are different,
and their pets are grateful for that.

00:06:18.492 --> 00:06:21.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
The variety we find among God’s people today

00:06:21.245 --> 00:06:23.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue on into the new world.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves variety.

00:06:25.874 --> 00:06:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many colors are there?

00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:32.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many species of plants,
birds, and animals are there?

00:06:32.423 --> 00:06:36.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among God’s creation,
we find the simple and the complex,

00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:41.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
the plain and the fancy,
the sweet and the sour,

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rough and the smooth.

00:06:44.393 --> 00:06:46.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s great variety among people.

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the new world,

00:06:48.523 --> 00:06:51.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
perfect humans won’t have
the same personality,

00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:54.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
talents, and abilities.

00:06:54.153 --> 00:06:56.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve always wanted to play the violin?

00:06:56.614 --> 00:06:58.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t think that when you’re perfect,

00:06:58.616 --> 00:07:01.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll just be able
to pick up a violin and play.

00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:05.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s no guarantee
you’ll be able to play in our orchestra.

00:07:07.584 --> 00:07:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one way to maintain unity

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to respect the conscience of others.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is very important

00:07:15.342 --> 00:07:18.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
because very often when unity is disturbed,

00:07:18.178 --> 00:07:20.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s because we don’t respect

00:07:20.764 --> 00:07:22.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ability of other brothers and sisters

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:24.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
to decide things for themselves.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we mean by the conscience?

00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:30.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s be simple.

00:07:30.065 --> 00:07:32.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the faculty

00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps us determine right from wrong.

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:37.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conscience is the faculty

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:44.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
to determine right from wrong.

00:07:44.371 --> 00:07:48.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s consider
how our upbringing and our culture

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:52.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help shape
our personal view of right and wrong.

00:07:53.798 --> 00:07:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cultures, there are large families.

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Conversation around the dinner table is loud.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can hardly hear yourself think.

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:03.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
The children tease one another

00:08:03.975 --> 00:08:07.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and don’t hesitate
to ask each other personal questions.

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:10.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
The girls borrow each other’s clothes,

00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:13.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes without asking.

00:08:13.443 --> 00:08:15.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people would say that’s wrong,

00:08:15.445 --> 00:08:17.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the girls see nothing wrong with it,

00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:19.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and neither do their parents.

00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:24.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other cultures, family members
are polite and courteous,

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:28.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they don’t talk much
about their plans or their feelings.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:32.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parents don’t often talk about their past

00:08:32.087 --> 00:08:35.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they value their privacy.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some who were raised that way

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:41.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
tend to be rather strict
with themselves and others.

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:45.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have definite views of right and wrong.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:47.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Borrow their clothes without asking

00:08:47.144 --> 00:08:49.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ll say: “That’s stealing.

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m calling the elders.”

00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:55.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no gray areas with them.

00:08:55.361 --> 00:08:57.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are lots of exceptions,

00:08:57.363 --> 00:09:00.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re not saying that everyone
in a certain culture fits the bill.

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:03.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you get the idea.

00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:05.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do you suppose happens

00:09:05.872 --> 00:09:07.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a publisher from one culture

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:12.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
moves into a congregation
where the other culture predominates?

00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:14.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he doesn’t adjust
his way of viewing others,

00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll be miserable.

00:09:16.883 --> 00:09:18.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is one way right and the other wrong?

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:09:20.553 --> 00:09:25.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Members of both cultures
could learn from one another.

00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:28.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of culture, we might ask ourselves,

00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:30.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How do I feel about brothers and sisters

00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
who come from cultures
that are very different from my own?’

00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:36.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may speak with an accent.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their style of dress may be different.

00:09:39.531 --> 00:09:43.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their manners and food
may not be what we’re used to.

00:09:43.827 --> 00:09:46.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose that an elder
is younger than we are

00:09:46.497 --> 00:09:48.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
or from a different race.

00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:51.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we accept his counsel?

00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:54.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we ask him for counsel?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or will we look for an elder who’s older

00:09:57.383 --> 00:10:00.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from a similar background?

00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:02.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we celebrate our differences,

00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:06.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
or will we allow them to disturb our unity?

00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:08.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s one thing.

00:10:08.978 --> 00:10:11.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s talk about our personal history.

00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:16.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our personal history
can also affect our view of right and wrong.

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:21.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some grew up in a household
where alcohol was a problem.

00:10:21.574 --> 00:10:24.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Home was not a happy place.

00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:29.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as adults, they stay
as far away from alcohol as they can,

00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:32.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they take a dim view
of anyone who uses it,

00:10:32.752 --> 00:10:34.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in moderation.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it’s just plain wrong to drink.

00:10:39.885 --> 00:10:42.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others have only good memories
of their childhood home.

00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:45.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
At supper time,
there was always wine on the table,

00:10:45.849 --> 00:10:47.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
but nobody ever abused it.

00:10:49.895 --> 00:10:52.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person who left behind an immoral lifestyle

00:10:52.773 --> 00:10:56.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be extremely sensitive
about choices of clothing.

00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:58.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may be troubled by a clothing style

00:10:58.821 --> 00:11:02.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
that other brothers and sisters
find totally acceptable.

00:11:02.783 --> 00:11:04.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they’re not careful,

00:11:04.869 --> 00:11:07.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who tend to be strict with themselves

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
could impose their conscience on others.

00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:14.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider a familiar scenario.

00:11:14.128 --> 00:11:18.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four publishers
are working rural territory in a car group.

00:11:18.257 --> 00:11:20.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, each home is separated from the next

00:11:20.969 --> 00:11:23.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
by many miles or kilometers.

00:11:23.638 --> 00:11:25.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the first call, the driver

00:11:25.765 --> 00:11:28.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her companion get out
and the other sisters stay in the car.

00:11:28.852 --> 00:11:31.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have no choice.
There’s no place to go.

00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:34.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the householder has many questions,

00:11:34.232 --> 00:11:36.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a Bible study has started.

00:11:36.943 --> 00:11:40.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s noon when the two publishers
return to the car

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:42.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all smiles.

00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:45.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what’s coming next, don’t you?

00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:49.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the sisters in the back seat says,

00:11:49.247 --> 00:11:53.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, the two of us
can’t count any time this morning.”

00:11:53.168 --> 00:11:55.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s she done?

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s spoken for herself
and for her companion.

00:11:58.632 --> 00:12:03.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
And unintentionally, she’s imposed
her own conscience on her friend.

00:12:03.637 --> 00:12:06.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if she doesn’t want
to count any time, that’s her business.

00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:10.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be best
if she kept her business to herself.

00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:15.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve ever visited a foreign country
and gone on a guided tour,

00:12:15.816 --> 00:12:18.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
probably one of the things
the tour guide wanted to show you

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:21.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the architecture inside a church.

00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:24.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some brothers
have no problem entering a church

00:12:24.158 --> 00:12:28.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it’s part of a tour because to them
it’s no different from visiting a museum.

00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:32.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others who were
strong supporters of false religion

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:35.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
couldn’t enter a church for any reason,

00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:38.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even to attend a wedding or a funeral.

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:42.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it’s just plain wrong.

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:45.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consciences can differ in this respect,

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:47.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to respect that;
we have to acknowledge that.

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:51.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to expand
on that idea in a moment.

00:12:51.853 --> 00:12:54.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve hardly scratched the surface

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:57.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to describing
the variety of personalities

00:12:57.734 --> 00:13:01.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewpoints in Jehovah’s organization.

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the question:

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:07.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we maintain our unity?

00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:08.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what Paul said?

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:12.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Earnestly endeavoring to maintain”

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
—maintain this perfect bond of unity.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:20.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that we have to put forth effort

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:23.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain that unity.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
it’ll help a lot to get well-acquainted

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:29.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
with brothers and sisters
who think differently from us.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get to know their background.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll help you not to overreact

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:37.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they take a position
that you don’t agree with.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll help us not to judge them.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul wrote very plainly on that subject

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:46.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the words found at Romans 14:4

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
—simple statement but very powerful.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:54.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s check it out together
at Romans chapter 14

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:56.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
(I’ll give you a moment)

00:13:56.837 --> 00:13:58.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 4.

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:03.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul writes: “Who are you

00:14:03.886 --> 00:14:07.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to judge the servant of another?

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:10.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To his own master he stands or falls.

00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:13.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Indeed, he will be made to stand,

00:14:13.437 --> 00:14:17.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah can make him stand.”

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:20.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s go back
and look at that first sentence again:

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who are you to judge

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:26.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
the servant of another?”

00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:28.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know what a judge does.

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:31.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
He declares someone guilty or not guilty.

00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:33.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not our job.

00:14:33.583 --> 00:14:36.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Judge.

00:14:36.294 --> 00:14:40.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
If each of us concentrates
on his own thinking and his own conscience,

00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:45.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace and unity
of the congregation will be preserved.

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:49.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we all want to be balanced

00:14:49.057 --> 00:14:52.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we determine
what is right and what is wrong.

00:14:52.477 --> 00:14:55.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to have a balanced view of things
—a good conscience.

00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:58.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we be balanced

00:14:58.525 --> 00:15:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
when determining
whether something is right or wrong?

00:15:02.529 --> 00:15:05.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in some cases, it’s easy;
the Bible tells us.

00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:09.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in other cases, there’s no clear answer.

00:15:09.077 --> 00:15:11.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a scenario
we touched on earlier

00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:14.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the matter of entering a church.

00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:17.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that may not be
a problem where you live,

00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:20.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in some places, it’s a real issue.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, these talks
are for our worldwide brotherhood.

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:26.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to consider a subject

00:15:26.095 --> 00:15:29.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be a real problem
for many to overcome,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hope that they will benefit from it.

00:15:31.976 --> 00:15:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the scenario:

00:15:34.103 --> 00:15:38.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two different sisters are married
to men who are not in the truth.

00:15:38.191 --> 00:15:42.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in both cases,
the husband’s mother has died.

00:15:42.737 --> 00:15:45.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
The funeral will be in a church.

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:47.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister decides to go;

00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other decides against it.

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister who decides to attend

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:55.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
has considered that in that church,

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:58.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will just be a talk by a clergyman.

00:15:58.336 --> 00:16:00.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no congregation singing,

00:16:00.505 --> 00:16:03.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
congregation prayers, or religious gestures.

00:16:03.758 --> 00:16:05.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was never very religious anyway,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
so none of that would mean anything to her.

00:16:07.888 --> 00:16:10.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
And her husband and his family will be happy

00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:14.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
if she just sits quietly until it’s over.

00:16:16.063 --> 00:16:19.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second sister
has a different set of circumstances.

00:16:19.483 --> 00:16:24.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
The service in that church
involves participation by the congregation.

00:16:24.196 --> 00:16:26.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
She used to be
an active member of that church,

00:16:26.865 --> 00:16:30.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s afraid
she’ll do something she’ll regret.

00:16:30.744 --> 00:16:34.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her husband’s family
get very emotional at funerals,

00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:38.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re likely to make a scene
if she doesn’t participate.

00:16:38.085 --> 00:16:42.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she respectfully tells her husband
that her attendance

00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:46.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
could cause him embarrassment
and declines to attend.

00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:51.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see that each situation is different.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:56.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to discuss four questions
that we might ask ourselves

00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re called upon
to make any difficult decision.

00:16:59.774 --> 00:17:03.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will repeat the question

00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:05.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if you’re taking notes,

00:17:05.488 --> 00:17:08.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may want to at least
write the question down.

00:17:08.116 --> 00:17:11.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are very, very good questions
that we can ask ourselves

00:17:11.745 --> 00:17:14.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we make a difficult decision.

00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:15.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:17:15.207 --> 00:17:17.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s number one:

00:17:17.209 --> 00:17:21.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will make Jehovah happy?

00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:23.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll repeat that.

00:17:23.966 --> 00:17:28.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will make Jehovah happy?

00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:33.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that should be our main concern,
to please Jehovah.

00:17:33.142 --> 00:17:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how do we know
what will make Jehovah happy?

00:17:36.187 --> 00:17:40.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
We identify the Bible principles
that have a bearing on the situation.

00:17:40.274 --> 00:17:42.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way we can do that

00:17:42.276 --> 00:17:46.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by checking the <i>Index</i>
or the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:48.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some Scriptural principles

00:17:48.366 --> 00:17:51.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sister who’s married to an unbeliever
might consider when deciding

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:55.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether to attend a funeral in a church?

00:17:55.123 --> 00:17:57.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of some?

00:17:57.125 --> 00:18:00.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about 1 Peter 3:1?

00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:03.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wives, be in subjection to your husbands.”

00:18:03.423 --> 00:18:07.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is pleased when
a Christian woman respects her husband,

00:18:07.093 --> 00:18:09.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether he’s in the truth or not.

00:18:09.471 --> 00:18:13.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a wife’s subjection is relative.

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:16.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s dedicated to Jehovah,

00:18:16.812 --> 00:18:19.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to her husband.

00:18:19.606 --> 00:18:22.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s dedicated to Jehovah,

00:18:22.484 --> 00:18:25.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to her husband.

00:18:25.487 --> 00:18:28.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s 1 Peter 3:1.

00:18:28.031 --> 00:18:31.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Isaiah 52:11?

00:18:31.952 --> 00:18:34.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Touch nothing unclean! . . .

00:18:34.496 --> 00:18:37.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep yourselves clean.”

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under the Mosaic Law,

00:18:39.668 --> 00:18:42.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
if someone so much as
touched something unclean,

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:45.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
he became unclean.

00:18:45.382 --> 00:18:49.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers and sisters
would find it very hard to sit quietly

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:52.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
while a clergyman told lies
about the condition of the dead.

00:18:52.682 --> 00:18:57.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it would be
touching something unclean.

00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:00.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others might compare that
to a young person in school

00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:05.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
sitting quietly while his teacher
tells lies about the origin of life.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:10.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
If someone does decide
to attend a funeral in a church,

00:19:10.658 --> 00:19:13.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
he or she should be absolutely determined

00:19:13.745 --> 00:19:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to participate in any religious ritual,

00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:20.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether singing hymns
or so much as saying “amen”

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a prayer that the clergyman offers.

00:19:23.046 --> 00:19:27.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the goal is to please Jehovah.

00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:29.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the first point was,

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:32.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes Jehovah happy?

00:19:32.723 --> 00:19:35.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number two—number two:

00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:39.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
How might my choice affect others?

00:19:40.731 --> 00:19:42.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you got that?

00:19:42.733 --> 00:19:45.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
How might my choice

00:19:45.569 --> 00:19:48.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
affect others?

00:19:48.823 --> 00:19:51.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want to stumble anyone.

00:19:51.117 --> 00:19:53.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in a family matter,

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:55.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as attending a wedding
or a funeral in a church

00:19:55.997 --> 00:19:58.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
(which we may consider as a personal matter),

00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:01.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to weigh the effect our decision

00:20:01.377 --> 00:20:04.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have on others.

00:20:04.338 --> 00:20:07.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could affect them in one of two ways.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the first is the obvious way.

00:20:09.677 --> 00:20:13.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some areas, if a Witness
even entered a church,

00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:17.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
his brothers and sisters
would lose respect for him.

00:20:17.102 --> 00:20:20.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a second way
the Witness could stumble someone.

00:20:20.772 --> 00:20:24.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He might be able to attend the funeral
and make no compromise.

00:20:24.943 --> 00:20:26.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suppose a new brother decided

00:20:26.987 --> 00:20:30.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to follow his example
when a family member died.

00:20:30.157 --> 00:20:32.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new brother could give in
to family pressure

00:20:32.743 --> 00:20:35.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and participate in idolatry.

00:20:35.412 --> 00:20:38.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
How tragic is that!

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul never worshipped idols.

00:20:41.043 --> 00:20:45.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when meat that had been offered to an idol
went up for sale in a meat market,

00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:48.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
it probably didn’t bother
Paul’s conscience to buy it

00:20:48.717 --> 00:20:51.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he knew that an idol is nothing.

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:54.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some of his brothers had worshipped

00:20:54.765 --> 00:20:58.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
those very idols
before coming into the truth.

00:20:58.144 --> 00:21:00.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could have felt guilty
about eating that meat.

00:21:00.855 --> 00:21:05.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, it would be
like having a communion meal with an idol.

00:21:07.528 --> 00:21:11.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
The feelings of his brothers
were important to Paul.

00:21:11.282 --> 00:21:14.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was willing to sacrifice his own rights

00:21:14.327 --> 00:21:17.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the sake of his brothers.

00:21:17.205 --> 00:21:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d never want to take the unloving view

00:21:19.415 --> 00:21:22.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if our brother
is stumbled by what we do,

00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:24.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s too bad for him.

00:21:24.504 --> 00:21:26.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:31.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re the type of person
who is often stumbled by what others do,

00:21:31.261 --> 00:21:35.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to ask Jehovah
to help us gain a more balanced viewpoint.

00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:41.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far, we’ve discussed
the need to make Jehovah happy

00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:43.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to consider the feelings of our brothers.

00:21:43.899 --> 00:21:45.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s next?

00:21:45.526 --> 00:21:50.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number three: Have I asked for counsel?

00:21:51.156 --> 00:21:53.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got that?

00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:57.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have I asked for counsel?

00:21:57.037 --> 00:22:01.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe the elders haven’t dealt
with the exact situation we’re facing,

00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:03.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they know a lot of people.

00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:06.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may know someone
who has dealt with the situation before

00:22:06.797 --> 00:22:08.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saw how he handled it.

00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:12.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or they may know about the effect
the decision had on others.

00:22:12.553 --> 00:22:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, they might know
how the congregation reacted

00:22:15.932 --> 00:22:19.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last time someone attended a wedding

00:22:19.352 --> 00:22:21.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a funeral in a church.

00:22:23.523 --> 00:22:27.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another situation where brothers often ask
for the help of the elders

00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:30.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves the use of blood fractions.

00:22:30.989 --> 00:22:34.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we accept them or not?

00:22:34.242 --> 00:22:38.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has refused
to impose its conscience on the brotherhood.

00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:40.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do we know?

00:22:40.332 --> 00:22:45.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that the Bible says
to “abstain . . . from blood.”

00:22:45.003 --> 00:22:48.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as you divide it into fractions

00:22:48.048 --> 00:22:51.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fractions get tinier and tinier,

00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:56.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
at what point does blood stop being blood?

00:22:56.056 --> 00:22:58.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one will have to decide that
for himself.

00:22:58.851 --> 00:23:00.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some might say,

00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:03.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, if it’s a really,
really tiny fraction,

00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:04.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t bother me to take it.”

00:23:04.607 --> 00:23:07.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
But others will say:
“It doesn’t matter to me.

00:23:07.193 --> 00:23:10.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s from blood, I don’t want it.”

00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:15.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their conscience
also has to be respected.

00:23:15.034 --> 00:23:17.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s illustrate:

00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:20.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Air is made up of nitrogen

00:23:20.581 --> 00:23:22.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and oxygen,

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:27.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
and together they make up 99 percent of air.

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:30.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
That leaves 1 percent.

00:23:30.466 --> 00:23:34.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 1 percent is made up
of a variety of gases:

00:23:34.012 --> 00:23:37.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
carbon dioxide, hydrogen, neon

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:41.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
—small fractions.

00:23:41.102 --> 00:23:43.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to small fractions,

00:23:43.146 --> 00:23:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders need to be careful, though,

00:23:45.148 --> 00:23:48.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to insert their personal opinion
into the discussion,

00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:51.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as by saying
“I wouldn’t take any of it.”

00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:56.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should simply help the publisher
to reason on the basic principles

00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:58.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let him make up his own mind.

00:23:58.745 --> 00:24:00.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So where are we?

00:24:00.998 --> 00:24:02.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
We make Jehovah happy.

00:24:02.624 --> 00:24:05.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
We consider the feelings
of our brothers and sisters.

00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
We ask for counsel.

00:24:08.172 --> 00:24:10.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number four:

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:13.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I take the time

00:24:14.512 --> 00:24:17.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
—did I take the time—

00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meditate prayerfully
before making my decision?

00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:26.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I take the time to meditate prayerfully

00:24:26.983 --> 00:24:29.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
before making my decision?

00:24:29.777 --> 00:24:32.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your goal is to make Jehovah happy.

00:24:32.989 --> 00:24:35.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you wouldn’t want
to make your decision hastily

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then ask Jehovah to bless it.

00:24:37.535 --> 00:24:40.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should ask Jehovah for guidance first

00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:43.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than asking him to bless a decision

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:45.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve already made.

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:47.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever heard someone say,

00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:50.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That doesn’t bother my conscience”?

00:24:50.674 --> 00:24:55.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might ask:
‘How did he come to that conclusion?

00:24:55.345 --> 00:24:58.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he follow the four steps
we just mentioned?

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he do research to learn
what makes Jehovah happy?

00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:05.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he think
about how others might be affected?

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:07.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Did he ask for counsel?

00:25:07.649 --> 00:25:11.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And did he meditate prayerfully
on his decision?

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is he just following his feelings?’

00:25:15.991 --> 00:25:19.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following your feelings isn’t the same

00:25:19.078 --> 00:25:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
as following a Bible-trained conscience.

00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:24.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:28.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following your feelings is not the same

00:25:28.004 --> 00:25:32.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
as following a Bible-trained conscience.

00:25:32.592 --> 00:25:34.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our conscience needs to be trained

00:25:34.927 --> 00:25:37.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with Scriptural principles.

00:25:37.513 --> 00:25:40.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul’s conscience
didn’t bother him a bit

00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:42.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was persecuting Christians.

00:25:42.477 --> 00:25:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
He thought he was doing Jehovah a favor.

00:25:45.188 --> 00:25:47.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when he realized
how Jehovah felt about it,

00:25:47.941 --> 00:25:50.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knew he had to change.

00:25:50.402 --> 00:25:55.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to be sure that we’re really getting
Jehovah’s thinking on matters.

00:25:55.282 --> 00:25:58.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jeremiah 17:9

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:04.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
—simple expression but so true.

00:26:04.708 --> 00:26:09.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 17

00:26:09.087 --> 00:26:11.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 9 says:

00:26:13.717 --> 00:26:16.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The heart is more treacherous

00:26:16.804 --> 00:26:20.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“than anything else and is desperate.

00:26:20.432 --> 00:26:22.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who can know it?”

00:26:24.436 --> 00:26:28.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The heart is treacherous.’

00:26:28.315 --> 00:26:31.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might allow our emotions
to get the better of us.

00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:35.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when a family member
is disfellowshipped,

00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:37.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the person is living outside the home,

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:39.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that we should limit our association

00:26:39.076 --> 00:26:42.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
to necessary family business.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if the family was never very close,
that might not be a problem.

00:26:46.417 --> 00:26:50.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suppose family ties are really strong;

00:26:50.338 --> 00:26:52.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can be a challenge.

00:26:52.632 --> 00:26:55.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we allow ourselves to be ruled by emotion

00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:58.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than by Scriptural principles,

00:26:58.388 --> 00:27:02.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could stretch the meaning
of necessary family business

00:27:02.183 --> 00:27:05.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to include almost any activity.

00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:08.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
The heart is treacherous.

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asking ourselves
the four questions we just mentioned

00:27:12.945 --> 00:27:16.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to make decisions
based on godly principles

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:21.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than simply relying on our feelings.

00:27:21.245 --> 00:27:24.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s see how mature Christians

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
can apply these principles
and how the elders can help.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video interviews

00:27:31.547 --> 00:27:34.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
are about weddings and funerals

00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:38.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a touchy subject
in many cultures, as you will see.

00:27:43.476 --> 00:27:45.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Japan,

00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:49.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
religious rituals are associated
with each stage of life

00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:51.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with each season of the year.

00:27:52.652 --> 00:27:54.654 line:10% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:27:54.654 --> 00:27:57.407 line:10% position:50% align:center
we want to keep the cleanliness and unity

00:27:57.407 --> 00:28:00.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the congregation.

00:28:00.076 --> 00:28:03.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard,
one of the most delicate areas

00:28:03.496 --> 00:28:08.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the decision on whether to attend
a non-Witness funeral or not.

00:28:10.462 --> 00:28:14.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first thing we must consider
regarding funerals is not to be involved

00:28:14.674 --> 00:28:18.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
in religious rituals and acts of worship
that are condemned by the Bible.

00:28:21.098 --> 00:28:22.349 line:10% position:50% align:center
In harmony with the principle

00:28:22.349 --> 00:28:25.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
at 2 Corinthians 6:14,

00:28:25.727 --> 00:28:27.896 line:10% position:50% align:center
we need to keep completely separate

00:28:27.896 --> 00:28:29.940 line:10% position:50% align:center
from pagan acts of worship.

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:36.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, even if we don’t participate
in the worship of other religions,

00:28:36.489 --> 00:28:41.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to consider if our decisions
could stumble someone in the congregation.

00:28:43.245 --> 00:28:45.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we consider the Bible principle

00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.167 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Luke 17:2,

00:28:48.167 --> 00:28:50.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
we do not want our decisions to hinder

00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:52.713 line:10% position:50% align:center
the faith of someone in the congregation.

00:28:57.385 --> 00:29:00.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third point to think about
is our conscience.

00:29:02.348 --> 00:29:05.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to seriously think
about the Bible principle

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:09.147 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Galatians 6:5, where it says

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:12.025 line:10% position:50% align:center
that each must “carry his own load.”

00:29:13.276 --> 00:29:14.945 line:10% position:50% align:center
This Bible principle

00:29:14.945 --> 00:29:17.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
also applies when elders
want to support others.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, those in the congregation
can ask the elders for support

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
in issues related to funerals.

00:29:27.249 --> 00:29:29.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in matters of conscience,

00:29:29.376 --> 00:29:32.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders cannot force decisions on others.

00:29:34.423 --> 00:29:37.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it would be wrong
to make some kind of rule

00:29:37.217 --> 00:29:39.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding attending non-Witness funerals.

00:29:41.222 --> 00:29:42.890 line:10% position:50% align:center
If each person can make

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
decisions based on Bible principles,

00:29:45.476 --> 00:29:47.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can have a truly peaceful

00:29:47.478 --> 00:29:49.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
and free atmosphere

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
where each individual’s differing situation

00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:54.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
is respected.

00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:59.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
This would really contribute
to the unity of the congregation.

00:29:59.365 --> 00:30:02.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all can maintain a clean conscience

00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:04.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve happily before Jehovah.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my culture,

00:30:09.334 --> 00:30:12.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
specifically the Namibian Oshiwambo
culture,

00:30:12.212 --> 00:30:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
like in many African cultures,

00:30:14.631 --> 00:30:18.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many spiritistic customs
related to weddings

00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:21.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are included in wedding celebrations.

00:30:21.721 --> 00:30:24.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth.

00:30:24.015 --> 00:30:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, for Ben and I,

00:30:25.434 --> 00:30:28.311 line:10% position:50% align:center
that was one of the main concerns.

00:30:28.311 --> 00:30:30.981 line:10% position:50% align:center
They don’t understand our worship of Jehovah,

00:30:30.981 --> 00:30:33.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they don’t understand
that we apply Bible principles

00:30:33.525 --> 00:30:35.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the traditions of men.

00:30:35.569 --> 00:30:38.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got engaged before the pandemic,

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
but obviously, now that our wedding
was to be over videoconferencing,

00:30:41.742 --> 00:30:44.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
it meant that we didn’t have control
over many things.

00:30:44.828 --> 00:30:47.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to imagine situations

00:30:47.206 --> 00:30:49.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could stumble our brothers or disrupt

00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:51.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unity in the congregation.

00:30:53.796 --> 00:30:55.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to, in advance,

00:30:55.923 --> 00:30:58.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
think of Bible principles
that would apply in our case,

00:30:58.759 --> 00:31:03.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
but particularly what we also found helpful
was speaking to a mature elder.

00:31:03.347 --> 00:31:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave us a principle at Proverbs 14:15.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told us to be very careful
when people say,

00:31:11.773 --> 00:31:15.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will do this” or “I won’t do this”
at your wedding.

00:31:15.652 --> 00:31:19.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, it was up to us to make sure
that the proceedings

00:31:19.614 --> 00:31:21.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
or things that happen at our wedding

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be in order and in harmony
with Bible principles.

00:31:25.412 --> 00:31:27.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another principle that came to mind was

00:31:27.664 --> 00:31:31.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Corinthians 10:23.

00:31:31.084 --> 00:31:35.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, we knew
that we had the right to do many things,

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were also very conscious

00:31:37.174 --> 00:31:40.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how our brothers would view our wedding.

00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:44.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want anybody to be at our wedding
and feel embarrassed

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even stumbled to be there.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now looking back at our wedding,

00:31:50.688 --> 00:31:53.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
we look back with fond memories.

00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:58.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
So applying Bible principles
didn’t restrict our fun.

00:32:00.573 --> 00:32:03.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, it contributed to the unity
among our brothers

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all of us
—those present, those who were invited—

00:32:05.912 --> 00:32:08.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to enjoy the wedding.

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:11.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not worried about thinking,
‘Oh, did that thing offend anybody?’

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re able to enjoy the day
without any bad memories.

00:32:21.344 --> 00:32:24.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see,
our brothers in many countries

00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:26.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
are faced with very difficult decisions

00:32:26.975 --> 00:32:29.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
where weddings and funerals are concerned.

00:32:29.728 --> 00:32:34.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
The guidance the elders
can provide is invaluable.

00:32:34.733 --> 00:32:36.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes medical doctors

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
complain that their Witness patients
are inconsistent

00:32:40.072 --> 00:32:44.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they don’t all have the same view
of certain medical treatments.

00:32:44.201 --> 00:32:47.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Witness patient
accepts certain fractions or therapies,

00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:51.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the doctor figures he knows
what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe.

00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:54.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the next patient comes along,

00:32:54.253 --> 00:32:56.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he rejects them all.

00:32:56.463 --> 00:32:59.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctor is confused.

00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:02.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those doctors don’t understand
the role of the conscience.

00:33:02.678 --> 00:33:05.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
We shouldn’t worry
when medical professionals

00:33:05.139 --> 00:33:07.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t understand our differing viewpoints,

00:33:07.141 --> 00:33:09.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we should be glad
that we serve a God

00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
who dignifies us
with the freedom to make many

00:33:13.022 --> 00:33:15.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our own decisions.

00:33:16.818 --> 00:33:19.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the apostle Paul
mentioned four qualities

00:33:19.445 --> 00:33:22.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to maintain
the uniting bond of peace.

00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:24.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to find those qualities

00:33:24.993 --> 00:33:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ephesians chapter 4,

00:33:27.036 --> 00:33:30.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to zero in on verse 2.

00:33:30.623 --> 00:33:34.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to Ephesians chapter 4,

00:33:34.336 --> 00:33:36.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to look at verse 2.

00:33:36.421 --> 00:33:39.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we read verses 3-6 earlier,

00:33:39.466 --> 00:33:42.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you know that Paul
was concerned about unity.

00:33:42.135 --> 00:33:44.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unity is what he had on his mind,

00:33:44.388 --> 00:33:47.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now he is telling us
that these four qualities

00:33:47.808 --> 00:33:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
are going to help us to maintain our unity.

00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:53.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Earnestly endeavoring”

00:33:53.397 --> 00:33:55.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
—remember when he said
“earnestly endeavoring

00:33:55.983 --> 00:33:59.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain the oneness of the spirit”?

00:33:59.069 --> 00:34:03.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the work that we need
to put into promoting unity.

00:34:03.449 --> 00:34:05.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 2 says:

00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:10.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With all humility and mildness,

00:34:10.456 --> 00:34:13.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with patience,

00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:17.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting up with one another in love.”

00:34:17.296 --> 00:34:19.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:34:19.006 --> 00:34:23.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice the qualities:
humility, mildness,

00:34:23.636 --> 00:34:26.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
patience, and love?

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re humble,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
we recognize that our opinion
isn’t always the right one.

00:34:32.645 --> 00:34:34.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility will also prevent us

00:34:34.689 --> 00:34:37.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
from trying to impose
our conscience on others

00:34:37.317 --> 00:34:42.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if Jehovah had appointed us to judge them.

00:34:42.072 --> 00:34:44.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about mildness?

00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:48.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mildness will help us to think
about the effect our words might have

00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:50.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our brothers and sisters.

00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want to hurt them,

00:34:52.165 --> 00:34:55.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when we strongly disagree with them.

00:34:55.502 --> 00:34:58.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we should give them
the benefit of the doubt.

00:34:58.714 --> 00:35:02.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
If someone says something
that makes you mad,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:05.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
pray before you speak.

00:35:06.388 --> 00:35:10.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray before you speak.

00:35:12.394 --> 00:35:16.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love covers a multitude of sins,”

00:35:16.148 --> 00:35:19.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
which contributes
to the peace of the congregation.

00:35:19.527 --> 00:35:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we deeply appreciate it
when our brothers are patient with us.

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:26.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, we need to be patient with them

00:35:26.576 --> 00:35:31.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re all
at different stages of spiritual growth,

00:35:31.205 --> 00:35:33.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have to acknowledge that.

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:37.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve talked
about making Jehovah happy

00:35:37.545 --> 00:35:39.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our decisions.

00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:41.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also please Jehovah
when we work hard

00:35:41.883 --> 00:35:44.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote peace in the congregation,

00:35:44.803 --> 00:35:47.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes it does take
an earnest endeavor.

00:35:47.681 --> 00:35:50.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we have to work hard

00:35:50.141 --> 00:35:53.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
at ensuring
that the congregation is at peace.

00:35:53.353 --> 00:35:55.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the elders?

00:35:55.105 --> 00:35:59.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders take the lead
in working together in unity.

00:35:59.901 --> 00:36:03.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should always speak with a united voice.

00:36:03.405 --> 00:36:07.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they don’t, their congregation
will sense that they’re divided,

00:36:07.367 --> 00:36:10.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this will make
the brothers and sisters uneasy.

00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:14.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any difference of opinion
should be worked out in private,

00:36:14.416 --> 00:36:18.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
while showing deep respect for one another.

00:36:18.462 --> 00:36:22.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because someone disagrees with us
doesn’t make him a bad person.

00:36:22.883 --> 00:36:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to understand that,

00:36:24.927 --> 00:36:29.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his difference of opinion
may search us through.

00:36:29.223 --> 00:36:32.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be something
that we need to think about and consider.

00:36:32.435 --> 00:36:36.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we always consider
that the other person may be right.

00:36:36.898 --> 00:36:38.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about us publishers?

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re having a hard time
getting along with someone,

00:36:41.903 --> 00:36:44.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than asking Jehovah to change him,

00:36:44.531 --> 00:36:47.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should ask Jehovah to mold us,

00:36:47.117 --> 00:36:49.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the Great Potter he is.

00:36:49.327 --> 00:36:53.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should ask him to show us
why he drew that person to the congregation.

00:36:53.665 --> 00:36:55.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what Jesus said?

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘No one comes to him
unless the Father draws him.’

00:36:59.546 --> 00:37:02.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah see in that person

00:37:02.382 --> 00:37:04.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we aren’t seeing?

00:37:05.844 --> 00:37:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
We each have a responsibility to contribute

00:37:09.056 --> 00:37:12.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the peace and unity of the congregation.

00:37:12.434 --> 00:37:16.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless us
as we work toward that goal.

00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the scene: It’s nighttime.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re in the garden of Gethsemane
with your close friends and beloved Teacher.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, you hear a crowd coming.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:17.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re being led by a man you know,
Judas Iscariot.

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approaches Jesus
and kisses him on the cheek.

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then steps aside
as men move in to arrest Jesus.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your emotions churn inside you.

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your Master and Lord is being arrested
—the Son of God.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can this be happening?

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you do?

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you can even decide what to do,

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter draws his sword

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chops off the ear
of the slave of the high priest.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jesus says to Peter:

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return your sword to its place,

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all those who take up the sword
will perish by the sword.”

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then you watch the unbelievable,

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus heals the man’s ear.

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter must have thought
that it was a great and noble thing

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:10.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fight on behalf of the Son of God.

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus didn’t think so.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
With six words

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“return your sword to its place”—

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus taught his disciples
an important lesson.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not their fight;

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor was it the time to fight.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in this talk,

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:36.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to focus our attention
on an insidious way

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
that any of us, like Peter,

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
can become inadvertently involved
in this world’s conflicts

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
without even realizing it.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will talk about how we
can avoid making that serious mistake.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:54.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s discuss why Jesus
did not ask his Father

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send “12 legions of angels”

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him when being arrested.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to do with Jesus’ name.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please open your Bible
to Isaiah chapter 9,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read verse 6

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Isaiah 9:6.

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know Jesus has many titles,

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in this verse,
we’re going to focus on just one.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 6:

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For a child has been born to us,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a son has been given to us;

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the rulership will rest on his shoulder.

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His name will be called Wonderful Counselor,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mighty God, Eternal Father,

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:45.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prince of Peace.”

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is Jesus called “Prince of Peace”?

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:55.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, consider what Jehovah’s angel
 declared to the shepherds in the field

00:02:55.946 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jesus’ birth at Luke 2:14.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said:
“Glory in the heights above to God,

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:08.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on earth peace among men of goodwill.”

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
How appropriate for the angels to announce

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at the birth
of the destined Prince of Peace,

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
there would be divine peace
for those who have God’s goodwill!

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:22.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when will this become a reality?

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t happen when Jesus was on earth,

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we certainly don’t see peace today.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of peace, what do we see?

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:33.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see the nations that are locked
in hostilities and aggression

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a competition for world dominance.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see global violence and bloodshed.

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
But please don’t lose heart.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:47.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we don’t see peace now
does not mean it’s not coming.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 9:6

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s not just wishful thinking.

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a promise from Almighty God,
and Jehovah cannot lie.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
All his prophecies come true.

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:03.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
let’s read the last portion of verse 7

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Isaiah chapter 9.

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last verse
(the last portion of verse 7) says:

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:13.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.”

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that Jehovah
does nothing in a half-hearted way.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s zealous to bring peace, and he will.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure
that whatever Jehovah promises,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will fully accomplish.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:31.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how will peace come to the earth?

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the Prince of Peace give us a clue?

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he did.

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:39.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the key to everlasting peace

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:43.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
is on the lips of millions of people
throughout the world.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know it by heart.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s read it at Matthew 6:9, 10

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:9.

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful thought for us!

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:01.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is how everlasting peace
is going to come through.

00:05:01.864 --> 00:05:06.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
It depends on the fulfillment
of these verses.

00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:08.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 9:

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must pray, then, this way:
‘Our Father in the heavens,

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:17.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
let your name [the name Jehovah]
be sanctified.’”

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
The emphasis that we place
on the name of God

00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:22.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not merely a matter
of religious knowledge.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:25.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone must know God’s name

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:28.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and treat it as something holy and respected.

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be something sacred.

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must be cleared of all the reproach
that has been heaped upon it.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the well-being
of the entire universe and its inhabitants

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:44.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
depends upon the sanctification
of Jehovah’s name.

00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:48.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at verse 10:

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your Kingdom come.

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:56.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let your will take place,
as in heaven, also on earth.”

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom
—two words but so important.

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:07.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom
is the most powerful government

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:09.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
humanity will ever see.

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:11.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no nation or empire

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:15.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can withstand
the might of God’s Kingdom.

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
And any nation who thinks
they can block the coming of God’s Kingdom

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:25.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like an ant who plants itself firmly
on the railroad track

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:30.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with his hand raised defiantly
shouts to the oncoming locomotive:

00:06:30.202 --> 00:06:32.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop! You can’t run over me.”

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, God’s heavenly government has the power

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:39.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy all present-day violent regimes.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:42.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re like ants to Jehovah.

00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:44.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he will eliminate their ability

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:47.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
to wage war, to foment conflict,
and to shed blood.

00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:50.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yes, Matthew 6:9, 10

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s that valuable and important
for lasting peace.

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:59.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom is the only road
to lasting peace.

00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:02.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in his role as King,

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:07.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 19:15 describes Jesus

00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:11.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
as ‘striking the nations with an iron rod.’

00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:14.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, Jehovah will give
the command to his Son,

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will destroy
all the things that disrupt peace.

00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:23.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gone will be the terror
that we have grown accustomed to living with

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
day in and day out.

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:30.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will happen next?

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:32.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what will happen

00:07:32.723 --> 00:07:35.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 37:10, 11.

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:38.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open our Bibles here
to Psalm 37:10, 11,

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:41.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just allow this prophecy to absorb

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:43.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to thrill our minds and our hearts

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:47.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give us a hope for the future.

00:07:48.488 --> 00:07:51.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10 of Psalm 37:

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:54.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just a little while longer,

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:59.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the wicked will be no more
[a little while longer];

00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:03.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will look at where they were,
and they will not be there.”

00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:05.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just a little while longer.”

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just like children saying
to their parents

00:08:07.257 --> 00:08:09.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
when going on a trip
“Are we there yet?”

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:12.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the parents say
“Just a little while longer.”

00:08:12.554 --> 00:08:16.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings comfort to them,
and it’s the same with us.

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
So imagine that!

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:22.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means you go into the streets,

00:08:22.314 --> 00:08:24.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re looking for a wicked person,

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:26.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will not be able to find even one.

00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wicked will be no more.”

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth.”

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:35.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we’re speaking about in verse 11.

00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that:
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:44.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will find exquisite delight
in the abundance of peace.”

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:47.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love reading that.

00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:49.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Men will be at peace.

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:53.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will be at peace with themselves,
with their neighbors, with their God.

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:54.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that sound to you?

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on that.

00:08:56.765 --> 00:09:00.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see yourself there
in a peaceful new world

00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:02.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the only news to tune into

00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:05.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
is regarding who’s getting resurrected today

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:09.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
or which new person you will be assigned
to teach about Jehovah?

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the joy
of studying with a person,

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:14.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just from a different culture,

00:09:14.282 --> 00:09:16.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
but from a different time period,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing things through their eyes

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:22.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they come to love Jehovah as you do?

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, soon the Prince of Peace

00:09:26.753 --> 00:09:30.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
will turn this world
into one of sheer delight

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:34.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no more borders,
no more threats, no more worries—

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:37.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
just an abundance of peace
with your brothers and sisters.

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to be there?

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:44.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

00:09:44.062 --> 00:09:49.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we show our loyal support
for the Prince of Peace?

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:51.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch the following video,

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice the different ways
we can do this right now.

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am no part of the world.”

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:10.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is the world a part of me?

00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:15.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m pressured every day

00:10:15.594 --> 00:10:19.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get involved in political issues
that affect me socially,

00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:30.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . environmentally,

00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:38.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and economically.

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:50.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
That pressure could rob me
of my peace of mind

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:55.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and influence how I think.

00:10:55.175 --> 00:10:57.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could take sides in my heart,

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:00.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if I’m not aware of it.

00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:10.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know that Jehovah

00:11:10.982 --> 00:11:14.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
will care for all of mankind’s concerns

00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:43.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . by means of his Kingdom

00:11:43.723 --> 00:11:47.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
ruled by his Son, Jesus Christ.

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:54.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
I show my support for him
in my prayers,

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:58.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . in how I think and feel,

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:10.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . and by teaching others

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the Kingdom will do for mankind.

00:12:13.378 --> 00:12:15.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know there are millions

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:18.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
of brothers and sisters
all over the world

00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:22.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . who loyally support
the “Prince of Peace”

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like me, because I

00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:27.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I

00:12:28.727 --> 00:12:32.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I am no part of the world.

00:12:37.444 --> 00:12:40.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what takes away the peace
in the country where you live?

00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:44.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your community?
in your town? in your society?

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:48.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most likely,
it’s the hot-button social issues.

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:51.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
how our two brothers and sister

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:54.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed their loyal support
for the Prince of Peace?

00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
What issues affected them?

00:12:56.379 --> 00:13:01.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfair tax hikes, blatant injustice,
a disregard of the environment

00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:06.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all things in themselves seemed
like noble causes worthy to get involved.

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:08.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can they get away with this?

00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not right.
We should do something.’

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:13.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound familiar?

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:16.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not have a literal sword in our hand,

00:13:16.524 --> 00:13:19.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we all have our Peterlike moments.

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re not careful,
issues that are close to our heart

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:27.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
can charge our emotions
and we can lose our spiritual balance.

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:31.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us
when we see things that are wrong?

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:34.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what the Prince of Peace
said to Peter

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that highly charged moment:

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return your sword to its place.”

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, this is not your fight.

00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:46.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we do?

00:13:46.054 --> 00:13:48.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do something far better than fight.

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
We preach.

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:53.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each time that we share the Kingdom news,

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:56.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
we proclaim our support for Jesus’ rule.

00:13:56.898 --> 00:13:59.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the thing:

00:13:59.317 --> 00:14:02.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we truly believe
in the good news of the Kingdom,

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:07.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not do anything
that hinders our ability to tell it.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once again, it’s so important

00:14:09.828 --> 00:14:13.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if we truly believe
in the good news of the Kingdom,

00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:18.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not do anything
that hinders our ability to tell it.

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:19.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:21.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s find out.

00:14:21.256 --> 00:14:23.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open up to Peter’s words himself

00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:27.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 2:12

00:14:29.723 --> 00:14:32.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Peter 2:12.

00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:35.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter helps us here with why we need

00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:39.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain our conduct properly.

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:12:

00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:44.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maintain your conduct fine
among the nations,

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:47.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that when they accuse you
of being wrongdoers,

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:50.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they may be eyewitnesses
of your fine works

00:14:50.744 --> 00:14:55.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as a result,
glorify God in the day of his inspection.”

00:14:56.499 --> 00:14:59.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Peter had to learn this.

00:14:59.002 --> 00:15:01.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do we see the connection?

00:15:01.337 --> 00:15:05.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our actions and words
are directly linked to Jehovah.

00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:10.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
When people see us,
they see a people that worships Jehovah.

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:14.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when people hear us,
they hear a people that worships Jehovah.

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:19.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how our freeness of speech
to speak about God’s Kingdom

00:15:19.397 --> 00:15:24.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be hindered if we were to voice
a position for a political issue!

00:15:24.402 --> 00:15:26.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it can happen so easily.

00:15:26.654 --> 00:15:31.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can happen at work, at school,
with relatives, and so forth.

00:15:31.075 --> 00:15:33.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan sets the trap masterfully.

00:15:33.912 --> 00:15:35.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s just waiting.

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:39.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he could only make us
“chop off the ear” of anything in this world

00:15:39.793 --> 00:15:43.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
that causes hurt and indignation in our heart

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:47.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if he can hook our heartstrings
by getting us emotionally charged,

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:51.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
he can then step back and reel us in.

00:15:51.304 --> 00:15:54.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new world, our hope for true peace,

00:15:54.224 --> 00:15:57.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
all starts to fade into the background.

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give him that chance!

00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:02.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be determined to do

00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Titus 3:1, 2 tells us.

00:16:06.569 --> 00:16:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that

00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:13.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Titus chapter 3,

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 1 and 2.

00:16:15.787 --> 00:16:18.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is the Scriptural admonition:

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue reminding them to be in subjection

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:28.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to be obedient
to governments and authorities,

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:30.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be ready for every good work,

00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:35.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to speak injuriously of no one,
not to be quarrelsome,

00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to be reasonable,
displaying all mildness toward all men.”

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Be in subjection

00:16:43.064 --> 00:16:46.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be obedient
to governments and authorities.’

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:48.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now let’s break that down.

00:16:48.194 --> 00:16:50.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
In practical terms, what does it mean?

00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:54.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means to obey the laws of the land
and pay taxes,

00:16:54.826 --> 00:16:58.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
to not speak negatively
about the superior authorities,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be careful not to take sides
on political issues

00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:04.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
(not even in our hearts).

00:17:04.335 --> 00:17:07.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
that expression from the video?

00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:09.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am no part of the world.

00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is the world a part of me?”

00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:14.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
when we find ourselves

00:17:14.846 --> 00:17:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Caesar’s law and God’s law,
we know what to do.

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:22.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
We apply Acts 5:29
and “obey God as ruler rather than men.”

00:17:22.937 --> 00:17:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that.

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:29.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Jesus, who healed the ear
of the armed guard Malchus,

00:17:29.193 --> 00:17:31.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re determined to react with mildness

00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:36.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
when provoked by an injustice
or cruelty in this world.

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:40.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
In conclusion,

00:17:40.747 --> 00:17:45.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the indescribable privilege
to honor the Prince of Peace.

00:17:45.752 --> 00:17:50.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how reassuring it is to know
that Jesus understands our feelings!

00:17:50.757 --> 00:17:55.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
He understands our emotions
when we see things that we know are wrong.

00:17:55.762 --> 00:17:58.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows these things hurt our heart.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just want to make things right.

00:18:02.018 --> 00:18:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember the critical lesson

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
he taught his apostles
in the garden of Gethsemane:

00:18:08.316 --> 00:18:11.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is not your fight.

00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:19.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, Jehovah, the King of Eternity,
and Jesus, the Prince of Peace,

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:23.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
are telling us:
“This is our fight. Leave it in our hands.”

00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:27.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, the prophecy at Isaiah 9:6, 7

00:18:27.877 --> 00:18:30.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be fulfilled completely.

00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
keep preaching about the Kingdom.

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:35.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Avoid saying or doing anything

00:18:35.885 --> 00:18:39.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
that suggests taking sides
on a political issue.

00:18:39.681 --> 00:18:42.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t allow yourself to “chop off the ear”

00:18:42.183 --> 00:18:46.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the injustices and the causes of conflict
of this old world.

00:18:46.229 --> 00:18:49.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter tried that, but it didn’t work.

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:52.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned a big lesson
that day in the garden,

00:18:52.652 --> 00:18:54.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he never forgot it.

00:18:54.654 --> 00:18:57.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never forget it either.

00:18:57.115 --> 00:19:00.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is the time to show
your active and loyal support

00:19:00.702 --> 00:19:02.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Prince of Peace

00:19:02.704 --> 00:19:07.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we echo Peter’s words at 2 Peter 3:14

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:12.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “do [our] utmost to be found finally
by [Jehovah and the Prince of Peace]

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
spotless and unblemished and in peace.”

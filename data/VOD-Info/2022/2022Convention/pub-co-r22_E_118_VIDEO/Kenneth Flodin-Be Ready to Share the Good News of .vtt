00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium is
about sharing “the good news of peace.”

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:10.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege it is to help humble people
find peace with Jehovah!

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 6:15,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
in describing
a Christian’s “complete suit of armor,”

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
it mentions our feet.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:20.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, back at that time,

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking of Roman soldiers,
Paul knew that often they marched

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
for hundreds of miles on Roman highways,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
crisscrossing the empire.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at Ephesians 6:15, he said this:

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Having your feet shod in readiness

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
[in readiness] to declare
the good news of peace”

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, ready to share “the good news of peace”

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
on every suitable occasion.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium, we’ll discuss five ways

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:56.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain ready to preach and teach.

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d first like to discuss
why it’s important to maintain your zeal.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as an analogy,

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:08.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
zeal has often been linked to fire.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
We even use the expression
—don’t we?—

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has a fiery zeal for his beliefs.”

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does “a fiery zeal” indicate?

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please find Romans 1:14, 15,

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here it does not
actually use the word “zeal,”

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the sense of the word is evident.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
You say: “We’re on fire,”
“We’re stoked up,” “We are ready.”

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you find it?

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 1:14, 15:

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Both to Greeks and to foreigners,
both to wise and to senseless ones,

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a debtor; so I am eager

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you see, ready with fiery zeal, eager]

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:48.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
to declare the good news.”

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:54.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zealous evangelizers are eager to declare
the good news—they’re “on fire.”

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:58.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want others to find peace with Jehovah.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there something
that can dampen that flame,

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:08.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that could even extinguish
the eager desire

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the readiness—
to find those who

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
even unknowingly yearn for peace?

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be difficult
to remain eager with fiery zeal

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we face such problems as

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
an unresponsive territory,

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
criticism, or outright opposition to the work

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and then there are
the pressures of daily life.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those issues can also be likened to a fire,

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:40.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destructive fires like the wildfires

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:44.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have plagued the western part
of the United States year after year.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those problems can threaten
our zeal and enthusiasm.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do?

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:58.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s an English expression
that originates with firefighters.

00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expression is “Fight fire with fire.”

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the path of a raging wildfire,

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
one technique is to ignite a controlled fire.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
That controlled fire
consumes combustible materials.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:16.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the wildfire advances to that point,

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no fuel left
and the wildfire goes out.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fight fire with fire.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your zeal for the ministry
burning brightly.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now please find 1 Timothy 4:16.

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our zeal fades—the flame smolders—

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might miss out on opportunities
to help others to gain life,

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:42.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
a life of peace with God.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at 1 Timothy 4:16 with me.

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Pay constant attention
to yourself and to your teaching”

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you see, the flame, the temperature.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Pay attention to your zeal and teaching.’

00:03:57.382 --> 00:03:59.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Persevere in these things,

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for by doing this
you will save both yourself

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who listen to you.”

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:08.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, share “the good news
of peace” with zeal.

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,
note how a couple realized

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the flame had gone out.

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:19.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
They still had some glowing embers left,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they now find a way to fan the coals

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regain their fiery zeal.

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:53.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t remember when our routine service day

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
became so,

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
well,

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:59.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
routine.

00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:10.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal wasn’t what it used to be.

00:05:20.174 --> 00:05:22.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were finally starting to notice.

00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:28.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone wants to listen.

00:05:28.932 --> 00:05:31.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t want to be the reason.

00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:42.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t take much research to find

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:46.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
great ideas
and set a few simple goals,

00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:52.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
like working with those
who encourage us.

00:05:54.374 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Ryota and Ami, we’re always talking

00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:59.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how we can reach the heart.

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:02.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got back to basics:

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:04.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be friendly,

00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:08.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen,

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
let the conversation progress naturally,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to share an appealing Scriptural thought,

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:21.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep trying.

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:23.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:26.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
can attract an honest person

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the truth.

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:37.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, what wildfires, or problems,

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:41.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
did the couple face that sucked the oxygen
out of their ministry?

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:44.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of the four we mentioned earlier,

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:46.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seems the couple’s zeal was waning

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of seemingly unresponsive territory.

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:55.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as tired as the husband looked
in that first scene,

00:06:55.477 --> 00:07:00.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pressures of daily life
might have been having a toll on him.

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:02.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did they come to realize

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:05.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they needed
to fight fire with fire?

00:07:07.322 --> 00:07:10.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember their kitchen-table talk?

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:15.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
The husband mused
that “not everyone wants to listen.”

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he added,
“We just didn’t want to be the reason,”

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see, the reason for them not listening.

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:25.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
They decided to fight fire with fire.

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:28.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reignited their own
controlled fire of zeal

00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:33.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counteract the problems
they were succumbing to.

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:36.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what were some
of the techniques they used?

00:07:36.393 --> 00:07:40.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first was to pray to Jehovah.

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:44.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could it be that the husband borrowed
the words of Romans 12:11 in his prayer?

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:47.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he may well have asked
Jehovah to help them

00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:50.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a couple to “be aglow with the spirit.”

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember he said earlier,

00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:58.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t remember when
our routine service day

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
became so, well, routine.”

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fight the wildfire by, again,
becoming “aglow with the spirit.”

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:10.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ensure that any lack of response

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:13.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not due to our lackluster approach.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:20.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what else did you notice
they did to rekindle their zeal?

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did some research,
looking for suggestions

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:25.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to invigorate their ministry.

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and regular Bible study
helps us to remember

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:32.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we endure in the disciple-making work.

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:36.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, review Jesus’ attitude
toward the ministry.

00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:41.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles’ bold witnessing
despite fiery opposition

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:45.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the disposition of Paul,
Aquila and Priscilla, Stephen,

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:47.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other Bible characters

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these can infuse us with similar zeal.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, keep your ministry fresh.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:08:58.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:03.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of having a number
of phone calls that go unanswered,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is similar to having no one at home
when in the door-to-door work,

00:09:08.693 --> 00:09:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
change the time of day for witnessing

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
to when more people are home.

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:18.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Participate in various forms of the ministry.

00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:20.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, ironically,

00:09:20.914 --> 00:09:23.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pandemic more or less forced some of us

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were staunch door-to-door Witnesses
to branch out.

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:30.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried phone witnessing and letter writing.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we have
a variety of preaching activities,

00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:37.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this can keep us
more fully engaged and enthused.

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:43.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice what the couple
in the video set as a goal?

00:09:43.353 --> 00:09:46.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Periodically, they decided in advance

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:49.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in the ministry
with someone specific.

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:53.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they determined
to talk about encouraging subjects

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:56.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
when in between calls,
whether in phone witnessing

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:58.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the public ministry.

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah values our work in the ministry

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of the response we receive.

00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:10.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 6:10—are you familiar with that?

00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:12.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course you are.

00:10:12.674 --> 00:10:14.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not say

00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:18.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah does not forget
the number of return visits you make.

00:10:18.597 --> 00:10:23.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not say he does not forget
how many Bible studies you conduct.

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:28.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it says he does not
“forget your work [your effort]

00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:31.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love you showed for his name.”

00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:35.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal for the ministry demonstrates

00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:40.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have a deep love
for Jehovah and Jesus.

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
If (like the couple in the video)
you detect that your

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
routine of service is becoming, well,

00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
very routine, then fight fire with fire.

00:10:52.422 --> 00:10:54.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maintain that fiery zeal.

00:10:54.883 --> 00:10:58.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be ready to share “the good news of peace.”

00:11:00.347 --> 00:11:03.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:06.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:11.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’
—Prepare Well.”

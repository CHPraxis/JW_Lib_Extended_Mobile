WEBVTT

00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:03.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
To encourage us to promptly follow up

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
on interest that we find
in the field ministry,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul likens our work to a plant

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:12.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
that grows from a little seed.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s vital for a planted seed to grow?

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
One authority says:

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Of all the factors
that determine seed germination,

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
water is the first and most important.”

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
And another reference says:

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:34.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Until seeds have sprouted,
keep the seed bed moist,

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
never allowing it to dry out.”

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will happen
to a seed that is not watered?

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will lay dormant.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, regular watering
is vital for a seed to sprout,

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take root
and, in fact, continue to grow.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with these facts in mind,

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:01.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 3:6

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
show that more is required

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
than simply planting a seed of truth.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s note his words.

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at 1 Corinthians 3:6.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“I planted, Apollos watered,

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
but God kept making it grow.”

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all credit goes to Jehovah God
for making the spiritual seed grow,

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:32.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he allows us
to have a role in the process.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
the important role Apollos played?

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did the watering.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:41.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a regular way,

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
he helped keep
the spiritual soil of the individual moist,

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
never allowing it to dry out.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people who show interest
in the Kingdom message today

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
are searching for the truth about God.

00:01:57.846 --> 00:02:00.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to teach them progressively,

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must return again and again.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:07.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
This requires good preparation

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and organization on our part.

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
By promptly making return visits,

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:18.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
we demonstrate
a sincere concern for the individual,

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanting to help them grow spiritually

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:31.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a sister follows up
on interest shown.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ami left a great question for her next visit.

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Return visit! Mrs. Iwata!

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her I’d visit this morning.

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t schedule the time.

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could at least stop by on the way back.

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:11.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I missed her again.

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I didn’t try something different,

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:24.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just going to keep missing her.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.645 line:10% position:50% align:center
First, I wanted her

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.356 line:10% position:50% align:center
to know I hadn’t forgotten her.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear Mrs. Iwata,

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you’re doing well.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise to come by early next week.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, your flowers are so beautiful!

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I made a plan for my service day.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following through is just too important

00:04:25.994 --> 00:04:28.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
to leave to chance.

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:37.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you plan your share in the ministry,

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
follow the good example
of the sister in the video

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and schedule time
to make regular return visits.

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing so is just as important

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
as other aspects of our ministry.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:53.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
These regular visits with interested people

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
are vital links in the chain
leading to a Bible study.

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:04.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our ministry,
we often compliment the householder

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the beautiful flowers or plants
in their yard,

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like the sister did in the video.

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:14.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did they get that way?

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the householder
probably watered them on set days

00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:22.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even used an automatic sprinkler timer

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:25.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
to schedule regular watering cycles.

00:05:25.804 --> 00:05:29.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, to have healthy and vibrant plants,

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:32.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
watering cannot be left to chance.

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we apply that to our ministry?

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:41.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before leaving a person
that has shown interest,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
endeavor to set
the proper time to water.

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:49.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
The water of truth will come on.

00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:49.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
See?

00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:53.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps ask, “On what day or hour
would you like for me to return

00:05:53.832 --> 00:05:57.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue our discussion
or to answer the question?”

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, this consideration
really dignifies the person,

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing them to share
in setting the appointment.

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:11.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s important that we be willing
to water an interested person

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the most convenient time for them.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, just like setting a timer,

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:21.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
put that appointment
where you’ll remember it.

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:25.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister in the video
put it in her electronic calendar

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she could be reminded later.

00:06:29.826 --> 00:06:32.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you promise someone that you’ll return,

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:35.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
then keep your promise.

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:40.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jesus’ simple statement
recorded at Matthew 5:37:

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just let your word ‘Yes’ mean yes.”

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:47.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they’re truly interested,

00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may go to great efforts
to keep the appointment.

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:55.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
How disappointed they would be
if we didn’t show up!

00:06:55.477 --> 00:06:59.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following through is just too important

00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:01.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
to leave to chance.

00:07:03.193 --> 00:07:07.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the busy lives
that people have today,

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may be hard
to find the person at home again,

00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:14.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if you set an appointment.

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:19.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s a good idea to try
and obtain his contact information,

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe his phone number.

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:24.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some publishers anticipate this challenge

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and simply ask, “Do you text?”

00:07:28.593 --> 00:07:30.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
By simply texting,

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:35.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may be able to keep in touch
and cultivate the interest further.

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:41.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you can’t get his contact information

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:44.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the person isn’t home
at the agreed-upon time,

00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:47.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might leave a brief note,

00:07:47.154 --> 00:07:50.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as the sister did in the video.

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:54.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this will assure the householder
that you haven’t forgotten them.

00:07:56.288 --> 00:08:01.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciple-making work
requires patience and persistence.

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:05.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard, note what

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:08.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 11:6 says.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 11:6
—it says:

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:16.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sow your seed in the morning

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:19.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not let your hand rest
until the evening;

00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:22.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you do not know
which will have success,

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:25.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether this one or that one,

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whether they will both do well.”

00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:32.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to planting literal seed,

00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:36.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t know when and where it will sprout.

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:41.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many factors are beyond our control.

00:08:42.584 --> 00:08:46.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something similar can be said
of the disciple-making work.

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:50.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to be patient and positive

00:08:50.092 --> 00:08:53.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t know who will respond.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:58.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Last and of utmost importance:

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if the return visit is brief,

00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:04.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
share a Scriptural thought.

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:07.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual content of our conversation

00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:12.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what makes our visit different
from any others that they may have.

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, they have neighbors,
friends, workmates,

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:19.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
or relatives that check in on them.

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:22.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for them to grow spiritually,

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:27.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
the water of truth from God’s Word
must be dispensed.

00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, conveying
just a brief Scriptural thought

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:33.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
may provide just enough

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep their spiritual soil moist.

00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:42.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work involved of following up interest

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:45.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a very important assignment

00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:48.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to each of us.

00:09:48.817 --> 00:09:53.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this in mind,
let’s return to Paul’s illustration

00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:56.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Jehovah views us.

00:09:56.533 --> 00:10:00.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s back at 1 Corinthians chapter 3,

00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:02.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 9.

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:07.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:10:07.377 --> 00:10:10.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we are God’s fellow workers.

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:14.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are God’s field under cultivation,
God’s building.”

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an honor to be one
of “God’s fellow workers.”

00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:25.061 line:90% position:50% align:center

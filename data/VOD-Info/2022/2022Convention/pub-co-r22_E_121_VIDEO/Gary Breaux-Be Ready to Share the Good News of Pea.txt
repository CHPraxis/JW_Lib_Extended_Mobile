00:00:01 To encourage us to promptly follow up
00:00:03 on interest that we find in the field ministry,
00:00:06 Paul likens our work to a plant
00:00:09 that grows from a little seed.
00:00:12 Now, what’s vital for a planted seed to grow?
00:00:17 One authority says:
00:00:19 “Of all the factors that determine seed germination,
00:00:23 water is the first and most important.”
00:00:27 And another reference says:
00:00:29 “Until seeds have sprouted, keep the seed bed moist,
00:00:34 never allowing it to dry out.”
00:00:37 So, what will happen to a seed that is not watered?
00:00:42 Nothing!
00:00:43 It will lay dormant.
00:00:46 See, regular watering is vital for a seed to sprout,
00:00:50 to take root and, in fact, continue to grow.
00:00:55 Now, with these facts in mind,
00:00:57 Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 3:6
00:01:01 show that more is required
00:01:04 than simply planting a seed of truth.
00:01:07 Let’s note his words.
00:01:09 It’s at 1 Corinthians 3:6.
00:01:16 It says: “I planted, Apollos watered,
00:01:20 but God kept making it grow.”
00:01:23 So all credit goes to Jehovah God for making the spiritual seed grow,
00:01:28 but he allows us to have a role in the process.
00:01:32 Did you notice the important role Apollos played?
00:01:37 He did the watering.
00:01:39 In a regular way,
00:01:41 he helped keep the spiritual soil of the individual moist,
00:01:46 never allowing it to dry out.
00:01:49 Many people who show interest in the Kingdom message today
00:01:53 are searching for the truth about God.
00:01:57 In order to teach them progressively,
00:02:00 we must return again and again.
00:02:04 This requires good preparation
00:02:07 and organization on our part.
00:02:10 By promptly making return visits,
00:02:14 we demonstrate a sincere concern for the individual,
00:02:18 wanting to help them grow spiritually
00:02:20 and develop a relationship with Jehovah.
00:02:25 In the following video,
00:02:27 notice how a sister follows up on interest shown.
00:02:38 Ami left a great question for her next visit.
00:02:46 Return visit! Mrs. Iwata!
00:02:51 I told her I’d visit this morning.
00:02:54 I just didn’t schedule the time.
00:02:59 I could at least stop by on the way back.
00:03:09 I missed her again.
00:03:18 If I didn’t try something different,
00:03:21 I was just going to keep missing her.
00:03:26 First, I wanted her
00:03:28 to know I hadn’t forgotten her.
00:03:47 Dear Mrs. Iwata,
00:03:49 I hope you’re doing well.
00:03:51 I promise to come by early next week.
00:03:54 By the way, your flowers are so beautiful!
00:04:03 Then I made a plan for my service day.
00:04:22 Following through is just too important
00:04:25 to leave to chance.
00:04:35 As you plan your share in the ministry,
00:04:37 follow the good example of the sister in the video
00:04:40 and schedule time to make regular return visits.
00:04:44 Doing so is just as important
00:04:48 as other aspects of our ministry.
00:04:50 These regular visits with interested people
00:04:53 are vital links in the chain leading to a Bible study.
00:05:01 In our ministry, we often compliment the householder
00:05:04 for the beautiful flowers or plants in their yard,
00:05:07 just like the sister did in the video.
00:05:11 But how did they get that way?
00:05:14 Well, the householder probably watered them on set days
00:05:18 or even used an automatic sprinkler timer
00:05:22 to schedule regular watering cycles.
00:05:25 See, to have healthy and vibrant plants,
00:05:29 watering cannot be left to chance.
00:05:33 Well, how can we apply that to our ministry?
00:05:37 Before leaving a person that has shown interest,
00:05:41 endeavor to set the proper time to water.
00:05:46 The water of truth will come on.
00:05:49 See?
00:05:49 Perhaps ask, “On what day or hour would you like for me to return
00:05:53 to continue our discussion or to answer the question?”
00:05:57 See, this consideration really dignifies the person,
00:06:02 allowing them to share in setting the appointment.
00:06:06 It’s important that we be willing to water an interested person
00:06:11 at the most convenient time for them.
00:06:14 Then, just like setting a timer,
00:06:18 put that appointment where you’ll remember it.
00:06:21 The sister in the video put it in her electronic calendar
00:06:25 so she could be reminded later.
00:06:29 If you promise someone that you’ll return,
00:06:32 then keep your promise.
00:06:35 Remember Jesus’ simple statement recorded at Matthew 5:37:
00:06:40 “Just let your word ‘Yes’ mean yes.”
00:06:44 If they’re truly interested,
00:06:47 they may go to great efforts to keep the appointment.
00:06:50 How disappointed they would be if we didn’t show up!
00:06:55 Following through is just too important
00:06:59 to leave to chance.
00:07:03 Because of the busy lives that people have today,
00:07:07 it may be hard to find the person at home again,
00:07:11 even if you set an appointment.
00:07:14 So it’s a good idea to try and obtain his contact information,
00:07:19 maybe his phone number.
00:07:21 Some publishers anticipate this challenge
00:07:24 and simply ask, “Do you text?”
00:07:28 By simply texting,
00:07:30 you may be able to keep in touch and cultivate the interest further.
00:07:37 And if you can’t get his contact information
00:07:41 and the person isn’t home at the agreed-upon time,
00:07:44 you might leave a brief note,
00:07:47 just as the sister did in the video.
00:07:50 And this will assure the householder that you haven’t forgotten them.
00:07:56 The disciple-making work requires patience and persistence.
00:08:03 In this regard, note what
00:08:05 Ecclesiastes 11:6 says.
00:08:11 Ecclesiastes 11:6 —it says:
00:08:14 “Sow your seed in the morning
00:08:16 “and do not let your hand rest until the evening;
00:08:19 “for you do not know which will have success,
00:08:22 “whether this one or that one,
00:08:25 or whether they will both do well.”
00:08:30 When it comes to planting literal seed,
00:08:32 we don’t know when and where it will sprout.
00:08:36 Many factors are beyond our control.
00:08:42 Something similar can be said of the disciple-making work.
00:08:46 We need to be patient and positive
00:08:50 because we don’t know who will respond.
00:08:54 Last and of utmost importance:
00:08:58 Even if the return visit is brief,
00:09:00 share a Scriptural thought.
00:09:04 The spiritual content of our conversation
00:09:07 is what makes our visit different from any others that they may have.
00:09:13 See, they have neighbors, friends, workmates,
00:09:15 or relatives that check in on them.
00:09:19 But for them to grow spiritually,
00:09:22 the water of truth from God’s Word must be dispensed.
00:09:28 See, conveying just a brief Scriptural thought
00:09:31 may provide just enough
00:09:33 to keep their spiritual soil moist.
00:09:39 The work involved of following up interest
00:09:42 is a very important assignment
00:09:45 that Jehovah has given to each of us.
00:09:48 With this in mind, let’s return to Paul’s illustration
00:09:53 and see how Jehovah views us.
00:09:56 It’s back at 1 Corinthians chapter 3,
00:10:00 and verse 9.
00:10:05 It says:
00:10:07 “For we are God’s fellow workers.
00:10:10 You are God’s field under cultivation, God’s building.”
00:10:15 It’s an honor to be one of “God’s fellow workers.”
00:10:20 It enables us to show our love for him and for our neighbors.
00:10:25 It brings us great joy to share “the good news of peace”
00:10:29 by following up on interest shown.
00:10:32 And we can be assured that those who respond favorably
00:10:37 will forever appreciate our diligent efforts
00:10:41 when they recall how we promptly followed up
00:10:45 when they showed interest.
00:10:50 Brother William Malenfant, a helper to the Teaching Committee,
00:10:54 will now present the final talk of this symposium,
00:10:58 “Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’
00:11:01 —Help Students Grow to Maturity.”

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am so sorry.”

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:08.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s my fault, please forgive me.”

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how we phrase it,

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:13.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be difficult to apologize.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that so challenging?

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:17.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many reasons:

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may fear confrontation,
blame, or rejection.

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:24.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we feel embarrassed,
and we’re too proud to apologize.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may reason, ‘Apologizing will not undo
the blunder I’ve already made.’

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:33.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it may even be that we are angry.

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:37.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is such a matter of concern

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “in July 2000,

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the California State Legislature
in the United States

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:47.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“passed a bill designed
to relieve people of liability

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if they express sympathy to an individual
who was injured in an accident

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:54.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in which they
themselves were involved. . . .

00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:57.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was noted that . . . people
often hesitate to extend an apology

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[out of concern that]
it could be construed in court

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an admission of guilt.”

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:08.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible provides an account
of a faithful servant,

00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:10.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul,

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:14.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was a good example
of one who apologized.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account is
in the book of Acts chapter 23.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:22.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The setting: A Roman military officer

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanted to know why Paul
was being accused by the Jews.

00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:31.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he brought Paul
to the Jewish chief priests

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:35.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commanded the Sanhedrin,
the high court, to assemble.

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:39.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read Acts 23:1-5 together,

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:41.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t help but be impressed

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:45.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Paul’s boldness
as he stands for what is right.

00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:50.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the same time,
please take note of his humility.

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:56.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 23:1: “Looking intently
at the Sanhedrin,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul said: ‘Men, brothers,

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:02.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have behaved before God

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:06.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with a perfectly clear conscience
down to this day.’

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At this the high priest Ananias

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:12.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ordered those standing by him
to strike him on the mouth.

00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:14.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Paul said to him:

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘God is going to strike you,
you whitewashed wall.

00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:20.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do you sit to judge me according to the Law

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and at the same time violate the Law

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:26.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by commanding me to be struck?’

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those standing by said:

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:32.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are you insulting the high priest of God?’

00:02:33.394 --> 00:02:35.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Paul said: ‘Brothers,

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:38.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I did not know he was high priest.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:41.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For it is written,
“You must not speak injuriously

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a ruler of your people.”’”

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:48.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul immediately admitted his error.

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:50.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
What he had said,

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the one appointed as judge
should not resort to violence, was right.

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:58.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he apologized.

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:01.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:03.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will see an older sister

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:08.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
applying the inspired words of Titus 2:3-5

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:12.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to advise younger sisters
“to be sound in mind.”

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will also observe
how one of the younger sisters

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:19.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
avoids further problems
and pursues peace

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
by humbly apologizing.

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how this happened

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:38.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, Haley, I’m sorry.

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:41.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
It hurts me to see you so upset.

00:03:46.097 --> 00:03:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t believe you two.

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
First,

00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:53.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you heard

00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not what I said.

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I thought that was how you felt.

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:06.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if I got that part wrong,
all this drama?

00:04:06.953 --> 00:04:08.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now stop!

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:12.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, girls.

00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:15.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley, come closer.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:30.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.”

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:38.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not jealous.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t become provoked,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when things become difficult.

00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:53.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are we going to do?

00:04:57.382 --> 00:04:59.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought if—

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:04.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:07.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, Haley.

00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:14.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:05:15.652 --> 00:05:18.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you so harshly.

00:05:20.115 --> 00:05:22.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you at all.

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:31.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m sorry for dragging you into this
by twisting what you said.

00:05:33.087 --> 00:05:36.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK; things happen.

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:38.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been on both ends.

00:05:46.143 --> 00:05:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should never have spoken
that way to you, Celia

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I mean, to either of you.

00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:05.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to get home to Nana.

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll call you tomorrow.

00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:13.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:06:17.302 --> 00:06:22.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
The older sister apologized,
even though she was not in the wrong.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:26.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also urged
the two younger sisters to make peace.

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:31.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes courage, humility,
and determination to apologize.

00:06:32.443 --> 00:06:34.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting to note what’s stated

00:06:34.904 --> 00:06:39.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 2:3:

00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:46.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:51.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:56.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means our determined effort
is not to win an argument,

00:06:56.677 --> 00:06:58.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
which could be contentious,

00:06:58.972 --> 00:07:00.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor do we want to start a discussion

00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:05.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the primary thought being
that we are in the right.

00:07:05.687 --> 00:07:10.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
That could mean
that we are self-concerned, or egotistical.

00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:14.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, in harmony
with the principle of that scripture

00:07:14.655 --> 00:07:17.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to act with humility.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our aim should be to pursue peace.

00:07:21.454 --> 00:07:25.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we think the other person
is being unreasonable,

00:07:25.876 --> 00:07:28.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
we apologize.

00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:31.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it so important to do so?

00:07:31.548 --> 00:07:35.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that is what makes
our worship to Jehovah acceptable.

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:39.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew chapter 5,

00:07:39.515 --> 00:07:42.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 23, 24,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus makes it very clear:

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:51.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, then, you are bringing
your gift to the altar

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:56.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and there you remember
that your brother has something against you,

00:07:56.283 --> 00:07:59.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“leave your gift there
in front of the altar,

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and go away.

00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:05.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“First make your peace with your brother,

00:08:05.835 --> 00:08:09.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then come back and offer your gift.”

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:14.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One Bible scholar
describes the scene this way:

00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:19.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The worshipper has entered the Temple;

00:08:19.892 --> 00:08:22.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘he has passed through [a] series of courts,

00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:24.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the Court of the Gentiles,

00:08:24.522 --> 00:08:28.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the Court of the Women,
the Court of the Men.

00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:31.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Beyond that there lay
the Court of the Priests

00:08:31.655 --> 00:08:34.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘into which the layman could not go.

00:08:34.658 --> 00:08:37.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The worshipper is standing at the rail,

00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ready to hand over
his [living animal] to the priest.’ . . .

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that [critical] moment,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
the worshipper remembers
that his brother has something against him.”

00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he to do?

00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:55.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Leave your gift there
in front of the altar,”

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:58.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus explains, “and go away.”

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:04.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jesus say is more important
than offering up a sacrifice?

00:09:04.857 --> 00:09:09.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘First, make peace with your brother.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Then when you have come back,

00:09:12.741 --> 00:09:15.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer up your gift.’

00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expression rendered “make your peace”

00:09:17.913 --> 00:09:21.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “to reconcile.”

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:24.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words teach a crucial lesson:

00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:26.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reconciliation, or peace,

00:09:26.964 --> 00:09:30.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes before sacrifice.

00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way we treat fellow worshippers

00:09:33.096 --> 00:09:36.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a direct bearing
on our relationship with God.

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:41.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 4:20 pointedly says:

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the one who does not love his brother,
whom he has seen,

00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:48.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot love God,
whom he has not seen.”

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:54.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves in a situation
where we have offended a fellow worshipper,

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:56.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to apply Jesus’ counsel.

00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:59.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to take the initiative

00:09:59.624 --> 00:10:02.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
to approach our brother or sister.

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:05.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may need
to acknowledge their hurt feelings.

00:10:05.422 --> 00:10:09.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may also need to ask,
“What can I do to make amends?”

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:13.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often a sincere apology
is all that is needed.

00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:20.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although our worship today
no longer includes animal sacrifices,

00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:22.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jesus was teaching

00:10:22.065 --> 00:10:24.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
emphasizes that there is a connection

00:10:24.943 --> 00:10:28.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
between peace with our brother

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:31.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and acceptable worship to God.

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:33.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
When two humans are at odds,

00:10:33.911 --> 00:10:36.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may be a measure
of blame on both sides,

00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:40.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
since both are imperfect and prone to error.

00:10:40.544 --> 00:10:44.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
This usually calls for mutual concessions.

00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:48.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if only the one apologizing is right,

00:10:48.427 --> 00:10:52.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
the issue is not so much
who is right and who is wrong

00:10:52.098 --> 00:10:55.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
but who will take the initiative
to make peace.

00:10:57.478 --> 00:11:00.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul heard
that the Christians in Corinth

00:11:00.732 --> 00:11:03.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
were taking fellow servants of God

00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:06.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to secular courts over personal differences,

00:11:06.196 --> 00:11:08.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said:

00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:11.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why [do you] not
rather let [yourself] be wronged?

00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:14.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you not
rather let [yourself] be defrauded?”

00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:18.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principle is clear.

00:11:18.584 --> 00:11:22.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace among fellow believers
is more important than proving

00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:25.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is right and who is wrong.

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:30.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping this in mind makes it easier
to apologize for a wrong

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:33.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
that someone thinks
we’ve committed against him or her.

00:11:33.934 --> 00:11:36.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
A heartfelt apology can open the way

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:39.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a constructive conversation.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can minimize problems

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restore peace.

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:47.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Leonard Myers,

00:11:47.783 --> 00:11:49.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:11:49.993 --> 00:11:53.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:55.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’ . . .

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
By Forgiving Freely.”

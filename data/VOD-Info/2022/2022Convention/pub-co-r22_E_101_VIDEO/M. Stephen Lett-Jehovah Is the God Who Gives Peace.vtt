WEBVTT

00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:03.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is my great pleasure

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warmly welcome all of you

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to say, <i>“Shalom.”</i>

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is saying that appropriate?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>shalom </i> is the Hebrew word for “peace,”

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it occurs over 200 times in the Bible.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it’s used as a greeting
(just as I used it),

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:25.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
it means: “May you have peace.”

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:30.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what could be a more appropriate way
to greet all of you at the start

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this “Pursue Peace”!
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:38.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are very pleased that you’re with us,

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we assure you
that you will not be disappointed.

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary, you’ll be glad you were able

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:49.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
to devote three days to learning
what the Bible says

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:52.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to gain and maintain peace

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:56.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all areas of your life.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s begin
by talking about the Person

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:03.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has drawn us all together
for this convention—Jehovah.

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how we delight in talking

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:09.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our marvelous heavenly Father!

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 4:9

00:01:11.302 --> 00:01:14.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
calls Jehovah “the God of peace.”

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true
that he possesses many qualities

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love, justice, wisdom, power—

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also possesses the quality of peace.

00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:26.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you think about it,
he is at peace with himself,

00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:28.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
at peace with angels,

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:30.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
at peace with faithful humans.

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he is “the God of peace.”

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:38.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now here’s a question:
Does Jehovah keep this peace to himself?

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s get the answer
at Romans chapter 15.

00:01:43.085 --> 00:01:45.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans chapter 15

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:49.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and please let’s read verse 33:

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:54.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives peace

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:57.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
be with all of you. Amen.”

00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:00.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he generously gives this peace,
as we’ll be discussing.

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he gives
“every good gift and every perfect present,”

00:02:04.232 --> 00:02:06.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to James 1:17.

00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:10.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of his finest presents
is the gift of peace.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:12.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now here’s another question:

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of peace does Jehovah give?

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:17.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many equate peace

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:21.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
with freedom from conflict
and strife in one’s life.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:25.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the peace Jehovah gives
is a lot more than that.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:28.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace that only Jehovah can supply

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings in feelings of safety,

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:34.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
security, well-being.

00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Jehovah-given peace

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
is described very nicely
in Philippians chapter 4.

00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go there.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians chapter 4 beginning in verse 6:

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:47.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:50.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in everything by prayer and supplication

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with thanksgiving,

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let your petitions be made known to God;

00:02:56.452 --> 00:03:01.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding

00:03:01.374 --> 00:03:04.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will guard your hearts
and your mental powers

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:07.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:12.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice that Jehovah is saying:
“Do not be anxious over anything.”

00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:14.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Jehovah tell us to do something

00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:16.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was impossible for us to do?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:21.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, obviously, he’s talking about not being

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:24.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
overly anxious.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Controlled anxiety
can actually be beneficial.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can move us to show concern for others.

00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:35.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can motivate us to work enthusiastically
to accomplish an assignment.

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:39.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what about excessive,
uncontrolled anxiety?

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:41.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that can lead to physical problems.

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:44.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depression can be crippling,

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:47.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
debilitating, enfeebling.

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:49.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how can we avoid

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
being overly anxious over anything?

00:03:54.053 --> 00:03:58.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is given in the next words
of Philippians 4:6, 7.

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
After telling us not to be anxious,
Jehovah gives the antidote.

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
He basically tells us to pray,
supplicate, and petition him,

00:04:06.983 --> 00:04:10.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will get that “peace of God.”

00:04:10.487 --> 00:04:13.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what does the scripture mean

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:17.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it says that this ‘peace of God

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:21.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
surpasses all understanding’?

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:24.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we could say
that it’s so amazing and so powerful

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:28.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we limited humans
cannot fully understand it.

00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:32.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
It defies logic from a human standpoint.

00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:36.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hearts and minds may be filled
with so much worry, fear, anxiety

00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:39.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we see no way out, but we beg Jehovah

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:42.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the peace that he can supply.

00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:44.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what happens?

00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:49.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our minds and hearts
are amazingly filled with calmness,

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
security, tranquility.

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:55.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loraine, a young girl

00:04:55.116 --> 00:04:58.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose mother was dying
of cancer, said this:

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was in the room
when my mother took her last breath.

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:05.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I . . . asked Jehovah
to give me the strength

00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:08.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to endure and to get through this.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
I immediately felt the peace of God.”

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:17.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what is meant by the expression

00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the peace of God . . .
will guard your hearts

00:05:21.477 --> 00:05:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your mental powers”?

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Greek word translated “guard”

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:29.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a military term
that evokes a mental picture

00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:33.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
of soldiers
maintaining a day-and-night watch.

00:05:33.114 --> 00:05:34.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same way,

00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
this peace of God
can act like a 24-hour guard

00:05:38.494 --> 00:05:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
over our hearts and mental powers

00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:46.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
—keeping them calm, secure, and tranquil.

00:05:46.127 --> 00:05:48.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a question:

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the key ingredient

00:05:50.507 --> 00:05:55.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our being able to receive
this miraculous peace of God?

00:05:55.762 --> 00:06:00.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer:
Having a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:04.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul
experienced firsthand many times

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:07.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
that having inner peace depends,

00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:09.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on circumstances,

00:06:09.443 --> 00:06:13.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, on a close,
personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:15.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, on one occasion

00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:19.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Paul and Silas boldly preached,

00:06:19.203 --> 00:06:22.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had their garments ripped off of them.

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were beaten—many blows with rods.

00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were thrown into the inner prison.

00:06:27.712 --> 00:06:30.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their feet were fastened in stocks.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the middle of the night,

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did Paul and Silas begin to do?

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:40.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to pray
and sing songs of praise to Jehovah.

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
In amazement,

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:45.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the other prisoners
were listening to them.

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:50.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obviously, their very,
very unfavorable circumstances

00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:54.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
had not robbed them
of their precious peace of God.

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:57.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s learn
this valuable lesson from Paul and Silas.

00:06:57.826 --> 00:06:59.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having the peace of God

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not dependent on our circumstances,
but it is dependent

00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:09.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
on having a close,
personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus far, we’ve discussed how Jehovah
is the God of peace who gives peace,

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:17.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve talked
about what kind of peace he gives.

00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:19.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:23.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom does Jehovah give peace?

00:07:23.853 --> 00:07:25.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simple answer is,

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:30.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives peace
to those who draw close to him

00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:33.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and want to follow his guidance.

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:36.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
So receiving peace from Jehovah starts

00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
with living a clean life,

00:07:39.202 --> 00:07:42.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
following Jehovah’s
righteous moral standards.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in Satan’s world, as you know,

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:49.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
believe that God will accept them as they are

00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:53.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that God in effect
will lower his standard to accommodate them.

00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:55.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine such pride?

00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:00.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be like a pot
telling its maker, the potter,

00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the pot must be used,

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:07.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the potter must accept this,
whether he likes it or not.

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:09.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know
it doesn’t work that way, does it?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to come up
to Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he’ll help us, but we do the changing

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
—certainly not Jehovah.

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:22.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, James 3:17

00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:25.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that “the wisdom from above

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:29.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is first of all pure,

00:08:29.087 --> 00:08:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
then peaceable.”

00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:33.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we want peace from Jehovah

00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:35.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will result in peaceful lives,

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:40.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be pure
according to Jehovah’s moral standards.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 48:22 reads:

00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:47.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘There is no peace,’
says Jehovah, ‘for the wicked.’”

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or put another way,

00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:52.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who wickedly set
their own moral standards

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:57.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive no peace from Jehovah
and will not have peaceful lives.

00:08:57.575 --> 00:09:02.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we work hard
to live by Jehovah’s standards.

00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:05.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s true
that Jehovah does his part to help us,

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:09.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he does expect us to do our part.

00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could say that his blessing on our effort

00:09:12.048 --> 00:09:14.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
is somewhat like multiplication.

00:09:14.884 --> 00:09:16.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean?

00:09:16.886 --> 00:09:21.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we put forth no effort,
there’s nothing for Jehovah to multiply.

00:09:21.307 --> 00:09:23.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is ten times zero?

00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:24.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:09:24.894 --> 00:09:27.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
a hundred times zero?
a thousand times zero?

00:09:27.272 --> 00:09:29.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
a million times zero?

00:09:29.065 --> 00:09:30.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still have zero.

00:09:30.734 --> 00:09:35.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we don’t do anything,
Jehovah has nothing to multiply.

00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:39.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 5:22 tells us that peace

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an aspect
of “the fruitage of the [holy] spirit.”

00:09:43.664 --> 00:09:48.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the holy spirit will help us
cultivate and demonstrate peace.

00:09:48.377 --> 00:09:51.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, John 14:26

00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:54.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes the holy spirit as a “helper.”

00:09:54.717 --> 00:09:56.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that expression “helper”

00:09:56.844 --> 00:10:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t indicate
it will miraculously do the job for us

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no effort on our part.

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:05.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate this if we can:

00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine that you’re working very hard

00:10:08.147 --> 00:10:10.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
to paint the outside of your house,

00:10:10.817 --> 00:10:12.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a good friend comes to help you.

00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:14.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re painting together.

00:10:14.988 --> 00:10:16.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then you decide,

00:10:16.906 --> 00:10:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ll just go back in the house,
and I’ll just take it easy.’

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:24.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how long
will your friend keep painting?

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:28.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he continued painting,
he’s no longer a helper;

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:30.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s doing the job for you.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 11:13 tells us that Jehovah

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:38.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “give holy spirit
to those asking him” for it.

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:40.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we ask for holy spirit

00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:44.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then do our very best
to work in harmony with that helper,

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:47.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy peace with God

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:50.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will enjoy and promote harmony,

00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:53.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
unity, and good relations with others.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:58.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a pleasure it is
to associate with those who display peace

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:02.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this important aspect
of the spirit’s fruitage!

00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:05.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a sleeping baby

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:11.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
is suddenly awakened
in the middle of the night by a loud noise,

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
he becomes frightened
—doesn’t he?—

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he cries out for help.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when a parent cuddles him

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:22.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and soothes him with reassuring words,

00:11:22.224 --> 00:11:24.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
he calms down immediately.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:29.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, David at Psalm 55:16-18

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:34.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
said that when he was troubled,
he ‘called out to God’

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:39.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Jehovah
‘heard his voice’ and ‘gave him peace.’

00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:42.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like David, when we’re in anguish,

00:11:42.703 --> 00:11:45.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can supplicate our heavenly Father,

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:50.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will soothe and restore our peace.

00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:55.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, our loving Father
is eager to do this for us.

00:11:55.842 --> 00:11:58.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open up to Jeremiah chapter 29,

00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:02.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice that he’s eager
to replace our anxiety

00:12:02.932 --> 00:12:05.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the peace from him.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 29:11:

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:13.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you,’

00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:15.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“declares Jehovah,

00:12:15.487 --> 00:12:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:12:19.032 --> 00:12:21.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to give you a future and a hope.

00:12:21.702 --> 00:12:26.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And you will call me
and come and pray to me,

00:12:26.707 --> 00:12:31.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will listen to you.’”

00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:32.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our God is ready, willing, and able
to replace our anxieties

00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:42.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this amazing peace
that only he can give.

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:47.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve now discussed
how Jehovah is the God of peace.

00:12:47.061 --> 00:12:49.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve discussed who he gives the peace to

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:52.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to those who draw close to him

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
and earnestly seek peace from him.

00:12:55.403 --> 00:12:59.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s examine how each of us

00:12:59.365 --> 00:13:02.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
can promote peace with others.

00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:05.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook of the Governing Body

00:13:07.624 --> 00:13:11.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
will explain how this convention program

00:13:11.002 --> 00:13:14.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to pursue peace.

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:18.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:21.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that we really appreciate

00:13:21.346 --> 00:13:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
your attending
this “Pursue Peace”! Convention.

00:13:24.808 --> 00:13:27.228 line:10% position:50% align:center
Speaking of peace,

00:13:27.228 --> 00:13:29.230 line:10% position:50% align:center
we love the serene setting

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.273 line:10% position:50% align:center
here at our world headquarters

00:13:31.273 --> 00:13:34.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Blue Lake in New York State.

00:13:34.402 --> 00:13:37.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, the water is as smooth as a mirror.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
We occasionally see eagles and hawks fly by.

00:13:42.827 --> 00:13:46.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the fall of the year
when the leaves change color,

00:13:46.414 --> 00:13:48.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
the forest can look spectacular.

00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:52.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
More important
than this tranquil setting, though,

00:13:52.295 --> 00:13:54.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the abundant peace

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:57.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to his organization.

00:13:57.926 --> 00:14:02.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can say this because of the peace
and harmony that unite us

00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:04.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what our nationality,

00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:09.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
language, race, tribe,
or social background is.

00:14:09.438 --> 00:14:12.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is truly spectacular,

00:14:12.316 --> 00:14:16.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we consider
all the turmoil in the world

00:14:16.987 --> 00:14:19.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how divided people are

00:14:19.198 --> 00:14:23.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
politically, socially, and religiously.

00:14:23.244 --> 00:14:27.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we cannot take
our beautiful peace for granted;

00:14:27.873 --> 00:14:30.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not maintained automatically.

00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:34.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us personally must pursue peace

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to have God’s approval.

00:14:36.674 --> 00:14:41.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah certainly wants his worshippers
to enjoy lasting peace.

00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:43.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was true in ancient times.

00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:47.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
God told Moses to have the priests in Israel

00:14:47.102 --> 00:14:51.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
bless the people with very reassuring words.

00:14:51.022 --> 00:14:53.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice these words that we find

00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:58.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Numbers 6:24-26,

00:14:58.447 --> 00:15:02.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hear what the priests
were to say to the people:

00:15:02.492 --> 00:15:06.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you.

00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:09.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah make his face shine upon you,

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and may he favor you.

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:14.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah lift up his face toward you

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grant you peace.”

00:15:17.842 --> 00:15:19.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next verse states:

00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they must place my name

00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:23.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“upon the people of Israel,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I may bless them.”

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:28.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has placed his name on us too,

00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:31.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is richly blessing us.

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:35.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider what
this convention program is going to cover

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:38.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’ll know how we can continue

00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:41.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy God’s blessing of peace.

00:15:41.324 --> 00:15:46.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll consider
how to be at peace with God.

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our greatest peace comes

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
from having
a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:55.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making him our best Friend benefits us

00:15:55.547 --> 00:16:00.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leads to peace
in every other aspect of our life.

00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:04.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we reach out
for a close relationship with God?

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need more
than a superficial knowledge of him.

00:16:08.602 --> 00:16:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to get to know Jehovah as a person

00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:14.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and admire his qualities and ways.

00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we can love what he loves

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:20.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hate what he hates.

00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:22.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this program,

00:16:22.533 --> 00:16:24.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen for details about Jehovah

00:16:24.911 --> 00:16:27.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will draw you ever closer to him.

00:16:28.873 --> 00:16:33.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we’ll consider
how to be at peace with others.

00:16:33.294 --> 00:16:36.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our homes should be havens
for peace for our families.

00:16:37.841 --> 00:16:40.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means more than the absence of arguing.

00:16:40.719 --> 00:16:45.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves putting the interests
of our family members ahead of our own.

00:16:45.724 --> 00:16:48.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ll learn from this program,

00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:51.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
that includes showing love
and respect to one another,

00:16:51.688 --> 00:16:53.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
working as a team,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
improving family communication,

00:16:56.193 --> 00:16:59.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and worshipping Jehovah together.

00:16:59.905 --> 00:17:02.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, we’ll consider

00:17:02.157 --> 00:17:04.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to be at peace despite trials

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
and troublesome world conditions.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:11.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this convention,
we’re going to tour the world to see how,

00:17:11.876 --> 00:17:15.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite opposition, illness,

00:17:15.421 --> 00:17:18.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic problems, and natural disasters,

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers really care for one another,

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they receive help
from Jehovah’s organization,

00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:29.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they continue
their spiritual activity.

00:17:29.102 --> 00:17:33.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what may threaten
our lives or livelihood,

00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:37.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be confident
that Jehovah can help us get through it

00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:39.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and retain our peace of mind and heart.

00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:43.033 line:10% position:50% align:center
Fourth, we’ll consider

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:45.702 line:10% position:50% align:center
how to enjoy peace eternally.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once God’s Kingdom
has lifted mankind to perfection,

00:17:50.332 --> 00:17:53.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll no longer have to pursue peace.

00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:57.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Psalm 72:7 promises:

00:17:57.006 --> 00:17:59.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will flourish,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace will abound
until the moon is no more.”

00:18:03.304 --> 00:18:07.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, there will be peace forever.

00:18:07.725 --> 00:18:10.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
This program will help us

00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:13.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anticipate future blessings from Jehovah.

00:18:13.815 --> 00:18:16.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see why “Pursue Peace!”

00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:20.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
was well chosen
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:18:20.238 --> 00:18:22.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
To pursue something means

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
to chase it in order to capture it.

00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:28.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the influence of Satan,

00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:31.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
his wicked world, and our own imperfections,

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace is constantly trying to elude us.

00:18:34.836 --> 00:18:39.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we have to chase after it
to capture it in our lives.

00:18:39.383 --> 00:18:44.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention program will help us do that.

00:18:44.263 --> 00:18:49.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
May the God of peace
be with all of you now and forever!

00:18:49.268 --> 00:18:54.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the heartfelt wish
of all of us on the Governing Body

00:18:54.273 --> 00:18:57.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love you dearly.

00:18:57.109 --> 00:19:01.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy the entire convention program!

00:19:04.575 --> 00:19:07.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warmly thank Brother Cook
for highlighting

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of the ways
this convention program

00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:13.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to pursue peace.

00:19:13.793 --> 00:19:16.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s briefly preview

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:20.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
the convention program that is coming our way

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been provided by the God of peace,

00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:26.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you may want to follow along
by using your copy

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the convention program.

00:19:29.518 --> 00:19:32.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll note that day one has the theme

00:19:32.187 --> 00:19:36.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will bless his people with peace.”

00:19:36.233 --> 00:19:39.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first symposium will illustrate

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:41.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
how love for God, love for neighbor,

00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:43.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love for God’s Word

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:47.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
lead to genuine peace.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s dramatic Bible reading

00:19:49.663 --> 00:19:52.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
is based on the life of Jacob.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you will see,
Jacob gives us an excellent example

00:19:56.754 --> 00:20:00.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to how we can
“pursue the things

00:20:00.842 --> 00:20:03.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
making for peace.”

00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thereafter, we’ll have the talk

00:20:06.222 --> 00:20:10.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Result of True Righteousness
Will Be Peace,”

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:15.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see in that talk
how we can resist temptation.

00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:20.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as a lion devours prey
and assimilates it into his body,

00:20:20.112 --> 00:20:23.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan tries to get us
to succumb to temptations

00:20:23.699 --> 00:20:28.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he can devour us
and assimilate us into his world.

00:20:28.203 --> 00:20:33.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during that talk,
we’ll learn how to reject his temptations.

00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:35.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in the second half of day one,

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:39.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll enjoy our second convention symposium,

00:20:39.423 --> 00:20:44.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace.”

00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:48.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will be greatly heartened
by Jehovah’s promises of peace

00:20:48.516 --> 00:20:50.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
found in the book of Isaiah.

00:20:50.726 --> 00:20:53.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, one of the talks has the theme

00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:57.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Wolf and the Lamb Will Feed Together.”

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we can’t even imagine
feeding a wolf and a lamb together.

00:21:02.155 --> 00:21:05.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we tried such, it would likely result

00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:09.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
in lamb chops for the wolf.

00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:13.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah’s promise in Isaiah assures us

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:16.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
that peace will exist
between humans and animals

00:21:16.378 --> 00:21:20.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and between animals and other animals.

00:21:20.966 --> 00:21:25.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third convention symposium
has a thought-provoking theme

00:21:25.929 --> 00:21:30.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace.”

00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:33.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how, despite challenges,

00:21:33.062 --> 00:21:36.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
marriage mates, parents, and children

00:21:36.315 --> 00:21:41.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
can successfully follow
that road map to family peace.

00:21:41.028 --> 00:21:43.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we’ll enjoy the talk

00:21:43.447 --> 00:21:46.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Loyally Support the ‘Prince of Peace.’”

00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:48.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
That talk will remind us

00:21:48.703 --> 00:21:51.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the importance
of maintaining our neutrality

00:21:51.456 --> 00:21:55.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not taking sides on political issues.

00:21:55.293 --> 00:21:59.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
To conclude day one,
we’ll have the intriguing talk

00:21:59.172 --> 00:22:04.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do Not Be Misled by Imitation Peace!”

00:22:04.052 --> 00:22:07.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will contrast the world’s so-called peace

00:22:07.013 --> 00:22:09.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a genuine peace

00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:12.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will give his followers.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then on day two,

00:22:14.062 --> 00:22:16.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the theme

00:22:16.148 --> 00:22:21.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be found . . . spotless
and unblemished and in peace.”

00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:24.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second day starts with a symposium

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to invigorate us for our ministry

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can be ready

00:22:30.412 --> 00:22:34.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the good news of peace.

00:22:35.042 --> 00:22:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will be followed by the talk

00:22:37.587 --> 00:22:42.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Young People
—Choose a Path That Leads to Peace!”

00:22:42.592 --> 00:22:45.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that talk will encourage
our dear young ones

00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:47.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue the full-time ministry.

00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:50.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to say to you dear young ones

00:22:50.016 --> 00:22:53.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if you do this,
you will enjoy a happy life

00:22:53.853 --> 00:22:56.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have no regrets.

00:22:56.606 --> 00:22:59.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we will see a video

00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:01.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows how our brothers around the world

00:23:01.444 --> 00:23:04.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
are continuing their spiritual activity

00:23:04.573 --> 00:23:09.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are enjoying peace
despite difficult trials.

00:23:09.494 --> 00:23:11.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a highlight of the day

00:23:11.705 --> 00:23:15.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be the baptism
of new disciples of Jesus.

00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:18.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the baptism talk, the baptism candidates

00:23:18.337 --> 00:23:23.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be encouraged
to “Go On Walking ‘in the Way of Peace.’”

00:23:23.342 --> 00:23:25.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why?

00:23:25.052 --> 00:23:29.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because this is truly the best way of life.

00:23:29.515 --> 00:23:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two more symposiums
will use video dramatizations

00:23:34.103 --> 00:23:37.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
to contrast traits of peace wreckers

00:23:37.273 --> 00:23:41.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the qualities of peacemakers.

00:23:41.152 --> 00:23:46.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a stark contrast between the two
you’ll see in these symposiums!

00:23:46.157 --> 00:23:50.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s kind of like the contrast
between bitter and sweet.

00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:55.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part 1 of this year’s Bible drama

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
will remind us of ancient examples
of God’s people who pursued peace,

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll definitely be able
to relate to their examples

00:24:03.258 --> 00:24:07.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and relate it
to our current situation in life.

00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:10.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day will conclude with showing us

00:24:10.224 --> 00:24:14.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to “Safeguard
Our ‘Uniting Bond of Peace’!”

00:24:14.603 --> 00:24:16.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how we can do so

00:24:16.605 --> 00:24:19.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
by putting the application
of Bible principles

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:24.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
always ahead
of following local culture and traditions.

00:24:25.114 --> 00:24:27.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now on day three, the theme is

00:24:27.283 --> 00:24:29.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:24:29.494 --> 00:24:33.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill you with all joy and peace.”

00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:38.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opening symposium
will examine seven examples

00:24:38.336 --> 00:24:42.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
of ones who sowed peace and reaped peace.

00:24:42.632 --> 00:24:46.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will examine Joseph and his brothers,

00:24:46.052 --> 00:24:49.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gibeonites, Gideon, Abigail,

00:24:49.347 --> 00:24:52.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mephibosheth, Paul and Barnabas,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and modern examples.

00:24:55.604 --> 00:25:00.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly hope that many accept our invitation
to hear the enlightening

00:25:00.067 --> 00:25:02.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
public Bible discourse

00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:07.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Friendship With God
—How Possible?”

00:25:07.074 --> 00:25:09.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if we think about it,

00:25:09.076 --> 00:25:11.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not born as friends of God

00:25:11.162 --> 00:25:14.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re born
as sinful offspring of Adam.

00:25:14.373 --> 00:25:16.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, if you think about it,

00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:18.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re born as enemies of God.

00:25:18.502 --> 00:25:21.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you’ll hear
people say of a little baby,

00:25:21.422 --> 00:25:24.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look at that little angel,”

00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:26.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
but more accurate would be to say,

00:25:26.886 --> 00:25:30.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look at that little enemy of God.”

00:25:30.014 --> 00:25:32.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, we love that little baby.

00:25:32.016 --> 00:25:35.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not hopeless
because our loving Creator

00:25:35.645 --> 00:25:37.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
has made reconciliation with him

00:25:37.897 --> 00:25:40.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the reach of everyone.

00:25:40.984 --> 00:25:43.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can become a good friend of God.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that close relationship with Jehovah

00:25:46.114 --> 00:25:50.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
will become our most valuable possession.

00:25:50.035 --> 00:25:54.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then after we enjoy
Part 2 of the Bible drama,

00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:56.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
the concluding talk of this convention

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
will fill our hearts with a joyful prospect

00:26:00.087 --> 00:26:05.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Universal Peace Is Sure to Come!”

00:26:05.092 --> 00:26:09.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s guaranteed by the God “who cannot lie.”

00:26:09.555 --> 00:26:13.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, we’ll join in singing
a beautiful new original song

00:26:13.768 --> 00:26:17.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll close with a prayer of praise
to Jehovah,

00:26:17.647 --> 00:26:20.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Source of peace.

00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:22.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,

00:26:22.193 --> 00:26:24.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a brief synopsis

00:26:24.487 --> 00:26:28.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our wonderful three-day convention

00:26:28.158 --> 00:26:32.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided by the God of peace
that is coming our way.

00:26:32.829 --> 00:26:34.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
And throughout,

00:26:34.831 --> 00:26:39.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
the program will be enhanced
with dozens of videos,

00:26:39.086 --> 00:26:43.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see our brothers
either in real-life settings

00:26:43.048 --> 00:26:48.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
or dramatizations
that we’ll definitely be able to relate to.

00:26:48.053 --> 00:26:50.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the following video

00:26:50.764 --> 00:26:53.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a little, or small, sampling of the videos

00:26:53.517 --> 00:26:56.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will see during this convention.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone.

00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:01.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:27:01.192 --> 00:27:02.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:04.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:27:04.403 --> 00:27:06.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:27:06.447 --> 00:27:09.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to go up to the girls
and smash their phones.

00:27:09.826 --> 00:27:11.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neutral?
Ain’t no neutral.

00:27:11.828 --> 00:27:13.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:15.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:27:15.164 --> 00:27:17.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was feeling back then

00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:19.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just sadness,

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:21.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
never really peace.

00:27:21.755 --> 00:27:22.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here.

00:27:24.257 --> 00:27:28.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:31.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
In June of 2018,

00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:34.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge group of armed men came to us.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:39.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:42.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost us?

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:44.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a choice.
You went behind my back!

00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:46.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s your mask?

00:27:46.947 --> 00:27:49.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know how many people
have actually gotten sick?

00:27:49.366 --> 00:27:50.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:27:51.702 --> 00:27:53.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what always happens.

00:27:53.788 --> 00:27:55.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just
about to lose all your strength,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:02.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful that we made peace

00:28:02.672 --> 00:28:05.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the world turned upside down.

00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:11.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s an important question
for all of us:

00:28:11.764 --> 00:28:14.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we prepare our heart

00:28:14.517 --> 00:28:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive God’s peace
during this convention?

00:28:18.688 --> 00:28:22.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra 7:10 tells us

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:27.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘Ezra prepared his heart
to consult the Law of Jehovah

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:31.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to practice it,
and to teach it to the Israelites.’

00:28:31.034 --> 00:28:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what was the result?

00:28:32.786 --> 00:28:37.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11 tells us
he became “an expert in the study

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:40.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the commandments of Jehovah.”

00:28:40.336 --> 00:28:42.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in imitation of Ezra,

00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:45.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we prepare our heart

00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:49.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what we’re going to take in
at this convention?

00:28:49.637 --> 00:28:53.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing (very important),
by prayer and meditation,

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:57.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can make sure that our heart is ready,

00:28:57.562 --> 00:29:01.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
receptive to receive Jehovah’s instruction.

00:29:01.399 --> 00:29:04.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can also make sure that in our heart,

00:29:04.485 --> 00:29:08.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are determined
to apply what Jehovah teaches us.

00:29:08.782 --> 00:29:10.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then another thing we can do

00:29:10.784 --> 00:29:12.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
is we can pay close attention

00:29:12.911 --> 00:29:15.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the music-video presentations

00:29:15.747 --> 00:29:19.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be shown before every session
as the convention begins.

00:29:19.876 --> 00:29:23.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these presentations
have been carefully crafted

00:29:23.797 --> 00:29:28.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help prepare our heart for each session.

00:29:28.343 --> 00:29:31.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much time, effort, and expense

00:29:31.305 --> 00:29:34.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been expended in preparing

00:29:34.183 --> 00:29:36.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
these beautiful presentations.

00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:41.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please listen carefully
as the sounds and scenes

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepare your heart to accept
the spiritual instruction

00:29:45.778 --> 00:29:47.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will follow.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, may each of us be determined

00:29:51.242 --> 00:29:54.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen attentively

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what Jehovah is teaching us.

00:29:56.664 --> 00:30:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we be determined to imitate the psalmist

00:30:00.376 --> 00:30:04.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
who humbly stated at Psalm 85:8:

00:30:04.714 --> 00:30:08.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will listen
to what the true God Jehovah says,

00:30:08.718 --> 00:30:12.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he will speak peace to his people.”

00:30:12.639 --> 00:30:17.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we will learn
how to pursue peace with all people

00:30:17.644 --> 00:30:20.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the praise of Jehovah, the God of peace,

00:30:20.606 --> 00:30:23.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
who blesses his people with peace.

00:30:23.442 --> 00:30:27.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we will be successful in pursuing peace

00:30:27.988 --> 00:30:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
until we no longer have to pursue it.

00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:34.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we mean?
Well, think about it.

00:30:34.161 --> 00:30:36.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah have to pursue peace?

00:30:36.914 --> 00:30:39.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he have to chase it
in an effort to try to catch it?

00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:41.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:30:41.043 --> 00:30:44.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah merely displays peace.

00:30:44.505 --> 00:30:46.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in the new world,

00:30:46.507 --> 00:30:48.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a wonderful time it will be

00:30:48.968 --> 00:30:52.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we no longer have to pursue peace,

00:30:52.055 --> 00:30:56.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
but like Jehovah,
we can merely display peace.

00:30:56.851 --> 00:31:01.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
But right now, let’s be determined
to continue to pursue peace.

00:31:01.856 --> 00:31:04.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may this wonderful convention

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:08.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is coming our way help us to do so!

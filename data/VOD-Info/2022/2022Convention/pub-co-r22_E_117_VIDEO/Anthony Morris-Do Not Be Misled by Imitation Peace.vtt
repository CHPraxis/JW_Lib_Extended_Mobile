00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus taught us that Satan

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “the father of the lie.”

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recall that he deceived Eve,
a perfect woman.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:17.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lied about our precious Jehovah.

00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:21.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you’re familiar (many of you)
with Revelation chapter 12.

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:23.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to find that

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 12.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this chapter, verses 7 and 8,

00:00:30.844 --> 00:00:34.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
it addressed the fact
that “war broke out in heaven.”

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
that after he’s kicked out of heaven,

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 9 we read:

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:45.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So down the great dragon was hurled,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the original serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan,

00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:53.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth;

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:57.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was hurled down to the earth,
and his angels

00:00:57.413 --> 00:01:00.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
were hurled down with him.”

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:05.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I read it that way specifically,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what it doesn’t say is

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:11.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in the middle part of verse 9):

00:01:11.302 --> 00:01:15.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Satan, who is [trying to mislead]

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire inhabited earth.”

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:22.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he <i>“is</i>  misleading

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:26.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire inhabited earth.”

00:01:26.192 --> 00:01:31.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s crucial to understand
when we think about the theme of this talk,

00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:34.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be misled by imitation peace,

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
because as “the ruler of the world,”

00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:40.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s what he’s out to do—mislead.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:45.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it’s an interesting point
here in 2 Corinthians chapter 11

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appreciate

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:53.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he goes about misleading,
or at least it’s addressed here

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:57.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as a good warning for us.

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:02.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And an interesting point with the revision

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:08.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
(for those of you in the truth before 2013

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:12.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it was revised, you’ll remember this)

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:16.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 14 of 2 Corinthians chapter 11:

00:02:16.327 --> 00:02:21.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And no wonder,
for Satan himself keeps disguising himself

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an angel of light.”

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to say before the revision

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:34.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[transforms] himself
into an angel of light.”

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:39.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the very English word “metamorphosis,”

00:02:39.518 --> 00:02:44.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
like for a caterpillar transforming
into a beautiful butterfly,

00:02:44.523 --> 00:02:47.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s where it comes from,
the Greek language.

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:52.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that word was not in verse 14.

00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:56.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, because Satan can’t transform himself

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
into “an angel of light”
(so it’s an improved translation),

00:03:01.207 --> 00:03:03.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he does disguise.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a masquerader.

00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:11.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he does that with the subject of peace.

00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:15.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
His world offers a sort of peace,

00:03:15.388 --> 00:03:19.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s imitation peace.

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:23.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus is distinguished,
though, with the peace that he gives.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’ll follow along here

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
in John chapter 14,

00:03:30.237 --> 00:03:32.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
he himself explains it to us.

00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:36.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we treasure the Gospel accounts,

00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:40.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 27: “I leave you peace;

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:43.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I give you my peace.

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:46.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I do not give it to you
the way the world gives it.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not let your hearts be troubled
nor let them shrink out of fear.”

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:56.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus gives us his peace, see.

00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:59.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace that Jesus gives us,

00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:04.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s this inner calm once you know
the truth and Jesus gives us the peace.

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:09.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have this confidence that he loves us
and Jehovah loves us,

00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:13.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we enjoy a good,
peaceful relationship with them

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:16.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a good conscience.

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we look forward to the Kingdom
removing all war and death.

00:04:21.873 --> 00:04:24.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a point to make here:

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:28.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan wants us to trade

00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:30.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace that Jesus gives

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:33.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his imitation peace

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:37.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he has advertised in the world.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in this talk,

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:45.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will consider
three forms of imitation peace

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why the peace
that Jesus gives is superior.

00:04:51.946 --> 00:04:56.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one has to do with material things

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:59.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how they’ll not bring true peace.

00:04:59.078 --> 00:05:03.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to help us with that,
turn to Matthew chapter 4,

00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:08.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll be referring to this chapter

00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:14.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout this particular talk
about not being misled by imitation peace.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this one
is connected with material things

00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:18.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how they don’t bring true peace—

00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:21.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the example Jesus sets forth here.

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Matthew chapter 4:

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:26.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus was led by the spirit

00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:30.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“up into the wilderness
to be tempted by the Devil.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After he had fasted
for 40 days and 40 nights,

00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:35.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he felt hungry.

00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:38.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the Tempter approached and said to him:

00:05:38.702 --> 00:05:41.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you are a son of God,

00:05:41.163 --> 00:05:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’

00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:49.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he answered: ‘It is written:

00:05:49.004 --> 00:05:52.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Man must live, not on bread alone,

00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:56.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on every word that comes
from Jehovah’s mouth.”’”

00:05:56.971 --> 00:05:59.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful rebuttal?

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:02.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus refused to trade

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:06.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
his peace for material things
(in this case, bread),

00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:09.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though he was hungry.

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:13.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
So serving Jehovah was more important to him

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
than material things, see.

00:06:16.282 --> 00:06:19.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world, they have this thinking,

00:06:19.577 --> 00:06:22.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, you need

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
a certain amount of money to retire,’

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:30.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re constantly
focused on material things

00:06:30.797 --> 00:06:33.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not Jesus, see.

00:06:33.508 --> 00:06:38.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s superior peace from Jehovah God.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s only temporary anyway,

00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:44.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
the material benefits that people seek

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:47.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pursue throughout their lives.

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:51.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we can enjoy true contentment

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah God is going to care for us.

00:06:55.197 --> 00:07:00.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many have
personal experiences to prove that.

00:07:00.203 --> 00:07:02.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,

00:07:02.747 --> 00:07:07.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
see what a brother learned
about the so-called peace

00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:09.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the world promises.

00:07:15.176 --> 00:07:18.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a family, we were doing
very well spiritually.

00:07:18.763 --> 00:07:21.641 line:10% position:50% align:center
We did family worship, went preaching,

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.561 line:10% position:50% align:center
and went to the meetings together.

00:07:25.687 --> 00:07:28.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some time, we began

00:07:28.357 --> 00:07:30.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encounter financial problems.

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:34.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we did not even have money
to buy food

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:36.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each day.

00:07:38.033 --> 00:07:40.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people in our area
were going to South Africa

00:07:40.577 --> 00:07:42.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide basic needs for their families.

00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:45.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to go as well,

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving behind my wife
to take care of our seven children.

00:08:00.264 --> 00:08:02.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
This affected me spiritually

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:05.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I did not know the language,
I was unable to preach,

00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:08:09.774 --> 00:08:11.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being so far from my family

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused me to neglect
my responsibility as a family head.

00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:20.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually

00:08:20.994 --> 00:08:23.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we all missed each other very much.

00:08:23.538 --> 00:08:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I had made
a wrong decision going abroad.

00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:31.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:33.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I remembered the example of Baruch

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Jeremiah 45:5.

00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:42.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch may have wanted
to pursue material riches as I had.

00:08:44.518 --> 00:08:47.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was helped, he returned.

00:08:48.647 --> 00:08:52.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place

00:08:52.318 --> 00:08:54.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of searching for material things.

00:08:55.446 --> 00:08:58.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started to make changes to go home

00:08:58.574 --> 00:09:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help my family spiritually.

00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:06.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I left South Africa
and reached the border of Malawi

00:09:06.416 --> 00:09:09.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
(after leaving my family
for about six months),

00:09:09.753 --> 00:09:13.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt great happiness in my heart,

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:15.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am still happy till now.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:19.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still encounter financial problems,

00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:25.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I remember that in Satan’s world,

00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:27.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is nowhere we can go
and have no problems.

00:09:28.856 --> 00:09:31.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I serve as an elder.

00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:34.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family is progressing spiritually.

00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:38.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this makes me very happy,

00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:41.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my relationship
with Jehovah is strong.

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:52.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he learned a hard lesson.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
He goes to South Africa

00:09:55.174 --> 00:09:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
—meetings interrupted and no field service.

00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:02.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he remembers Baruch,

00:10:02.557 --> 00:10:05.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
secretary for Jeremiah.

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:10.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he returns to be with his family,
putting the Kingdom first,

00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:14.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we appreciate him
being truthful and sharing that experience.

00:10:14.819 --> 00:10:19.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s imitation peace,
going after material things.

00:10:20.742 --> 00:10:25.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now this next one, it’s quite interesting.

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:27.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
So pay close attention

00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:31.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there may be some
listening who need this counsel.

00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:34.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan’s world says that we

00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:36.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
can ignore Bible standards

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:41.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we might need
to ignore some of them to gain peace of mind.

00:10:41.764 --> 00:10:46.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are two examples
that we’re going to analyze in this talk.

00:10:46.435 --> 00:10:50.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person may reason
that marrying an unbeliever

00:10:51.315 --> 00:10:55.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
or obtaining an unscriptural divorce

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:58.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make life easier.

00:10:58.323 --> 00:11:01.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they start reasoning this way,

00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I just want to get married,

00:11:04.954 --> 00:11:08.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s an unbeliever,
but he’s a nice person.’

00:11:08.083 --> 00:11:12.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things like that go on
with the treacherous heart.

00:11:12.087 --> 00:11:16.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we go to the example
of our Lord and Master, Jesus.

00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:21.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to read verses 5-7 of Matthew 4:

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:27.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the Devil took him
along into the holy city,

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he stationed him
on the battlement of the temple

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to him:

00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:36.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If you are a son of God,
throw yourself down,

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for it is written:

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:42.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“He will give his angels
a command concerning you,” 

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:44.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and, “They will carry you on their hands,

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may not strike
your foot against a stone.”’

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to him: ‘Again, it is written:

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:58.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not put Jehovah
your God to the test.”’”

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:03.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jesus made that very clear.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was going to be obedient to his Father

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:10.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wasn’t going to worry about being testy

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:15.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
with such an experience
as the Devil proposed there.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:19.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
So obedience

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jesus twice (in a moment we’ll read
another one) said: “It is written.”

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:27.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sticks with the Scriptures
—Jehovah’s thinking—

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he refused to disobey Jehovah.

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:35.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now here’s the question,

00:12:35.548 --> 00:12:38.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the peace that Jesus gives

00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:41.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
superior to the pursuit

00:12:41.303 --> 00:12:45.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

00:12:47.059 --> 00:12:49.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let that sink in.

00:12:49.103 --> 00:12:51.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the peace that Jesus gives

00:12:51.814 --> 00:12:54.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
superior to the pursuit

00:12:54.067 --> 00:12:57.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

00:12:57.111 --> 00:13:00.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, marrying an unbeliever

00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:05.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that will likely bring
(and it has happened time after time)

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
that person greater pain

00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:12.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the longing
they felt when they were single.

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:14.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve personally seen that

00:13:14.755 --> 00:13:18.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
all too many times in various congregations

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:22.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve had the privilege to serve in.

00:13:22.012 --> 00:13:27.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the other one
is an unscriptural divorce.

00:13:27.059 --> 00:13:30.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
It often leads to immoral conduct.

00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:33.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly leads to a troubled conscience,

00:13:33.524 --> 00:13:38.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional damage
and, of course, a loss of privileges.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is very important to keep in mind.

00:13:43.993 --> 00:13:48.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that with two imperfect individuals

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:52.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
married to each other,
well, there are going to be difficulties

00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:55.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are going to be challenges.

00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:59.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But stop and think about this:

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:01.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re having difficulties,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t forget that marriage

00:14:04.681 --> 00:14:07.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a sacred arrangement.

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:12.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world totally has forgotten that.

00:14:12.064 --> 00:14:16.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah will strengthen

00:14:16.276 --> 00:14:20.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
both to make a success.

00:14:20.155 --> 00:14:24.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to keep that in mind:
Jehovah will strengthen and help

00:14:24.618 --> 00:14:28.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can succeed
because this is his sacred arrangement.

00:14:28.914 --> 00:14:32.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Devil has been attacking
the family arrangement

00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:36.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
all through the last days of this system,

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:38.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s intensifying it

00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he gets closer
to being thrown into the abyss.

00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:46.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,

00:14:46.057 --> 00:14:51.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the results
of pursuing imitation peace.

00:14:53.398 --> 00:14:55.441 line:10% position:50% align:center
Newly married life came with a lot

00:14:55.441 --> 00:14:57.736 line:10% position:50% align:center
of unexpected challenges.

00:14:57.736 --> 00:15:01.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
You dream about the way
your marriage will go,

00:15:01.114 --> 00:15:03.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then the reality is quite different.

00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:08.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
All we ever did was argue,

00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:11.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we wouldn’t speak to one another.

00:15:12.584 --> 00:15:14.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never ever went to the elders.

00:15:14.294 --> 00:15:16.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t want to bother them.

00:15:16.171 --> 00:15:19.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just felt, you know,
we needed to figure it out ourselves.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided that if the house sold,

00:15:24.221 --> 00:15:26.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we would separate.

00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:34.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
The separation wasn’t a good thing,

00:15:34.523 --> 00:15:37.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in some respects
it made things worse.

00:15:38.236 --> 00:15:40.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
It did have an impact on the boys.

00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:41.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
They started acting out.

00:15:41.989 --> 00:15:45.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got into some trouble
with the police one time.

00:15:47.745 --> 00:15:51.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was a loneliness
because you’ve gotten married,

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:54.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now you don’t have that,
and you’re by yourself.

00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:57.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same old routine
went on where you’re

00:15:57.714 --> 00:16:01.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
cooking and cleaning
and doing laundry and working.

00:16:02.802 --> 00:16:04.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt sick to my stomach.

00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:08.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a hard time getting up every morning
and facing the world.

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:11.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point, I felt that I needed

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:13.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have the elders help out a little bit.

00:16:13.897 --> 00:16:17.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did pray for Jehovah’s help to direct me,

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:21.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I kept wondering
why Jehovah wasn’t really

00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:22.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
answering my prayers.

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:27.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I kind of realize now
that it was because we were separated.

00:16:27.536 --> 00:16:32.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expectations of the separation
were not at all what I was thinking.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
I reflected on the marriage vows.

00:16:35.378 --> 00:16:37.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the things I thought

00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:40.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
about was a sister in our congregation.

00:16:40.883 --> 00:16:44.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was married to an unbeliever,
and then she learned the truth.

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:46.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was so violent.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:51.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would beat her; he would burn her books;
he would burn her clothes.

00:16:51.227 --> 00:16:54.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not allow her children
to attend the meetings.

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:57.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought about the problems
that Darrel and I had.

00:16:57.067 --> 00:16:59.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:
‘Well, Darrel is a kind person.

00:16:59.235 --> 00:17:00.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s never done that.’

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:01.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:

00:17:01.947 --> 00:17:03.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, this is something

00:17:03.532 --> 00:17:05.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that we need to really work on.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:08.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We need to really put forth the effort

00:17:08.453 --> 00:17:11.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to start applying Bible principles

00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:12.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to put Jehovah first in our life

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can bring our marriage
back in union with Jehovah.’

00:17:17.963 --> 00:17:21.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted,

00:17:21.592 --> 00:17:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was what Jehovah wanted.

00:17:27.223 --> 00:17:29.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was just no other choice.

00:17:29.392 --> 00:17:33.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wasn’t going to bless us
unless we got back together.

00:17:34.438 --> 00:17:39.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got back together,
our marriage was still a work in progress.

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:41.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t have
a perfect marriage in this world,

00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:44.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you can sure make it better
when you put Jehovah first.

00:17:44.824 --> 00:17:47.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoyed the feelings
we had toward each other.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt closer to Debbie.

00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:54.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Debbie and I
have been married now for 48 years.

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:58.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Separation does not make
anything better at all.

00:17:58.338 --> 00:18:01.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you even have an inkling of love
for one another,

00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:05.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
you want to work on that,
and you want to make it bloom

00:18:05.053 --> 00:18:07.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jehovah can bless it.

00:18:07.097 --> 00:18:09.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings have been endless.

00:18:09.141 --> 00:18:11.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our children are all doing

00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:13.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
fantastic in the truth.

00:18:13.729 --> 00:18:16.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said:
“Taste and see that [He] is good.”

00:18:16.148 --> 00:18:18.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ve got to do that.

00:18:24.114 --> 00:18:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really appreciated this couple sharing

00:18:28.244 --> 00:18:31.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
their experience with the brotherhood.

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:34.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned, you know.

00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:36.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were always arguing,

00:18:36.127 --> 00:18:39.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s all they
did was argue, argue, argue.

00:18:39.589 --> 00:18:42.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
It affected their children.

00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:47.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
They decided to separate
and finally have peace.

00:18:47.222 --> 00:18:51.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t have to be around her,’
or ‘I don’t have to be around him.’

00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:55.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he realized
his relationship with Jehovah

00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:58.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being interfered with here,

00:18:58.233 --> 00:19:01.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he went to the elders.

00:19:01.153 --> 00:19:03.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
His prayers were affected.

00:19:03.155 --> 00:19:05.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things he noticed
—he was honest about that.

00:19:05.907 --> 00:19:10.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our precious sister
was so nice to honestly explain.

00:19:10.662 --> 00:19:15.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said what she learned
was that ‘this is not about me;

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s about Jehovah.’

00:19:17.628 --> 00:19:20.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you finally come to that realization,

00:19:20.965 --> 00:19:23.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will strengthen you

00:19:23.175 --> 00:19:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy peace with your marriage partner.

00:19:28.264 --> 00:19:32.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the next one, I never tire of speaking

00:19:32.727 --> 00:19:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
about these particular couple of verses

00:19:37.774 --> 00:19:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
or reading about it or hearing
another brother give a talk about it.

00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:44.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, here’s what’s coming soon.

00:19:44.906 --> 00:19:48.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many of you are going, ‘Oh, yeah, I know

00:19:52.497 --> 00:19:54.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he’s going to read about.’

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:59.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is one of the prophecies

00:19:59.045 --> 00:20:02.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is yet to be fulfilled.

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s just invigorating

00:20:04.635 --> 00:20:08.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know that soon
here’s what’s going to happen

00:20:08.055 --> 00:20:10.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:14.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 2 and 3:

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For you yourselves know very well

00:20:18.482 --> 00:20:23.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah’s day
is coming exactly as a thief in the night.

00:20:24.739 --> 00:20:27.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:20:27.283 --> 00:20:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:20:30.786 --> 00:20:35.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:39.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:43.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:20:45.176 --> 00:20:48.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, see, “Jehovah’s day”

00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:52.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this has to do with the day
of the outbreak of the great tribulation

00:20:52.893 --> 00:20:56.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Babylon the Great is destroyed

00:20:56.146 --> 00:20:58.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Armageddon finishes it off.

00:20:58.398 --> 00:21:01.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this context, that’s “Jehovah’s day.”

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happens before then

00:21:04.613 --> 00:21:09.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
is this proclamation, “peace and security!”

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will religious leaders be involved?

00:21:11.745 --> 00:21:15.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they’re part of Satan’s system;
that’s very possible.

00:21:15.332 --> 00:21:16.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll have to wait and see.

00:21:16.959 --> 00:21:21.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will it be one announcement
or a series of announcements?

00:21:21.172 --> 00:21:23.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
That we don’t know.

00:21:23.174 --> 00:21:25.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is coming.

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:29.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those who are staying close to Jehovah

00:21:29.013 --> 00:21:32.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoying the peace
from him and his Son, Jesus,

00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:35.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be deceived

00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:39.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
by this imitation proclamation of peace

00:21:39.357 --> 00:21:41.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
—imitation peace.

00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:46.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, back in Matthew chapter 4,

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:50.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to see how Jesus handled

00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:53.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
this type of test from the Devil

00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:55.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what we learn from it here

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:59.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 8-11 of Matthew chapter 4.

00:22:01.588 --> 00:22:04.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Again the Devil took him [in verse 8]

00:22:04.508 --> 00:22:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along to an unusually high mountain

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and showed him all the kingdoms
of the world and their glory.

00:22:12.516 --> 00:22:14.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he said to him:

00:22:14.894 --> 00:22:17.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘All these things I will give you

00:22:17.938 --> 00:22:22.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if you fall down
and do an act of worship to me.’

00:22:23.486 --> 00:22:26.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus said to him [without hesitation]:

00:22:26.906 --> 00:22:29.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Go away, Satan!

00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:33.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For it is written:
“It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:22:33.997 --> 00:22:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is to him alone
you must render sacred service.”’

00:22:39.586 --> 00:22:43.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the Devil left him,
and look! angels came

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began to minister to him.”

00:22:47.385 --> 00:22:50.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away, a third time: “It is written.”

00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:54.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was having nothing to do

00:22:54.351 --> 00:22:58.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this offer of the kingdoms
—this imitation peace.

00:22:58.522 --> 00:23:02.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’ll have all the glory and rule.’

00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:05.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s always boggled my mind

00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:09.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this one who knew

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:12.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus in his prehuman existence

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:17.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have the audacity to try to get Jesus
to bow down and worship him.

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:22.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows you that he’s obviously insane.

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:26.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he wouldn’t allow it either

00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:28.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they tried to make him an earthly king.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus wasn’t having any part of that.

00:23:31.514 --> 00:23:34.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were thinking he could bring them peace.

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:39.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus said there’s no peace
except by Jehovah’s way.

00:23:40.648 --> 00:23:45.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace from God’s Kingdom
is so superior

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:50.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anything they could try to come up with
—their imitation peace.

00:23:50.075 --> 00:23:51.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s why.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about this:

00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:57.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will remove the Devil.

00:23:59.543 --> 00:24:03.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will remove human rulership.

00:24:03.255 --> 00:24:05.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will remove sin.

00:24:06.925 --> 00:24:11.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the earth’s peace
will never again be disturbed.

00:24:13.557 --> 00:24:18.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I appreciate very much
that he’s going to get rid of all problems,

00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:22.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that includes undoing all causes of pain

00:24:22.775 --> 00:24:25.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and not just physical pain,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional pain as well.

00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:34.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful to look forward to that time

00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:36.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that beautiful peace

00:24:36.748 --> 00:24:40.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our precious Father,
Jehovah, and his Son, Jesus.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,

00:24:43.296 --> 00:24:45.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
see what convinced this sister

00:24:45.632 --> 00:24:50.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to believe the world’s promises of peace.

00:24:55.017 --> 00:24:58.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father always taught me
that we needed God in our life

00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:00.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for there to be peace.

00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:04.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
And he always wanted to know,

00:25:04.902 --> 00:25:06.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
Can Christians go to war?

00:25:08.197 --> 00:25:12.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is this consistent
with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?

00:25:12.952 --> 00:25:16.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the pastor could never give us an answer,

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:19.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so I thought I’d have to look
to politics to find it.

00:25:19.917 --> 00:25:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of peace movements
were being formed at that time,

00:25:23.379 --> 00:25:25.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I joined one of them.

00:25:27.091 --> 00:25:30.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided where
the protest marches would be

00:25:30.053 --> 00:25:32.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and which pamphlets we would use.

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:38.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the protests were over,

00:25:38.353 --> 00:25:40.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone was so excited

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they all started applauding

00:25:43.024 --> 00:25:45.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cheering for the leaders.

00:25:45.068 --> 00:25:48.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought:
‘That’s not what I wanted.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t want to honor people.

00:25:50.824 --> 00:25:53.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I want to have world peace.

00:25:53.994 --> 00:25:56.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that still hasn’t happened yet.’

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:04.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I started to feel very alone,

00:26:04.088 --> 00:26:07.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it made me feel unsafe in this world.

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:09.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
With no peace in sight,

00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:11.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘What is the purpose of life?’

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
While visiting friends for coffee,
I saw a man I’d never met before.

00:26:18.978 --> 00:26:22.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
My friends told me he wanted
to talk to us about the Bible.

00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:27.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I asked him:

00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:29.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sir, what do you think?

00:26:29.113 --> 00:26:31.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can Christians join the military?”

00:26:32.242 --> 00:26:34.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the man said,
“No, that’s not allowed

00:26:34.828 --> 00:26:37.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Bible says
you should ‘love your [enemy].’”

00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:43.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me think
about what my father always said

00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:46.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that we need God to bring peace.

00:26:49.968 --> 00:26:51.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a really nice lady came to my door,

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she had an orange book in her hand.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it said:
<i>True Peace and Security.</i>

00:27:02.189 --> 00:27:04.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reading it, I thought:

00:27:04.316 --> 00:27:06.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘This is it!

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the organization
that truly wants peace.’

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I went to those involved
in the peace movement.

00:27:16.996 --> 00:27:20.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told them that I believe
that God will change this world

00:27:20.082 --> 00:27:23.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a beautiful earth
where there’ll be true peace.

00:27:24.837 --> 00:27:27.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all looked at me
like I had lost my mind.

00:27:28.508 --> 00:27:31.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy with my new life.

00:27:31.136 --> 00:27:33.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like I was part of a family

00:27:33.012 --> 00:27:35.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
who truly cared about one another

00:27:35.056 --> 00:27:37.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really wanted peace with each other.

00:27:41.938 --> 00:27:46.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 14:7 had a major impact on my life

00:27:46.109 --> 00:27:48.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there God promises

00:27:48.278 --> 00:27:51.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
a calm and peaceful world.

00:28:00.374 --> 00:28:03.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that nice how she learned?

00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:08.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’d looked to politics and protests
for world peace.

00:28:08.507 --> 00:28:11.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, she was sincere.

00:28:11.052 --> 00:28:15.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she learned that’s all imitation peace.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
True peace and security
comes from Jehovah God.

00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:26.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
So wrapping it up with these
three different types

00:28:26.693 --> 00:28:30.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
of imitation peace
that we’ve emphasized,

00:28:30.321 --> 00:28:34.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to encourage you
in these last minutes

00:28:34.993 --> 00:28:39.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
to safeguard the peace
that Jesus has given you.

00:28:41.792 --> 00:28:44.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
In John chapter 14

00:28:47.172 --> 00:28:50.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
(you know this,
but I want you to really focus

00:28:50.425 --> 00:28:54.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a particular point), in verse 6:

00:28:56.515 --> 00:28:58.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to him:

00:28:58.517 --> 00:29:03.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:29:03.105 --> 00:29:07.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one comes to the Father
except through me.’”

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:29:11.322 --> 00:29:16.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Particularly we want to emphasize
Jesus is “the truth.”

00:29:18.329 --> 00:29:20.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust all of his promises.

00:29:20.665 --> 00:29:22.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is “the truth.”

00:29:24.377 --> 00:29:27.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to give us peace
—already has—

00:29:27.422 --> 00:29:31.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will to a greater extent in the future.

00:29:31.593 --> 00:29:35.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our Master is “the truth.”

00:29:35.055 --> 00:29:38.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he gave the early Christians that peace.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
The things that they were able to deal
with are just mind-boggling.

00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:47.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the apostle Paul’s experiences
and Peter’s and others’

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the persecution they endured—
they did it,

00:29:50.737 --> 00:29:52.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
enduring with joy.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing!

00:29:54.992 --> 00:29:59.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can only be
a supernatural provision of peace.

00:29:59.997 --> 00:30:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just remember,

00:30:02.249 --> 00:30:07.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will likewise give you
the peace you need now

00:30:07.004 --> 00:30:12.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep doing Jehovah’s will
and to make Him happy.

00:30:12.009 --> 00:30:15.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, brothers, please,

00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:19.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
safeguard the gift of peace

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:22.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus has given you.

00:30:22.896 --> 00:30:25.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan uses this world

00:30:25.982 --> 00:30:29.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer you promises of imitation peace.

00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:32.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be misled!

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:38.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, rather, “Let the peace of the Christ
rule in your hearts.”

00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:40.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And show yourselves thankful.”

00:30:40.497 --> 00:30:42.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, through his Son,

00:30:42.499 --> 00:30:47.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will bless us all with peace forever!

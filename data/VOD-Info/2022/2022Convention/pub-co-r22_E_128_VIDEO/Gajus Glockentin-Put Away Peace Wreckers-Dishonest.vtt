00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:05.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
What comes to your mind
when you hear the word “dishonesty”?

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:09.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you think of Satan,
“the father of the lie.”

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:12.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Ananias and his wife come to your mind.

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lost their lives because of lying.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not want to imitate such ones.

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
We avoid lying.

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that, though, as far as our honesty goes?

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our holy God, Jehovah,
wants us to be holy as well,

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is why he urged
the ancient Israelites

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to deceive others

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
as mentioned at Leviticus 19:11.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this not add some color to honesty?

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty includes
(and please take note of this definition)

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
intentionally leading someone
to a wrong conclusion.

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, by twisting the truth

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:03.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
or by providing only certain details,

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endanger our peace with others.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say so?

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does dishonesty wreck peace?

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:17.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace and a peaceful relationship

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
are built on trust.

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting someone makes you feel
safe and secure

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and puts you at ease.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no peace without trust.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we develop trust?

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust is the result
of spending time together,

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:40.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking the truth with one another.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust people who act unselfishly

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:47.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not use “crooked speech,”
as the Bible puts it.

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
If someone deceives us only once
or is dishonest in another way,

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:56.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might start to question
everything they say.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
One single act of dishonesty may be enough.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can ruin their reputation.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
As bad as this is,
dishonesty has the potential

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
to create even greater damage.

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty can be compared

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:17.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a highly contagious virus.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty breeds dishonesty.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
People who have contact
with deceitful, dishonest persons

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in danger of being infected.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty might not only wreck
one relationship

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:36.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
but multiple relationships,

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting the unity and peace
of the whole group at risk.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds us of the relationship

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:50.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Laban and Jacob
in the Bible book of Genesis.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on the agreement with Laban,

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob worked hard for seven years

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to marry Laban’s daughter Rachel.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:04.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And despite this high price
that Jacob had to pay,

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:07.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
those years seemed for him

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like “a few days.”

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, instead of Rachel,

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
he received the older daughter, Leah,
as a wife.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now Leah was also part of the deception.

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result after Jacob had found out

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Laban tricked him?

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
The trust was gone.

00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
The relationship had suffered
to a great degree.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dishonesty wrecked the peace
in those relationships,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so the following seven years
of work for Rachel were bitter.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Laban’s dishonesty emboldened him
to continue in his course.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
He unfairly changed Jacob’s wages ten times.

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:55.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
He deceived Jacob.

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Laban’s dishonesty,

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:01.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace in the whole family
was disrupted.

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us now continue to watch
the next segment of the dramatization.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
We left Emily and Celia sitting
in a coffee shop.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch carefully, and notice

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:18.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Emily is tempted to alter the truth.

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
You pioneer together.

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know, and that’s why I’m concerned.

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concern is good,

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:27.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought you would understand.

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I understand your feelings.

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not about Haley?

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t seen all her posts.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:47.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing immoral, is there?

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:50.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good. That’s not like her.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s a case of her being more careful
how she comes across,

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:02.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s another matter.

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:04.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you talk to her?

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:15.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily, you are a beautiful, spiritual sister.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
for years,

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:30.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a bad habit
of comparing myself to others.

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:35.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
My own insecurity hurt me

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my closest friends.

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:52.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you don’t think
I should’ve spoken to Celia?

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:55.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, I’m glad you asked Celia about it

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:57.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
—someone you trust.

00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:00.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she say?

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:02.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she definitely understands how I feel.

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And about Haley’s posts?

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she hasn’t seen
everything she has out there.

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:14.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:20.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did say that Haley

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs to be more careful

00:06:22.444 --> 00:06:24.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
how she comes across.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she suggest?

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:34.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I should tell her
that she needs to stop,

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:37.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m too worked up.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:41.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look,

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Celia agrees
that Haley is doing something she shouldn’t,

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:51.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should talk to her.

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:58.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll find the right time.

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:09.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for understanding.

00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:11.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m hungry.

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:12.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you say the prayer?

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:13.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:18.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, we’d like to praise you

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:20.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your generosity and kindness . . .

00:07:27.092 --> 00:07:31.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how Emily just heard
what she wanted to hear?

00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
In talking to her husband, Jake,
she painted an incomplete picture.

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did not relay that Celia had no opinion

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the social media posts of Haley.

00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:45.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
And contrary to what she told her husband,

00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:49.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Celia did not encourage her
to tell Haley to stop.

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:53.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters deserve the truth.

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:56.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Emily didn’t relay that, did she?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was dishonest, something that can have

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
a damaging effect, as we will see later.

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:07.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to put away

00:08:07.257 --> 00:08:09.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
this peace wrecker, dishonesty.

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:12.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us to always be truthful,

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:14.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
even in small matters.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, how do we put away dishonesty?

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:24.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us please turn to Ephesians chapter 4.

00:08:24.816 --> 00:08:27.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here the apostle Paul reminds us

00:08:27.652 --> 00:08:29.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a reason to be honest.

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:32.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Ephesians chapter 4,

00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:35.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to read verse 25:

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:41.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, now that you
have put away deceit,

00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:44.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each one of you speak truth
with his neighbor,

00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:49.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we are members
belonging to one another.”

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:53.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice why we put away deceit

00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:57.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speak truth with one another?

00:08:57.015 --> 00:09:01.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Because we are
members belonging to one another.”

00:09:01.478 --> 00:09:04.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, Paul reminds us of the fact

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
that dishonesty affects others

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:10.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our brothers and our relationship with them.

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:12.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, knowing this,

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:16.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we put away dishonesty?

00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:18.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is:

00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:23.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
By considering the consequences
of dishonesty and honesty.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:27.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help us to do the right thing.

00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:32.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what are the consequences of dishonesty?

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:35.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve seen in the case of Laban and Jacob,

00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:39.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will disrupt the peace with others.

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:42.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since Jehovah hates dishonesty,

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:46.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will also disrupt our peace with Jehovah.

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:50.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
what are the consequences of honesty?

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:58.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
While dishonesty might seem in the moment
to be the easier way out,

00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the long run,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
honesty will enable us to have good friends.

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to enjoy peace as well,

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:09.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore they are also searching

00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
for someone they can trust.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:14.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this way, we are

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:18.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
like ‘body members belonging to one another.’

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:22.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even more important,

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:25.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy a good conscience

00:10:25.854 --> 00:10:28.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “peace with God.”

00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:32.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, therefore, put away
this peace wrecker (dishonesty)

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:36.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
by sticking to the truth
even in small things.

00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:39.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah knows

00:10:39.618 --> 00:10:41.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
that for us imperfect humans

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is not always easy.

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:47.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he promises to help us

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:50.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to bless every step we take

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build trust and peace

00:10:53.423 --> 00:10:56.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not to wreck it.

00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:01.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Patrick LaFranca,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:04.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:09.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers—Harmful Gossip.”

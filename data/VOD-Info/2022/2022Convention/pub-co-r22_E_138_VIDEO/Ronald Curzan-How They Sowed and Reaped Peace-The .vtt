00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a battle
that has lasted for centuries

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continues down to our day.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a battle of wills

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the will of disobedient humans

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
who fight against Jehovah’s will.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than submitting
or surrendering their will

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:20.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do Jehovah’s will, most humans refuse

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make peace with him,
becoming peacebreakers.

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
millions throughout the centuries

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
have humbly submitted to Jehovah’s will,

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
making his will their will.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are known as peacemakers.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
By sowing peace with Jehovah,

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have reaped the benefits of having
a close, personal friendship with him

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:50.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the wonderful hope of living forever
in a peaceful new world.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even so, we must admit

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it can be difficult at times to accept

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then follow Jehovah’s direction

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
or direction that we may receive
from his organization,

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if we don’t understand
the reasons behind the direction

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it’s not what we might prefer.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is needed to sow and reap peace?

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:15.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility is defined as a “lowliness of mind,

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
freedom from pride or arrogance.”

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person is not self-willed,

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:28.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they actively look for ways to sow peace

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:31.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah and others.

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s known as a peacemaker.

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the result of humility
and sowing peace?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Proverbs 22:4 says:

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The result of humility
and the fear of Jehovah

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is [reaping, notice] riches

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and glory and life.”

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, everlasting life.

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains many fine examples

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:00.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who sowed and reaped peace

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
by humbly submitting to Jehovah’s will.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the example of the Gibeonites.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Gibeonites
—weren’t they enemies of the Israelites?

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did they humbly sow and reap peace

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah and with his people?

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you recall,
after Joshua led the Israelites

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
across the Jordan River
into the Promised Land,

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah directed them to remove

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:31.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pagan Canaanite nations
who dwelled there.

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
This included the Gibeonites.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account at Joshua chapter 9

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
informs us that the Gibeonites
were plainly told

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was Jehovah’s will
that the Canaanites be annihilated.

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israel’s stunning victories
over Jericho and Ai

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:54.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
made it very clear that Jehovah
was fighting for his people,

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Gibeonites did not want to be next.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what could they do
if this was Jehovah’s will?

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they devised an interesting plan.

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:07.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sent representatives to seek peace

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:11.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Israelites and thereby with Jehovah.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:14.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to verse 11, they were instructed:

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:18.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will be your servants;

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
now make a covenant with us.”

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is what they were
to say as representatives.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:28.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 4 says that the Gibeonites
“acted shrewdly”

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
by trying to trick the Israelites

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their worn-out clothing and provisions,

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:37.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
pretending that they had traveled
from a very distant land

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:40.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
but were actually just 20 miles (30 km) away.

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did their plan work?

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite their deception,
yes, their plan was successful.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:49.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in verse 15,

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:53.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua made a covenant of peace
with the Gibeonites.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:57.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, this was in harmony
with Jehovah’s will

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflected their humility

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:03.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
and desire to seek peace
with Him and his people.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:06.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
They demonstrated
their humility and submission

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:10.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s will
and his representative, Joshua,

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following whatever direction
they received.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:16.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, notice the direction at verse 27;

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Joshua made them gatherers of wood

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:25.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and drawers of water for the assembly
and for Jehovah’s altar.”

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the Gibeonite men
were likely skilled warriors,

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were happy and content
to do whatever work

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were given to support pure worship.

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:39.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly following direction

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved their lives and brought them peace.

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:48.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate the Gibeonites?

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
By bringing our lives into harmony
with Jehovah’s will.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some, this may require
making big changes,

00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
adjusting their thinking,
giving up harmful practices,

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoiding bad associates.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also imitate the Gibeonites
by being willing

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to perform whatever assignments we are given

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:13.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
to humbly support pure worship.

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the lesson is clear.

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:17.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sowing and reaping peace

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:20.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires humbly following direction.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:24.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
This lesson is highlighted
in the following dramatization.

00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:28.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the benefits of submitting
to Jehovah’s direction.

00:05:35.272 --> 00:05:36.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:41.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pandemic lasted longer
than any of us expected,

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:46.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the conflicting news reports
just added to the stress.

00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then my sister lost her job
and had to move in with us.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yeah, it was me

00:05:55.876 --> 00:06:00.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Kelly, Nicole, and Dad.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty seconds, Son

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
—twenty seconds.

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:14.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll see you later.

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:15.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:17.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh, where’s your mask?

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:18.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:20.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, you can use this one. 

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:22.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t get near anyone.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gary.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:25.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:28.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody at the warehouse is wearing masks.

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:31.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you know how many people
have actually gotten sick?

00:06:31.453 --> 00:06:32.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:34.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far.

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:37.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
You saw the last Governing Body update.

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:39.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t let down our guard.

00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:40.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:06:40.337 --> 00:06:41.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, I get it.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK?

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:49.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I think it’s great that the brothers
are trying to keep us safe.

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:50.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
But . . .

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:52.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what?

00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:56.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think that they’re,
you know, overreacting?

00:07:12.452 --> 00:07:16.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, it wasn’t
the brothers who had the problem.

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:21.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
A week later, I found out that a friend
in our service group

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
was in the hospital with COVID-19.

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:34.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was young, and he had been taking
all the right precautions.

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:38.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had really let my guard down.

00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is not the time

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
to slacken our hand when it comes to safety.

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:54.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let your guard down.

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:59.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t think the virus
can’t affect you or your family.

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:04.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how the organization
was really trying to protect us

00:08:04.713 --> 00:08:08.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how much my decisions
were affecting others,

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the people I love the most.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:18.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the pandemic dragged on,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned the importance
of being humble and obedient.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following Jehovah’s direction
didn’t just help us stay safe,

00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:37.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
it brought us peace.

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
What timely lessons,

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:49.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially with all that we are facing today!

00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:51.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Gary, there are times

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:54.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may need
to adjust our thinking on matters

00:08:54.054 --> 00:08:57.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put aside our personal opinions
and preferences

00:08:57.265 --> 00:09:01.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can loyally
and humbly follow Jehovah’s direction

00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:06.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whatever direction we receive
from his representatives,

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:09.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:09:09.152 --> 00:09:11.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gary learned an important lesson:

00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly following direction

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t just help our family stay safe,

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:19.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
it brings us happiness and peace

00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a vital lesson for us today.

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:27.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us
to humbly follow direction now

00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:29.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as in the future?

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:31.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the apostle Paul said

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ephesians 5:17;

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:38.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says: “Stop being unreasonable,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but keep perceiving

00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:45.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the will of Jehovah is.”

00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:49.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible clearly shows
God’s thinking on matters.

00:09:49.568 --> 00:09:52.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if it’s not so clear to us

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:56.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we struggle to fully grasp
how it applies to us personally

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:59.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in a given situation?

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:01.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul advise?

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Keep perceiving
what the will of Jehovah is.”

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do that?

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:11.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just as a miner keeps digging
deep below the surface of the ground

00:10:11.882 --> 00:10:13.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find precious gems,

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:18.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must look beyond the surface
of what we read in the Bible.

00:10:18.263 --> 00:10:21.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
This requires that we keep digging deep,

00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:26.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
carefully searching for gems
in the form of Bible principles.

00:10:26.605 --> 00:10:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we must prayerfully meditate
on what we find.

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:34.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jehovah’s precious thoughts

00:10:34.446 --> 00:10:37.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
will become our thoughts.

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perceiving Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:43.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to avoid getting
into a battle of wills,

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can follow His direction

00:10:45.957 --> 00:10:50.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whatever direction we receive
from the Governing Body.

00:10:50.378 --> 00:10:53.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the Gibeonites, may we be peacemakers

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:58.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
by continuing to sow peace
with Jehovah and his people.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:01.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we humbly make Jehovah’s will our will,

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:06.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will joyfully reap abundant peace forever.

00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:09.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:11:09.814 --> 00:11:13.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:16.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Gideon.”

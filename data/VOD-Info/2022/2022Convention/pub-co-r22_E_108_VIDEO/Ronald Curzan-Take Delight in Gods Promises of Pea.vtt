WEBVTT

00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:05.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it sounds too good to be true,
it probably is.”

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:10.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
This familiar saying might be true
with human promises,

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:14.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s certainly not true
with promises from Jehovah.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
They always come true.

00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:21.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just before his death at the age of 110,

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:23.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua reminded the Israelites

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:27.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
why Jehovah’s promises
can always be trusted.

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:32.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Not one word
out of all the good promises

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:35.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah your God
has spoken to you has failed.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have all come true for you.”

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:41.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among all of Jehovah’s good promises

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:44.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the heartwarming restoration promises

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:49.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
given to the Jews returning
from exile in Babylon.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the land of Judah
had lain desolate for 70 years,

00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:57.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jews wouldn’t have expected brand
new homes waiting for them to occupy

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
or fields ready for them to harvest.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
There would be much work
for them to do once they arrived.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many unknowns
about their future,

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:12.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
which could have caused some to worry,
or to be anxious.

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:16.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some family heads might have wondered:
‘Where will we live?

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:20.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will I feed my family
and keep them safe?’

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah calmed their hearts
with the reassuring promises

00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:28.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Isaiah 65:21, 22.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read these together.

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:34.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Isaiah 65:21, 22,

00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:36.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there it reads:

00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses
and live in them,

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:43.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will plant vineyards
and eat their fruitage.

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:46.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will not build
for someone else to inhabit,

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:49.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:53.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the days of my people
will be like the days of a tree,

00:01:53.686 --> 00:01:58.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the work of their hands
my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:03.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
These promises
must have strengthened the Jews.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah didn’t say that ‘they <i>might </i>
build and live in their own homes,

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they <i>might</i>  enjoy the fruitage
from their own vineyards.’

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he told his precious chosen ones

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:19.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they <i>will</i>  enjoy
these promises to the full.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though they
hadn’t been told every detail

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:26.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there were many unknowns
regarding their future,

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:29.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
they knew their God, Jehovah.

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:32.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew that his promises
were for their good

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:36.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they would all come true.

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:38.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those promises did come true.

00:02:38.902 --> 00:02:43.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that God fulfilled
all of his promises in the past

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:46.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthens our trust and confidence

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of his promises for the future,

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:51.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the ones that we read in Isaiah 65,

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
will all come true for our everlasting good.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joy it will be to build
and then live in our own home,

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:03.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
never having to worry that we will lose it

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of a natural disaster
or economic collapse!

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:12.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, though, many of our
brothers and sisters today

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
do suffer the harsh realities
of living in this old system of things.

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:21.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
a sister in Poland named Gabriela

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced great loss when her home
was nearly destroyed by a flood.

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did she maintain her joy?

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:32.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what she said:

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:37.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t want to talk about what I lost
—those are just material things.

00:03:37.257 --> 00:03:41.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, I want to tell you
how much I gained.

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This experience reassured me

00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:48.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that being a part of the Christian
congregation is a unique privilege

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:52.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as a source of joy and happiness.”

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:57.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So although she went through some
very difficult times, what did she gain?

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy and happiness.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about a single sister
from Puerto Rico named Anel?

00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:05.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
She endured a very difficult test

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in 2017 when Hurricane Maria
destroyed her home.

00:04:10.544 --> 00:04:14.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of that storm, she lost her job.

00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:16.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what she recalled:

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During those difficult days,
I felt anxious

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I learned to trust in Jehovah
through prayer

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not let anxiety paralyze me.”

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:29.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also said:

00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:34.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Following the direction of the organization
helped me to remain calm.

00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:39.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I saw Jehovah’s hand
in the spiritual encouragement I received

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:43.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as well as the material assistance
provided by the brotherhood.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah gave me much more than
I could even ask for, and my faith

00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:51.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
was greatly strengthened.”

00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:55.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she received assistance from Jehovah
—from his organization—

00:04:55.343 --> 00:04:57.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she was greatly strengthened.

00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:05:00.723 --> 00:05:04.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you suffering some sort of storm
in your life,

00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps from a natural disaster

00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:08.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe a figurative one

00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:11.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused by a health issue,

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:14.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
a family problem,
or some injustice?

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
During such times,

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:20.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s normal to experience
feelings of anxiety,

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:23.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
worry about our future,
the safety of our family.

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t allow such feelings
to paralyze you.

00:05:27.753 --> 00:05:30.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Gabriela and Anel,

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:34.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep doing what you can
and continue trusting in Jehovah.

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:39.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, continue to trust
in our loving brotherhood.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters are true friends

00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:47.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are ready to show love
in our time of distress.

00:05:47.983 --> 00:05:50.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will quickly come to our aid

00:05:50.194 --> 00:05:54.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
by providing practical assistance
and relief provisions.

00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:59.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will help us rebuild our home
and rebuild our life.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:03.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will build us up and stabilize us
with words of encouragement.

00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:09.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we put our complete trust in Jehovah
and his promises,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
we receive the best protection possible.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the psalmist wrote
at Psalm 91:1, 2.

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:21.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 91:1, 2 says:

00:06:21.353 --> 00:06:23.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Anyone dwelling in the secret place

00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:28.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the Most High will lodge
under the shadow of the Almighty.

00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:30.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will say to Jehovah:

00:06:30.154 --> 00:06:33.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You are my refuge and my stronghold,

00:06:33.032 --> 00:06:36.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
my God in whom I trust.’”

00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:40.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful reminder
of protection from Jehovah!

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:45.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is
“the secret place of the Most High”?

00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:49.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a figurative place
of spiritual security and protection.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who dwell, or lodge,
with God as his personal guests

00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:58.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain there are safe from anything

00:06:58.143 --> 00:07:01.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
or anyone that threatens their faith

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their love for God.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure that Jehovah
will never abandon those who trust in him

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not now, not ever.

00:07:12.576 --> 00:07:15.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:07:15.162 --> 00:07:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
envision the secure future that lies ahead

00:07:18.207 --> 00:07:21.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we will enjoy complete security.

00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:28.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you long for a home of your own?

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:33.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised the returning exiles

00:07:33.056 --> 00:07:37.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they would build
and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:50.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah likewise cares for us,

00:07:50.242 --> 00:07:52.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether we lose our home

00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:54.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we’re taken from it.

00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:02.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all,

00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:06.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
true worship provides spiritual security

00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:08.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is found nowhere else.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual home we have now

00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:20.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us that Jehovah will give us

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:22.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
a physical place to call home

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:23.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new world.

00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:54.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will build houses and live in them.”

00:09:00.819 --> 00:09:03.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful video!

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us imagine
what we will experience

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:09.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the near future
when all of God’s promises

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:14.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
become a reality on a paradise earth
and when we truly are safe

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:17.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cared for in every way

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
—physically, spiritually, and emotionally.

00:09:21.341 --> 00:09:25.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to read another
comforting promise from Jehovah?

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:30.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Isaiah 65:23.

00:09:30.017 --> 00:09:34.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there it says:
“They will not toil for nothing,

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:36.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor will they bear children for distress,

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they are the offspring

00:09:38.902 --> 00:09:43.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
made up of those blessed by Jehovah,
and their descendants with them.”

00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:48.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
This must have brought
great comfort to the Jews.

00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:51.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how comforting it is for us today!

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

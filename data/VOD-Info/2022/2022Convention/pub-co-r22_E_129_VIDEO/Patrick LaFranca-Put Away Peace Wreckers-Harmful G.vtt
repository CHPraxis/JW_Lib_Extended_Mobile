00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you gossip?

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:03.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:06.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, whenever we share
any news about others,

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is a form of gossip.

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we are interested in others,
we might say,

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am really concerned
about Brother Smith’s health,”

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Did you hear about Sister Brown’s
experience in the ministry?”

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this type of gossip harmful?

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Generally not.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, we need to be careful.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Timothy 5:13,

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul spoke out against certain sisters

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were “gossipers
and meddlers in other people’s affairs.”

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not need to know
and share everything we know

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what’s happening
in other people’s lives.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if, for example,
Brother Smith did not want others

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know details about his health problem?

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to respect the privacy of others.

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or what if talking
about Sister Brown’s experience turns into,

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, you know, she always brags
about her success in the ministry.”

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our talk about others turns negative,

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can develop into slander.

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:11.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slander is making
deliberate, false statements

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
that damage another’s reputation.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now consider
how harmful gossip wrecks peace.

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have spread harmful gossip
about someone and he hears about it,

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you see him the next time,

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will be the look on his face?

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me Proverbs 25:23:

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The north wind brings a downpour,

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.”

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The north wind in Palestine

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
brought dark clouds and rain.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, when the one you gossiped about

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
catches wind of this and he sees you,

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will have a gloomy, angry face.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be a storm
and a chilled relationship.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when that happens,

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may feel very badly and apologize,

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you may have damaged his reputation

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that may be difficult to undo.

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:22.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to this old Jewish story:

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A man went about town
slandering the town’s wise man.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Later, the malicious gossiper
realized his wrong

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and went to the wise man
and asked for his forgiveness.

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:39.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He offered to do
whatever was needed to make amends.

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The wise man made one request.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He told the gossiper
to take a feather pillow,

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘cut it open,
and scatter the feathers to the wind.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, the gossiper
was puzzled by this request,

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but he did as instructed.

00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Then he returned to the wise man.

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“Am I now forgiven?” he asked.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“First, go and gather all the feathers,”
the wise man responded.

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“But, how can I?

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The wind has already scattered them.”

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The wise man replied,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“It is as difficult to repair
the damage done by your words

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it is to recover the feathers.”’

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, once spoken,
hurtful words cannot be retrieved.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s not scatter feathers in the wind.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we spread rumors,

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can seriously disturb
the peace of many in the congregation.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find an example of this

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:43.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Acts 21:20, 21.

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
The older men of the Jerusalem congregation
explained to Paul

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some Jews
had spread a rumor among Jewish Christians

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had been teaching an apostasy,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaking against the Law of Moses.

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, this was a twisting of the facts.

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul never spoke disrespectfully of the Law.

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:08.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even went to synagogues

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he reasoned
on the basis of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such stories could have led
some newly converted Jewish Christians

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think that Paul
did not respect God’s arrangements,

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:25.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this could have seriously disrupted
the peace of the congregation.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:32.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the effect
that harmful gossip can have

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the peace in a congregation.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially as a pioneer,

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:41.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of example is she setting?

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has Emily stopped following her?

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:46.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not yet, but she probably will.

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alistair, what do you think?

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
About what?

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley’s posts on QuicPost.

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:56.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a problem?

00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:58.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily has told me

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:00.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re all just, “Look at me

00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:03.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my clothes, my hair, my makeup.”

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even Celia agrees with her.

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:12.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s very easy to take things
out of context on social media.

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:18.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that I’ve done that and realized later

00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was wrong.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:22.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s a good point.

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:27.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen, I don’t want to pull you away,

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:30.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if you have a minute, would you mind
giving me a hand with these boxes?

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:31.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:42.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks for your help.

00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:44.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
No problem.

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:49.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake, back in the hall,
I know you were just expressing concern,

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:52.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here’s something to consider.

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:55.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
This principle is one of my favorites.

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:58.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Proverbs

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:02.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:07.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The first to state his case seems right,

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:11.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the other party comes
and cross-examines him.”

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not sure I understand.

00:06:18.357 --> 00:06:21.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just means that sometimes

00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:23.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
we only hear one side of a story.

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
And until we personally hear both,

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:30.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s best not to draw any conclusions.

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:35.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even then, if it’s something negative,

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t want to spread it

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
any more than we’d want something spread
about ourselves.

00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:46.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I hadn’t considered that.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:52.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to apologize to Harry and Marie

00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:57.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have Emily talk directly to Haley.

00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:00.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:09.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice what Jake said

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:12.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the elder graciously helped him reason

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:14.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Proverbs 18:17?

00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:18.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “I had not considered that.”

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:22.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jake just did not stop and think

00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:26.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he said
those negative things about Haley.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we “put away” harmful gossip

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it begins?

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:36.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Proverbs 15:28:

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:43.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The heart of the righteous one
meditates before answering,

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the mouth of the wicked

00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:48.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
blurts out bad things.”

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:52.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
So before we say bad things about others,

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:54.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to meditate.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this does not mean
a long-drawn-out process.

00:07:58.457 --> 00:08:01.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just requires a little thought.

00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:05.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
What thoughts could have stopped Jake

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:10.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
from repeating his wife’s negative view
of Haley’s post?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have asked himself:

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is what I am about to say true?

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:18.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is it kind, loving?

00:08:18.685 --> 00:08:22.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How will Harry and Marie view Haley

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:25.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they hear
those negative things about her?’

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:30.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another principle
that will help us to put away harmful gossip

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:33.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the so-called Golden Rule,

00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:36.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Luke 6:31.

00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:40.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Just as you
want men to do to you,

00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:43.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
do the same way to them.”

00:08:43.627 --> 00:08:46.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means showing empathy,

00:08:46.088 --> 00:08:48.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting ourselves
in the place of the other person,

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:52.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asking ourselves,
‘How would I feel

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
if someone said this about me?’

00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
One situation that may tempt us
to engage in harmful gossip

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:05.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when we believe we
have been wronged by someone.

00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of applying the counsel

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:10.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 5:23, 24

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 18:15

00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk to the person privately,

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:19.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could start talking about it
to others who are not involved.

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:23.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine if after finally talking
with the person

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
you find out he actually
did not wrong you at all.

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:31.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will have made the situation much worse.

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:33.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whether we are right or wrong,

00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:36.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
engaging in hurtful speech

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:39.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
will never improve a situation.

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:46.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gossip requires a speaker and a listener.

00:09:46.148 --> 00:09:49.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it wrong to listen to harmful gossip?

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:51.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:55.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what Proverbs 17:4 says:

00:09:55.115 --> 00:10:00.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A wicked man pays attention
to hurtful speech,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a deceptive man
listens to a malicious tongue.”

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:10.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
In God’s eyes if we listen to hurtful,

00:10:10.922 --> 00:10:15.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
malicious speech, we too
bear a heavy responsibility.

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:17.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
By listening to the gossiper,

00:10:17.804 --> 00:10:21.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are encouraging him to go on.

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:23.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should you do?

00:10:23.393 --> 00:10:26.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without taking on an air
of self-righteousness,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could simply say,
“Let’s change the subject,”

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:35.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “I don’t really feel comfortable
talking about this;

00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:39.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
after all, she is not here
to defend herself.”

00:10:40.744 --> 00:10:43.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we find that a brother or sister

00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:46.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
likes to gossip,

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:49.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may find it easier to avoid harmful gossip

00:10:49.753 --> 00:10:54.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
by stopping close association
with that person.

00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:58.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 20:19 frankly counsels:

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not associate
with one who loves to gossip.”

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear friends,
let’s put away harmful gossip.

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing so, we will maintain

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:14.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
our precious peace and unity.

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:16.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook,

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:22.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:26.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put Away’ Peace Wreckers
—Uncontrolled Anger.”

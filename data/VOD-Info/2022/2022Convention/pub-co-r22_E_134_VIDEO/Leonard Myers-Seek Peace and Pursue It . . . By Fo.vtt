00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a simple fact
that to be at peace with others,

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be willing to forgive.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice two examples:

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
A father and his teenage daughter
didn’t get along.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Minor disagreements often developed
into shouting matches.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, the tension got so bad

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the daughter was asked
to leave the house.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, she recognized
that she was at fault

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked for her father’s forgiveness.

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
But instead of overlooking her mistakes,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
her father rejected her efforts.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was unwilling to extend forgiveness
to his own daughter.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s contrast that
with another example.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
A blameless man was condemned to die
for a crime he didn’t commit.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly before he died,
the innocent man stated:

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Father, forgive them,

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words of Jesus
are recorded at Luke 23:34,

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he may have been referring
to the Roman soldiers

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
who drove the nails into his hands and feet

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who didn’t know who he really was.

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:13.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or Jesus may have had in mind
some in the crowd

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
who demanded his execution

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
but would later exercise faith in him.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jesus
was willing to forgive freely.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we measure up
with regard to forgiveness?

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:32.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we like Jesus,
willing to forgive others freely?

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:37.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or at times, do we tend to be more
like the man who was unwilling to forgive?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Granting forgiveness isn’t always easy.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imperfection exerts
a powerful influence over us,

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:48.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes robbing us of compassion.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
When someone hurts us,

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may become resentful, or hold a grudge.

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:57.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perhaps some of us
were taught not to forgive others.

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little wonder that cultivating
a peaceful, forgiving spirit

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be difficult.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, the Bible encourages us
to forgive freely.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:15.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider another example
of forgiveness in the man Job.

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re familiar with his trials:

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:19.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of his possessions and ten children,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
a loathsome disease,
and his wife told him to curse God and die.

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three companions heard
about Job’s calamities,

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they agreed to go comfort him.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job 2:13 states that when they arrived,

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they sat . . . with him
for seven days and seven nights,”

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:39.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they didn’t say “a word to him.”

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe that was a good thing

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:44.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
because when they finally opened
their mouths,

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:48.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
they deeply hurt Job
with their baseless accusations.

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice something interesting
about this account.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Job chapter 42.

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:58.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of Job’s trials, Jehovah asked Job

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something
regarding these false accusers.

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice Jehovah’s words there at Job 42,
the <i>B </i> portion of verse 8:

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And my servant Job will pray for you.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will surely accept his request

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to deal with you
according to your foolishness.”

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:22.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
that after all the false accusations,

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah asked Job to pray
for the men who had tormented him?

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, would Job tell Jehovah,

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, after what they said to me,
I’m not going to forgive them”?

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:36.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Job be resentful?

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the latter portion of verse 9:

00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jehovah accepted Job’s prayer.”

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job followed Jehovah’s instructions.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:53.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result
of Job’s integrity and his forgiving spirit?

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:55.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10:

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After Job had prayed for his companions,

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:02.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah removed Job’s tribulation
and restored his prosperity.

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave him double what he had before.”

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account goes on to say
that Job had ten more children.

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:12.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lived for 140 more years,

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 17 states:

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:19.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Finally Job died,
after a long and satisfying life.”

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job was blessed for his forgiving spirit,

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he set a good example for us
to forgive freely.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization
with Celia and Haley,

00:04:30.874 --> 00:04:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice why Haley finally decides
to forgive freely.

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:02.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, it’s me.

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:04.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been thinking of you.

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:07.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great broadcast.

00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:09.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you like the new original song?

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give us a call.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wish she’d give it a rest.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:35.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, it’s just Emily
for the millionth time.

00:05:41.528 --> 00:05:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the problem, love?

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:46.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no problem.

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just . . .

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:53.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . difficult to let her back in?

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:09.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not that simple?

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:12.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not that simple.

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:15.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to forgive . . .

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . but not get burned again.

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:29.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:33.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t want to miss that opportunity.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:38.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never thought about it like that.

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time
when you wanted forgiveness

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:49.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when it meant everything.

00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:52.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did it feel?

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:53.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . just like your Nana does as well.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:54.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
She really deeply cares about you.

00:06:55.102 --> 00:06:57.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
You feel awful

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ve let everyone down.

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:04.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re very precious.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:13.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they forgive you,

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:18.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suddenly everything is OK.

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:32.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emily, sorry I haven’t been back to you.

00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:36.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have plans for tomorrow?

00:07:39.604 --> 00:07:42.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
What good reasoning on the part of Celia!

00:07:42.607 --> 00:07:46.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the expression
that really touched Haley’s heart?

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t want to miss that opportunity.”

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:58.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we’ve been wronged,
we don’t want to miss the opportunity

00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
to imitate Jehovah by forgiving freely.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please notice how this is highlighted
at Colossians 3:13.

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we considered Job’s example,
remember that Jehovah

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
instructed him to pray for his companions.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:16.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that helped Job
display a forgiving spirit.

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:20.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice here what Jehovah
instructs us to do at Colossians 3:13:

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:23.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue putting up with one another

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:27.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and forgiving one another freely

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:30.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if anyone has a cause for complaint
against another.

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:34.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:37.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must also do the same.”

00:08:38.663 --> 00:08:41.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek verb used here for “freely forgive”

00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
is related to a word often rendered

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:47.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“undeserved kindness” or “favor.”

00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:49.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
When used in the sense of forgiving,

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
this verb conveys the idea of doing so

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
freely, generously

00:08:54.304 --> 00:08:58.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just as when you, out of generosity,
give a gift to someone.

00:08:59.768 --> 00:09:04.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah requires that we
freely forgive others in imitation of him.

00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:06.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the end of the verse?

00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:10.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You <i>must</i>  also do the same.”

00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:15.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if the offense is minor,
it’s best to overlook it.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 13:5 states

00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:21.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
that love “does not keep account
of the injury.”

00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Proverbs 19:11 tells us

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “it is beauty . . .
to overlook an offense.”

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, if we feel that we need to talk
to our brother or sister

00:09:31.925 --> 00:09:34.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
about an offense that was committed
against us,

00:09:34.386 --> 00:09:37.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the best way to handle that?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we should ask Jehovah in prayer
for his guidance.

00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:44.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then with the brother’s good qualities
in mind,

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:47.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
graciously tell him
that we want to make peace.

00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:51.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen carefully and empathetically.

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:56.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
We shouldn’t interrupt, even if we
don’t agree with everything being said.

00:09:56.074 --> 00:10:00.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be that his viewpoint is wrong,
but it is his viewpoint.

00:10:01.872 --> 00:10:06.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when it’s our turn to speak,
we want to be gracious.

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:08.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell the brother
what we appreciate about him;

00:10:08.753 --> 00:10:12.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
apologize for any part that we played
in the misunderstanding.

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:18.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our humble efforts result in good,
thank Jehovah.

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:21.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they don’t,
keep asking Jehovah for guidance

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:24.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
while we look for another opportunity
to make peace.

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we truly forgive,

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:31.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make a heartfelt decision
to let go of resentment.

00:10:31.568 --> 00:10:34.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what peace that can bring us!

00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:38.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, forgiving doesn’t mean
that we approve of a wrong action,

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:42.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider it unimportant,
or pretend it didn’t happen.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, if we’ve been treated unjustly
and have a cause for complaint,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do what we can to pursue peace
and resolve the matter.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we confidently leave it
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, what will you
take away from this consideration?

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:04.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree that it can be
a challenge at times to forgive.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather than be like the man
we spoke of earlier

00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:09.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
who refused to forgive his own daughter,

00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:14.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
may we follow the examples of Jehovah,
Jesus, Job, and Haley

00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:18.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving freely, generously.

00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:20.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, a chance to forgive

00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:23.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a chance to imitate Jehovah,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we wouldn’t want to miss
that opportunity.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us pursue peace

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:32.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being willing to forgive freely.

00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:39.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the final talk
of this symposium,

00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:44.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Seek Peace and Pursue It’ . . .
By Using Our Gift of Speech Wisely.”

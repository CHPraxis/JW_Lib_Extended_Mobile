00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family peace is precious.

00:00:04.108 --> 00:00:06.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s even as the Bible proverb says:

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Better is a piece of dry bread
where there is peace

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
than a house full of feasting
along with quarreling.”

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what exactly is family peace?

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:23.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone might say, “As long as we’re not
arguing, our family is at peace.”

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is that real peace?

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might think of two countries
that were fighting

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have now agreed to a cease-fire.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the cease-fire mean that they’ve become

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
real friends who love one another?

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that genuine peace takes more work.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true in the family as well.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our heavenly Father knows
that the most satisfying family peace

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:52.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves more than an absence of arguing.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:56.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves a family’s well-being and unity.

00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is such peace in a family today
really possible?

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although none of us have a perfect family,
the answer is yes.

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it requires work
—perhaps breaking bad habits

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
that disrupt peace and adopting
new ones that promote it—

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
those efforts are worth it.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium,

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how Bible principles
can guide families to peace,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as a road map

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
guides travelers to a beautiful destination.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each of the talks,
we invite you husbands, fathers,

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:38.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
wives, mothers, children, teenagers

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be the traveler who studies the map

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then goes in the right direction.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
The focus of our first talk

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
is showing love and respect.

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would you say these two qualities

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
are so important to family peace?

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s simple:

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
because family members
who love and respect one another

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel secure and appreciated.

00:02:04.436 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, our relationships

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
are warm, close, and peaceful.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, showing love and respect
can be a challenge these days.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization notice why.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irene.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww,

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
you look so handsome there.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you look beautiful.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those came out so nice.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at you.

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:38.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Crazy, right?

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the day!

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at us.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re so surprised.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just knew you were going to do it.

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry, Olivia.

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:46.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s OK, Sue.

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:51.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, I’m all moved in.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the last box.

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad, are those the wedding photos?

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me see.

00:02:58.824 --> 00:02:59.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look it. Here’s . . .

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:02.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you all look beautiful.

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
That dress looks so nice.

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:03.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
You look so good.

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:05.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, look at you.

00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aww, that suits you.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice, you guys.

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:11.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it all came together.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:12.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really did.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:26.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia?

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know this is all new, baby.

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I cut in?

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:44.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s wrong?

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:11.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s the desk?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to get rid of it.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one is better for everyone.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mean it’s better for him!

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Max?

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:21.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:22.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you care?

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t talk to me like that. Get back here!

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:58.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Olivia, what do you think
about the desk?

00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:01.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come here, sweetie. Come here.

00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:13.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you never forget that I love you.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you like it.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:26.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, every family
faces challenges of some sort.

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consult our road map together

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:31.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible at Romans 12:10.

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:33.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you read it with me, please?

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Romans 12:10:

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:39.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In brotherly love

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:42.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have tender affection for one another.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:47.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:49.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:52.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regardless of the role we play in the family,

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:57.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
each of us needs to treat our family members
with love and respect.

00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:01.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to “take the lead,”
or initiative, to do so.

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:05.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us, let’s consider four good habits

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:08.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of us should work
to develop more fully.

00:06:08.597 --> 00:06:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Habit number one:

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:14.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regularly express tender affection.

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:16.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
When conveyed with sincerity,

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:18.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressions of affection

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:22.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
are like sunshine and water to plants.

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:25.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
They help everyone
in the family grow and thrive.

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:29.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video we just watched,
did you note how Olivia

00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
cherished her father’s gift (that green desk)
and his tender words?

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:39.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told her,
“So you never forget that I love you.”

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:41.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also saw warm affection

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the newly blended family
of Max and Irene looked at wedding photos.

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:48.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was encouraging.

00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:51.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s a question: How are we doing

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
in expressing tender affection in our family?

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:57.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that’s not one of our strengths,

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might relate to a husband
who mustered up the courage

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:03.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say “I love you” to his wife.

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brought her to tears—tears of joy.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:09.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said this, “I love you too,

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:14.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this is the first time in 25 years
you’ve said it like that.”

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to wait that long, of course,

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:24.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
but even an awkward attempt
at expressing affection in our family

00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:28.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an act of love,
and it can do so much good.

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a habit we all want to cultivate.

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:34.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a second habit:

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:36.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be kind in your actions,

00:07:36.893 --> 00:07:39.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
tone of voice, and choice of words.

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:44.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, we recall Irene’s reassurance
to her daughter, Olivia.

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:47.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “I know this is all new, baby.

00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:49.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient.”

00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:51.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom was kind

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what she said and how she said it.

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:57.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little later, though, Olivia was upset.

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:59.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we know she was hurt,

00:07:59.374 --> 00:08:02.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
her speech and actions were not so kind,
were they?

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:08.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us have been under tremendous stress,

00:08:08.383 --> 00:08:11.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely we didn’t always treat others

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:14.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our family as kindly
as we would have liked.

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s in the past.

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:18.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can we all do now?

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:22.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can pray to Jehovah
to help us “take the lead”

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
in showing kindness.

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:28.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
every day greeting one another kindly,

00:08:28.403 --> 00:08:31.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day saying “please” and “thank you,”

00:08:31.156 --> 00:08:35.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
sharing little gifts,
making time to talk, really listening

00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:38.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of these are acts of kindness.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good habit we all want to cultivate.

00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:45.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s habit number three?

00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:49.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be quick to apologize and forgive freely.

00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:53.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, Olivia’s new stepsister, Sue,

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:57.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
apologized after she bumped into Olivia
with a box by mistake.

00:08:57.432 --> 00:09:00.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
That apology promoted peace.

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:04.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you and I realize we’ve hurt someone

00:09:04.022 --> 00:09:06.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
even unintentionally, what should we do?

00:09:06.608 --> 00:09:09.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should make amends quickly.

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:12.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
A mother named Marina said this:

00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:15.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We try to set a good example
for our children

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in forgiving others
. . . and not getting offended.

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:21.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I am wrong, I apologize to my children.

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:26.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want them to learn to do the same
in their dealings with others.”

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:29.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good habit, wouldn’t you agree?

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider one more,
a fourth habit:

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:37.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your family members feel respected.

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:41.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
An article in the <i>Awake!</i>  magazine
once made this insightful comment:

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:46.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Respect is in the eye of the beholder.”

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:48.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we think
we’re showing respect in the family,

00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:54.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
good questions to ask ourselves are:

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:58.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do my family members
feel that I respect them?

00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is there more I can do to help my mate,
my children, or my parents

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:05.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel loved and respected?’

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:11.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, when we fulfill
our God-given role in the family

00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:13.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
by developing good habits such as these,

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:18.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show respect both for Jehovah
and for all of our family members.

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:22.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s think about Olivia and her mom.

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:25.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next video,
note how peace can be restored

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:28.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
by showing love and respect.

00:10:39.493 --> 00:10:40.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK, Mom.

00:10:41.786 --> 00:10:42.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
You didn’t know.

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:45.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad did that for her just before he died.

00:10:49.503 --> 00:10:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anything I can do to help?

00:10:57.469 --> 00:10:59.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 12:10:

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia?

00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:19.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made your favorite tonight.

00:11:23.286 --> 00:11:24.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:36.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell you
that I didn’t handle that so well today.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
You had good reason
to be upset about the desk.

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:46.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, you didn’t know.

00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:52.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just one of those things
that Dad did just for me.

00:11:55.777 --> 00:11:57.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know he’s my stepdad now, but

00:11:58.947 --> 00:12:01.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just wish he would have checked first.

00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:03.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t Max.

00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:05.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:10.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to surprise Max
with a place for him to do his work.

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:17.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he didn’t make you get rid of the desk?

00:12:17.382 --> 00:12:18.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:25.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought you both didn’t care.

00:12:26.349 --> 00:12:30.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will never ever stop caring about you.

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:48.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful outcome!

00:12:48.913 --> 00:12:53.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
The well-being and unity
of the family were restored.

00:12:53.335 --> 00:12:57.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mom, Irene,
applied the principle at Romans 12:10.

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:02.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
She ‘took the lead,’ or the initiative,
to talk kindly with her daughter.

00:13:02.427 --> 00:13:06.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though Olivia was upset,
she too showed love and respect

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:08.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being willing to listen to her mom.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
the misunderstanding was cleared up,

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:17.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Irene used the opportunity to reassure
her precious daughter of her love,

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:22.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying, “I will never ever
stop caring about you.”

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how our hearts were touched

00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see their warm embrace!

00:13:28.203 --> 00:13:32.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we “take the lead”
in applying Bible principles,

00:13:32.707 --> 00:13:35.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
we promote genuine family peace.

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may all of us be determined

00:13:38.838 --> 00:13:43.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep showing our family
that we truly love and respect them

00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:45.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
in word and action.

00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:49.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now please listen as Brother Robert Luccioni,

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:53.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Publishing Committee,
considers the next talk

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:55.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this symposium, with the theme 

00:13:55.689 --> 00:14:00.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Follow the Road Map to Family Peace
—Improve Communication.”

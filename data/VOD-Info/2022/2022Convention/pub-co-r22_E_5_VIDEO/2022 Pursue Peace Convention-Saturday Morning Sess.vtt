WEBVTT

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
We extend a warm welcome to all.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s session will begin
with a music-video presentation

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will remind us of the many blessings
in store for Jehovah’s servants

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and motivate us to share
these precious truths with others.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy.

00:10:32.152 --> 00:10:34.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this session and the next,

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:37.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy the talks and videos

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:40.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the Saturday heading on your program.

00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:43.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture theme for these two sessions

00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:46.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
is taken from 2 Peter 3:14,

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:48.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we are admonished

00:10:48.543 --> 00:10:53.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be found . . . spotless
and unblemished and in peace.”

00:10:55.175 --> 00:10:57.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
These sessions will highlight

00:10:57.219 --> 00:11:01.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we can individually do
to ‘pursue peace with others.’

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:05.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin,
please join in singing song number 58,

00:11:05.727 --> 00:11:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Searching for Friends of Peace.”

00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 58.

00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:10.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s people,

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:14.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are proud to witness
about “the God of peace”

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:16.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to proclaim his Kingdom.

00:14:16.876 --> 00:14:20.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we give an effective witness

00:14:20.046 --> 00:14:22.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help interested ones to progress?

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:28.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our first symposium for this session
will address these questions.

00:14:28.972 --> 00:14:33.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:14:33.143 --> 00:14:37.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
will deliver the first talk of the symposium,

00:14:37.147 --> 00:14:41.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’
—Maintain Your Zeal.”

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:54.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium is
about sharing “the good news of peace.”

00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:59.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege it is to help humble people
find peace with Jehovah!

00:15:00.962 --> 00:15:03.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 6:15,

00:15:03.298 --> 00:15:05.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
in describing
a Christian’s “complete suit of armor,”

00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:07.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
it mentions our feet.

00:15:07.886 --> 00:15:09.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, back at that time,

00:15:09.888 --> 00:15:13.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking of Roman soldiers,
Paul knew that often they marched

00:15:13.183 --> 00:15:15.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
for hundreds of miles on Roman highways,

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:18.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
crisscrossing the empire.

00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at Ephesians 6:15, he said this:

00:15:22.358 --> 00:15:26.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Having your feet shod in readiness

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:30.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
[in readiness] to declare
the good news of peace”

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:34.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, ready to share “the good news of peace”

00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:37.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
on every suitable occasion.

00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:41.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium, we’ll discuss five ways

00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:45.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain ready to preach and teach.

00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:51.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d first like to discuss
why it’s important to maintain your zeal.

00:15:51.554 --> 00:15:53.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as an analogy,

00:15:53.848 --> 00:15:57.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
zeal has often been linked to fire.

00:15:57.185 --> 00:15:59.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
We even use the expression
—don’t we?—

00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:02.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has a fiery zeal for his beliefs.”

00:16:02.732 --> 00:16:06.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does “a fiery zeal” indicate?

00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:09.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please find Romans 1:14, 15,

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:12.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here it does not
actually use the word “zeal,”

00:16:12.784 --> 00:16:15.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the sense of the word is evident.

00:16:15.662 --> 00:16:18.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
You say: “We’re on fire,”
“We’re stoked up,” “We are ready.”

00:16:18.498 --> 00:16:19.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you find it?

00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:21.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 1:14, 15:

00:16:24.462 --> 00:16:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Both to Greeks and to foreigners,
both to wise and to senseless ones,

00:16:28.716 --> 00:16:32.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a debtor; so I am eager

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you see, ready with fiery zeal, eager]

00:16:35.348 --> 00:16:37.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
to declare the good news.”

00:16:39.102 --> 00:16:43.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zealous evangelizers are eager to declare
the good news—they’re “on fire.”

00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want others to find peace with Jehovah.

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there something
that can dampen that flame,

00:16:53.032 --> 00:16:57.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that could even extinguish
the eager desire

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the readiness—
to find those who

00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:02.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
even unknowingly yearn for peace?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:17:04.794 --> 00:17:08.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can be difficult
to remain eager with fiery zeal

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:11.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we face such problems as

00:17:11.426 --> 00:17:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
an unresponsive territory,

00:17:14.178 --> 00:17:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
criticism, or outright opposition to the work

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:22.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and then there are
the pressures of daily life.

00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:26.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those issues can also be likened to a fire,

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:29.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destructive fires like the wildfires

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:33.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have plagued the western part
of the United States year after year.

00:17:33.615 --> 00:17:38.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those problems can threaten
our zeal and enthusiasm.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do?

00:17:42.957 --> 00:17:47.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s an English expression
that originates with firefighters.

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:51.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expression is “Fight fire with fire.”

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the path of a raging wildfire,

00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:58.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
one technique is to ignite a controlled fire.

00:17:58.014 --> 00:18:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
That controlled fire
consumes combustible materials.

00:18:01.684 --> 00:18:05.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the wildfire advances to that point,

00:18:05.104 --> 00:18:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no fuel left
and the wildfire goes out.

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:11.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fight fire with fire.

00:18:11.402 --> 00:18:15.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your zeal for the ministry
burning brightly.

00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:18.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now please find 1 Timothy 4:16.

00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:24.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our zeal fades—the flame smolders—

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:28.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might miss out on opportunities
to help others to gain life,

00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:31.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
a life of peace with God.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at 1 Timothy 4:16 with me.

00:18:36.636 --> 00:18:40.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Pay constant attention
to yourself and to your teaching”

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you see, the flame, the temperature.

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:46.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Pay attention to your zeal and teaching.’

00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Persevere in these things,

00:18:48.564 --> 00:18:51.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for by doing this
you will save both yourself

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:53.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who listen to you.”

00:18:53.236 --> 00:18:57.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, share “the good news
of peace” with zeal.

00:18:58.783 --> 00:19:02.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following video,
note how a couple realized

00:19:02.662 --> 00:19:04.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the flame had gone out.

00:19:04.956 --> 00:19:08.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
They still had some glowing embers left,

00:19:08.209 --> 00:19:11.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they now find a way to fan the coals

00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:14.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and regain their fiery zeal.

00:19:39.032 --> 00:19:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t remember when our routine service day

00:19:42.618 --> 00:19:44.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
became so,

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
well,

00:19:45.913 --> 00:19:48.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
routine.

00:19:55.673 --> 00:19:59.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal wasn’t what it used to be.

00:20:09.103 --> 00:20:11.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were finally starting to notice.

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:17.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone wants to listen.

00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:20.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t want to be the reason.

00:20:29.207 --> 00:20:31.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t take much research to find

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:35.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
great ideas
and set a few simple goals,

00:20:38.382 --> 00:20:41.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
like working with those
who encourage us.

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:46.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Ryota and Ami, we’re always talking

00:20:46.724 --> 00:20:48.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how we can reach the heart.

00:20:49.685 --> 00:20:51.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got back to basics:

00:20:51.687 --> 00:20:53.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be friendly,

00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:57.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen,

00:20:57.485 --> 00:21:00.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
let the conversation progress naturally,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
try to share an appealing Scriptural thought,

00:21:08.704 --> 00:21:10.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep trying.

00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:12.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal

00:21:12.834 --> 00:21:15.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
can attract an honest person

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the truth.

00:21:21.634 --> 00:21:26.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the video, what wildfires, or problems,

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:30.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
did the couple face that sucked the oxygen
out of their ministry?

00:21:30.893 --> 00:21:33.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of the four we mentioned earlier,

00:21:33.437 --> 00:21:35.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seems the couple’s zeal was waning

00:21:35.773 --> 00:21:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of seemingly unresponsive territory.

00:21:40.736 --> 00:21:44.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as tired as the husband looked
in that first scene,

00:21:44.407 --> 00:21:49.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pressures of daily life
might have been having a toll on him.

00:21:49.203 --> 00:21:51.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did they come to realize

00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:54.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they needed
to fight fire with fire?

00:21:56.252 --> 00:21:59.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember their kitchen-table talk?

00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:04.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
The husband mused
that “not everyone wants to listen.”

00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:08.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he added,
“We just didn’t want to be the reason,”

00:22:08.764 --> 00:22:10.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see, the reason for them not listening.

00:22:10.892 --> 00:22:14.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
They decided to fight fire with fire.

00:22:14.103 --> 00:22:17.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reignited their own
controlled fire of zeal

00:22:17.732 --> 00:22:21.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counteract the problems
they were succumbing to.

00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:25.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what were some
of the techniques they used?

00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:29.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first was to pray to Jehovah.

00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:33.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could it be that the husband borrowed
the words of Romans 12:11 in his prayer?

00:22:33.915 --> 00:22:36.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he may well have asked
Jehovah to help them

00:22:36.834 --> 00:22:39.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a couple to “be aglow with the spirit.”

00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:43.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember he said earlier,

00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:46.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t remember when
our routine service day

00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:50.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
became so, well, routine.”

00:22:51.891 --> 00:22:56.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fight the wildfire by, again,
becoming “aglow with the spirit.”

00:22:56.687 --> 00:22:59.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ensure that any lack of response

00:22:59.899 --> 00:23:02.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not due to our lackluster approach.

00:23:04.403 --> 00:23:08.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what else did you notice
they did to rekindle their zeal?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did some research,
looking for suggestions

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:14.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
to invigorate their ministry.

00:23:14.497 --> 00:23:17.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and regular Bible study
helps us to remember

00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:21.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
why we endure in the disciple-making work.

00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:25.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, review Jesus’ attitude
toward the ministry.

00:23:25.758 --> 00:23:30.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostles’ bold witnessing
despite fiery opposition

00:23:30.012 --> 00:23:34.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the disposition of Paul,
Aquila and Priscilla, Stephen,

00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:36.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other Bible characters

00:23:36.227 --> 00:23:40.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these can infuse us with similar zeal.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, keep your ministry fresh.

00:23:46.404 --> 00:23:47.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:23:48.864 --> 00:23:52.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of having a number
of phone calls that go unanswered,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is similar to having no one at home
when in the door-to-door work,

00:23:57.623 --> 00:24:00.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
change the time of day for witnessing

00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:02.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
to when more people are home.

00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:07.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Participate in various forms of the ministry.

00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:09.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, ironically,

00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:12.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pandemic more or less forced some of us

00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:16.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were staunch door-to-door Witnesses
to branch out.

00:24:16.517 --> 00:24:19.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried phone witnessing and letter writing.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we have
a variety of preaching activities,

00:24:22.315 --> 00:24:26.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this can keep us
more fully engaged and enthused.

00:24:27.903 --> 00:24:32.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice what the couple
in the video set as a goal?

00:24:32.283 --> 00:24:35.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Periodically, they decided in advance

00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:38.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in the ministry
with someone specific.

00:24:38.914 --> 00:24:42.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they determined
to talk about encouraging subjects

00:24:42.335 --> 00:24:45.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
when in between calls,
whether in phone witnessing

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:47.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in the public ministry.

00:24:49.425 --> 00:24:52.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah values our work in the ministry

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of the response we receive.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 6:10—are you familiar with that?

00:24:59.602 --> 00:25:01.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course you are.

00:25:01.604 --> 00:25:03.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not say

00:25:03.606 --> 00:25:07.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah does not forget
the number of return visits you make.

00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:12.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not say he does not forget
how many Bible studies you conduct.

00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:17.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it says he does not
“forget your work [your effort]

00:25:17.536 --> 00:25:20.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love you showed for his name.”

00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:24.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our zeal for the ministry demonstrates

00:25:24.752 --> 00:25:29.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have a deep love
for Jehovah and Jesus.

00:25:29.131 --> 00:25:33.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
If (like the couple in the video)
you detect that your

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
routine of service is becoming, well,

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:41.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
very routine, then fight fire with fire.

00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:43.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maintain that fiery zeal.

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:47.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be ready to share “the good news of peace.”

00:25:49.276 --> 00:25:52.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:55.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:25:55.616 --> 00:26:00.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’
—Prepare Well.”

00:26:08.379 --> 00:26:12.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you think and how would you feel
if I showed up to give this talk

00:26:12.383 --> 00:26:15.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had done nothing to prepare
what to say to you

00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:18.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if I had not bothered
to study the outline I was given,

00:26:18.055 --> 00:26:21.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not remember the theme,
had no idea what the main points are,

00:26:21.642 --> 00:26:25.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would have to guess
at what scriptures to use to support them,

00:26:25.104 --> 00:26:27.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then, as I spoke,
I would ramble incoherently?

00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:29.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d make a very bad impression.

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:31.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know how I would feel.

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:33.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be a nervous wreck,

00:26:33.904 --> 00:26:36.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you would wonder why
I did not think enough of you

00:26:36.407 --> 00:26:39.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put all the time and effort
that was necessary

00:26:39.201 --> 00:26:43.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
into preparing the talk so that you could get
the most benefit from it.

00:26:44.623 --> 00:26:47.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see where I’m going with this?

00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:49.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could the same things be said

00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:53.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you engaged in the ministry
without first preparing what to say?

00:26:53.382 --> 00:26:56.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did not review the sample
conversations that had been provided,

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:59.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not think of how
to start a conversation,

00:26:59.513 --> 00:27:02.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
and did not know
what scripture to share,

00:27:02.308 --> 00:27:04.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
how nervous would you be?

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what would the householder
think of you?

00:27:06.645 --> 00:27:10.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would likely be a very short,
uncomfortable conversation.

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:14.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the other person may not care
to have you call again.

00:27:15.696 --> 00:27:20.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should take some time
to prepare well before we preach.

00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:21.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:27:21.744 --> 00:27:24.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we have the best message ever

00:27:24.413 --> 00:27:27.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“the good news of peace” 
to share with people—

00:27:27.249 --> 00:27:32.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we should do our best so that they
will want to listen to what we have to say.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus helped his disciples
to prepare for the ministry.

00:27:37.134 --> 00:27:42.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke chapter 10 reports that before
sending out 70 disciples to preach,

00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:45.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
he shared with them a pleasant way
to greet each householder,

00:27:45.935 --> 00:27:48.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told them what to talk about
(the Kingdom of God),

00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:53.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he told them how to respond
to the varied reactions

00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:55.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would get in their territory.

00:27:55.361 --> 00:27:57.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
because the disciples

00:27:57.404 --> 00:27:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
were fully prepared for the ministry,

00:27:59.615 --> 00:28:03.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoyed some thrilling experiences.

00:28:03.285 --> 00:28:05.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are prepared,

00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:10.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are more poised and enthusiastic
and can truly enjoy the ministry.

00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:13.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:28:13.879 --> 00:28:17.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the good results of preparing well.

00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:30.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d made some good changes,

00:28:31.063 --> 00:28:34.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we weren’t done.

00:28:35.776 --> 00:28:39.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Yuri what she planned to talk about.

00:28:40.447 --> 00:28:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
That started the usual scramble.

00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:47.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we got it—the sample conversation.

00:28:47.788 --> 00:28:49.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll do.

00:28:53.752 --> 00:28:58.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for that to work,
I had to remember the scripture.

00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:20.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were both a little forgetful that morning.

00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:23.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:29:29.413 --> 00:29:32.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d been relying on our experience

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:34.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not enough on Jehovah.

00:29:37.338 --> 00:29:40.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first we prepared our hearts.

00:29:42.926 --> 00:29:46.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we prepared our minds

00:29:49.892 --> 00:29:54.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found new ways
to use our preaching tools.

00:29:58.609 --> 00:30:02.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even a little preparation for initial calls

00:30:04.156 --> 00:30:06.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our returns visits

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
went a long way.

00:30:23.384 --> 00:30:27.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
The husband said,
“Yeah, we needed to prepare better.”

00:30:27.763 --> 00:30:30.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought that
about your ministry?

00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the couple in the video,

00:30:32.643 --> 00:30:36.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can first prepare
our heart and our mind

00:30:36.563 --> 00:30:39.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then see how best to use
our preaching tools.

00:30:39.692 --> 00:30:44.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal should be the same
as that of the apostle Paul.

00:30:44.071 --> 00:30:48.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 9:23,

00:30:48.075 --> 00:30:50.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wrote that he wanted

00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:53.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “do all things for the sake
of the good news,

00:30:53.872 --> 00:30:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to share it with others.”

00:30:57.126 --> 00:31:02.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about some specific things
that we can do to prepare well,

00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:06.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning with what we can say
on the initial call,

00:31:06.427 --> 00:31:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether that is done
in person or over the telephone.

00:31:10.806 --> 00:31:14.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each issue of the
<i>Christian Life and Ministry—Meeting Workbook </i>

00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:18.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides us with sample conversations
that give us some helpful ideas.

00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:23.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you may modify the samples
or use something entirely different.

00:31:23.402 --> 00:31:25.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps a subject from a previous month

00:31:25.863 --> 00:31:30.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a different scripture would have
wider appeal in your territory.

00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:35.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your opening words may be
the most important part of the presentation,

00:31:35.581 --> 00:31:37.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
so think it through.

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:40.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the introduction
does not arouse interest,

00:31:40.711 --> 00:31:43.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other person may terminate
the conversation

00:31:43.547 --> 00:31:46.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we can give a witness.

00:31:46.008 --> 00:31:49.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will be more effective if we
carefully prepare

00:31:49.678 --> 00:31:54.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first sentence or two that we will say
after giving a customary greeting.

00:31:55.517 --> 00:31:59.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might say,
“Many people are concerned about . . . ”

00:31:59.605 --> 00:32:03.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “I would like
to get your opinion on . . . ”

00:32:03.692 --> 00:32:05.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
or say something else.

00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:08.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then pick a topic that is of local interest

00:32:08.864 --> 00:32:11.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask a well-worded viewpoint question

00:32:11.283 --> 00:32:14.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would draw the person
into the conversation.

00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:20.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about preparing
for our return visits?

00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:24.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
That actually begins
on the initial call by leaving a question

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the person to think about
until you call again.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how the sample initial calls
and return visits

00:32:31.762 --> 00:32:34.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
are set up in the <i>Meeting Workbook</i>.

00:32:34.348 --> 00:32:38.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
By leaving a thought-provoking question
at the end of every visit,

00:32:38.894 --> 00:32:43.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can keep the chain of conversations
going as long as possible.

00:32:44.858 --> 00:32:46.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can illustrate it this way:

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a freight train
with an engine at the front,

00:32:49.696 --> 00:32:53.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
a caboose at the rear,
and many cars in between.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:58.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
What keeps all of those cars
moving together down the train track?

00:32:58.455 --> 00:33:02.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a device called a coupler
at the back of each train car

00:33:02.793 --> 00:33:07.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
that latches onto the coupler
at the front of the car behind it.

00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:09.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
By being coupled, or linked, together,

00:33:09.758 --> 00:33:14.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
the cars all run as a unit along the track.

00:33:14.513 --> 00:33:19.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question that we leave
with a householder at the end of one visit

00:33:19.476 --> 00:33:23.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what we can latch onto at the beginning
of our next visit

00:33:23.772 --> 00:33:28.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can keep the train of thought
going from one conversation to the next.

00:33:29.862 --> 00:33:33.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, on the initial call
you could ask,

00:33:33.907 --> 00:33:37.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why is there so much suffering
in the world?”

00:33:37.452 --> 00:33:40.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
After discussing that, raise the question,

00:33:40.747 --> 00:33:44.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How does God feel about our suffering?”

00:33:44.209 --> 00:33:48.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t answer the question
until your next visit.

00:33:48.005 --> 00:33:51.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
After answering that question
on the first return visit,

00:33:51.717 --> 00:33:56.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
leave the person with this question,
“What will God do to end our suffering?”

00:33:56.722 --> 00:34:00.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will be discussed on your next visit.

00:34:00.934 --> 00:34:05.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is also important to have an objective
in mind for each return visit.

00:34:06.773 --> 00:34:08.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before making the call,

00:34:08.275 --> 00:34:11.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what you want to accomplish
on that call.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you raised a question the last time,

00:34:13.822 --> 00:34:18.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re objective will surely include
answering that question from the Bible.

00:34:19.494 --> 00:34:22.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
the ultimate objective is to try to start

00:34:22.122 --> 00:34:26.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Bible study
in the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  brochure.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about preparing
for the Bible studies that we conduct?

00:34:32.883 --> 00:34:35.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we know the material very well,

00:34:35.135 --> 00:34:40.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should prepare for each study session
with our student in mind.

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:43.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means thinking about and anticipating

00:34:43.352 --> 00:34:46.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
the views and needs of that individual.

00:34:46.647 --> 00:34:51.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
What points might he struggle
to understand or accept?

00:34:51.526 --> 00:34:54.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also means getting familiar
with the lesson

00:34:54.279 --> 00:34:57.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be covered
in our interactive Bible course.

00:34:57.783 --> 00:34:59.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read the lesson carefully,

00:34:59.952 --> 00:35:03.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
look up the “read” scriptures
to see how they apply,

00:35:03.497 --> 00:35:06.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
watch the videos that will be shown
during the lesson,

00:35:06.875 --> 00:35:10.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and review the items
in the “Explore” section

00:35:10.128 --> 00:35:15.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you will know which of those
will be especially helpful to your student.

00:35:15.008 --> 00:35:19.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will be well-prepared
to conduct the study.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:25.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since it is ‘God who makes
the seed of truth grow’ in a person’s heart,

00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:29.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should ask for Jehovah’s blessing
on our preparation for the study

00:35:29.523 --> 00:35:32.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can best help
the student spiritually.

00:35:34.361 --> 00:35:36.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will be more effective
in our ministry

00:35:36.613 --> 00:35:39.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we stay up-to-date
with the latest material

00:35:39.032 --> 00:35:44.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and features found
on jw.org and on <i>JW Library®.</i>

00:35:44.037 --> 00:35:47.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
So learn how to navigate the website
and the app.

00:35:47.958 --> 00:35:51.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two very helpful features on the website

00:35:51.003 --> 00:35:55.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
are “Bible Questions Answered”
under the Bible Teachings tab

00:35:55.882 --> 00:36:00.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Frequently Asked Questions”
under the About Us tab.

00:36:00.804 --> 00:36:04.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can also be found
on the app under “Article Series.”

00:36:06.435 --> 00:36:10.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul described himself
at 1 Corinthians 3:10

00:36:10.105 --> 00:36:13.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a skilled master builder.”

00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:15.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is because he was engaging

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:19.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a spiritual construction work
to build Christian disciples.

00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are doing the same sort of work
when we engage in the ministry.

00:36:24.453 --> 00:36:29.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to build effectively,
we must learn to use our tools well.

00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:34.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
We especially need to develop skill
in using our principal tool, God’s Word,

00:36:34.463 --> 00:36:38.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as learn how to make effective use
of the publications

00:36:38.258 --> 00:36:41.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our Teaching Toolbox.

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:44.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
A builder who prepares
before starting to work

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:48.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
avoids mistakes and frustration.

00:36:48.185 --> 00:36:51.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what the brother said
at the end of the video?

00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Even a little preparation goes a long way.’

00:36:55.317 --> 00:37:00.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is what will help you
to do your best in the ministry.

00:37:00.155 --> 00:37:04.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Paul recommended
at 2 Timothy 2:15

00:37:04.993 --> 00:37:08.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
—please follow along in your Bible,
if you will—

00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:13.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s 2 Timothy 2:15:

00:37:13.043 --> 00:37:17.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do your utmost to present
yourself approved to God,

00:37:17.923 --> 00:37:20.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,

00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:24.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
handling the word of the truth aright.”

00:37:24.971 --> 00:37:28.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will experience great joy
in the spiritual building work

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is taking place now
because you will be ready

00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:36.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and well-prepared to share
“the good news of peace.”

00:37:37.818 --> 00:37:40.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Anthony Morris,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:37:40.654 --> 00:37:43.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of the symposium,

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’
—Take the Initiative.”

00:37:56.002 --> 00:37:58.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this part of the symposium,

00:37:58.463 --> 00:38:00.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Share ‘the Good News of Peace,’”

00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:05.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to discuss
the need to take the initiative.

00:38:05.178 --> 00:38:07.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re going to look

00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:10.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
at why we should take the initiative,

00:38:10.642 --> 00:38:12.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to take the initiative,

00:38:12.894 --> 00:38:16.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then a concluding thought
about who’s helping

00:38:16.857 --> 00:38:20.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
in directing us in our preaching work.

00:38:20.068 --> 00:38:24.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first of all, why take the initiative?

00:38:24.823 --> 00:38:27.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about it.

00:38:27.409 --> 00:38:30.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing about being Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:38:30.162 --> 00:38:33.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we’re never off duty.

00:38:33.498 --> 00:38:38.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never stop being
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:38:38.503 --> 00:38:40.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
—wherever we are or whatever we’re doing.

00:38:40.839 --> 00:38:42.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it isn’t just when we’re out

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:47.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the formal preaching work
with a congregation group

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:51.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
all the time.

00:38:51.725 --> 00:38:55.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no such thing as being off duty

00:38:55.353 --> 00:38:58.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:38:58.648 --> 00:39:01.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to give you an idea of how 

00:39:01.902 --> 00:39:06.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
significant this is
with informal witnessing,

00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:11.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will tell you a statistic:
A survey was taken some years ago

00:39:11.828 --> 00:39:14.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and you’d be surprised, possibly),

00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:19.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one group
of over 200 baptized Witnesses,

00:39:19.252 --> 00:39:22.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
now notice, over 40 percent

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:26.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been contacted by informal witnessing.

00:39:26.593 --> 00:39:28.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:39:28.595 --> 00:39:31.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the door-to-door work is crucial.

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:34.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, during COVID-19
that’s been inhibited

00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:39.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
—letter writing has its place
and also phone witnessing.

00:39:39.606 --> 00:39:42.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the point is, there are other times

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we can do some witnessing informally.

00:39:45.654 --> 00:39:48.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s examine how to do it?

00:39:48.949 --> 00:39:53.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the best example
of how to do informal witnessing

00:39:53.495 --> 00:39:56.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
is, of course, Christ Jesus.

00:39:56.289 --> 00:40:00.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s an account that all of us
are familiar with in the Bible book of John.

00:40:00.335 --> 00:40:04.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please find John chapter 4,

00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:09.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to take a look
at how Jesus took the initiative

00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:12.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then imitate him

00:40:12.931 --> 00:40:15.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
—do just as he did.

00:40:15.141 --> 00:40:18.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice here in John chapter 4

00:40:18.853 --> 00:40:23.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
(we get the context),
they’ve been traveling through Samaria.

00:40:23.858 --> 00:40:27.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then verse 6, we’ll read:

00:40:27.279 --> 00:40:30.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, Jacob’s well was there.

00:40:30.115 --> 00:40:34.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Jesus, tired out as he was
from the journey,

00:40:34.494 --> 00:40:36.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was sitting at the well.

00:40:36.579 --> 00:40:39.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about the sixth hour.”

00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:43.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s interesting, is it not?

00:40:43.253 --> 00:40:45.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was tired.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a perfect man, but human,

00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:51.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his journey tired him out.

00:40:51.052 --> 00:40:55.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s there
about noon sitting at the well.

00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:59.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now notice what happens in verse 7:

00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:03.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:07.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to her: ‘Give me a drink.’”

00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:12.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Real simple—“Give me a drink.”

00:41:12.699 --> 00:41:15.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we learn from this?

00:41:15.285 --> 00:41:18.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you noticed, Jesus was tired.

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get tired

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:23.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of being imperfect.

00:41:23.293 --> 00:41:26.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a perfect man gets tired out,
certainly we get tired.

00:41:26.463 --> 00:41:30.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you may feel:
‘Well, you know, maybe I could witness

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to this person
—take the initiative.

00:41:32.427 --> 00:41:34.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I just don’t feel like it.
I’m tired.’

00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:37.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not with Jesus.

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, to imitate Jesus,
even in the case when you’re tired,

00:41:42.645 --> 00:41:44.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re thinking of others.

00:41:44.689 --> 00:41:48.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to take the opportunity
to start a conversation.

00:41:48.735 --> 00:41:50.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the initial goal.

00:41:50.737 --> 00:41:53.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice something else here

00:41:53.365 --> 00:41:55.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we learn in the 9th verse

00:41:55.909 --> 00:41:59.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
of John chapter 4:

00:41:59.371 --> 00:42:02.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the Samaritan woman said to him:

00:42:02.791 --> 00:42:07.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘How is it that you, despite being a Jew,

00:42:07.462 --> 00:42:11.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask me for a drink even though
I am a Samaritan woman?’”

00:42:11.466 --> 00:42:15.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we learn more here in parentheses:

00:42:15.178 --> 00:42:19.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For Jews have no dealings
with the Samaritans.”

00:42:19.265 --> 00:42:21.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it went both ways.

00:42:21.518 --> 00:42:24.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the way prejudice was
—“no dealings”—

00:42:24.687 --> 00:42:27.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on top of that, she’s a woman.

00:42:27.148 --> 00:42:30.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And women were not treated very nicely

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
during that period in man’s history.

00:42:33.113 --> 00:42:37.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she’s a Samaritan, she’s a woman,

00:42:37.492 --> 00:42:40.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus asks her for a drink.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
He starts a conversation with her.

00:42:42.956 --> 00:42:46.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these are the things we learn from this:

00:42:46.084 --> 00:42:50.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t make any assumptions about her

00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:54.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obviously knew that she was a woman

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:58.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a Samaritan traveling
through Samaria at that time.

00:42:58.847 --> 00:43:02.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t refuse
to speak to her

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of that.

00:43:04.644 --> 00:43:06.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the lesson for us is:

00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:10.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t judge people by what you see,

00:43:10.275 --> 00:43:14.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on their culture
or color of their skin.

00:43:14.988 --> 00:43:17.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world is filled with judges.

00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:20.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:22.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t do that.

00:43:22.328 --> 00:43:25.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
We leave the judging
to Jehovah and Jesus Christ.

00:43:25.957 --> 00:43:29.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t judge
whether you think they’ll converse with you.

00:43:29.627 --> 00:43:31.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wrong.

00:43:31.713 --> 00:43:33.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus didn’t do that,

00:43:33.965 --> 00:43:37.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he set the perfect example for us.

00:43:37.427 --> 00:43:41.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go ahead, and if you’re
a little nervous about it,

00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:45.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we beg Jehovah for his spirit to help us

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:47.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to give us the courage to witness

00:43:47.854 --> 00:43:51.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his beautiful name and purposes.

00:43:51.483 --> 00:43:55.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he also teaches us

00:43:55.195 --> 00:43:57.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
something else interesting here.

00:43:57.238 --> 00:43:59.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is where in taking the initiative,

00:43:59.324 --> 00:44:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
you start a conversation;

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:05.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
you don’t rush into things.

00:44:05.163 --> 00:44:09.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice, we read verse 9,

00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:12.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then they had
this conversation take place

00:44:12.086 --> 00:44:15.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
through these following verses here.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get to verse 24 where he mentions

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:22.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘God is a Spirit, and you
must worship him with spirit and truth.’

00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:25.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now here’s what happens

00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:27.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
after they had this fine conversation

00:44:27.268 --> 00:44:29.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after he simply asked for a drink.

00:44:29.729 --> 00:44:31.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 25:

00:44:31.773 --> 00:44:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The woman said to him:

00:44:33.816 --> 00:44:38.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I know that Messiah is coming,
who is called Christ.

00:44:38.238 --> 00:44:43.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever that one comes,
he will declare all things to us openly.’”

00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:45.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
She spoke out of her heart.

00:44:45.995 --> 00:44:48.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice verse 26:

00:44:48.498 --> 00:44:52.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus said to her: ‘I am he,

00:44:52.919 --> 00:44:55.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one speaking to you.’”

00:44:55.547 --> 00:44:57.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
My, what a moment!

00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:02.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she’s blessed
with having the Messiah himself speak to her.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, give it some thought.

00:45:06.182 --> 00:45:09.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if Jesus, rather than saying:

00:45:09.602 --> 00:45:12.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give me a drink,”
started off with saying:

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:16.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I am the Messiah.
Give me a drink.’

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, I don’t know.

00:45:18.945 --> 00:45:23.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jesus had Jehovah’s spirit
and heavenly wisdom,

00:45:23.074 --> 00:45:25.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
he entered the conversation first.

00:45:25.702 --> 00:45:29.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s what we want
to keep in mind and try to do ourselves

00:45:29.497 --> 00:45:31.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to have a conversation.

00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:35.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might just be speaking from your heart

00:45:35.378 --> 00:45:38.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to engage the person.

00:45:38.464 --> 00:45:43.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you could be
in the doctor’s office waiting room.

00:45:43.469 --> 00:45:45.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you speak from your heart,

00:45:45.638 --> 00:45:49.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you notice the person is looking at you:

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:54.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boy, I look forward to the day
when I’ll never be sick again.”

00:45:54.272 --> 00:45:58.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they could look at you and think,

00:45:58.109 --> 00:46:00.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, this guy is crazy.’

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or they could say: “Well, that would be nice.

00:46:04.699 --> 00:46:07.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes you believe
that’s going to happen for you?”

00:46:07.702 --> 00:46:09.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Either way, you’re starting

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:13.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the initiative
to start a conversation,

00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:16.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leave the rest to Jehovah.

00:46:16.169 --> 00:46:20.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the one
that gets the credit for the results.

00:46:20.715 --> 00:46:23.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, next, we have a video here.

00:46:23.718 --> 00:46:26.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,

00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:30.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a sister
finds an effective way

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
to witness informally.

00:46:54.957 --> 00:46:57.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seemed nice.

00:46:58.044 --> 00:47:01.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew what Yuri was thinking.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to start a conversation,

00:47:05.218 --> 00:47:08.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t want to bother them either.

00:47:15.687 --> 00:47:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when an opportunity came,

00:47:24.487 --> 00:47:26.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just froze.

00:47:33.705 --> 00:47:36.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was in a rush to give a witness.

00:47:49.429 --> 00:47:52.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt forced.

00:47:59.147 --> 00:48:02.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped to hear that we’d all been there.

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:05.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our past experiences were similar.

00:48:11.993 --> 00:48:14.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever we didn’t put pressure on ourselves

00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:18.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just looked for something in common
to talk about,

00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could usually find a moment
when we could say something about the Bible.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was curious why we were dressed up.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turns out that she’d never talked

00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:32.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s Witnesses before.

00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:45.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciated
how she took the initiative.

00:48:45.693 --> 00:48:49.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you see the contrast there
that at one point she froze.

00:48:49.864 --> 00:48:53.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it is stressful—no doubt about it.

00:48:53.868 --> 00:48:55.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re only human.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then she rushed
into things running after her with the tract.

00:48:59.499 --> 00:49:01.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, give it some thought.

00:49:01.834 --> 00:49:04.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to have a conversation,

00:49:04.045 --> 00:49:08.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
then let the spirit move it,
and that would be imitating Jesus.

00:49:08.716 --> 00:49:13.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then this can move
to getting into the spiritual purpose

00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:16.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
of initiating the conversation.

00:49:16.098 --> 00:49:19.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a good example,
give it a try, brothers and sisters,

00:49:19.477 --> 00:49:22.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let Jehovah bless your efforts.

00:49:22.939 --> 00:49:25.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to conclude,

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:28.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to share this beautiful thought

00:49:28.903 --> 00:49:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to this work we’re engaging in

00:49:31.531 --> 00:49:35.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sharing “the good news of peace”
by taking the initiative.

00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:39.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget this, and you know it,
but it’s a good reminder

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:42.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 14.

00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:47.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here in Revelation

00:49:47.463 --> 00:49:50.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
(familiar to most of you listening),

00:49:50.633 --> 00:49:53.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 6, let’s read it:

00:49:53.761 --> 00:49:57.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:49:57.557 --> 00:50:00.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:50:00.935 --> 00:50:03.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth, to every

00:50:03.813 --> 00:50:07.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
nation and tribe and tongue and people.”

00:50:07.525 --> 00:50:11.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is profound, obviously,

00:50:11.988 --> 00:50:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
an “angel flying in midheaven.”

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:17.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote helps us;
it’s overhead

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
—where the birds fly.

00:50:19.662 --> 00:50:21.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, you see them.

00:50:21.247 --> 00:50:26.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, another ‘angel in midheaven,’
that’s how close they are.

00:50:26.252 --> 00:50:30.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is something
you want to meditate on.

00:50:30.131 --> 00:50:33.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, when I was in the traveling work,

00:50:33.301 --> 00:50:37.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes I’d be working with one
of the brothers or one of the sisters,

00:50:37.972 --> 00:50:42.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had opposition

00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:44.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some of the territories we’d work.

00:50:44.478 --> 00:50:47.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could tell they’re feeling the stress,

00:50:47.899 --> 00:50:52.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I know it was because of the reaction
of some of these householders.

00:50:52.278 --> 00:50:54.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what I used to enjoy doing

00:50:54.447 --> 00:50:58.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and they appreciated it
after they realized what I was doing),

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d be walking along
and then I would just stop and I’d look up.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d say, “Do you see him?”

00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’d say, “Who?”

00:51:07.877 --> 00:51:10.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’s right up there above the trees.”

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’d look at me like,
‘Our circuit overseer has lost it.’

00:51:15.259 --> 00:51:17.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I said, “See,”

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would tell them
about Revelation 14:6.

00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:22.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re in the preaching work,

00:51:22.683 --> 00:51:27.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s informal or formal door-to-door,

00:51:27.688 --> 00:51:30.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angels are the real reapers.

00:51:30.232 --> 00:51:33.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least one is nearby.

00:51:33.569 --> 00:51:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a profound thought!

00:51:36.072 --> 00:51:38.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are the real harvesters.

00:51:38.407 --> 00:51:43.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are the ones directing us
to the “rightly disposed” people.

00:51:43.287 --> 00:51:45.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t ever forget that.

00:51:45.289 --> 00:51:49.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to being ready
to share “the good news of peace,”

00:51:49.377 --> 00:51:54.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
you go ahead and take the initiative
to start conversations.

00:51:54.256 --> 00:51:57.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have valuable opportunities

00:51:57.343 --> 00:52:00.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share “the good news of peace.”

00:52:02.974 --> 00:52:06.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Gary Breaux,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:52:06.811 --> 00:52:10.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:52:10.481 --> 00:52:13.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’

00:52:13.776 --> 00:52:17.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Follow Up on Interest.”

00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:27.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
To encourage us to promptly follow up

00:52:27.665 --> 00:52:30.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
on interest that we find
in the field ministry,

00:52:30.543 --> 00:52:33.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul likens our work to a plant

00:52:33.838 --> 00:52:36.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
that grows from a little seed.

00:52:36.674 --> 00:52:41.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s vital for a planted seed to grow?

00:52:41.137 --> 00:52:43.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
One authority says:

00:52:43.639 --> 00:52:47.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Of all the factors
that determine seed germination,

00:52:47.393 --> 00:52:51.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
water is the first and most important.”

00:52:51.147 --> 00:52:53.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And another reference says:

00:52:53.315 --> 00:52:58.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Until seeds have sprouted,
keep the seed bed moist,

00:52:58.112 --> 00:53:01.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
never allowing it to dry out.”

00:53:01.574 --> 00:53:06.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will happen
to a seed that is not watered?

00:53:06.537 --> 00:53:07.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:53:07.955 --> 00:53:09.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will lay dormant.

00:53:09.999 --> 00:53:14.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, regular watering
is vital for a seed to sprout,

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take root
and, in fact, continue to grow.

00:53:19.383 --> 00:53:21.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with these facts in mind,

00:53:21.469 --> 00:53:25.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 3:6

00:53:25.931 --> 00:53:28.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
show that more is required

00:53:28.476 --> 00:53:31.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
than simply planting a seed of truth.

00:53:31.604 --> 00:53:33.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s note his words.

00:53:33.647 --> 00:53:38.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at 1 Corinthians 3:6.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“I planted, Apollos watered,

00:53:44.241 --> 00:53:47.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
but God kept making it grow.”

00:53:47.787 --> 00:53:52.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all credit goes to Jehovah God
for making the spiritual seed grow,

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:56.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he allows us
to have a role in the process.

00:53:56.879 --> 00:54:01.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
the important role Apollos played?

00:54:01.133 --> 00:54:03.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did the watering.

00:54:03.427 --> 00:54:05.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a regular way,

00:54:05.513 --> 00:54:10.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
he helped keep
the spiritual soil of the individual moist,

00:54:10.392 --> 00:54:13.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
never allowing it to dry out.

00:54:13.604 --> 00:54:17.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people who show interest
in the Kingdom message today

00:54:17.483 --> 00:54:21.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
are searching for the truth about God.

00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:24.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to teach them progressively,

00:54:24.907 --> 00:54:28.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must return again and again.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
This requires good preparation

00:54:31.831 --> 00:54:34.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and organization on our part.

00:54:34.917 --> 00:54:38.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
By promptly making return visits,

00:54:38.087 --> 00:54:42.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
we demonstrate
a sincere concern for the individual,

00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:44.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanting to help them grow spiritually

00:54:44.885 --> 00:54:47.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
and develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:54:49.306 --> 00:54:51.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:55.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a sister follows up
on interest shown.

00:55:02.444 --> 00:55:06.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ami left a great question for her next visit.

00:55:10.661 --> 00:55:13.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Return visit! Mrs. Iwata!

00:55:15.833 --> 00:55:18.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her I’d visit this morning.

00:55:18.377 --> 00:55:20.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just didn’t schedule the time.

00:55:23.007 --> 00:55:25.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could at least stop by on the way back.

00:55:33.893 --> 00:55:35.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
I missed her again.

00:55:42.735 --> 00:55:45.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I didn’t try something different,

00:55:45.613 --> 00:55:48.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just going to keep missing her.

00:55:50.618 --> 00:55:52.620 line:10% position:50% align:center
First, I wanted her

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
to know I hadn’t forgotten her.

00:56:11.305 --> 00:56:13.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear Mrs. Iwata,

00:56:13.682 --> 00:56:15.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you’re doing well.

00:56:15.935 --> 00:56:18.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
I promise to come by early next week.

00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:22.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, your flowers are so beautiful!

00:56:27.488 --> 00:56:30.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I made a plan for my service day.

00:56:46.674 --> 00:56:49.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following through is just too important

00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:52.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
to leave to chance.

00:56:59.478 --> 00:57:01.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you plan your share in the ministry,

00:57:01.772 --> 00:57:04.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
follow the good example
of the sister in the video

00:57:04.483 --> 00:57:08.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and schedule time
to make regular return visits.

00:57:08.779 --> 00:57:11.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing so is just as important

00:57:11.991 --> 00:57:14.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
as other aspects of our ministry.

00:57:14.535 --> 00:57:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
These regular visits with interested people

00:57:17.913 --> 00:57:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
are vital links in the chain
leading to a Bible study.

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our ministry,
we often compliment the householder

00:57:28.507 --> 00:57:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the beautiful flowers or plants
in their yard,

00:57:31.969 --> 00:57:35.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like the sister did in the video.

00:57:35.139 --> 00:57:38.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did they get that way?

00:57:38.183 --> 00:57:42.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the householder
probably watered them on set days

00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even used an automatic sprinkler timer

00:57:46.442 --> 00:57:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
to schedule regular watering cycles.

00:57:49.778 --> 00:57:53.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, to have healthy and vibrant plants,

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:56.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
watering cannot be left to chance.

00:57:57.828 --> 00:58:01.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we apply that to our ministry?

00:58:01.832 --> 00:58:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before leaving a person
that has shown interest,

00:58:05.794 --> 00:58:10.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
endeavor to set
the proper time to water.

00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:13.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
The water of truth will come on.

00:58:13.052 --> 00:58:13.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
See?

00:58:13.761 --> 00:58:17.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps ask, “On what day or hour
would you like for me to return

00:58:17.806 --> 00:58:21.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue our discussion
or to answer the question?”

00:58:21.643 --> 00:58:26.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, this consideration
really dignifies the person,

00:58:26.231 --> 00:58:30.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing them to share
in setting the appointment.

00:58:30.402 --> 00:58:35.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s important that we be willing
to water an interested person

00:58:35.407 --> 00:58:38.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the most convenient time for them.

00:58:38.911 --> 00:58:42.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, just like setting a timer,

00:58:42.081 --> 00:58:45.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
put that appointment
where you’ll remember it.

00:58:45.417 --> 00:58:49.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister in the video
put it in her electronic calendar

00:58:49.004 --> 00:58:51.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she could be reminded later.

00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:56.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you promise someone that you’ll return,

00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:59.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
then keep your promise.

00:58:59.306 --> 00:59:04.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jesus’ simple statement
recorded at Matthew 5:37:

00:59:04.353 --> 00:59:08.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just let your word ‘Yes’ mean yes.”

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they’re truly interested,

00:59:11.276 --> 00:59:14.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may go to great efforts
to keep the appointment.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
How disappointed they would be
if we didn’t show up!

00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following through is just too important

00:59:23.872 --> 00:59:25.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
to leave to chance.

00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:31.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the busy lives
that people have today,

00:59:31.213 --> 00:59:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may be hard
to find the person at home again,

00:59:35.342 --> 00:59:38.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if you set an appointment.

00:59:38.262 --> 00:59:43.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s a good idea to try
and obtain his contact information,

00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:45.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe his phone number.

00:59:45.811 --> 00:59:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some publishers anticipate this challenge

00:59:48.689 --> 00:59:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and simply ask, “Do you text?”

00:59:52.568 --> 00:59:54.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
By simply texting,

00:59:54.695 --> 00:59:59.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may be able to keep in touch
and cultivate the interest further.

01:00:01.743 --> 01:00:05.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you can’t get his contact information

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the person isn’t home
at the agreed-upon time,

01:00:08.709 --> 01:00:11.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might leave a brief note,

01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:14.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as the sister did in the video.

01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:18.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this will assure the householder
that you haven’t forgotten them.

01:00:20.262 --> 01:00:25.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciple-making work
requires patience and persistence.

01:00:27.102 --> 01:00:29.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this regard, note what

01:00:29.146 --> 01:00:32.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 11:6 says.

01:00:35.944 --> 01:00:38.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 11:6
—it says:

01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:40.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sow your seed in the morning

01:00:40.741 --> 01:00:43.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not let your hand rest
until the evening;

01:00:43.785 --> 01:00:46.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you do not know
which will have success,

01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:49.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether this one or that one,

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:52.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whether they will both do well.”

01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:56.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it comes to planting literal seed,

01:00:56.798 --> 01:01:00.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t know when and where it will sprout.

01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many factors are beyond our control.

01:01:06.558 --> 01:01:10.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something similar can be said
of the disciple-making work.

01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to be patient and positive

01:01:14.066 --> 01:01:17.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t know who will respond.

01:01:18.487 --> 01:01:22.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Last and of utmost importance:

01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if the return visit is brief,

01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:28.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
share a Scriptural thought.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual content of our conversation

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:36.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what makes our visit different
from any others that they may have.

01:01:37.089 --> 01:01:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, they have neighbors,
friends, workmates,

01:01:39.716 --> 01:01:43.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
or relatives that check in on them.

01:01:43.095 --> 01:01:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for them to grow spiritually,

01:01:46.431 --> 01:01:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
the water of truth from God’s Word
must be dispensed.

01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:55.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, conveying
just a brief Scriptural thought

01:01:55.357 --> 01:01:57.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
may provide just enough

01:01:57.734 --> 01:02:01.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep their spiritual soil moist.

01:02:03.615 --> 01:02:06.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work involved of following up interest

01:02:06.326 --> 01:02:09.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a very important assignment

01:02:09.538 --> 01:02:12.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given to each of us.

01:02:12.791 --> 01:02:17.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this in mind,
let’s return to Paul’s illustration

01:02:17.212 --> 01:02:20.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Jehovah views us.

01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:24.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s back at 1 Corinthians chapter 3,

01:02:24.886 --> 01:02:26.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 9.

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:31.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:33.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we are God’s fellow workers.

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:38.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are God’s field under cultivation,
God’s building.”

01:02:39.776 --> 01:02:44.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an honor to be one
of “God’s fellow workers.”

01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:49.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
It enables us to show our love
for him and for our neighbors.

01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:52.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brings us great joy
to share “the good news of peace”

01:02:52.998 --> 01:02:56.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following up on interest shown.

01:02:56.877 --> 01:03:01.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be assured
that those who respond favorably

01:03:01.423 --> 01:03:05.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
will forever appreciate our diligent efforts

01:03:05.552 --> 01:03:09.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they recall how we promptly followed up

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:11.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they showed interest.

01:03:14.061 --> 01:03:18.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother William Malenfant,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:03:18.523 --> 01:03:21.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

01:03:21.985 --> 01:03:25.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’

01:03:25.238 --> 01:03:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Help Students Grow to Maturity.”

01:03:35.707 --> 01:03:40.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basic Bible teachings are wonderful.

01:03:40.045 --> 01:03:44.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually,
it’s the fundamental doctrines of the Bible

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:49.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
—basic teachings—
that draw people to the truth.

01:03:49.137 --> 01:03:52.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, learning basic Bible teachings

01:03:52.099 --> 01:03:56.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just the beginning
of knowledge about Jehovah.

01:03:56.603 --> 01:04:00.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 6:1,

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:04.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul exhorts
all students of God’s Word

01:04:04.528 --> 01:04:08.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
to progress beyond basic teachings.

01:04:08.365 --> 01:04:12.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what is stated at Hebrews 6:1:

01:04:12.828 --> 01:04:16.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, now that we have moved beyond

01:04:16.623 --> 01:04:19.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the primary doctrine about the Christ,

01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:23.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us press on to maturity.”

01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:26.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that what we want to achieve
with our Bible students,

01:04:26.925 --> 01:04:30.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them move beyond the primary doctrine

01:04:30.011 --> 01:04:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and progress to Christian maturity?

01:04:33.849 --> 01:04:36.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
It comes about in degrees

01:04:36.226 --> 01:04:40.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
as students acquire
an increased level of knowledge

01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:43.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciation for the truth.

01:04:43.984 --> 01:04:48.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible students must learn to love God

01:04:48.155 --> 01:04:51.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his standards and appreciate

01:04:51.825 --> 01:04:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of his ways and requirements

01:04:54.911 --> 01:04:58.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
are expressions of his love for us.

01:04:58.665 --> 01:05:01.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Bible students experience the good

01:05:01.293 --> 01:05:03.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from obeying Jehovah

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:06.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and following his ways,

01:05:06.381 --> 01:05:09.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
their love for him will deepen.

01:05:09.843 --> 01:05:12.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

01:05:12.804 --> 01:05:16.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
please note how a sister helps her student

01:05:16.224 --> 01:05:19.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make progress toward maturity.

01:05:21.772 --> 01:05:24.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mrs. Iwata was doing great.

01:05:24.691 --> 01:05:27.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were already on Lesson 10.

01:05:27.903 --> 01:05:30.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really hoped she’d come to a meeting soon.

01:05:33.116 --> 01:05:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about Hebrews 10:24, 25

01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:41.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and watched the video.

01:05:48.215 --> 01:05:50.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I miss something?

01:05:51.843 --> 01:05:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I did.

01:05:56.515 --> 01:05:59.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was too focused
on our progress with the lessons

01:05:59.726 --> 01:06:03.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of her progress and what she needed.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:14.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Iwata said going to meetings
would dishonor the family.

01:06:15.492 --> 01:06:18.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted her to quit the study.

01:06:19.329 --> 01:06:21.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
She didn’t want to quit,

01:06:21.748 --> 01:06:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
but whenever she tried to talk about it,
they argued.

01:06:26.253 --> 01:06:28.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
We showed her where to look for help

01:06:28.797 --> 01:06:31.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made time during our studies

01:06:31.299 --> 01:06:33.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk about it more.

01:06:53.154 --> 01:06:57.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all prayed for Jehovah

01:06:57.909 --> 01:06:59.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bless her efforts.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did our best
to share the good news of peace,

01:07:14.843 --> 01:07:17.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah did the rest.

01:07:22.851 --> 01:07:26.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we saw, the student took an important step

01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:28.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward Christian maturity

01:07:28.648 --> 01:07:32.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she began to attend meetings.

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:35.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you study with your student

01:07:35.405 --> 01:07:40.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
lessons 7 to 11
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book,

01:07:40.076 --> 01:07:42.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
please be sure to highlight

01:07:42.412 --> 01:07:45.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s appealing qualities

01:07:45.498 --> 01:07:48.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are set forth in those lessons.

01:07:48.251 --> 01:07:52.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, lesson 7
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> book

01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:56.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes Jehovah’s loving ways.

01:07:56.927 --> 01:08:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to help our students to understand

01:08:00.263 --> 01:08:04.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
really does love them as individuals

01:08:04.684 --> 01:08:09.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wants them to achieve everlasting life.

01:08:09.606 --> 01:08:12.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle John highlights Jehovah’s love

01:08:12.817 --> 01:08:14.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 John 4:9

01:08:14.903 --> 01:08:18.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
by pointing out
that Jehovah sent Jesus to earth

01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:20.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take our place in death

01:08:20.367 --> 01:08:23.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus pay for our inherited sins

01:08:23.161 --> 01:08:25.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our personal sins.

01:08:25.705 --> 01:08:28.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, out of love,

01:08:28.083 --> 01:08:30.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided a way for us

01:08:30.251 --> 01:08:34.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy an approved standing with him.

01:08:34.255 --> 01:08:39.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is one of Jehovah’s loving ways.

01:08:39.177 --> 01:08:44.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 8 shows us
how to become Jehovah’s friend.

01:08:44.057 --> 01:08:48.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is likely something that most people
have never even thought of.

01:08:48.812 --> 01:08:51.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the privilege

01:08:51.398 --> 01:08:54.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
of becoming God’s friend?

01:08:54.401 --> 01:08:58.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your students to see how their obedience

01:08:58.154 --> 01:09:01.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and exclusive devotion to Jehovah

01:09:01.408 --> 01:09:05.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
pave the way to friendship with him.

01:09:05.495 --> 01:09:09.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5, 6

01:09:09.207 --> 01:09:11.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us specifically

01:09:11.292 --> 01:09:14.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah wants us to do.

01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:18.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5, 6 says:

01:09:20.635 --> 01:09:23.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

01:09:23.179 --> 01:09:25.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with all your heart,

01:09:25.515 --> 01:09:29.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not rely on your own understanding.

01:09:29.894 --> 01:09:33.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In all your ways take notice of him,

01:09:33.732 --> 01:09:36.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will make your paths straight.”

01:09:38.153 --> 01:09:40.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
We show our trust in Jehovah

01:09:40.864 --> 01:09:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
by doing what he tells us to do

01:09:44.075 --> 01:09:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby become his friends.

01:09:47.996 --> 01:09:50.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah takes good care of his friends,

01:09:50.832 --> 01:09:53.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is always loyal to them.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:00.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 9 highlights the power of prayer.

01:10:00.175 --> 01:10:02.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teach your Bible students

01:10:02.635 --> 01:10:05.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to pray to Jehovah.

01:10:05.638 --> 01:10:07.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to prayer,

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
regular Bible reading is also necessary

01:10:10.727 --> 01:10:13.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make spiritual progress.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm, the first Psalm,

01:10:16.858 --> 01:10:21.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 2 and 3, encourages Bible reading.

01:10:21.529 --> 01:10:22.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look it up together.

01:10:22.989 --> 01:10:26.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Psalm, the first Psalm,

01:10:26.951 --> 01:10:30.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 2 and 3.

01:10:31.623 --> 01:10:34.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s speaking about a man of God

01:10:34.042 --> 01:10:36.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
who takes delight in God’s Word.

01:10:36.086 --> 01:10:39.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “But his delight

01:10:39.047 --> 01:10:41.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is in the law of Jehovah,

01:10:41.132 --> 01:10:43.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[well, the law of Jehovah
is found in the Bible,

01:10:43.718 --> 01:10:46.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it says,] and he reads His law

01:10:46.304 --> 01:10:50.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in an undertone day and night.

01:10:50.225 --> 01:10:53.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will be like a tree planted
by streams of water,

01:10:53.978 --> 01:10:57.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a tree that produces fruit in its season,

01:10:57.023 --> 01:10:59.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the foliage of which does not wither.

01:10:59.859 --> 01:11:03.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And everything he does will succeed.”

01:11:03.196 --> 01:11:05.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, “everything he does” as a Christian,

01:11:05.824 --> 01:11:09.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading a Christian life, “will succeed.”

01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:12.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading God’s Word

01:11:12.163 --> 01:11:16.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then putting it into practice
brings Jehovah’s blessing.

01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:18.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you have a student

01:11:18.962 --> 01:11:21.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
who feels limited in his learning ability,

01:11:21.881 --> 01:11:24.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps because of a lack of education,

01:11:24.926 --> 01:11:29.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
please encourage him
to go to Jehovah in prayer

01:11:29.889 --> 01:11:33.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persist in asking him

01:11:33.059 --> 01:11:36.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
for help to understand his Word.

01:11:36.146 --> 01:11:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:5

01:11:38.481 --> 01:11:42.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
assures us that Jehovah is ready and willing

01:11:42.777 --> 01:11:46.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help those
who ‘keep on asking’ him for help.

01:11:48.074 --> 01:11:51.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 10 gives this direction:

01:11:51.452 --> 01:11:53.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as possible,

01:11:53.496 --> 01:11:57.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
invite Bible students
to attend congregation meetings.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:12:02.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
What your student hears and observes
at Christian meetings

01:12:02.297 --> 01:12:06.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
can touch his heart
and will help him to progress.

01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:10.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you show your student the video

01:12:10.054 --> 01:12:12.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?,</i>

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be a good time
to warmly invite him

01:12:16.436 --> 01:12:18.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend meetings.

01:12:18.688 --> 01:12:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, be sure to invite
a variety of publishers

01:12:23.193 --> 01:12:25.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accompany you on the study.

01:12:25.486 --> 01:12:27.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, your student will get acquainted

01:12:27.739 --> 01:12:29.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
with others in the congregation,

01:12:29.866 --> 01:12:34.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will likely feel more at home
when he attends our meetings.

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 11: In this lesson,

01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:41.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are encouraged to teach our students

01:12:41.794 --> 01:12:44.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to do personal study

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:49.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
using jw.org and <i>JW Library</i>®.

01:12:49.135 --> 01:12:53.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show your student how to use these tools.

01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:56.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you feel a bit unsure
about teaching someone 

01:12:56.559 --> 01:13:00.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make use
of their electronic device for research,

01:13:00.688 --> 01:13:05.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t hesitate to ask
for help from the congregation.

01:13:05.026 --> 01:13:08.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many
who would be delighted to assist you.

01:13:10.698 --> 01:13:15.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings that we receive
when we teach someone the truth

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
is described by the apostle John

01:13:18.248 --> 01:13:21.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 3 John 4, where it states:

01:13:21.209 --> 01:13:25.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No greater joy do I have than this:

01:13:25.004 --> 01:13:27.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should hear that my children

01:13:27.757 --> 01:13:30.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
go on walking in the truth.”

01:13:30.802 --> 01:13:35.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, John is speaking
of his spiritual children.

01:13:35.765 --> 01:13:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
That same joy can be ours.

01:13:39.727 --> 01:13:44.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has this symposium
brought to our attention?

01:13:44.232 --> 01:13:47.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has helped us to see how we can maintain

01:13:47.193 --> 01:13:49.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
our zeal for the preaching work.

01:13:49.654 --> 01:13:52.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has instructed us to prepare well

01:13:52.865 --> 01:13:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the truth with others.

01:13:55.785 --> 01:13:58.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
It showed us how to take the initiative

01:13:58.663 --> 01:14:01.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give an informal witness,

01:14:01.165 --> 01:14:05.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
to follow up on interest,
and to help Bible students

01:14:05.545 --> 01:14:07.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow to maturity.

01:14:08.631 --> 01:14:11.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do the best we can in the ministry,

01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether people respond or not,

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:18.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy the peace
that comes from knowing

01:14:18.266 --> 01:14:21.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are pleasing Jehovah.

01:14:21.978 --> 01:14:26.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:15, 16

01:14:26.607 --> 01:14:29.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us how to bring pleasure
to Jehovah God,

01:14:29.986 --> 01:14:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s certainly something we want to do.

01:14:33.072 --> 01:14:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Hebrews 13:15, 16; it reads:

01:14:40.872 --> 01:14:43.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Through him [that is, through Jesus]

01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:48.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let us always offer to God
a sacrifice of praise,

01:14:48.755 --> 01:14:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is, the fruit of our lips

01:14:51.507 --> 01:14:55.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that make public declaration to his name.

01:14:55.136 --> 01:14:58.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, do not forget to do good

01:14:58.723 --> 01:15:01.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to share what you have with others,

01:15:01.392 --> 01:15:06.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

01:15:07.023 --> 01:15:11.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your readiness to share
“the good news of peace” with others

01:15:11.277 --> 01:15:14.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just such a sacrifice.

01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:16.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can rest assured

01:15:16.657 --> 01:15:19.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is thoroughly pleased

01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:23.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
with your loving and faithful service to him.

01:15:25.416 --> 01:15:28.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for helping us to be ready

01:15:28.586 --> 01:15:32.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share “the good news of peace” effectively
at every opportunity.

01:15:35.134 --> 01:15:38.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization continues to grow,

01:15:38.179 --> 01:15:40.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there is plenty of work to do.

01:15:41.349 --> 01:15:44.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young people in particular
have many opportunities

01:15:44.519 --> 01:15:46.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expand their service.

01:15:46.938 --> 01:15:49.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can a career in full-time service

01:15:49.565 --> 01:15:52.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
lead to rich blessings now and in the future?

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:58.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some common obstacles
to pursuing full-time service,

01:15:58.074 --> 01:16:01.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how can they be overcome?

01:16:01.285 --> 01:16:03.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage young ones

01:16:03.287 --> 01:16:06.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give special attention to the next talk.

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:10.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson,
a member of the Governing Body,

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
will develop the theme

01:16:12.547 --> 01:16:17.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Young People
—Choose a Path That Leads to Peace!”

01:16:25.643 --> 01:16:27.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
An 18-year-old brother

01:16:27.645 --> 01:16:31.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
was trying to decide
what he wanted to do after high school.

01:16:31.816 --> 01:16:35.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was raised in the truth, and in his heart,

01:16:35.445 --> 01:16:38.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wanted to be a pioneer.

01:16:38.072 --> 01:16:41.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he also had a scholarship
to go to university

01:16:41.826 --> 01:16:45.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some other grants,
and he had been accepted to attend.

01:16:45.955 --> 01:16:50.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had many questions
(how was he going to support himself?)

01:16:50.835 --> 01:16:53.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and much pressure from his teachers

01:16:53.296 --> 01:16:56.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and counselors to go to university.

01:16:56.549 --> 01:16:59.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
What decision would he make?

01:16:59.552 --> 01:17:04.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe many of you young ones
who are listening to this talk right now

01:17:04.182 --> 01:17:06.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing that same decision,

01:17:06.934 --> 01:17:10.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe you will be in a year or two.

01:17:10.521 --> 01:17:13.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
What path will you take?

01:17:13.733 --> 01:17:16.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, here’s what we know:

01:17:16.235 --> 01:17:21.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you to have,
not just a good life,

01:17:21.115 --> 01:17:23.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just an average life,

01:17:23.409 --> 01:17:26.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he wants you to have an awesome,
wonderful life

01:17:26.913 --> 01:17:29.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both now during your youth

01:17:29.582 --> 01:17:33.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really for your entire life.

01:17:33.002 --> 01:17:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the Bible says

01:17:35.004 --> 01:17:39.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ecclesiastes 11:9:

01:17:40.801 --> 01:17:44.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rejoice, young man, while you are young,

01:17:44.388 --> 01:17:49.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let your heart be glad
in the days of your youth.”

01:17:50.144 --> 01:17:55.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many young people
have found real joy and peace

01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:59.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
by choosing a career
in the full-time service.

01:17:59.445 --> 01:18:03.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, when we say full-time service,
what are we talking about?

01:18:03.783 --> 01:18:07.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, full-time service
is not just one thing.

01:18:07.203 --> 01:18:09.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
It actually includes many things.

01:18:09.664 --> 01:18:13.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes pioneering,
maybe in your home congregation

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe in another area

01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:20.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe in another city, state,
province or even in another country.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might mean assisting
with theocratic construction projects,

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe building Kingdom Halls
or Assembly Halls 

01:18:27.682 --> 01:18:30.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
or building remote translation offices

01:18:30.518 --> 01:18:34.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even working at building
at Bethel facilities.

01:18:34.105 --> 01:18:37.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it also could mean
submitting an application

01:18:37.275 --> 01:18:40.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Bethel service and becoming a Bethelite.

01:18:40.403 --> 01:18:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, there are

01:18:42.405 --> 01:18:45.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
so many wonderful opportunities

01:18:45.992 --> 01:18:49.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are available for you young ones

01:18:49.203 --> 01:18:51.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
in full-time service.

01:18:51.414 --> 01:18:53.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

01:18:53.791 --> 01:18:56.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
What challenges could prevent you

01:18:56.711 --> 01:18:59.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
from starting or continuing

01:18:59.839 --> 01:19:02.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the path of full-time service?

01:19:02.133 --> 01:19:04.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more important,

01:19:04.218 --> 01:19:08.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can you overcome those challenges?

01:19:08.097 --> 01:19:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk about three obstacles.

01:19:12.101 --> 01:19:15.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the first one:
It’s financial concerns.

01:19:15.813 --> 01:19:18.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
How am I going to support myself?

01:19:18.774 --> 01:19:21.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at something that Jesus said

01:19:21.319 --> 01:19:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew chapter 6

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 33

01:19:29.327 --> 01:19:31.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:33.

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:35.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Keep on, then,
seeking first the Kingdom

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:38.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his righteousness,

01:19:38.336 --> 01:19:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all these other things
will be added to you.”

01:19:42.965 --> 01:19:45.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, OK.

01:19:45.009 --> 01:19:47.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says “all these other things.”

01:19:47.845 --> 01:19:49.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
What other things?

01:19:49.263 --> 01:19:51.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Jesus talking about here?

01:19:51.641 --> 01:19:55.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to find out,
why don’t we go back up to verse 25?

01:19:55.728 --> 01:19:58.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let’s read a little bit more
of what Jesus

01:19:58.064 --> 01:20:01.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
was talking about when he said
those famous words

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
—verse 25:

01:20:03.444 --> 01:20:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On this account I say to you:

01:20:05.821 --> 01:20:09.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop being anxious about your lives

01:20:09.241 --> 01:20:12.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as to what you will eat
or what you will drink,

01:20:12.912 --> 01:20:16.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or about your bodies
as to what you will wear.

01:20:16.082 --> 01:20:18.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does not life mean more than food

01:20:18.876 --> 01:20:21.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the body than clothing?”

01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:23.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now (after identifying)—

01:20:23.589 --> 01:20:27.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know what Jesus is talking about:
He’s talking about our necessities

01:20:27.677 --> 01:20:29.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
—food, shelter, clothing.

01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, look at the illustrations
Jesus goes on to give now,

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:35.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning here in verse 26:

01:20:35.643 --> 01:20:39.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Observe intently the birds of heaven;

01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:44.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they do not sow seed or reap
or gather into storehouses,

01:20:44.235 --> 01:20:47.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

01:20:47.321 --> 01:20:50.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you not worth more than they are?

01:20:50.783 --> 01:20:55.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who of you by being anxious
can add one cubit to his life span?

01:20:55.371 --> 01:20:59.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:01.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,

01:21:01.585 --> 01:21:06.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“how they grow;
they do not toil, nor do they spin;

01:21:06.132 --> 01:21:09.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I tell you that not even Solomon

01:21:09.051 --> 01:21:12.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all his glory was arrayed
as one of these.

01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:16.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if this is how God clothes
the vegetation of the field

01:21:16.934 --> 01:21:20.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is here today and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven,

01:21:20.646 --> 01:21:24.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will he not much rather clothe you,

01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:26.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you with little faith?

01:21:26.235 --> 01:21:30.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So never be anxious and say,
‘What are we to eat?’

01:21:30.156 --> 01:21:32.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or, ‘What are we to drink?’
or, ‘What are we to wear?’

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:36.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all these are the things
the nations are eagerly pursuing.

01:21:36.537 --> 01:21:39.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your heavenly Father knows

01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:42.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you need all these things.”

01:21:42.585 --> 01:21:45.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do you get the sense of this?

01:21:45.838 --> 01:21:47.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was trying to reason

01:21:47.965 --> 01:21:50.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that just as Jehovah provides

01:21:50.217 --> 01:21:52.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of his creation,

01:21:52.803 --> 01:21:55.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
he can provide for you too.

01:21:55.556 --> 01:21:58.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just need to develop our faith

01:21:58.309 --> 01:22:02.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will provide the things we need

01:22:02.146 --> 01:22:05.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we put his service first.

01:22:05.399 --> 01:22:08.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, does that mean
that Jehovah is just going to drop

01:22:08.652 --> 01:22:11.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
into our lap everything that we need?

01:22:11.197 --> 01:22:12.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, no.

01:22:12.406 --> 01:22:15.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah expects
that we’re going to use the things

01:22:15.785 --> 01:22:19.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s given us
to be able to support ourselves.

01:22:19.163 --> 01:22:22.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s very wise when you’re young

01:22:22.249 --> 01:22:25.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
to plan ahead so that you can obtain

01:22:25.419 --> 01:22:29.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
the skills you need
to be able to support yourself.

01:22:29.006 --> 01:22:31.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in some lands,

01:22:31.175 --> 01:22:34.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
it may be that as you’re growing up,

01:22:34.053 --> 01:22:36.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can learn a trade from your father

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
or from your mother
or maybe even from another relative.

01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:44.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other lands, you might be able
while you’re still in high school

01:22:44.355 --> 01:22:46.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take some vocational courses

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:50.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would help you to learn
a skill or learn a trade.

01:22:50.903 --> 01:22:54.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the point: We need to plan.

01:22:54.824 --> 01:22:58.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
So ask yourself, ‘What abilities and skills

01:22:58.536 --> 01:23:02.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
do I have that I could use
to support myself?’

01:23:02.248 --> 01:23:04.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister named Kelly

01:23:04.291 --> 01:23:07.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a very clear goal in mind
of becoming a pioneer.

01:23:07.378 --> 01:23:09.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did she do?

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this is what she says:
“I had to choose something

01:23:12.508 --> 01:23:16.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would allow me
to support myself in my ministry.”

01:23:16.011 --> 01:23:20.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kelly enrolled in a vocational program
in her high school,

01:23:20.349 --> 01:23:23.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that helped her
to achieve her primary goal.

01:23:23.561 --> 01:23:25.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what she said:

01:23:25.604 --> 01:23:29.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The full-time ministry
was what I wanted to do.

01:23:29.567 --> 01:23:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything else was secondary.”

01:23:32.862 --> 01:23:37.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does Kelly feel now
about the decision that she made?

01:23:37.074 --> 01:23:39.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says: “I feel my decision

01:23:39.785 --> 01:23:43.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the best one that I could have made.”

01:23:43.205 --> 01:23:45.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
You young brothers and sisters,

01:23:45.249 --> 01:23:49.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can overcome that challenge
just by planning ahead

01:23:49.461 --> 01:23:52.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making sure
that you have practical skills

01:23:52.506 --> 01:23:55.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can use to support yourself.

01:23:55.593 --> 01:24:00.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the second obstacle:
pressure from others.

01:24:00.222 --> 01:24:03.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My relatives want me
to focus on making money.’

01:24:04.852 --> 01:24:06.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if that’s the case,

01:24:06.937 --> 01:24:09.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
explain your spiritual goals

01:24:09.815 --> 01:24:12.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a calm, respectful way.

01:24:12.776 --> 01:24:15.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 4:6 says:

01:24:15.529 --> 01:24:19.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your words always be gracious,

01:24:19.074 --> 01:24:21.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
seasoned with salt.”

01:24:21.452 --> 01:24:24.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we all know
when we eat food with no salt,

01:24:24.538 --> 01:24:26.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t taste very good, does it?

01:24:26.665 --> 01:24:30.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
We put a little salt on it
—now it becomes delicious.

01:24:30.502 --> 01:24:34.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
So make sure that when you
speak to your relatives,

01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:36.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
you put a little salt on those words

01:24:36.884 --> 01:24:40.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can reason with them
and help them to see the wisdom

01:24:40.763 --> 01:24:43.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the decision that you want to make.

01:24:43.599 --> 01:24:47.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it could be
that your relatives will not agree with you.

01:24:47.519 --> 01:24:49.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s look at something that Jesus said

01:24:49.647 --> 01:24:54.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
here at Luke 7:35.

01:24:56.987 --> 01:24:59.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “All the same,

01:24:59.323 --> 01:25:01.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wisdom is proved righteous

01:25:01.909 --> 01:25:06.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or, now, if you look at the footnote,
it says, ‘or “is vindicated”’]

01:25:06.455 --> 01:25:09.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
by all its children.”

01:25:09.583 --> 01:25:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, what’s the point?

01:25:11.627 --> 01:25:15.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, sometimes when people make a decision,

01:25:15.005 --> 01:25:17.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not sure if it
was the right one or not.

01:25:17.675 --> 01:25:20.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when the decision works out well,

01:25:20.761 --> 01:25:25.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it leads to success,
when people see how happy you are 

01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:29.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how successful you are
—the joy, the satisfaction you have—

01:25:29.436 --> 01:25:31.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, then, what happens?

01:25:31.814 --> 01:25:34.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe your relatives will see

01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:36.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your decision has been vindicated.

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:41.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been “proved righteous”
by the way things have turned out.

01:25:42.449 --> 01:25:46.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s obstacle number three:
unexpected challenges.

01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:50.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I thought it was going
to be easier than this.’

01:25:50.916 --> 01:25:54.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those unexpected challenges
can be many.

01:25:54.628 --> 01:25:58.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be just trying
to get used to new roommates,

01:25:58.966 --> 01:26:01.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with personality challenges,

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:04.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even just coping with homesickness.

01:26:04.471 --> 01:26:08.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the point: Don’t give up!

01:26:08.392 --> 01:26:11.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what James said here

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:14.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
in James chapter 1

01:26:14.148 --> 01:26:16.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
—James chapter 1

01:26:16.942 --> 01:26:18.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 4.

01:26:18.944 --> 01:26:22.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice as you look at verse 2,

01:26:22.114 --> 01:26:25.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
James is talking about trials,

01:26:25.034 --> 01:26:29.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s talking about how trials
can have a positive effect on us.

01:26:29.371 --> 01:26:31.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now look what he says in verse 4:

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:35.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But let endurance complete its work,

01:26:35.502 --> 01:26:40.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may be complete
and sound in all respects,

01:26:40.257 --> 01:26:43.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
not lacking in anything.”

01:26:44.261 --> 01:26:46.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s James trying to say?

01:26:46.055 --> 01:26:47.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s his point?

01:26:47.681 --> 01:26:49.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, have you ever heard the expression

01:26:49.767 --> 01:26:52.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No pain, no gain”?

01:26:52.811 --> 01:26:56.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you want to reach
a certain fitness goal

01:26:56.106 --> 01:26:59.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if you want to be very good
at playing a certain sport,

01:26:59.485 --> 01:27:03.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt you’re going to have
some aching muscles.

01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:06.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt you’re going to have
some hurt pride along the way too.

01:27:06.867 --> 01:27:09.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you won’t be very good
when you first start.

01:27:10.037 --> 01:27:11.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do you do?

01:27:11.663 --> 01:27:13.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you want to become good,

01:27:13.665 --> 01:27:16.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you want to reach your goal,
you can’t give up.

01:27:16.627 --> 01:27:19.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to keep trying.

01:27:19.171 --> 01:27:23.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the same could be said
about reaching our spiritual goals.

01:27:23.759 --> 01:27:25.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, James mentions

01:27:25.969 --> 01:27:30.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
that trials often reveal our weaknesses.

01:27:30.182 --> 01:27:34.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it’s some aspect of our personality
that needs improvement.

01:27:34.937 --> 01:27:38.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it’s something
in our relationship with Jehovah.

01:27:38.607 --> 01:27:43.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we need greater faith;
maybe we need greater trust.

01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:47.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we endure even during periods of trial

01:27:47.699 --> 01:27:52.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we refuse to give up,
we become stronger.

01:27:52.538 --> 01:27:55.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
We become stronger in our spirituality

01:27:55.541 --> 01:27:58.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our relationship with Jehovah

01:27:58.001 --> 01:28:02.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our love for him,
our faith in him, our trust in him

01:28:02.172 --> 01:28:04.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
just continues to grow.

01:28:04.299 --> 01:28:06.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
As James says there in verse 4,

01:28:06.927 --> 01:28:11.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
we become “complete
and sound in all respects,

01:28:11.181 --> 01:28:13.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
not lacking in anything.”

01:28:13.559 --> 01:28:16.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when those trials come

01:28:16.645 --> 01:28:18.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and they will come—

01:28:18.689 --> 01:28:21.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t look for a quick way out.

01:28:21.525 --> 01:28:25.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Endure, keep going, don’t give up!

01:28:25.654 --> 01:28:29.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seek advice from brothers and sisters
who have successfully coped

01:28:29.992 --> 01:28:34.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
with similar challenges,
and you too will be successful.

01:28:34.872 --> 01:28:37.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

01:28:37.249 --> 01:28:41.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how some full-time servants
have found real peace

01:28:41.128 --> 01:28:44.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite those three obstacles:
financial concerns,

01:28:44.798 --> 01:28:48.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
pressure from others,
and unexpected challenges.

01:28:50.846 --> 01:28:52.514 line:10% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah,

01:28:52.514 --> 01:28:54.308 line:10% position:50% align:center
“If it is your will, I would be happy

01:28:54.308 --> 01:28:55.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enter pioneer service.”

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:01.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I had to work really hard
to provide for the needs of my family

01:29:03.275 --> 01:29:07.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my father had died
when he was 45 years old.

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elder that I talked to

01:29:10.824 --> 01:29:14.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave me advice not to be picky
about what kind of job I could get.

01:29:14.661 --> 01:29:17.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reminded me of Matthew 6:33,
and told me

01:29:17.998 --> 01:29:20.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be overly anxious.

01:29:21.835 --> 01:29:24.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our good communication
within the family,

01:29:24.338 --> 01:29:26.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were able to find solutions.

01:29:26.882 --> 01:29:29.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
My other siblings realized
that they also shared

01:29:29.718 --> 01:29:32.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
responsibility in providing
for the needs of the family.

01:29:34.139 --> 01:29:37.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
After one year of pioneering,
I was encouraged to apply for Bethel service,

01:29:37.893 --> 01:29:41.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now I am in Bethel.

01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:45.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that Jehovah really cares for me,
loves me,

01:29:45.901 --> 01:29:48.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciates all my efforts.

01:29:52.366 --> 01:29:56.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because they love me, my cousins
pressured me to choose a secular career.

01:29:59.414 --> 01:30:00.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I went against

01:30:00.624 --> 01:30:02.918 line:10% position:50% align:center
their wishes, it would hurt them

01:30:02.918 --> 01:30:05.462 line:10% position:50% align:center
and put a strain on our relationship.

01:30:05.462 --> 01:30:07.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really anxious.

01:30:08.799 --> 01:30:11.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to show my trust
in Jehovah by pioneering

01:30:11.885 --> 01:30:15.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give him an opportunity to show me
that I can be happy in his service.

01:30:19.059 --> 01:30:22.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tried to express my appreciation
for my cousins by what 

01:30:22.854 --> 01:30:24.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said and did

01:30:26.692 --> 01:30:29.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed them love.

01:30:30.654 --> 01:30:34.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve realized
that I have changed for the better.

01:30:34.825 --> 01:30:37.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I show more concern for others now.

01:30:37.744 --> 01:30:42.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they understand that we have been
learning good things and that we have

01:30:42.708 --> 01:30:45.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
a happier and more meaningful life.

01:30:47.921 --> 01:30:49.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
I wanted to try serving

01:30:49.589 --> 01:30:51.133 line:10% position:50% align:center
where the need was greater.

01:30:51.133 --> 01:30:52.843 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I first arrived,

01:30:52.843 --> 01:30:55.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it was so cool being there.

01:30:55.512 --> 01:30:58.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had expected the poverty,
but when I saw it,

01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
it hit home more than what I had expected.

01:31:01.059 --> 01:31:03.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then I started to feel really homesick.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my brothers and sisters—

01:31:05.856 --> 01:31:09.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d go to the Kingdom Hall and they
were able to cope with the challenges

01:31:09.151 --> 01:31:12.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they were facing because they had
Jehovah in their life.

01:31:12.029 --> 01:31:16.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
So their example really helped me to see
that my circumstances

01:31:16.575 --> 01:31:20.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t need to change
for my attitude to change.

01:31:21.913 --> 01:31:24.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 15:15 stood out to me,

01:31:24.374 --> 01:31:26.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is about having “a cheerful heart”

01:31:26.877 --> 01:31:30.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being able to have “a continual feast”
no matter what my circumstances are.

01:31:30.922 --> 01:31:34.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I found an article about that scripture.

01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:39.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so from there, I decided to ask myself,
‘How can I use my situation

01:31:39.931 --> 01:31:42.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what I’m learning to help others?’

01:31:42.309 --> 01:31:45.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I got to start helping
with a foreign-language group there.

01:31:45.103 --> 01:31:47.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
That whole experience

01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:51.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
just made my love for people grow so much

01:31:51.526 --> 01:31:54.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and definitely changed my life.

01:31:57.282 --> 01:31:59.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of your non-Witness family members

01:31:59.868 --> 01:32:04.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
might offer you secular or financial advice.

01:32:04.039 --> 01:32:06.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know they mean well

01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:08.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they feel that they’re giving you
the best advice

01:32:08.919 --> 01:32:11.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they love you.

01:32:11.004 --> 01:32:13.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, young brothers and sisters,

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:18.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are convinced that the blessings
of full-time service

01:32:18.345 --> 01:32:21.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
far outweigh any challenges

01:32:21.681 --> 01:32:23.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might go along with it.

01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:28.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think of the experiences
that we heard in the video.

01:32:28.397 --> 01:32:31.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Harley’s choices allowed him to go to Bethel

01:32:31.858 --> 01:32:36.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped him to feel
that Jehovah really loved him.

01:32:36.363 --> 01:32:39.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anjil’s choices took courage,

01:32:39.157 --> 01:32:42.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
but those choices helped him
to be more concerned about other people

01:32:42.994 --> 01:32:45.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped his relatives to see

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had made a good decision.

01:32:48.041 --> 01:32:52.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Carlee did not give up
when the trials came.

01:32:52.087 --> 01:32:56.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, she learned
to love other people even more

01:32:56.425 --> 01:33:01.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and became a more powerful, strong Christian.

01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:06.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, why are we so convinced

01:33:06.476 --> 01:33:09.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
that full-time service
will lead you young ones

01:33:09.771 --> 01:33:12.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a wonderful life?

01:33:12.232 --> 01:33:14.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s because that’s the decision

01:33:14.484 --> 01:33:17.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
that so many of us made when we were young.

01:33:17.446 --> 01:33:20.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
that 18-year-old young brother

01:33:20.449 --> 01:33:23.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was trying to decide which path to take?

01:33:23.702 --> 01:33:27.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was me some years ago.

01:33:27.456 --> 01:33:29.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so glad

01:33:29.583 --> 01:33:33.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
that with the help of Jehovah and my parents

01:33:33.170 --> 01:33:36.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other mature friends in the congregation,

01:33:36.506 --> 01:33:38.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made the decision

01:33:38.508 --> 01:33:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like so many other brothers
and sisters around the world

01:33:42.596 --> 01:33:44.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to turn down that scholarship,

01:33:44.931 --> 01:33:47.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give up university,

01:33:47.184 --> 01:33:51.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to go directly
into the full-time service.

01:33:51.688 --> 01:33:55.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is a decision
that I have never regretted;

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:00.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is a decision that I will never regret.

01:34:00.322 --> 01:34:03.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young people, Jehovah loves you.

01:34:03.867 --> 01:34:07.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants you to have
a wonderful, awesome life.

01:34:07.954 --> 01:34:11.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Choose the path
of full-time service if you can.

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:14.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never regret it.

01:34:14.127 --> 01:34:19.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will put you on a path
that leads to joy and peace

01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:23.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our marvelous, wonderful God, Jehovah.

01:34:25.347 --> 01:34:27.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Sanderson,

01:34:27.349 --> 01:34:30.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the warm encouragement
to pursue full-time service

01:34:30.977 --> 01:34:32.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
from an early age.

01:34:34.105 --> 01:34:38.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we invite all to join
in singing song number 135,

01:34:38.985 --> 01:34:43.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s Warm Appeal: ‘Be Wise, My Son.’”

01:34:43.073 --> 01:34:45.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 135.

Hey, everyone.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:05.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:07.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:09.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:13.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to go up to the girls
and smash their phones.

00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:15.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neutral?
Ain’t no neutral.

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:20.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was feeling back then

00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:22.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just sadness,

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
never really peace.

00:00:24.982 --> 00:00:25.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:00:32.704 --> 00:00:34.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
In June of 2018,

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge group of armed men came to us.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:42.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:45.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost us?

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a choice.
You went behind my back!

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:50.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where’s your mask?

00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:52.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know how many people
have actually gotten sick?

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zero.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:56.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what always happens.

00:00:56.997 --> 00:00:59.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just
about to lose all your strength,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:05.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful that we made peace

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:08.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the world turned upside down.

Have you applied
to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not been invited?

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or have you wanted to apply

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wondered if the time was right?

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the pandemic,
classes are still suspended.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you are a pioneer
between the ages of 23 and 65

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would like to attend
a future class of SKE,

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
please contact your congregation secretary

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fill out the online application

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it can be considered
when classes resume.

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a reminder, your application
is active for one year.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, you must apply each year
that you desire to be considered.

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we are pleased to inform you

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
that graduates
of the Ministerial Training School

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the Bible School for Single Brothers

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are still single and in full-time service

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:25.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
may now apply
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it possible to maintain our peace

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
when dealing with intense trials
and pressures?

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:39.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah care for our needs
when we are in distress?

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video will introduce us
to brothers and sisters

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have been blessed by Jehovah
with peace.

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title is

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>How Our Brothers Are Enjoying Peace</i>

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Despite . . . Opposition, Illness,</i>

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Economic Problems, Natural Disasters.</i>

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.568 line:10% position:50% align:center
As long as we live in Satan’s world,

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:14.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us will face situations

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can rob us of our peace.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regaining that peace can be difficult

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not impossible.

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this video, we will hear

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
from three sisters and two couples

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will speak candidly about their trials

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:35.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they struggled to cope with them.

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in spite of what they have endured,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
please take note of their smiles, their joy,

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they did to regain
and maintain their peace.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
And take special note
of how Jehovah helped them.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body knows that many of you

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
are suffering circumstances

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
not unlike the ones we will hear about,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they trust that the examples
in this video

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:13.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help each of you to maintain your peace

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you endure various trials.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters all over the world
are facing

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic collapse,

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:33.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
illness,

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persecution.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite all that,

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
they keep joy and peace.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can learn a lot from them.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Antoinette.

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.046 line:10% position:50% align:center
I live here in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:55.547 line:10% position:50% align:center
with my supermom

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:58.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
and my troublemaking sister.

00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:03.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family and friends have always been
important to me.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a child, I lived with my mom and dad

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was very close
to my dad’s side of the family.

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very loving, unified, and fun.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was pretty happy.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I already was starting to feel
the effects of my cancer.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just didn’t know what it was really.

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day I was OK, and then the next day
I started feeling bad, you know.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.173 line:10% position:50% align:center
In my childhood,

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:40.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
I played an unusual game.

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:42.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would catch insects,

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:47.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
put them in a jar, and then bring them home.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, I would get books,
such as the Criminal Procedural Code,

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
open them up,
and start judging one of the bugs.

00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:02.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would play the role
of investigator and judge at the same time.

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born into a family where everyone,

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting with my grandparents,

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:14.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
was either wearing an officer’s uniform
or a judge’s robe.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:19.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why I had
this strong sense of justice.

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1989,

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:28.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mother was in a tragic car accident,

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:30.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:33.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
she got severe burns

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
on her face, hands, and body.

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:39.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then my father,

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:42.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
at seeing my mom’s condition,

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:46.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
decided to leave us.

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:48.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:53.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was at that moment, I guess,

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:57.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my world, my ideals,

00:05:57.502 --> 00:05:59.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
they crumbled.

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:05.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a little kid, I always wanted, like,
one big happy family.

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once we moved to New York for my treatment,

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:11.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
I no longer had that big family bond anymore.

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:17.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I was feeling back then in New York was

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:19.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
just sadness,

00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:21.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
never really peace.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in California,

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:33.038 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’re used to fires.

00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:39.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I got the call to evacuate
that morning,

00:06:39.836 --> 00:06:42.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never knew that by that evening,

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
the whole town of Paradise would be gone.

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:02.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just before the fire,
we had the needs of the congregation

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:07.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they instructed us
what to do in the case of a disaster.

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:10.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the truck full of gas,

00:07:10.492 --> 00:07:13.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had my go bag ready,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I had a map of where I was going.

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:20.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was ready.

00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:24.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers, also in their instructions,

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
said to obey the traffic instructors.

00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:29.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
The instructor told us to turn right,

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t want to turn right,

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:34.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they said obey them.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:36.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I turned right,

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:39.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
though I thought it would be really bad.

00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:46.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
The smoke got darker and darker,

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:54.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finally it got black.

00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:58.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
You couldn’t see anything.

00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:06.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom has always told me

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:09.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve always been

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:11.928 line:10% position:50% align:center
a caregiver ever since I was a little girl;

00:08:11.928 --> 00:08:15.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
it was just part of who I was.

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:19.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t like to see people suffer;
it’s very difficult for me.

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:27.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember that when I first started working
as a nurse,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would always cry.

00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:32.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cried—
Literally I cried

00:08:32.616 --> 00:08:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day that I had to go to work.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:41.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only was I overwhelmed
being a new nurse

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:44.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also

00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:47.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was battling my depression.

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2017,

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.346 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was the treasurer

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:56.932 line:10% position:50% align:center
for a prestigious bank in Nicaragua,

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:59.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was the father of a one-year-old son.

00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:00.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very happy.

00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:05.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then I lost my job.

00:09:06.608 --> 00:09:09.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said, ‘I have the experience,

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah will help me find another job,
something similar.’

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I kept looking for jobs,
but doors kept closing.

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt very tense;

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:22.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
it made me feel very useless,

00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:25.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
like

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t even provide for my family.

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:30.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was something very difficult for me.

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:41.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
These dear brothers and sisters

00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:43.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
faced serious challenges.

00:09:43.812 --> 00:09:47.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may have had moments
when they felt like Job

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:52.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said: “I loathe my life.”

00:09:52.154 --> 00:09:55.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not an unusual human emotion.

00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:59.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes things in life

00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:02.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t work out as we had hoped,

00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:05.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can hurt us deeply.

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:10.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this mean that we are helpless victims
of our circumstances?

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:15.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take note of why we can say

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:20.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Margaret, Feliks,

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:23.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miguel, Nikki, and Antoinette

00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:26.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not helpless victims.

00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary,

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:31.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are conquerors.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch and listen,

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:37.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for specific actions they took

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:40.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain their peace

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:43.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
and please give thoughtful attention

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ways that you can imitate their faith.

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:53.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up, I wondered,

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why does the Supreme Judge, God,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
allow injustice and suffering?’

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:04.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
And inside of me,
I had this need to restore justice.

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:07.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such a burning desire within me.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with that in mind,

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:13.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
I moved to Russia to stay with my sister.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
She started to study the Bible

00:11:18.448 --> 00:11:20.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was overflowing with the truth.

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:25.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked for hours till late into the night.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s when my special relationship
with Jehovah began.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when I got a taste of what it’s like

00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:37.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a caring Father.

00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:41.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had been a while
since I was able to feel that.

00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:46.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
My baptism date was very exciting.

00:11:53.024 --> 00:11:56.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual family I inherited
was very vast.

00:11:56.778 --> 00:12:00.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can instantly feel the love.

00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:04.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got baptized,
and it seemed like miracles happened

00:12:04.077 --> 00:12:06.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
one after the other.

00:12:14.004 --> 00:12:16.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a great life.

00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:22.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:25.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
the persecution started
with Brother Christensen,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then there was a ripple effect
of arrests, one after the other.

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:30.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it was our turn.

00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:33.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
In June of 2018,

00:12:33.523 --> 00:12:37.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
a huge group of armed men came to us,
to our home.

00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:44.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:12:44.743 --> 00:12:46.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now these people,

00:12:46.953 --> 00:12:50.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
this judicial system,

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:55.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the source of injustice to me.

00:12:57.172 --> 00:13:01.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sitting in a cage,
the same way my bugs used to be in a jar.

00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:08.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I felt like they did.

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:14.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your head
at that moment when you hear the verdict

00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ll stay in prison,

00:13:17.442 --> 00:13:19.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like you’ve been knocked unconscious.

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:22.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve been hit in the head with something,

00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:25.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s just a ringing sound
in your ears.

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:31.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I was taken away in handcuffs.

00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:36.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, I wasn’t in the best mood.

00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:41.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:46.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doors of the elevator opened up,
and in front of us,

00:13:57.649 --> 00:14:00.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of brothers and sisters

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:03.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
were clapping their hands
as hard as they could.

00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:07.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some were crying,

00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:10.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not crying
because they felt sorry for me.

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:13.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
They cried because they loved us

00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:16.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because they were proud of us.

00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:19.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what always happens.

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:21.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just about to lose
all your strength,

00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:26.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you
that gives you a second wind.

00:14:27.262 --> 00:14:31.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, the applause, the love,

00:14:31.349 --> 00:14:32.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tears,

00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:36.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
the shouts,
“Hang in there; everything will be OK!”

00:14:36.104 --> 00:14:41.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they gave me a second wind.

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:45.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with renewed strength,
I could run the next part of the race.

00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:51.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the guards was so surprised
that he said,

00:14:51.911 --> 00:14:54.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now that’s some support you’ve got!”

00:14:55.874 --> 00:14:57.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:01.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without friends, I would be very lonely.

00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:04.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would constantly be focusing on my illness.

00:15:04.424 --> 00:15:07.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day I met Marissa was at a convention.

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a really great friend,
a spiritual friend.

00:15:11.514 --> 00:15:13.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
When she’d take me
to my hospital appointments,

00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:16.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would eat out.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think food is just the common language
between everyone, you know.

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:20.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you talk about food, you know,
it’s like:

00:15:20.732 --> 00:15:23.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ah! Yes, we have something to talk about,”
you know.

00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be excited when she would take me
to my hospital appointment.

00:15:26.863 --> 00:15:28.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always makes me laugh, you know.

00:15:28.656 --> 00:15:32.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always helps me have a good time
no matter what.

00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:37.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, friends really help encourage me.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 17:17 says:

00:15:41.377 --> 00:15:44.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A true friend shows love at all times

00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:47.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is a brother who is born
for times of distress.”

00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:51.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have seen this come true in my life.

00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:53.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I lost my job at the bank,

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:58.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, I felt very depressed, troubled, tense.

00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:01.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have a good friend who I can talk to,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when I told him how I was feeling,
he told me:

00:16:04.734 --> 00:16:08.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look, Miguel, don’t look for the same

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:10.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“line of work.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe what you need to do
is make a change in your life.

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:19.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why don’t you find some simple work
outside of an office for a time?

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:23.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That can help you to keep your eye simple

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:25.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allow you to provide for your family.”

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
I watched my wife make bread for our family,

00:16:32.554 --> 00:16:34.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one day I told her:

00:16:34.556 --> 00:16:37.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m going to make that bread,
but not for our family.

00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:39.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to make it to sell.”

00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she told me, “No, are you crazy?”

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:45.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a big change—right?—

00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:48.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
from having a position at a bank

00:16:48.194 --> 00:16:50.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and handling a lot of money

00:16:50.196 --> 00:16:52.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
to selling on the street.

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:55.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I told her,
“Look, I’m going to put this hat on,”

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:58.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I put like a chef’s hat on.

00:16:58.329 --> 00:17:00.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I told her,

00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:04.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ll be back in less than an hour,
whether I sell or not.”

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what happened.

00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:08.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to her surprise,
I came back without any bread.

00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:11.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I got ready
to leave the second time to sell,

00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
she said: “OK. Go, but leave the hat here.”

00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also started to iron clothes
for people in their homes,

00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it looked strange
because normally where we live

00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:43.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
that type of work is done by a woman.

00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:48.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for a man to go and iron clothes
at someone’s home,

00:17:48.338 --> 00:17:50.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
you don’t see that.

00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:52.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I didn’t want to just sit back
with my arms crossed

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see what would happen.

00:17:54.093 --> 00:17:55.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:17:55.094 --> 00:17:59.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to put my hands to work
to earn a living for my family.

00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I would preach one day,
and the next day I would iron clothes.

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:08.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next day I would preach, and the day
after that I would go out and sell bread.

00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my mind was always occupied
on doing something,

00:18:10.693 --> 00:18:12.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
either for the Kingdom or my family.

00:18:12.862 --> 00:18:14.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that helped me a lot.

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:20.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was feeling so sad.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really needed Jehovah’s help
to figure out what was going on with me.

00:18:24.082 --> 00:18:26.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remember

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:31.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the 2009 article about depression
came out.

00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:37.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized: ‘OK, Jehovah,
you’re telling me this is what I have.

00:18:37.595 --> 00:18:40.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So now that I realize I have this,

00:18:40.682 --> 00:18:43.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to figure out how I can manage it.’

00:18:44.102 --> 00:18:46.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I changed my eating habits.

00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started exercising a lot more.

00:18:48.564 --> 00:18:51.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that exercising and eating healthy

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:53.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
really, really did help.

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:56.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, I made a journal,

00:18:58.324 --> 00:19:01.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I made different sections

00:19:01.536 --> 00:19:05.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the different aspects of my depression
that I dealt with.

00:19:05.164 --> 00:19:08.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each section, I would put scriptures;

00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:10.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would put articles.

00:19:10.378 --> 00:19:12.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the illustrations, the pictures,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
they speak a lot without saying anything.

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:20.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hears us.

00:19:21.848 --> 00:19:24.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cares.

00:19:30.148 --> 00:19:32.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some time in prison,

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
they transferred me to a different cell.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
In it were inmates who followed the orders

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the investigators.

00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:44.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did everything they could
to other inmates

00:19:44.912 --> 00:19:48.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make life unbearable.

00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:51.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did they do this?

00:19:51.627 --> 00:19:54.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
To break a person

00:19:54.797 --> 00:19:57.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they would start to collaborate
with the investigators,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
confess to everything, and then be able
to get transferred to another area.

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:12.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 37:3:
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.”

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Jehovah, please help me
to stay loyal to you.

00:20:17.236 --> 00:20:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please help me.”

00:20:18.654 --> 00:20:20.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
My prayers were really simple

00:20:20.698 --> 00:20:22.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
—actually like two words: “Jehovah, help!

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, help! Jehovah, help!”

00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:27.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite how they treated me,

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I dealt with others,
I tried to treat them with kindness.

00:20:32.835 --> 00:20:35.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
These people,

00:20:35.338 --> 00:20:37.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
they made life

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
uncomfortable, unbearable,

00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:43.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when they were treated kindly,

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:45.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
they started to soften.

00:20:45.723 --> 00:20:47.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to treat me differently.

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:50.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was being transferred

00:20:50.978 --> 00:20:53.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of that cell,

00:20:53.022 --> 00:20:58.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inmate who ran the area
called me over to him and said,

00:20:58.027 --> 00:21:00.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Come sit beside me.”

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:02.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I sat down.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he said, “If anybody in this prison
touches you,

00:21:06.869 --> 00:21:09.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell him that I’ll come looking for him.”

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:16.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he said, “Get his things”

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:18.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
(he told the other prisoners).

00:21:18.548 --> 00:21:20.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cell doors opened

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the guards saw

00:21:24.303 --> 00:21:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
a crowd of inmates

00:21:26.722 --> 00:21:30.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
grabbing my things
and putting them out into the hallway.

00:21:31.686 --> 00:21:34.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
I left the cell
without having to carry a thing!

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
The guard quietly closed the door.

00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:41.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
And before the inmates
returned to their cells,

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:45.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
they even said goodbye, hugged me,
and said: “Hang in there!

00:21:45.116 --> 00:21:47.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to be OK.”

00:21:47.326 --> 00:21:50.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went into the cell, and the guard
closed the door and asked me,

00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:53.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boy, how long have you been in there?”

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:55.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Three weeks.”

00:21:57.253 --> 00:22:00.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Well, normally
people leave this cell beaten up,

00:22:00.548 --> 00:22:02.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they’re thrown out by the other inmates.

00:22:02.884 --> 00:22:05.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They have to carry their own things,
and that’s if the other inmates

00:22:05.595 --> 00:22:07.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
haven’t thrown their stuff out the door.”

00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:11.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
He couldn’t believe what had just happened.

00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:13.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Jehovah.

00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:18.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exercising, changing my diet,

00:22:18.566 --> 00:22:22.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
the publications, journaling
—that was my lifeline.

00:22:22.486 --> 00:22:26.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really actually helped me
for a long time.

00:22:26.365 --> 00:22:30.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it came to a point
where it stopped working as effectively.

00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:34.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember getting ready,
dressing for the meeting,

00:22:34.874 --> 00:22:37.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was fine.

00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:40.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was getting dressed for the meeting
and about to walk out the door,

00:22:40.046 --> 00:22:41.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I couldn’t.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was this overwhelming fear
that came over me

00:22:44.592 --> 00:22:47.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an overwhelming sadness
that came over me.

00:22:47.803 --> 00:22:51.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just lost it; I just started crying.

00:22:51.557 --> 00:22:53.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t get myself together.

00:22:55.144 --> 00:22:56.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was bad.

00:22:56.187 --> 00:22:59.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got really bad;
my depression got really bad.

00:23:02.985 --> 00:23:05.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was very difficult for me

00:23:05.613 --> 00:23:08.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
to approach the brothers
to ask them for help.

00:23:08.532 --> 00:23:12.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at that time, I knew that if I didn’t,

00:23:12.453 --> 00:23:15.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
that

00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:16.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
something bad would happen.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided: ‘You know what?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to ask for a shepherding call
with my brothers,’

00:23:23.256 --> 00:23:26.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’d never talked about my depression
with the elders at all.

00:23:26.592 --> 00:23:30.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was my first time speaking with them.

00:23:30.054 --> 00:23:33.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was one brother, one of the elders,

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:35.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
who also battled depression.

00:23:35.643 --> 00:23:38.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he suggested,

00:23:38.729 --> 00:23:41.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you thought
about seeking medical help?”

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:48.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeking professional help
was something I never wanted to do.

00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:51.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that I didn’t need to do it,

00:23:51.742 --> 00:23:55.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes there comes a point where

00:23:55.454 --> 00:23:58.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need additional help

00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:02.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what you’re doing is not enough.

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:06.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world, they make you feel
that it’s a bad thing,

00:24:06.173 --> 00:24:08.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
that depression is a dirty word,

00:24:08.175 --> 00:24:11.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that seeking medical help
is something that you don’t do.

00:24:11.804 --> 00:24:13.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I realized also

00:24:13.973 --> 00:24:16.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seeking medical help

00:24:16.267 --> 00:24:20.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
was part of my being able
to worship Jehovah effectively.

00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:21.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s me doing my part.

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:26.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not everyone needs to take that step,
but for me, this is what I need to do.

00:24:26.277 --> 00:24:28.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m glad I did it because of the fact

00:24:28.904 --> 00:24:33.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ve never ever felt this good

00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:35.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
in my life.

00:24:38.164 --> 00:24:40.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
About a year later,

00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:42.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were released.

00:24:45.087 --> 00:24:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my wife and I understood

00:24:47.423 --> 00:24:50.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could put me back in prison again,

00:24:50.551 --> 00:24:52.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
so

00:24:52.595 --> 00:24:55.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed to use
the time until then to the full

00:24:55.848 --> 00:24:57.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the best way possible.

00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:02.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did we do?

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 119:165:

00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:10.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Abundant peace belongs to those
who love your law.”

00:25:11.405 --> 00:25:15.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had family worship,

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:18.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
read the Bible, and prayed together.

00:25:18.662 --> 00:25:23.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how I spent my four months of freedom.

00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:29.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was put into prison

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:33.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
for three years.

00:25:36.931 --> 00:25:41.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they told me
about my cancer being gone,

00:25:41.143 --> 00:25:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really happy; I was ecstatic.

00:25:42.645 --> 00:25:45.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was like: ‘Finally I’m going
to get to do normal things

00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:48.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that a kid my age should be able to do.

00:25:48.567 --> 00:25:52.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t need to be afraid
or anxious anymore.’

00:25:57.118 --> 00:26:00.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I did relapse again,

00:26:00.371 --> 00:26:04.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and basically right now
my present condition is

00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:06.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s nothing really more to do.

00:26:06.877 --> 00:26:11.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re just waiting
to let nature take its course basically,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s it.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with Ephesians 4:26,

00:26:23.978 --> 00:26:26.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to let myself process the news

00:26:26.689 --> 00:26:29.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let myself be sad and be angry.

00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let yourself feel those feelings;

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:37.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not try to repress them.

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:41.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you can control
your thoughts and your actions.

00:26:41.454 --> 00:26:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pretty much my whole life
has revolved around my illness,

00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:48.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’ve learned how to shift focus.

00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:50.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just don’t focus on myself all the time.

00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:53.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
I focus on others and their trials,

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:56.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are different but just as hard.

00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:01.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
You read the stories
on jw.org in the Newsroom.

00:27:01.932 --> 00:27:04.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian brothers and sisters,

00:27:04.435 --> 00:27:08.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
I pray for them constantly because

00:27:08.606 --> 00:27:11.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are going through a very tough time.

00:27:13.152 --> 00:27:17.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is [definitely] more happiness
in giving than receiving.”

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in our situation, this proved true.

00:27:20.618 --> 00:27:24.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say

00:27:24.163 --> 00:27:27.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
this really helps to relieve your pain.

00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:30.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you focus on yourself,
your pain gets worse.

00:27:31.754 --> 00:27:35.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you focus on others
and on their problems,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
your pain lessens, diminishes.

00:27:54.818 --> 00:27:56.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:27:57.947 --> 00:27:59.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:04.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Antoinette, I was so—

00:28:04.453 --> 00:28:08.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was told
that we would talk with each other,

00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was something very special for me.

00:28:11.627 --> 00:28:13.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Same for me too.

00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:15.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the brothers told me as well

00:28:15.881 --> 00:28:18.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
about meeting you, I was really excited.

00:28:18.384 --> 00:28:23.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for your prayers
in behalf of the brothers in Russia.

00:28:23.097 --> 00:28:25.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are precious.

00:28:26.058 --> 00:28:28.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can learn so much from you.

00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:32.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:36.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really nice of you to say that.

00:28:36.068 --> 00:28:40.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve both been through very many hardships.

00:28:40.364 --> 00:28:42.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure prison was super hard.

00:28:43.993 --> 00:28:47.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, in prison,
us brothers had a saying,

00:28:49.415 --> 00:28:54.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you ask: ‘How much worse can it get?’

00:28:55.546 --> 00:28:58.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
you won’t have to wait long to find out.”

00:28:58.299 --> 00:29:02.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or in other words, when you think,
‘How much worse can it get?’

00:29:02.303 --> 00:29:05.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
for sure something worse is bound to happen.

00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:09.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we received our sentence,
we thought:

00:29:09.435 --> 00:29:12.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, that’s it.
That’s the worst that could happen.’

00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:25.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course, it got worse.

00:29:26.452 --> 00:29:29.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon arrival at the prison,

00:29:29.872 --> 00:29:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were beaten up

00:29:32.708 --> 00:29:35.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for hours we were humiliated.

00:29:45.888 --> 00:29:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought, ‘How much worse can it get?’

00:29:49.558 --> 00:29:51.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the next day, we were told,

00:29:51.977 --> 00:29:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are going to the punishment cell.”

00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought,

00:29:56.065 --> 00:30:00.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, how much worse can it get?’

00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:03.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, it started with one floor,

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:07.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it went to another floor,
and then the whole entire hospital.

00:30:07.326 --> 00:30:09.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every floor had COVID patients.

00:30:12.915 --> 00:30:17.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was some of the hardest nursing
that I’ve ever done in my life

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all of my years of nursing.

00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:24.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we lost a lot of good nurses

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were right in the trenches with me
who were in there doing their best.

00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:31.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
We lost a lot of good people.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was on medication to help me,

00:30:35.312 --> 00:30:37.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
it still didn’t take the depression away.

00:30:37.523 --> 00:30:39.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re like: ‘What’s the point?

00:30:39.817 --> 00:30:41.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I can’t save anyone.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t, I can’t help anyone.’

00:30:45.823 --> 00:30:50.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was devastating.
It truly, truly was devastating.

00:30:53.706 --> 00:30:58.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever felt as Feliks did
when he asked,

00:30:58.585 --> 00:31:01.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How much worse can it get?”

00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:05.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, a spiritual person

00:31:05.843 --> 00:31:08.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
can see each new challenge

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an opportunity to rely on Jehovah.

00:31:13.016 --> 00:31:17.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we watch
the concluding part of this video,

00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:20.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
please take note of how Jehovah strengthened

00:31:20.691 --> 00:31:22.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
these brothers and sisters

00:31:22.693 --> 00:31:26.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deepened their friendship with him.

00:31:26.572 --> 00:31:29.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about your own circumstances

00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:34.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ways that Jehovah
has helped you through trials,

00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:37.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have full confidence

00:31:37.124 --> 00:31:40.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will continue to do so.

00:31:44.882 --> 00:31:47.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I decided
that I was going to stop asking,

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:50.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How much worse could it get?”

00:31:51.597 --> 00:31:53.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Jehovah for endurance

00:31:53.974 --> 00:31:58.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joy for that day—just for that day.

00:32:00.856 --> 00:32:04.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at those times, I just

00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:07.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
cry to Jehovah,

00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:11.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to Jehovah about how I’m feeling,

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just ask for his peace
to help me to deal.

00:32:18.123 --> 00:32:22.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve talked to Jehovah
very intimately and personally

00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:27.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never like I have
when I was so alone there.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I was going to die.

00:32:35.933 --> 00:32:40.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Jehovah if he saw enough good in me,

00:32:40.187 --> 00:32:43.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would just resurrect me

00:32:43.232 --> 00:32:45.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I’d love to be in his new world

00:32:45.984 --> 00:32:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see my husband again and my children.

00:32:50.322 --> 00:32:55.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thanked him so much
for the life that I had.

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:59.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I felt such a peace

00:32:59.206 --> 00:33:02.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I’d never felt before.

00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:06.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just knew it was Jehovah getting me out.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
The obedience, just doing what we were told,

00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:18.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
it came from Jehovah, and it was so simple.

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gave him something to bless,
and it may have saved my life.

00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:33.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just never wanted to be a burden on people,

00:33:33.115 --> 00:33:34.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:33:34.741 --> 00:33:38.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters
had come from all over the country

00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:42.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do work for this house
and the other houses—all of them.

00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:47.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
They made me feel wanted,

00:33:47.379 --> 00:33:49.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they made me feel loved.

00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:55.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feel like Jehovah cared enough
to give attention to me,

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
I

00:34:00.517 --> 00:34:02.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
just felt so unworthy.

00:34:02.603 --> 00:34:05.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here all these people

00:34:05.314 --> 00:34:07.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
are here taking care of me.

00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:11.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you just look at them,
and then you think:

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m part of this organization.
I’ve got to do better.

00:34:15.032 --> 00:34:18.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to be like them
and make other people happy.’

00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:28.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m able to help people
who are battling depression,

00:34:28.128 --> 00:34:30.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like Jehovah is using me in that way,

00:34:30.714 --> 00:34:34.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it makes me happy
that I can be of use to Jehovah.

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:38.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to feel—
It’s so nice to feel good again,

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel happy again, to be able to smile,

00:34:42.184 --> 00:34:44.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to take in enjoyment

00:34:44.186 --> 00:34:47.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the small things, you know,
in Jehovah’s creation

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:52.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and, you know, just be happy that I’m alive.

00:34:52.152 --> 00:34:54.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
So

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
yeah, yeah.

00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:07.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I have a stable job.

00:35:07.751 --> 00:35:09.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work at a hardware store.

00:35:11.213 --> 00:35:12.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I feel at peace.

00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:15.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The adversities have made me stronger,

00:35:15.258 --> 00:35:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and overall, I have
a much closer relationship with Jehovah.

00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:22.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m still making bread.

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:25.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at home, yeah,
I’m the one who irons the clothes.

00:35:29.564 --> 00:35:34.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a while, I found out
that I was being deported.

00:35:34.569 --> 00:35:37.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember getting off the train.

00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:40.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took me through the back door,

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:43.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my wife, Zhenya,
was standing at the main entrance.

00:35:43.412 --> 00:35:46.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was on the phone. She couldn’t see me.

00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was looking at the main entrance.

00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:53.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I threw my bag down as I ran to her.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could see from the corner of her eyes
someone was running.

00:35:59.845 --> 00:36:02.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was a little confused, even scared.

00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:11.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there I was

00:36:15.569 --> 00:36:18.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
hugging the person I loved the most.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was one
of the most beautiful days of my life.

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:32.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:36:32.335 --> 00:36:34.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Privet.</i>

00:36:35.172 --> 00:36:36.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:36:40.427 --> 00:36:45.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard that you were praying for us

00:36:45.432 --> 00:36:48.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the brothers and sisters in Russia,

00:36:49.853 --> 00:36:51.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really encouraged me and Feliks.

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:54.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s such an example for me personally.

00:36:55.942 --> 00:36:57.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
We mentioned it in our prayer yesterday;

00:36:57.944 --> 00:36:59.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feliks was saying

00:36:59.946 --> 00:37:03.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are a great example
of how we need

00:37:03.033 --> 00:37:07.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
to genuinely care
for our brothers and sisters.

00:37:08.413 --> 00:37:11.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you very much.

00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:24.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:37:24.763 --> 00:37:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:37:25.722 --> 00:37:26.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was nice meeting you.

00:37:26.765 --> 00:37:28.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:34.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
My cancer is uncurable,

00:37:34.106 --> 00:37:37.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I know the cure is in the new system.

00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:40.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the cure!

00:37:44.574 --> 00:37:48.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like to imagine, ‘When that time happens,
what will I be doing?’

00:37:49.329 --> 00:37:51.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, I’m going to be jumping for joy

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m going to be rid of my cancer.

00:37:54.417 --> 00:37:57.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to enjoy food
that we never really got to enjoy,

00:37:57.712 --> 00:38:01.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m going to have so many animals.

00:38:01.133 --> 00:38:05.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to make a house.
I’m going to learn how to make a house.

00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:09.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace in this world is not the absence

00:38:09.724 --> 00:38:12.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
of illness,

00:38:12.435 --> 00:38:14.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
danger,

00:38:14.646 --> 00:38:16.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
persecution,

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
or economic problems.

00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:26.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace in this world
is listening to Jehovah’s guidance,

00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:30.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
praying to Jehovah constantly,

00:38:32.205 --> 00:38:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditating on Jehovah’s Word
and his promises.

00:38:39.796 --> 00:38:42.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace in this world is also

00:38:42.549 --> 00:38:44.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
having good friends by our side

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and having a good sense of humor.

00:38:53.602 --> 00:38:56.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I’ve learned from all of this

00:38:56.605 --> 00:39:01.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace isn’t from what’s outside,

00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:04.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what’s going on,
or from what you’re experiencing.

00:39:04.613 --> 00:39:08.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that peace is on the inside,

00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:12.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that comes from Jehovah.

00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:20.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
These examples we’ve just seen

00:39:20.754 --> 00:39:22.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
are of ordinary people

00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:25.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with feelings like ours.”

00:39:25.383 --> 00:39:28.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they felt peace

00:39:28.178 --> 00:39:32.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when confronting serious trials.

00:39:32.057 --> 00:39:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they do it?

00:39:34.517 --> 00:39:37.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Miguel lost his job,

00:39:37.062 --> 00:39:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
he kept his focus on serving Jehovah

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:44.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was not too proud to do humble work

00:39:44.361 --> 00:39:46.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide for his family.

00:39:47.364 --> 00:39:51.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Margaret was prepared for a natural disaster,

00:39:51.785 --> 00:39:54.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and throughout her ordeal,

00:39:54.287 --> 00:39:57.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
she prayed to Jehovah.

00:39:57.624 --> 00:40:00.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
While struggling with depression,

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:04.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nikki did research using our publications

00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:08.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked for help from the elders.

00:40:08.426 --> 00:40:12.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when facing brutal persecution,

00:40:12.264 --> 00:40:16.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feliks showed kindness to his persecutors.

00:40:16.268 --> 00:40:19.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that the way he responded

00:40:19.479 --> 00:40:22.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
would reflect Christian qualities.

00:40:22.941 --> 00:40:24.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
And dear Antoinette,

00:40:24.985 --> 00:40:27.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite her diagnosis,

00:40:27.779 --> 00:40:30.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
focuses not on herself

00:40:30.949 --> 00:40:33.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on helping others.

00:40:33.827 --> 00:40:37.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
As she said, the cure for her

00:40:37.122 --> 00:40:39.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as it is for all of us—

00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:41.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
is God’s Kingdom.

00:40:43.044 --> 00:40:46.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are experiencing trials,

00:40:46.756 --> 00:40:50.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on what you can control,

00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
help others,

00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:54.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
be grateful,

00:40:54.723 --> 00:40:59.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rely on Jehovah and his organization.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are not experiencing serious trials,

00:41:04.065 --> 00:41:07.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
do what you can to prepare for them

00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:10.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
by building yourself up spiritually.

00:41:11.406 --> 00:41:13.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be anxious.

00:41:13.616 --> 00:41:16.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fear of what might happen

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:19.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
is often worse than the trial itself.

00:41:20.832 --> 00:41:25.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah, and be assured

00:41:25.128 --> 00:41:29.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will never abandon his friends.

00:41:30.592 --> 00:41:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dear brothers and sisters
whom we’ve just listened to

00:41:35.138 --> 00:41:37.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
are doing well spiritually.

00:41:37.891 --> 00:41:42.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank them
for participating in these interviews.

00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:46.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d also like to thank
all our brothers and sisters

00:41:46.107 --> 00:41:48.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
working in the medical field

00:41:48.443 --> 00:41:52.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have gone the extra mile
during this pandemic.

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:55.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 5:11 reads:

00:41:55.867 --> 00:42:00.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We consider happy those who have endured.

00:42:00.372 --> 00:42:03.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have heard of the endurance of Job

00:42:03.249 --> 00:42:06.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave,

00:42:06.753 --> 00:42:11.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is very tender in affection
and merciful.”

00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:17.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings we receive by enduring trials

00:42:17.097 --> 00:42:19.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
can strengthen us for the future

00:42:19.974 --> 00:42:23.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help us to become the kind of person

00:42:23.353 --> 00:42:26.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah wants us to be.

00:42:26.648 --> 00:42:31.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inner peace and joy we experience

00:42:31.027 --> 00:42:34.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a gift from Jehovah.

00:42:34.406 --> 00:42:37.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
As these brothers and sisters
from around the world

00:42:37.909 --> 00:42:39.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
have reminded us,

00:42:39.994 --> 00:42:42.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need never doubt

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:46.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our wonderful heavenly Father will bless

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those who continue loving him.

00:42:56.219 --> 00:42:59.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank all of the sisters and brothers
who were interviewed

00:42:59.222 --> 00:43:01.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
for their sincere comments

00:43:01.224 --> 00:43:05.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for allowing us to benefit and learn
from their experiences.

00:43:06.104 --> 00:43:08.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those candid interviews show

00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:11.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can remain at peace

00:43:11.484 --> 00:43:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when enduring severe trials.

00:43:15.155 --> 00:43:20.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always supports and cares for us,
his loyal servants.

00:43:22.912 --> 00:43:26.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
The time has now come
for the baptism discourse.

00:43:26.666 --> 00:43:30.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage all baptism candidates
to pay particular attention.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:36.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does walking in Jehovah’s way
bring peace?

00:43:36.134 --> 00:43:40.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we stay on the road
to everlasting life?

00:43:40.096 --> 00:43:42.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please listen carefully
as Brother William Turner,

00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:44.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:43:44.893 --> 00:43:47.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
delivers the talk

00:43:47.061 --> 00:43:50.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go On Walking ‘in the Way of Peace.’”

00:43:58.281 --> 00:43:59.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot express

00:43:59.908 --> 00:44:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
to you baptism candidates around the world

00:44:02.911 --> 00:44:05.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much of a privilege it is for us

00:44:05.413 --> 00:44:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in this occasion with you.

00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:10.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are following through
on the most important decision

00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:12.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve ever made

00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to make it known publicly

00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:17.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have dedicated your life to God.

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:21.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know your situations vary.

00:44:21.888 --> 00:44:25.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you candidates
were raised knowing about Jehovah,

00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:29.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you had to develop your own
personal relationship with him.

00:44:29.812 --> 00:44:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others of you may be taking this step

00:44:32.315 --> 00:44:35.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
after learning about Jehovah more recently.

00:44:35.443 --> 00:44:38.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever your circumstances,

00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
likely it was a journey

00:44:41.282 --> 00:44:46.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a figurative road
you had to travel to get to this point.

00:44:46.037 --> 00:44:48.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the Bible also compares true worship

00:44:48.873 --> 00:44:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a road, a path,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a walkway that has to be traveled.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 9:2,

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the first-century
Christian congregation was being established,

00:45:01.469 --> 00:45:05.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ disciples used the term “The Way”

00:45:05.306 --> 00:45:09.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to designate their newly established
form of worship.

00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:12.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
They understood that as baptized Christians,

00:45:12.939 --> 00:45:16.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were walking on a new path

00:45:16.442 --> 00:45:21.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every aspect of their lives was involved.

00:45:21.406 --> 00:45:25.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s going to be
the case for you as well.

00:45:25.076 --> 00:45:27.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, note how the Bible describes this.

00:45:27.453 --> 00:45:31.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Ephesians.

00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:35.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And note what is stated
in Ephesians chapter 4,

00:45:36.504 --> 00:45:40.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verses 22 through 24.

00:45:50.351 --> 00:45:53.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says: “You were taught
to put away the old personality

00:45:53.813 --> 00:45:56.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that conforms
to your formal course of conduct

00:45:56.691 --> 00:46:00.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that is being corrupted
according to its deceptive desires.

00:46:00.737 --> 00:46:03.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:46:03.531 --> 00:46:06.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in your dominant mental attitude,

00:46:06.451 --> 00:46:08.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and should put on the new personality

00:46:08.786 --> 00:46:11.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that was created according to God’s will

00:46:11.372 --> 00:46:14.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
in true righteousness and loyalty.”

00:46:15.501 --> 00:46:18.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like the first-century Christians,

00:46:18.254 --> 00:46:21.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have come to know
the truth about Jehovah.

00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:23.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the things you’ve learned

00:46:23.509 --> 00:46:26.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
have led you to become baptism candidates.

00:46:26.929 --> 00:46:29.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like all of God’s people,

00:46:29.057 --> 00:46:31.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve done what verse 22 states,

00:46:31.142 --> 00:46:34.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“put away the old personality.”

00:46:34.312 --> 00:46:37.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there in verse 23,

00:46:37.273 --> 00:46:40.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must also “continue to be made new

00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:45.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
in [our] dominant mental attitude.”

00:46:45.198 --> 00:46:48.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves our thoughts

00:46:48.326 --> 00:46:52.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what we allow our mind to dwell on.

00:46:52.163 --> 00:46:54.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know, the footnote for that verse

00:46:54.582 --> 00:46:57.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates this term could also be rendered

00:46:57.085 --> 00:47:01.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the force actuating [our] mind”

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:05.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
or literally translated
“to the spirit of your mind.”

00:47:07.053 --> 00:47:09.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the English language,

00:47:09.055 --> 00:47:13.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps you’ve heard someone say
that they are in good spirits

00:47:13.434 --> 00:47:17.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you’ve heard someone
described as being mean-spirited.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:24.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a description
of one’s dominant mental attitude

00:47:24.153 --> 00:47:27.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one’s thoughts and motivations.

00:47:27.407 --> 00:47:31.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what moves us to act the way that we do.

00:47:33.705 --> 00:47:36.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal as baptized servants of Jehovah

00:47:36.874 --> 00:47:40.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to gain a dominant mental attitude

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:44.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
that aligns and is in harmony

00:47:44.257 --> 00:47:47.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
with God’s thoughts.

00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:49.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that won’t always be easy.

00:47:49.929 --> 00:47:53.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes time and a lot of effort.

00:47:53.683 --> 00:47:56.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who walk
in the way of peace

00:47:56.853 --> 00:47:58.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
often encounter trials.

00:47:58.938 --> 00:48:01.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to stay on that road,

00:48:01.607 --> 00:48:05.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be willing to make sacrifices.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like some of those first-century Christians,

00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:12.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may have to endure direct persecution.

00:48:12.577 --> 00:48:17.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we continue to walk in Jehovah’s way,

00:48:17.248 --> 00:48:19.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to be happy

00:48:19.625 --> 00:48:22.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah is going to bless us.

00:48:22.962 --> 00:48:26.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 1:79, he assures us

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will “guide our feet
in the way of peace.”

00:48:32.013 --> 00:48:34.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a comforting thought, isn’t it?

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re excited.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re excited that you baptism candidates

00:48:39.645 --> 00:48:41.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
have undertaken this journey.

00:48:41.898 --> 00:48:43.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that you have

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
some eight and a half million
other Witnesses on this road with you.

00:48:48.654 --> 00:48:50.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today,

00:48:50.656 --> 00:48:55.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is our honor and privilege to welcome you

00:48:55.203 --> 00:48:59.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to welcome you to Jehovah’s way of peace

00:48:59.123 --> 00:49:01.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “the road leading off into life.”

00:49:03.419 --> 00:49:05.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we go through our discussion today,

00:49:05.421 --> 00:49:08.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to answer three questions.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:12.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, why is it important
that we do not give up

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
on walking in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:49:15.973 --> 00:49:17.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second,

00:49:17.975 --> 00:49:22.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does walking
in Jehovah’s way bring us peace?

00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:25.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, what can we do

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue walking
in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:49:31.072 --> 00:49:33.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s address our first question:

00:49:33.282 --> 00:49:37.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it important that we do not give up

00:49:37.036 --> 00:49:40.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
on walking in Jehovah’s way of peace?

00:49:40.289 --> 00:49:42.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to answer that, let’s turn, please,

00:49:42.333 --> 00:49:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:49:46.963 --> 00:49:48.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll note

00:49:48.381 --> 00:49:53.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Corinthians 4:16-18.

00:49:55.638 --> 00:49:57.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it reads:

00:49:57.557 --> 00:50:01.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, we do not give up,

00:50:01.561 --> 00:50:05.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but even if the man
we are outside is wasting away,

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:10.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“certainly the man we are inside
is being renewed from day to day.

00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:13.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For though the tribulation
is momentary and light,

00:50:13.406 --> 00:50:15.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it works out for us a glory

00:50:15.908 --> 00:50:20.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is of more and more
surpassing greatness and is everlasting;

00:50:20.413 --> 00:50:22.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
“while we keep our eyes,

00:50:22.415 --> 00:50:27.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not on the things seen,
but on the things unseen.

00:50:27.044 --> 00:50:29.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the things seen are temporary,

00:50:29.922 --> 00:50:33.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the things unseen are everlasting.”

00:50:35.595 --> 00:50:38.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see why we can’t give up?

00:50:38.598 --> 00:50:41.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires that we remain active

00:50:43.561 --> 00:50:45.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persevere in the way of peace.

00:50:47.648 --> 00:50:51.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
You dear candidates have not given up
in your efforts to please Jehovah

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:55.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to qualify to become part of his people.

00:50:55.406 --> 00:50:58.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why is that?

00:50:58.117 --> 00:51:00.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because of your love for him.

00:51:00.536 --> 00:51:05.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know that any trials
and obstacles you face now

00:51:05.291 --> 00:51:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
are “momentary and light”

00:51:08.044 --> 00:51:11.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
when compared to an eternity
in God’s new world.

00:51:13.049 --> 00:51:16.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, you will enter
into a special relationship

00:51:16.344 --> 00:51:18.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah God.

00:51:18.346 --> 00:51:22.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
So don’t let anyone or anything

00:51:22.141 --> 00:51:24.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
jeopardize that relationship.

00:51:24.769 --> 00:51:28.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let it be something that you cherish

00:51:28.439 --> 00:51:31.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that relationship is everlasting.

00:51:33.402 --> 00:51:37.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
So keep walking in Jehovah’s way of peace.

00:51:37.323 --> 00:51:40.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Focus on what it means
to have him as a Friend,

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have him guiding your steps.

00:51:44.163 --> 00:51:46.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t give up,

00:51:46.415 --> 00:51:49.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
then despite any trials you face,

00:51:49.418 --> 00:51:54.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will continue
to enjoy Jehovah’s blessings.

00:51:54.173 --> 00:51:56.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re confident that you can do so.

00:51:57.885 --> 00:52:01.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to highlight how this can be done,

00:52:01.055 --> 00:52:03.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this time,

00:52:03.057 --> 00:52:06.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re pleased to introduce
Sister Indira Alfonso.

00:52:06.644 --> 00:52:09.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Alfonso was baptized in 2006

00:52:09.897 --> 00:52:14.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now serves with her husband
as Bethel family members in Warwick.

00:52:15.194 --> 00:52:17.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Alfonso,

00:52:17.196 --> 00:52:19.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you tell us a little about your journey,

00:52:19.991 --> 00:52:23.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
how you became associated
with Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:25.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I was born in Cuba,

00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:28.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my mom and I moved
to the United States when I was nine.

00:52:28.082 --> 00:52:31.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I was young,
I felt it was important to look for God.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whenever we moved,
I would visit the local churches in the area,

00:52:35.297 --> 00:52:37.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
even getting baptized in a number of them.

00:52:37.591 --> 00:52:41.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was 11, my mom
let me move in with my aunt,

00:52:41.387 --> 00:52:43.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:47.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from there, she asked my mom
if I could study with a pioneer sister

00:52:47.143 --> 00:52:49.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
from her congregation, and my mom agreed.

00:52:50.521 --> 00:52:52.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s nice to see
that even at a young age

00:52:52.481 --> 00:52:54.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
you had a spiritual need.

00:52:54.692 --> 00:52:58.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
So during this time
leading up to your baptism

00:52:58.029 --> 00:53:00.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:00.072 --> 00:53:03.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you encounter any trials
that threatened to make you give up?

00:53:03.576 --> 00:53:06.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I did.
I made changes very quickly.

00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:10.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stopped celebrating holidays
and stopped praying to idols.

00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:13.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these changes
were very strange to my mom

00:53:13.335 --> 00:53:16.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just difficult for her to understand.

00:53:16.005 --> 00:53:18.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was really afraid
that I was being brainwashed.

00:53:18.883 --> 00:53:21.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after studying for several months,

00:53:21.135 --> 00:53:23.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had me move back in with her,

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:27.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
which meant the end of my studies
and no more attending meetings.

00:53:27.266 --> 00:53:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t long before my association

00:53:30.019 --> 00:53:32.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
was affecting my speech and my behavior.

00:53:32.605 --> 00:53:36.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found myself easily influenced
to even celebrate my birthday again.

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:41.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could feel I was moving further away
from Jehovah instead of closer to him.

00:53:41.447 --> 00:53:44.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry to hear that, Sister Alfonso.

00:53:44.158 --> 00:53:46.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what helped you not to give up

00:53:46.994 --> 00:53:49.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to go on walking in the way of peace?

00:53:49.246 --> 00:53:52.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped me was the scripture
at Matthew 10:37,

00:53:52.458 --> 00:53:56.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jesus said:
“Whoever has greater affection for father

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:59.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
or mother than for me is not worthy of me.”

00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:01.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that a peaceful
relationship with Jehovah

00:54:01.842 --> 00:54:03.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
might mean no peace with my family.

00:54:03.928 --> 00:54:06.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I knew that if I were
to ever gain my mom,

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:10.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to walk with Jehovah
the right way and not give up.

00:54:10.142 --> 00:54:12.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one night, I prayed to him,

00:54:12.144 --> 00:54:14.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
crying for forgiveness
and asking for his help.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to my surprise,
a few days later without any explanation,

00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:21.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mom had me move back in with my aunt.

00:54:21.362 --> 00:54:23.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I resumed my Bible studies,

00:54:23.739 --> 00:54:27.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a year later
at the age of 15, I got baptized.

00:54:27.827 --> 00:54:31.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah clearly heard
and answered your prayer.

00:54:31.413 --> 00:54:35.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then, have you seen
continued evidence of Jehovah’s guidance?

00:54:35.709 --> 00:54:40.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
A good friend helped me to adjust the way
I was communicating with my mom.

00:54:40.256 --> 00:54:45.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one day, I called her and expressed to her
how much I truly appreciate and love her.

00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:48.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want us to be distant anymore.

00:54:48.013 --> 00:54:51.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
I explained to her
that my love for her had never changed,

00:54:51.767 --> 00:54:54.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my love for Jehovah had come first.

00:54:54.937 --> 00:54:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that conversation
was a turning point for us.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we have had many positive discussions,

00:55:00.568 --> 00:55:03.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she’s much more understanding
of my decision.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing Jehovah’s guidance in my life

00:55:05.531 --> 00:55:08.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes me determined
to continue walking in his way of peace.

00:55:09.702 --> 00:55:11.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Sister Alfonso.

00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:14.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate
your faithful example and comments.

00:55:17.751 --> 00:55:20.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s address our second point.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does walking in Jehovah’s way
bring us peace?

00:55:25.759 --> 00:55:29.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to answer this,
we’re going to compare the path,

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
or journey, you’ve taken on the road to life

00:55:32.558 --> 00:55:35.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a literal road, or walkway.

00:55:35.769 --> 00:55:40.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in making this comparison,
we find a number of similarities.

00:55:40.649 --> 00:55:45.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, both roads have boundaries,

00:55:45.237 --> 00:55:50.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
a purpose, and a destination.

00:55:50.117 --> 00:55:53.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s start
with that first one: boundaries.

00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:57.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a literal road, we may see “Yield”

00:55:57.124 --> 00:55:59.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Do Not Enter” signs,

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
guardrails on the side of the road,

00:56:02.004 --> 00:56:05.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
or lines on the road
to help us stay in our lane.

00:56:05.966 --> 00:56:08.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those are boundaries.

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those boundaries
are there for our protection

00:56:11.972 --> 00:56:14.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if we step outside of them,

00:56:14.725 --> 00:56:18.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
we risk getting hurt or lost.

00:56:19.939 --> 00:56:22.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be great if we could tell you

00:56:22.524 --> 00:56:26.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
that as you continue
on the road to life after your baptism,

00:56:26.612 --> 00:56:30.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would love to say that the rest
of your journey is smooth sailing.

00:56:30.824 --> 00:56:32.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll have nothing but safe travels.

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the reality is

00:56:37.748 --> 00:56:42.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will face challenges
and tests of your faith.

00:56:42.753 --> 00:56:45.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil will make sure of it.

00:56:45.631 --> 00:56:48.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will make sure
that you are confronted

00:56:48.509 --> 00:56:50.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
with temptations.

00:56:50.761 --> 00:56:52.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to do whatever he can

00:56:52.846 --> 00:56:56.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
to damage
your special relationship with Jehovah.

00:56:57.685 --> 00:57:01.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re confident that you can succeed.

00:57:01.021 --> 00:57:04.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be successful and avoid danger

00:57:04.358 --> 00:57:07.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you remain within the boundaries

00:57:07.611 --> 00:57:10.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s way of peace.

00:57:10.864 --> 00:57:14.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do you stay
within those boundaries?

00:57:14.034 --> 00:57:17.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
By continuing to learn
about Jehovah’s laws

00:57:17.288 --> 00:57:21.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and principles and obeying them.

00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:25.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
That obedience will not only protect you,

00:57:25.045 --> 00:57:28.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it will give you inner peace

00:57:28.048 --> 00:57:31.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peace that comes
from having a clean conscience.

00:57:33.595 --> 00:57:36.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next similarity between a literal road

00:57:36.557 --> 00:57:39.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being on the road to life
that we’ll discuss

00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:42.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
is having a purpose.

00:57:42.771 --> 00:57:45.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we travel on a literal road,

00:57:45.649 --> 00:57:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
our plan usually is not to get on the road

00:57:49.236 --> 00:57:53.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just stand still (to become stationary)

00:57:53.407 --> 00:57:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
or watch other people or vehicles go by.

00:57:57.077 --> 00:57:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we’re there for a reason.

00:57:59.747 --> 00:58:03.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose of the road
is to enable movement

00:58:03.375 --> 00:58:07.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to help us get from one place to another.

00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar sense,
being on Jehovah’s way of peace

00:58:12.217 --> 00:58:15.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
allows you to move forward,

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:19.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make continual spiritual progress.

00:58:19.224 --> 00:58:24.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, there are many ways
that we can make spiritual advancement.

00:58:24.104 --> 00:58:28.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
One important way
that all Christians can do so

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by cultivating spiritual qualities.

00:58:32.196 --> 00:58:34.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is so pleasing to Jehovah.

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:36.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider with me, for example,

00:58:36.992 --> 00:58:39.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 6:10.

00:58:43.707 --> 00:58:48.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what’s mentioned here
at Galatians chapter 6,

00:58:48.504 --> 00:58:50.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 10.

00:58:50.547 --> 00:58:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “So, then, as long as we
have the opportunity,

00:58:55.344 --> 00:58:58.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let us work what is good toward all,

00:58:58.472 --> 00:59:03.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially toward those
related to us in the faith.”

00:59:04.853 --> 00:59:07.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one way to advance spiritually

00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:11.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to look for ways
to do good things for others,

00:59:11.985 --> 00:59:16.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
both inside and outside the congregation.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:21.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pandemic has afforded us
many opportunities to do this.

00:59:21.578 --> 00:59:24.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been able to call and check on others

00:59:24.164 --> 00:59:27.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and distribute food or supplies when needed.

00:59:27.084 --> 00:59:29.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think of what our brothers

00:59:29.086 --> 00:59:32.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
have done time and again to assist others

00:59:32.381 --> 00:59:35.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
during natural disasters.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take a minute and think
about your local area.

00:59:39.888 --> 00:59:44.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you work what is good toward all?

00:59:44.852 --> 00:59:47.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are there ones
that need assistance getting food

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
or running errands?

00:59:50.232 --> 00:59:52.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there someone who could use

00:59:52.693 --> 00:59:57.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
a good word of encouragement
to cheer them up?

00:59:57.448 --> 01:00:01.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we know individuals
who have lost loved ones in death

01:00:01.076 --> 01:00:04.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom we could share words of comfort

01:00:04.246 --> 01:00:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
or maybe simply provide a listening ear?

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:12.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, by displaying spiritual qualities

01:00:12.171 --> 01:00:14.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities such as kindness,

01:00:14.298 --> 01:00:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
compassion, hospitality, generosity—

01:00:17.801 --> 01:00:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to feel deeply rewarded

01:00:21.513 --> 01:00:23.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
for doing these things.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re pleasing Jehovah

01:00:26.894 --> 01:00:29.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you will show that your purpose

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being on the road to life

01:00:31.523 --> 01:00:35.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not just to save yourself

01:00:35.194 --> 01:00:37.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to help others.

01:00:39.114 --> 01:00:42.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there was a third similarity
between being on a literal road

01:00:42.576 --> 01:00:44.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being on the road to life.

01:00:44.745 --> 01:00:46.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
In both cases,

01:00:46.747 --> 01:00:49.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a destination

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we want to reach.

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:57.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling on a literal path
will eventually take you to your destination.

01:00:57.174 --> 01:00:59.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a Witness of Jehovah,

01:00:59.176 --> 01:01:03.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
our journey, our walk,
on this figurative road

01:01:03.514 --> 01:01:06.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
will lead us to our destination

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:11.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the goal of enjoying
a peaceful friendship with God forever.

01:01:13.607 --> 01:01:16.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we long for that time
in God’s new world,

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
even now we can experience
the blessings and inner peace

01:01:21.865 --> 01:01:25.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that come from a life of service to Jehovah.

01:01:27.746 --> 01:01:31.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now have the privilege
to speak with Sister Gloria Herd.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:34.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Herd has been baptized
for over 70 years

01:01:34.878 --> 01:01:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has enjoyed a rich spiritual life
in special full-time service

01:01:39.716 --> 01:01:43.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
with her husband,
Brother Samuel Herd of the Governing Body.

01:01:45.013 --> 01:01:49.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Herd, you’ve had
many rich spiritual blessings,

01:01:49.393 --> 01:01:54.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know that you’ve encountered
challenges along the way.

01:01:54.022 --> 01:01:58.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as you’ve carried out
these assignments through the years,

01:01:58.026 --> 01:02:00.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking in Jehovah’s way of peace,

01:02:00.737 --> 01:02:04.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
how have you managed
to enjoy greater inner peace?

01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:08.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned, Brother Turner,
that if Jehovah gives you an assignment,

01:02:08.495 --> 01:02:11.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will give you what you need to fulfill it.

01:02:11.582 --> 01:02:16.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned and really benefited
from the traveling overseers and their wives.

01:02:16.336 --> 01:02:20.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such a privilege to serve along
with these faithful brothers and sisters,

01:02:20.007 --> 01:02:24.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and several of them had served me
and my family when I was very young.

01:02:24.303 --> 01:02:27.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to see their faithfulness,
to see their happiness,

01:02:27.764 --> 01:02:31.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see that they really had inner peace

01:02:31.393 --> 01:02:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
really benefited me.

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned from that,
and I wanted to follow their example.

01:02:37.024 --> 01:02:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
That help from others can be so valuable.

01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:41.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
How else have you managed?

01:02:41.528 --> 01:02:45.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve enjoyed inner peace too
from praying to Jehovah a lot.

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:49.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times we had
very little money or no money,

01:02:49.953 --> 01:02:51.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we never missed a meal,

01:02:51.955 --> 01:02:55.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we never missed any theocratic event.

01:02:55.042 --> 01:02:58.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned that having no money

01:02:58.378 --> 01:03:00.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not an obstacle to Jehovah.

01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:03.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
He heard our prayers, he answered them,

01:03:03.383 --> 01:03:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was as if the blessing
sometimes just fell out of heaven.

01:03:08.513 --> 01:03:10.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer can be so powerful.

01:03:10.098 --> 01:03:12.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, how has walking
in Jehovah’s way of peace

01:03:15.395 --> 01:03:17.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped you to have peace with others?

01:03:17.731 --> 01:03:21.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worked and lived with many sisters,

01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:23.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they all had different personalities.

01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:27.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I learned that I had
to apply Romans 12:18,

01:03:27.324 --> 01:03:30.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says:
“As far as it depends [upon me],

01:03:30.827 --> 01:03:33.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
be peaceable with all men [and women].”

01:03:33.914 --> 01:03:37.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I learned that I have to adjust

01:03:37.751 --> 01:03:41.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
my personality sometimes to keep peace.

01:03:41.797 --> 01:03:44.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
This happened very often.

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:49.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one time, we moved in
with a sister on Tuesday morning,

01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:53.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and something I said upset her very much.

01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:55.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
She got very angry.

01:03:55.185 --> 01:03:58.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I decided not to pursue the issue

01:03:58.313 --> 01:04:00.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I had to live with her for a week.

01:04:00.732 --> 01:04:04.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just decided
to let her see by my conduct

01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could never have meant
what she thought.

01:04:07.823 --> 01:04:12.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the week went by,
the days went by, the tension lessened.

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:16.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by Monday when we left,
we were the best of friends.

01:04:16.957 --> 01:04:20.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she gave me a big hug,
and nothing more was said about the subject.

01:04:21.128 --> 01:04:23.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it sounds like you
handled that beautifully, Sister Herd.

01:04:23.338 --> 01:04:26.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your spiritual qualities were evident.

01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:30.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, finally, how has walking
in Jehovah’s way of peace

01:04:30.178 --> 01:04:32.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped you have peace with God?

01:04:32.472 --> 01:04:34.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you see Jehovah act

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:37.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
on your behalf over and over and over again,

01:04:37.644 --> 01:04:40.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
it makes you feel that you have his approval.

01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:43.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that Sam and I are in our senior years,

01:04:43.567 --> 01:04:46.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel He has given us
‘the desire of our heart’

01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:48.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
by allowing us to serve at Bethel,

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
which had been our goal for many years.

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:54.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know that as long as
I stay faithful to Jehovah,

01:04:54.953 --> 01:04:57.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will continue to grant me inner peace.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:00.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have that confidence as well.

01:05:00.834 --> 01:05:02.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Sister Herd.

01:05:02.836 --> 01:05:07.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
We deeply appreciate your comments
and your encouraging expressions.

01:05:10.427 --> 01:05:13.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s now address our final point.

01:05:13.555 --> 01:05:17.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do to continue walking

01:05:17.142 --> 01:05:19.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s way of peace?

01:05:19.603 --> 01:05:22.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back
to our illustration of the road.

01:05:22.606 --> 01:05:26.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a literal road,
travelers may need to make adjustments

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
in response to changing road conditions

01:05:29.863 --> 01:05:31.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
or bad weather.

01:05:31.907 --> 01:05:36.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, as you go on walking
in the way of peace,

01:05:36.411 --> 01:05:41.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will need to readjust your actions
and thinking from time to time.

01:05:42.793 --> 01:05:45.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, a circuit overseer
shared an interesting point

01:05:45.587 --> 01:05:49.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding our thoughts
and attitudes on matters.

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:51.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that they could either serve

01:05:51.092 --> 01:05:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a prison or a passport:

01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:59.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
a prison, in that our thoughts and actions

01:05:59.226 --> 01:06:03.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
can confine or restrict us

01:06:03.063 --> 01:06:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a passport,

01:06:05.607 --> 01:06:09.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that they can take us where we need to be.

01:06:10.779 --> 01:06:13.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, right now, we need to be

01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:17.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay on this road to life.

01:06:17.369 --> 01:06:22.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to make sure
that any needed adjustments are made

01:06:22.123 --> 01:06:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our thoughts and our actions

01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’re not confined or restricted

01:06:28.171 --> 01:06:30.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making spiritual progress.

01:06:31.883 --> 01:06:34.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what might be some areas

01:06:34.177 --> 01:06:37.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll need to make adjustments?

01:06:37.097 --> 01:06:41.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, please, Paul’s words
in 2 Corinthians chapter 13.

01:06:44.187 --> 01:06:49.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll read 2 Corinthians 13:11.

01:06:55.866 --> 01:06:58.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says: “Finally, brothers,

01:06:58.243 --> 01:07:02.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“continue to rejoice, to be readjusted,

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:05.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be comforted, to think in agreement,

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:08.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to live peaceably;

01:07:08.128 --> 01:07:12.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the God of love
and of peace will be with you.”

01:07:14.092 --> 01:07:16.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice three areas in this verse

01:07:16.803 --> 01:07:19.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Paul states we can make adjustments?

01:07:19.973 --> 01:07:24.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he says: “Continue to rejoice.”

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can lose our peace and joy

01:07:27.814 --> 01:07:32.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become overwhelmed
by the anxieties of life.

01:07:32.736 --> 01:07:35.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in order to rejoice,

01:07:35.906 --> 01:07:38.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you make it a goal to focus on things

01:07:38.533 --> 01:07:42.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
that bring joy rather than sadness?

01:07:42.078 --> 01:07:47.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’re not feeling well
or coping with chronic pain,

01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can focus on God’s promise
of when no one will say:

01:07:51.254 --> 01:07:53.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am sick.”

01:07:54.424 --> 01:07:58.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re facing opposition for your beliefs,

01:07:58.345 --> 01:08:02.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
focus on the fact
that we’re part of a brotherhood

01:08:02.182 --> 01:08:05.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a brotherhood that supports
and prays for us—

01:08:05.727 --> 01:08:09.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and arrangements are in place
to keep us spiritually strong.

01:08:11.399 --> 01:08:13.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re discouraged by world events,

01:08:13.818 --> 01:08:15.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can rejoice in the fact

01:08:15.946 --> 01:08:20.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have a hope for the future,

01:08:20.033 --> 01:08:22.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know how this all ends.

01:08:22.702 --> 01:08:26.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that better times are ahead.

01:08:26.831 --> 01:08:30.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is, Don’t let negative thoughts

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:34.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
restrict or limit your progress.

01:08:34.297 --> 01:08:37.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, make the needed adjustments

01:08:37.467 --> 01:08:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can move forward
and continue to rejoice.

01:08:43.431 --> 01:08:47.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note another area for readjustment
that Paul mentions in verse 11.

01:08:47.602 --> 01:08:49.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
There he says: “Continue . . .

01:08:49.771 --> 01:08:52.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think in agreement.”

01:08:53.984 --> 01:08:55.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were members of the congregation

01:08:55.986 --> 01:09:00.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
back in the first century
that were promoting apostate ideas.

01:09:00.949 --> 01:09:04.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others were introducing controversial ideas

01:09:04.035 --> 01:09:06.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were not directly unscriptural,

01:09:06.955 --> 01:09:09.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they were divisive.

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:13.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
This resulted in bickering
and arguments over words,

01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:17.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
really creating
a spiritually unhealthy atmosphere.

01:09:18.383 --> 01:09:20.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s going to help us

01:09:20.385 --> 01:09:24.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to think in agreement?

01:09:24.347 --> 01:09:28.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Paul’s words at 2 Timothy 2:23

01:09:28.727 --> 01:09:32.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “reject foolish and ignorant debates,

01:09:32.397 --> 01:09:36.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that they produce fights.”

01:09:36.943 --> 01:09:40.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we react strongly
when facing issues

01:09:40.155 --> 01:09:43.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
that clearly violate Jehovah’s moral laws.

01:09:43.408 --> 01:09:48.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if no Scriptural principle
is being violated,

01:09:48.288 --> 01:09:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re wise to abstain
from promoting our personal opinions.

01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:56.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to do all we can to avoid starting

01:09:56.921 --> 01:10:00.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
or being drawn into disagreements

01:10:00.175 --> 01:10:03.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can disrupt the peace
of the congregation.

01:10:05.388 --> 01:10:07.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, back in verse 11,

01:10:07.724 --> 01:10:10.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
a third area where we can make adjustments

01:10:10.518 --> 01:10:14.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to continue “to live peaceably.”

01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:19.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
from the interview with our sisters

01:10:19.694 --> 01:10:22.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they both did when challenged,

01:10:22.822 --> 01:10:27.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
when faced with a challenge
that threatened their peace?

01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:30.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took the matter to Jehovah in prayer.

01:10:30.622 --> 01:10:34.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reflected on scriptures
found in God’s Word.

01:10:34.334 --> 01:10:37.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they looked to see
how they could apply those verses

01:10:37.545 --> 01:10:40.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their particular situation.

01:10:40.507 --> 01:10:44.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped them to not only have inner peace

01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:47.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
but peace with others as well.

01:10:47.889 --> 01:10:52.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let your spiritual qualities
shine through.

01:10:52.435 --> 01:10:54.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to work on keeping peace,

01:10:54.979 --> 01:10:59.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing those qualities
of being loving and generous toward all,

01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:03.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially with our close family members,

01:11:03.029 --> 01:11:05.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether they are Witnesses or not.

01:11:07.826 --> 01:11:11.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to conclude
by reminding you baptism candidates

01:11:11.704 --> 01:11:14.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
that today marks a significant milestone

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:19.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your journey
in your relationship with Jehovah.

01:11:19.337 --> 01:11:22.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take the time to appreciate

01:11:22.674 --> 01:11:25.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
what this day means for you.

01:11:25.969 --> 01:11:29.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of all of you.

01:11:29.097 --> 01:11:33.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never regret
the decision you have made

01:11:33.143 --> 01:11:35.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

01:11:36.771 --> 01:11:41.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
But keep in mind that after today and beyond,

01:11:41.693 --> 01:11:44.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
the journey is not yet over.

01:11:44.279 --> 01:11:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, it’s just the beginning.

01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:50.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we encourage you
to do all you can

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay on the road to life.

01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:55.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind the points we considered today.

01:11:55.957 --> 01:12:00.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, do not give up
on walking in Jehovah’s way of peace.

01:12:00.962 --> 01:12:03.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your life depends on it.

01:12:03.464 --> 01:12:06.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Allow Jehovah to guide your steps.

01:12:07.385 --> 01:12:12.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, stay within the boundaries
on the road to life.

01:12:12.307 --> 01:12:15.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, you’re walking with a purpose,

01:12:15.351 --> 01:12:19.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will lead you to your destination

01:12:19.063 --> 01:12:22.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peaceful friendship with Jehovah forever.

01:12:23.735 --> 01:12:27.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, keep making
any needed adjustments

01:12:27.947 --> 01:12:31.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your thoughts, attitude, and actions

01:12:31.242 --> 01:12:36.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can maintain peace
with Jehovah and peace with others.

01:12:36.247 --> 01:12:38.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you continue to do these things,

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:41.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only will you have peace

01:12:41.628 --> 01:12:46.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as the last part
of 2 Corinthians 13:11 says:

01:12:46.049 --> 01:12:49.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The God of love and of peace

01:12:49.302 --> 01:12:51.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be with you.”

01:12:51.638 --> 01:12:54.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you always remember that promise,

01:12:54.599 --> 01:12:56.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
which Jehovah makes to those

01:12:56.935 --> 01:13:00.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
who go on walking in the way of peace.

01:13:02.106 --> 01:13:04.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Turner.

01:13:05.485 --> 01:13:07.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similar to last year,

01:13:07.487 --> 01:13:11.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
the arrangements for baptism
will vary in each location.

01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:15.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each local congregation’s elders
have made suitable provisions

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
in accord with local circumstances

01:13:17.997 --> 01:13:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
for candidates to be baptized
after the conclusion of this session.

01:13:25.004 --> 01:13:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank Jehovah
for the timely spiritual food we enjoyed

01:13:28.716 --> 01:13:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this session of the convention.

01:13:31.427 --> 01:13:33.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next session will show us how to avoid

01:13:33.846 --> 01:13:36.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
common pitfalls to pursuing peace.

01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:39.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will highlight specific activities

01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:41.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
that peacemakers excel at.

01:13:41.938 --> 01:13:46.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will also enjoy part one
of the feature Bible drama.

01:13:49.529 --> 01:13:54.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s sing together
the closing song for this session,

01:13:54.117 --> 01:13:58.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
song number 54, “‘This Is the Way.’”

01:13:58.538 --> 01:14:02.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the song, you may have
your own concluding prayer.

01:14:02.417 --> 01:14:04.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s song number 54.

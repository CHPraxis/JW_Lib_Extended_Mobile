Foretelling dominant traits
that would exist in the last days,

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Timothy chapter 3 says
that “men will be lovers of themselves.”

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:14.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it wrong for us to love ourselves?

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it’s normal, even necessary,
to have a healthy love of oneself.

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, Jesus said:

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love your neighbor as yourself.”

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:30.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll talk more about that in a minute.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the love mentioned here

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
is distorted and selfish.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because it prevents love of neighbor,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes a barrier to peace.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:47.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some Bible scholars suggest that Paul
put love of self at the top of his list

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:1-5

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:54.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all the remaining
negative characteristics in the list

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
result from it.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those traits too are a barrier to peace.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
“not [being] open to any agreement”

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at 2 Timothy 3:3,

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
often leads to “anger, wrath,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
screaming, and abusive speech.”

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:15.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than bringing peace,

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
such a lack of self-control
“stirs up strife.”

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, love of neighbor

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the opposite effect.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
It leads to genuine peace.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Matthew chapter 22,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 36.

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the Pharisees versed in the Law

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
tests Jesus:

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Teacher,

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the greatest commandment
in the Law?”

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus responded with the words in verse 37

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
just considered at length
in the preceding talk:

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:03.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God.”

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, Jesus goes
beyond the original question

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:08.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and quotes a second commandment.

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:11.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 39:

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The second, like it, is this:

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:18.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’”

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is saying that the two commandments

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love of God and love of neighbor—

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
are linked.

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how exactly would you define “neighbor”?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Luke chapter 10.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Jesus answered this very question:

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who really is my neighbor?”

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus responds clearly
with his renowned illustration

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the neighborly Samaritan.

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ day, the Jews disdained Samaritans.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:57.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their attitude moved Jesus
to make a powerful point.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his illustration,
Jesus said that the Samaritan

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
took extraordinary measures
to help a Jewish man.

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jew had fallen victim to robbers,

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his own countrymen ignored him

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:13.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
—leaving him half-dead.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Jesus said
must have stunned the audience.

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 10:33, 34 reads:

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But a certain Samaritan

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“traveling the road came upon him,

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:33.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he approached him
and bandaged his wounds,

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:39.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pouring oil and wine on them.

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he mounted him on his own animal
and brought him to an inn

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took care of him.”

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus then asked a penetrating question
in verse 36:

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who of these three

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to you
to have made himself neighbor?”

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:01.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words recorded in verse 37

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
are also directed to you and to me:

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:09.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go and do the same yourself.”

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our neighbors include

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only our family members
and our Christian brothers and sisters

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all whom we encounter from day to day.

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, our love

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
extends to those who are not of our own race,

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
tribe, nationality, or religion.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we show that love?

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn with me to Romans chapter 13.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we love our neighbor,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
we avoid conduct that disrupts peace.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we strive to apply
the inspired counsel

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:56.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 13:8-10:

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:02.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not owe anything to anyone
except to love one another;

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for whoever loves his fellow man
has fulfilled the law.

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the law code,
‘You must not commit adultery,

00:05:09.663 --> 00:05:12.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you must not murder,
you must not steal, you must not covet,’

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:16.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and whatever other commandment there is,

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:18.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is summed up in this saying:

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:26.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor;

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:30.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
therefore, love is the law’s fulfillment.”

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:34.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that our responsibility
is to treat others

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:37.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways that promote peace.

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
When others treat us unkindly,

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:42.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
we endeavor to imitate Jesus.

00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:47.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was being insulted,
he did not return the insult.

00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:50.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was suffering,
he didn’t go threatening.

00:05:50.662 --> 00:05:54.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitating the Prince of Peace
and the God of peace

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us inner peace.

00:05:58.754 --> 00:06:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:03.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a family benefits
from the apostle Paul’s example

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
of displaying love of neighbor,

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:08.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when provoked.

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:10.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to do?

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:11.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:12.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man, all you do
is stand next to your little cart.

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:13.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t do anything.

00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:14.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:15.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just stand next to your little cart.

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:16.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ain’t no neutral.

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stand up for your rights.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:17.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:19.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe,

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened today?

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:27.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just that I’ve been yelled at
in service before, but

00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:32.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time I wanted to—I don’t know.

00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:37.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to go up to the girls
and smash their phones.

00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:40.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so glad that you didn’t.

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:43.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel guilty

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was like—I was like so angry.

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:56.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:00.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep reading.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had left off in verse 26.

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:11.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Suddenly a great earthquake occurred,

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:14.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the foundations of the jail
were shaken.

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:18.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, all the doors
were instantly opened,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and everyone’s bonds came loose.

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:25.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the jailer woke up
and saw that the prison doors were open,

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:27.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he drew his sword

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:29.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and was about to kill himself,

00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:33.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“assuming that the prisoners had escaped.

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:35.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But Paul called out with a loud voice:

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:38.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not hurt yourself, for we are all here!’

00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:41.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he asked for lights and rushed in,

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and seized with trembling,

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:47.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fell down before Paul and Silas.”

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:54.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about what the jailer
had done to Paul.

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:02.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have hated him for it.

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:03.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he could have.

00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:10.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess he saw the jailer’s pain
instead of just his own.

00:08:15.557 --> 00:08:17.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, Paul loved his neighbor.

00:08:17.684 --> 00:08:20.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t hold back
from trying to save his life.

00:08:32.074 --> 00:08:32.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, man.

00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, how do you have the nerve
to keep coming out here?

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, you were right

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:47.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what you said.

00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:51.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one should stand around
while other people suffer injustice.

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:53.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
So do something. Fight like we do.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my way of making a difference

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the only way that I know
the world can really change.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, man, the Bible?

00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:05.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, I get what you’re thinking,
but let me show you just one scripture.

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:08.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, one scripture.

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:10.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is a verse in the Bible
that convinced me

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:12.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how I can make a difference.

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:16.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at Matthew 24:14.

00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here it says:

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom
will be preached

00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:23.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all the inhabited earth

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

00:09:25.627 --> 00:09:28.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the end will come.”

00:09:32.717 --> 00:09:36.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the dramatization, Paul could have reacted

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:39.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a negative way toward the jailer.

00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:42.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, in spite of the way
he had been treated,

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:45.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
he displayed neighborly love.

00:09:45.814 --> 00:09:48.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this had a powerful effect on the jailer

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brought praise to Jehovah.

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we are imperfect,

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must work hard
at cultivating love for our neighbor.

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:04.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is illustrated in what happened
with the apostle Peter.

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:08.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to becoming a follower of Jesus,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did not have fellowship
with non-Jewish people.

00:10:12.048 --> 00:10:14.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after he became a Christian,

00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:16.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
God taught him

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
that division between Jews and Gentiles

00:10:20.056 --> 00:10:22.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not to continue,

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:24.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Peter got the point.

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:28.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 10:34, 35,

00:10:28.148 --> 00:10:30.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter is quoted as saying:

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:35.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I truly understand
that God is not partial,

00:10:35.322 --> 00:10:40.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in every nation the man who fears him
and does what is right

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:43.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
is acceptable to him.”

00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:48.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter even stayed in the newly converted
Gentiles’ home for days.

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he continued the practice of eating

00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:54.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
with non-Jewish Christians.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:57.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, 13 years later

00:10:57.761 --> 00:11:00.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
while in Syrian Antioch,

00:11:00.263 --> 00:11:04.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter suddenly stopped associating
with Gentile Christians.

00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:05.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:11:05.936 --> 00:11:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
He feared the reaction
of some Jewish Christians

00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:11.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were slow to accept change.

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:15.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
This illustrates that prejudice
can be deeply rooted.

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes constant effort
to rid ourselves of it.

00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:23.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we must learn to view others impartially

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:25.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah does.

00:11:25.622 --> 00:11:28.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to treat others
as Jehovah treats them.

00:11:29.834 --> 00:11:33.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said:

00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:36.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You heard that it was said:

00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:40.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must love your neighbor
and hate your enemy.’

00:11:40.262 --> 00:11:43.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, I say to you:

00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:46.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue to love your enemies

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:49.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to pray for those who persecute you.”

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, as recorded at Matthew chapter 5,

00:11:53.817 --> 00:11:56.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 45,

00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
he explains why we want to show
that type of love:

00:12:01.324 --> 00:12:05.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that you may prove yourselves
sons of your Father who is in the heavens,

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:09.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“since he makes his sun rise
on both the wicked and the good

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:12.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and makes it rain on both the righteous

00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:15.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the unrighteous.”

00:12:15.338 --> 00:12:18.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
This love produced by holy spirit

00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:23.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
is markedly different from the sort of love
that is common in the world.

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:26.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s based on a higher principle.

00:12:26.516 --> 00:12:31.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said even sinners
will follow a policy of like for like.

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:37.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we want to prove ourselves
sons of our “Father who is in the heavens,”

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:39.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be different.

00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:42.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
We welcome others

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:45.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
as God and Christ have welcomed us.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Romans 15:7, the Bible says to us:

00:12:49.831 --> 00:12:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Welcome one another,

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Christ also welcomed you.”

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word used there conveys the idea

00:12:58.798 --> 00:13:01.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
of receiving someone kindly or hospitably

00:13:01.843 --> 00:13:05.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
—such as into one’s home
or circle of friends.

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:10.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prejudice withers as love grows.

00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:13.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that at one time,

00:13:13.938 --> 00:13:18.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were all strangers, or foreigners,
not close to God.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah drew us to him

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:25.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
with “cords of love.”

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:28.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ welcomed us.

00:13:28.578 --> 00:13:33.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
He opened the door, as it were,
so that we could become part of God’s family.

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:37.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jesus has kindly accepted us

00:13:37.754 --> 00:13:40.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
as imperfect as we are,

00:13:40.256 --> 00:13:45.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
it should be unthinkable for us
to reject anyone else.

00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:46.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:51.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
divisions, prejudice, and hostility
will doubtless increase in the world

00:13:51.976 --> 00:13:55.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we approach the end of this wicked system.

00:13:55.814 --> 00:13:58.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
As servants of Jehovah, though,

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
we seek “the wisdom from above,”
which is impartial

00:14:02.862 --> 00:14:05.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
and promotes peace.

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:07.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice

00:14:07.492 --> 00:14:10.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we forge friendships
with people from other lands,

00:14:10.995 --> 00:14:12.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
accept cultural differences,

00:14:12.997 --> 00:14:16.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
and possibly even learn
the languages of others.

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:18.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do this,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace flows “just like a river”

00:14:22.298 --> 00:14:26.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
and justice “like the waves of the sea.”

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:29.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
We “work what is good toward all,

00:14:29.597 --> 00:14:32.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially [our brothers].”

00:14:32.517 --> 00:14:36.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love of neighbor moves us
to make sacrifices in behalf of others

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:39.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to share the good news
at every opportunity.

00:14:41.109 --> 00:14:45.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Master, Jesus, said:

00:14:45.739 --> 00:14:48.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my commandment,

00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:52.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you love one another
just as I have loved you.”

00:14:54.372 --> 00:14:58.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are the blessings
that come from love of neighbor?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus answers that

00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:04.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John chapter 15,

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verses 8 through 10,

00:15:10.472 --> 00:15:12.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning with verse 8.

00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:15.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:20.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My father is glorified in this,

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you keep bearing much fruit

00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:26.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prove yourselves my disciples.”

00:15:27.197 --> 00:15:31.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second blessing, verse 9:

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:35.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as the Father has loved me,
so I have loved you;

00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:38.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remain in my love.

00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you observe my commandments,

00:15:41.377 --> 00:15:44.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will remain in my love,

00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:47.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as I have observed
the commandments of the Father

00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:50.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain in his love.”

00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:55.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:58.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the final talk
of this symposium,

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:03.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Love Leads to Genuine Peace
—Love for God’s Word.”

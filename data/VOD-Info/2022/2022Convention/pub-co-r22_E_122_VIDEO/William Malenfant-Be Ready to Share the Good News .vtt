00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basic Bible teachings are wonderful.

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually,
it’s the fundamental doctrines of the Bible

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
—basic teachings—
that draw people to the truth.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, learning basic Bible teachings

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just the beginning
of knowledge about Jehovah.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Hebrews 6:1,

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul exhorts
all students of God’s Word

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
to progress beyond basic teachings.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what is stated at Hebrews 6:1:

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, now that we have moved beyond

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the primary doctrine about the Christ,

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:48.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us press on to maturity.”

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that what we want to achieve
with our Bible students,

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them move beyond the primary doctrine

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:59.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and progress to Christian maturity?

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
It comes about in degrees

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
as students acquire
an increased level of knowledge

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciation for the truth.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:13.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible students must learn to love God

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:17.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his standards and appreciate

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of his ways and requirements

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
are expressions of his love for us.

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:26.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Bible students experience the good

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from obeying Jehovah

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
and following his ways,

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
their love for him will deepen.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
please note how a sister helps her student

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:44.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make progress toward maturity.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:50.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mrs. Iwata was doing great.

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were already on Lesson 10.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really hoped she’d come to a meeting soon.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about Hebrews 10:24, 25

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and watched the video.

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:15.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I miss something?

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess I did.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was too focused
on our progress with the lessons

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of her progress and what she needed.

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mr. Iwata said going to meetings
would dishonor the family.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:43.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted her to quit the study.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:47.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
She didn’t want to quit,

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
but whenever she tried to talk about it,
they argued.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
We showed her where to look for help

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made time during our studies

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:58.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk about it more.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we all prayed for Jehovah

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:25.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bless her efforts.

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did our best
to share the good news of peace,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah did the rest.

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we saw, the student took an important step

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward Christian maturity

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:57.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she began to attend meetings.

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:00.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you study with your student

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:05.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
lessons 7 to 11
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book,

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:07.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
please be sure to highlight

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:11.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s appealing qualities

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are set forth in those lessons.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:18.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, lesson 7
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> book

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes Jehovah’s loving ways.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to help our students to understand

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
really does love them as individuals

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:35.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wants them to achieve everlasting life.

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle John highlights Jehovah’s love

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 John 4:9

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
by pointing out
that Jehovah sent Jesus to earth

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take our place in death

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus pay for our inherited sins

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our personal sins.

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, out of love,

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided a way for us

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy an approved standing with him.

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:04.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is one of Jehovah’s loving ways.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 8 shows us
how to become Jehovah’s friend.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is likely something that most people
have never even thought of.

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:16.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine the privilege

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:19.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
of becoming God’s friend?

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your students to see how their obedience

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:26.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and exclusive devotion to Jehovah

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
pave the way to friendship with him.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:34.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5, 6

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us specifically

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah wants us to do.

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:44.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5, 6 says:

00:05:46.158 --> 00:05:48.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:51.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with all your heart,

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not rely on your own understanding.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In all your ways take notice of him,

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:02.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will make your paths straight.”

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:06.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
We show our trust in Jehovah

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:09.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
by doing what he tells us to do

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:13.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby become his friends.

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:16.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah takes good care of his friends,

00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:19.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is always loyal to them.

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:25.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 9 highlights the power of prayer.

00:06:25.697 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teach your Bible students

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:31.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to pray to Jehovah.

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:33.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to prayer,

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:36.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
regular Bible reading is also necessary

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make spiritual progress.

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:42.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm, the first Psalm,

00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:47.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 2 and 3, encourages Bible reading.

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:48.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look it up together.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Psalm, the first Psalm,

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:56.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 2 and 3.

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:59.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s speaking about a man of God

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:01.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
who takes delight in God’s Word.

00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:04.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “But his delight

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is in the law of Jehovah,

00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:09.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[well, the law of Jehovah
is found in the Bible,

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:11.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it says,] and he reads His law

00:07:11.827 --> 00:07:15.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in an undertone day and night.

00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:19.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will be like a tree planted
by streams of water,

00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:22.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a tree that produces fruit in its season,

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:25.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the foliage of which does not wither.

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:28.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
And everything he does will succeed.”

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, “everything he does” as a Christian,

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:34.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading a Christian life, “will succeed.”

00:07:35.684 --> 00:07:37.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading God’s Word

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:41.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then putting it into practice
brings Jehovah’s blessing.

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:44.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you have a student

00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:47.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
who feels limited in his learning ability,

00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:50.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps because of a lack of education,

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:55.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
please encourage him
to go to Jehovah in prayer

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:58.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persist in asking him

00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:01.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
for help to understand his Word.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:5

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:08.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
assures us that Jehovah is ready and willing

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help those
who ‘keep on asking’ him for help.

00:08:13.597 --> 00:08:16.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 10 gives this direction:

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as possible,

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
invite Bible students
to attend congregation meetings.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
What your student hears and observes
at Christian meetings

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
can touch his heart
and will help him to progress.

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you show your student the video

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:37.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?,</i>

00:08:37.913 --> 00:08:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be a good time
to warmly invite him

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend meetings.

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:48.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, be sure to invite
a variety of publishers

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:51.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accompany you on the study.

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:53.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, your student will get acquainted

00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:55.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
with others in the congregation,

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:59.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will likely feel more at home
when he attends our meetings.

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:04.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 11: In this lesson,

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:07.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are encouraged to teach our students

00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:09.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to do personal study

00:09:09.903 --> 00:09:14.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
using jw.org and <i>JW Library</i>®.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:18.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show your student how to use these tools.

00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:22.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you feel a bit unsure
about teaching someone 

00:09:22.082 --> 00:09:26.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make use
of their electronic device for research,

00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:30.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t hesitate to ask
for help from the congregation.

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:34.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many
who would be delighted to assist you.

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:41.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings that we receive
when we teach someone the truth

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:43.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
is described by the apostle John

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 3 John 4, where it states:

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:50.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No greater joy do I have than this:

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:53.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should hear that my children

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
go on walking in the truth.”

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, John is speaking
of his spiritual children.

00:10:01.288 --> 00:10:05.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
That same joy can be ours.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has this symposium
brought to our attention?

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:12.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has helped us to see how we can maintain

00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:15.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
our zeal for the preaching work.

00:10:15.177 --> 00:10:18.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has instructed us to prepare well

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:21.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the truth with others.

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:24.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
It showed us how to take the initiative

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give an informal witness,

00:10:26.688 --> 00:10:31.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
to follow up on interest,
and to help Bible students

00:10:31.067 --> 00:10:33.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow to maturity.

00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:37.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do the best we can in the ministry,

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether people respond or not,

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:43.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy the peace
that comes from knowing

00:10:43.788 --> 00:10:47.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are pleasing Jehovah.

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:51.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:15, 16

00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:55.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us how to bring pleasure
to Jehovah God,

00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:58.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s certainly something we want to do.

00:10:58.428 --> 00:11:03.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Hebrews 13:15, 16; it reads:

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:09.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Through him [that is, through Jesus]

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let us always offer to God
a sacrifice of praise,

00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:17.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is, the fruit of our lips

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that make public declaration to his name.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:24.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, do not forget to do good

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:26.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to share what you have with others,

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:31.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:36.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your readiness to share
“the good news of peace” with others

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just such a sacrifice.

00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:42.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can rest assured

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is thoroughly pleased

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:49.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
with your loving and faithful service to him.

00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:04.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is true peace?

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:08.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who live in lands
where they have wars,

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt the focus they have on true peace

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to stop fighting, to stop the conflicts,

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
to not have any wars.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:22.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s true that peace
does include an absence of war.

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:25.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in many cases, the efforts of mankind

00:00:25.046 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try and gain peace by stopping wars

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
is similar to what we say
is a Band-Aid solution.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:38.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, a person may have a horrible sore,

00:00:38.184 --> 00:00:40.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even cancerous.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if he just puts a Band-Aid over the top,

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:45.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe it hides the sore,

00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:49.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it really doesn’t solve the problem
—does it?—

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:54.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
because peace is not just an end of war.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know yourself, if you were to live
in a country where there isn’t any war

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:03.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’re still worried about your health,

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:06.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
your well-being, and your safety

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if you feel sick and hungry,

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:11.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you say that you’re having
a peaceful life?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:17.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Bible, the word “peace”

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:20.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
means far more than just an absence of war.

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means good health, well-being, and safety.

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:27.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from our convention, we’ve seen

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:30.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there’s a lot involved with true peace.

00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:35.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes having
a peaceful relationship with Jehovah God.

00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:39.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also means having
a peaceful relationship with others.

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also it includes

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:46.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
the peace of heart and mind
that gives us tranquility.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now in this final talk,

00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:54.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to consider a bigger issue,

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:57.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is universal peace.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what do we mean by universal peace?

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we mean by universal peace
is a type of peace

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is everywhere in heaven and on earth

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:12.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in all aspects of life.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the type of peace that only the God
of peace, Jehovah, can bring

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:21.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the “Prince of Peace,”
Jesus Christ.

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon they will take dramatic steps

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:28.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take our Bibles,
and if we turn together

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:34.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Romans 16:20,

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see what’s included

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this restoration of universal peace

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:44.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s Romans 16:20.

00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:48.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re told: “For his part,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God who gives peace will crush Satan

00:02:51.153 --> 00:02:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“under your feet shortly.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:57.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
May the undeserved kindness
of our Lord Jesus be with you.”

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:03.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the restoration of universal peace
also includes

00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:06.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
the crushing of Satan the Devil.

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:12.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in our final discussion,
the final talk of this convention,

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to consider four basic questions.

00:03:16.303 --> 00:03:18.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is,

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:21.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was universal peace disturbed?

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, Who will restore universal peace?

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third question, How will it be restored?

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally, we’re going to think
about what further blessings

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:36.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
mankind will enjoy at that time.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before we go on
to answer those questions,

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:45.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s review together
the program that we’ve had.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:49.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree that this has been
a beautiful convention.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s encouraged us to pursue peace.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:58.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are some of the good points
that you remember from the program?

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:03.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we mentioned already, there are
three aspects to peace that we’ll discuss.

00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:07.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, our peace with Jehovah God.

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Friday program finished
with the final talk,

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:15.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s where it mentions
about not being misled

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
by imitation peace.

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:22.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Sunday,
what a beautiful public discourse we had!

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said “Friendship With God—How Possible?”

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the second aspect of our peace

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace with one another.

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first day, remember,
we had that beautiful symposium

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
on family peace.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of the things
that we need to do

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:43.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have peace in our family?

00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:46.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, love and respect are important.

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:50.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to improve
our communication with one another.

00:04:50.232 --> 00:04:54.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to work as a team
and worship together.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Saturday, we had
another interesting symposium

00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:01.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what it said about peace wreckers,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
things that can wreck peace.

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:05.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember some of those?

00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:08.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inappropriate boasting,

00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:11.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
envy, dishonesty, harmful gossip,

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and uncontrolled anger.

00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:18.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the third aspect of peace

00:05:18.177 --> 00:05:20.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
deals with our personal peace,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
our inner calm despite trials.

00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:26.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Saturday, we had a very interesting talk

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:31.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
that mentioned the need
to safeguard our bond of peace.

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then on Sunday, we went through
another symposium where it gave examples

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who had sowed peace
and then reaped peace.

00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:44.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we look through the program,
I’m sure there are so many points

00:05:44.746 --> 00:05:47.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can remember that you enjoyed.

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:50.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, one of the highlights
at any convention

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:53.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when we have the baptism.

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:58.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you were baptized at this convention,
we’d like to welcome you!

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we welcome you
to the Christian brotherhood

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:06.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know that you’re working hard
to have peace with Jehovah God.

00:06:07.727 --> 00:06:11.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now at this point, let’s watch a video

00:06:11.773 --> 00:06:15.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gives us some lessons
with regard to what we saw

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the various videos in this convention.

00:06:18.572 --> 00:06:19.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy!

00:06:24.286 --> 00:06:26.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:28.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:29.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:06:29.917 --> 00:06:31.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:32.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she ever?

00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:34.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels out of your control, doesn’t it?

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:42.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when we studied
about the Shulammite girl?

00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:46.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was really in control?

00:06:46.976 --> 00:06:48.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was.

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:50.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the same power.

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you believe that,
it’ll change how you handle the pressure.

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:59.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:02.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am a wall.”

00:07:04.493 --> 00:07:05.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just a coward.

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:07.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:07:09.832 --> 00:07:11.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have hated him for it.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, he could have.

00:07:13.961 --> 00:07:17.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I guess he saw the jailer’s pain
instead of just his own.

00:07:19.675 --> 00:07:21.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you just one scripture.

00:07:21.052 --> 00:07:22.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, one scripture.

00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:25.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has taught us to love,

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:28.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s given our family

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:30.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
peace.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, everyone.

00:07:36.526 --> 00:07:38.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley from DeNure Design here.

00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:40.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:42.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe her?

00:07:46.494 --> 00:07:48.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t seen all her posts.

00:07:48.455 --> 00:07:51.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Celia agrees that Haley
is doing something she shouldn’t,

00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:53.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
you should talk to her.

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:55.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve noticed

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
your posts lately on QuicPost.

00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:59.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about them?

00:07:59.382 --> 00:08:01.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think you’re bragging.

00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:03.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who would think like that?
You?

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:05.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to upset you.
Jake said that I needed to take . . .

00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jake! So everyone thinks
my posts are inappropriate?

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:09.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:17.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time

00:08:17.317 --> 00:08:19.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you wanted forgiveness.

00:08:21.655 --> 00:08:25.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love is patient and kind.”

00:08:25.284 --> 00:08:28.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not jealous.

00:08:29.038 --> 00:08:31.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry, Haley.

00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:34.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine affection fights peace wreckers.

00:08:34.585 --> 00:08:37.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
And affection grows when we really know

00:08:37.338 --> 00:08:39.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters well.

00:08:42.176 --> 00:08:44.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always impressed

00:08:44.178 --> 00:08:46.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
with how close you two were.

00:08:47.598 --> 00:08:50.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t always that way.

00:08:52.687 --> 00:08:53.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:08:54.981 --> 00:08:58.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
What started as a small disagreement
just exploded.

00:08:58.317 --> 00:09:00.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
You!
You’re the problem.

00:09:02.238 --> 00:09:05.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:09:05.074 --> 00:09:07.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make things right with Nick.

00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a misunderstanding

00:09:09.704 --> 00:09:11.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
that got blown all out of proportion.

00:09:13.583 --> 00:09:16.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t handle it the best.

00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:20.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when our peace
was really put to the test.

00:09:21.508 --> 00:09:23.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
The body decided, unanimously,
that he should no longer serve.

00:09:23.885 --> 00:09:26.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you pushed them!

00:09:27.097 --> 00:09:30.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Phil didn’t know just how tense things were
between Tim and I.

00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:34.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort
in accounts of Jehovah’s servants.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me realize that 

00:09:37.566 --> 00:09:39.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
being at peace with my brothers

00:09:39.568 --> 00:09:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important
than any appointed position.

00:09:45.365 --> 00:09:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t easy,

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:49.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we talked it out.

00:09:49.703 --> 00:09:52.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were able to make peace
with Jehovah’s help.

00:09:52.664 --> 00:09:54.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without peace,

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how we could’ve managed
what was to come.

00:10:00.714 --> 00:10:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment when you hear the verdict

00:10:02.925 --> 00:10:04.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you’ll stay in prison,

00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:07.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s like you’ve been knocked unconscious.

00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:11.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then

00:10:11.517 --> 00:10:14.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
the doors of the elevator opened up,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in front of us . . .

00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:27.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Jehovah.

00:10:27.742 --> 00:10:30.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re just about to lose
all your strength,

00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:33.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:10:35.374 --> 00:10:38.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian brothers and sisters,
I pray for them constantly

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:43.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are going
through a very tough time.

00:10:50.848 --> 00:10:53.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I’ve learned from all of this

00:10:53.643 --> 00:10:57.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
is peace isn’t from what’s outside,

00:10:57.939 --> 00:11:01.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what’s going on,
or from what you’re experiencing.

00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:05.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned that peace is on the inside,

00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:09.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that comes from Jehovah.

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:19.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
What priceless lessons those were!

00:11:19.794 --> 00:11:23.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, at this point, friends,
we’re going to turn our attention

00:11:23.298 --> 00:11:25.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to that bigger issue

00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:28.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
—universal peace.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the first question
we’re going to answer?

00:11:32.432 --> 00:11:35.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was universal peace disturbed?

00:11:37.604 --> 00:11:40.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before mankind was created,

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:45.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
universal peace existed for countless ages.

00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:49.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just like a beautiful pond of water

00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:53.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was undisturbed
—no ripples, mirrorlike in appearance.

00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:57.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, there was
utmost harmony with Jehovah

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:00.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with all the spirit creatures.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then it’s just as if a rock was thrown

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
into that beautiful pond

00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:09.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace started to be disturbed.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
When do you think that happened?

00:12:13.641 --> 00:12:17.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll find the answer to that question
by turning to the Bible,

00:12:17.979 --> 00:12:22.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this time, if we look at 1 John 3:8

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s 1 John 3:8—

00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the answer to the question,
When did the problem start?

00:12:34.245 --> 00:12:38.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we’re told: “The one who practices sin

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:41.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“originates with the Devil,

00:12:41.002 --> 00:12:45.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the Devil has been sinning
from the beginning.

00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:49.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this purpose the Son of God
was made manifest,

00:12:49.761 --> 00:12:52.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to break up the works of the Devil.”

00:12:53.515 --> 00:12:56.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice the answer to the question.

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:59.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because the Devil has been sinning
from the beginning,”

00:12:59.688 --> 00:13:04.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
or, as the footnote says,
‘from the time that he began.’

00:13:04.192 --> 00:13:08.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean right from the very time
when he was created?

00:13:08.572 --> 00:13:11.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he wasn’t the Devil then, was he?

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:13.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a perfect angel.

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when was it

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:19.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this universal peace
started to be disturbed?

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was it that the ripples
started to go through the universe?

00:13:24.755 --> 00:13:27.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you might remember

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:30.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it wasn’t at the time
that he deceived Eve.

00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:35.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a little bit like when the Bible says
a woman gives birth to a child,

00:13:35.974 --> 00:13:38.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s not when the child’s life starts,
is it?

00:13:38.686 --> 00:13:40.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
It starts well before then.

00:13:40.688 --> 00:13:45.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
So likewise, this disruption
of the universal peace

00:13:45.484 --> 00:13:48.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
began in heaven first,

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:51.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the time that the angel who became Satan

00:13:51.407 --> 00:13:54.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to covet the position of Jehovah

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
to want worship from others.

00:13:57.163 --> 00:14:01.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by doing this,
he alienated himself from God

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:05.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no longer was he in harmony
with Jehovah’s will.

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:08.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then that sinful attitude

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:11.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
was manifested in the garden of Eden.

00:14:11.969 --> 00:14:14.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when he took the next step

00:14:14.138 --> 00:14:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started to disturb the peace
of Adam and Eve

00:14:18.434 --> 00:14:22.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course,
they lost their peace with God.

00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:24.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s take a moment and think

00:14:24.023 --> 00:14:27.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what was really involved

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those events
there in the garden of Eden.

00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:36.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some very important issues were raised.

00:14:36.077 --> 00:14:39.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember how Satan, first of all,
spoke to Eve?

00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:44.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
He asked what seemed
like a ridiculous question: ‘Is it true

00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:48.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that God hasn’t allowed you to eat
from any tree in the garden?

00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:50.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the trees are banned?’

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:53.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course, that’s ridiculous.

00:14:53.178 --> 00:14:55.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was he doing?

00:14:55.388 --> 00:15:00.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was calling into question
Jehovah’s qualities.

00:15:00.394 --> 00:15:04.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he was inferring
that Jehovah may not be so generous.

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:05.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe he’s stingy.

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:08.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps he’s holding things back
from Adam and Eve

00:15:08.944 --> 00:15:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they really should have.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Satan went one step further.

00:15:15.784 --> 00:15:20.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “You . . . will not die.”

00:15:20.789 --> 00:15:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really what he was saying is,
‘Jehovah is a liar.’

00:15:26.754 --> 00:15:29.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a horrible accusation!

00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:34.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Eve didn’t defend Jehovah.

00:15:34.094 --> 00:15:37.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would have expected
that she would have said to Satan:

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:40.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Who are you? I don’t know you.

00:15:40.267 --> 00:15:42.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why would I believe you?

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know my loving heavenly Father, Jehovah.’

00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no, she sided with the Devil.

00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:53.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what would Jehovah do?

00:15:53.447 --> 00:15:55.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think for a moment about this:

00:15:55.575 --> 00:16:00.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if someone accused you wrongly
in front of everybody,

00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:05.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
calling you a liar,
saying all sorts of bad things about you?

00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:07.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you do?

00:16:07.253 --> 00:16:10.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you go and punch them in the face?

00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:12.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you did, that wouldn’t be
the right thing to do

00:16:12.926 --> 00:16:17.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it certainly wouldn’t answer
the questions raised.

00:16:17.388 --> 00:16:22.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, was that person really true
in what they said or not?

00:16:22.352 --> 00:16:25.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you probably solve this?

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you might take the person to court.

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:31.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that court case, that person

00:16:31.444 --> 00:16:35.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
could offer whatever evidence they feel
they have to prove that you’re a liar.

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:39.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
you can produce witnesses to prove

00:16:39.703 --> 00:16:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really you aren’t a liar,
but you’re very truthful.

00:16:44.416 --> 00:16:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally, there would be
a decision made

00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:50.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to who was right and who was wrong.

00:16:50.672 --> 00:16:52.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in a similar way,

00:16:52.883 --> 00:16:56.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
these issues (these questions)
raised in the garden of Eden

00:16:56.386 --> 00:16:59.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
started a symbolic court case.

00:16:59.765 --> 00:17:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jehovah respond?

00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:05.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wisely, he allowed time

00:17:05.771 --> 00:17:08.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
to settle these issues.

00:17:08.107 --> 00:17:10.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allowed Satan the opportunity

00:17:10.943 --> 00:17:15.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try and rule mankind to do things his way.

00:17:16.574 --> 00:17:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time, mercifully,
he provided the hope

00:17:21.078 --> 00:17:24.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the unborn children of Adam and Eve.

00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:28.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember at Genesis 3:15,

00:17:28.294 --> 00:17:33.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
it speaks of an “offspring,” or a Son,
who’d come later

00:17:33.007 --> 00:17:35.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually undo the bad

00:17:35.092 --> 00:17:38.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan had done there in the beginning

00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:41.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually free mankind
from sin and death.

00:17:42.934 --> 00:17:45.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what has Satan been doing

00:17:45.061 --> 00:17:48.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
since this opportunity has been given to him?

00:17:48.189 --> 00:17:50.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s still craving worship from other people.

00:17:50.858 --> 00:17:55.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants them to bow down to him
and acknowledge him as their god.

00:17:55.655 --> 00:17:58.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also uses lies and deceit

00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:01.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘blind the minds’ of persons.

00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:06.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he also has great anger,
particularly at this time in history,

00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:08.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he knows his end is near.

00:18:08.293 --> 00:18:11.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he’s influencing the world to hate

00:18:11.212 --> 00:18:15.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
anyone who stands up on Jehovah’s side.

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:20.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s think
about a very interesting question:

00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:22.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we’re living

00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:25.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a world that is ruled by Satan,

00:18:25.894 --> 00:18:28.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
is it possible at all

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to have a measure of peace with God?

00:18:31.942 --> 00:18:35.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re experiencing
so many trials and challenges.

00:18:35.404 --> 00:18:36.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
We face opposition.

00:18:36.947 --> 00:18:41.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have illness, economic problems,
disasters.

00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:45.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it possible to have some measure of peace?

00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:48.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is found again in the Scriptures,

00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:50.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this time, if you turn with me, please,

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:55.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 1

00:18:55.591 --> 00:19:00.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Second Corinthians 1:3, 4—

00:19:02.098 --> 00:19:04.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice this beautiful promise:

00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:10.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Praised be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:10.398 --> 00:19:13.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Father of tender mercies

00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:16.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the God of all comfort,

00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:20.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials

00:19:20.032 --> 00:19:24.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may be able to comfort others
in any sort of trial

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:28.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the comfort that we receive from God.”

00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:31.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful scripture?

00:19:31.252 --> 00:19:33.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it highlight?

00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:37.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, Jehovah obviously is aware
of our suffering.

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:41.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
He feels for us.
He wants to help us.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentions he’s
“the Father of tender mercies.”

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the same time, we realize

00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:52.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah won’t step in
and fix all our problems at this point.

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:53.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:55.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because this is the time that Satan

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:59.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the opportunity
to try and rule the world,

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the problems of this world
really come from Satan.

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:08.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,
we wouldn’t expect Jehovah to step in

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start to solve the problems
as if he were helping Satan the Devil.

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:18.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is a time
when Satan will be taken away

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:21.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the problems will be solved.

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:25.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could think of Jehovah’s position
as similar to that of a father

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose son is running in a marathon race.

00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:33.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he sees his son running in the race,

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:36.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
he may see his son is starting to tire out.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:40.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps he may see that others
in the race are not obeying the rules.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:44.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean that the father then jumps in
and takes the place of his son

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:47.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helps him as he runs along?

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:49.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the rules don’t allow it.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:53.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what the father can do
is continue to encourage his son:

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:57.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on going.
Yes, you can do it!”

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:01.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in a similar way,
what does this verse tell us?

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:05.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said that Jehovah gives us comfort.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do that?

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:11.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives us peace
by means of his Word, the Bible;

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:13.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of holy spirit;

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by the loving brotherhood that we have.

00:21:18.069 --> 00:21:23.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this point, what we’d like to do
is have a look at a video that will highlight

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:27.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah lovingly helps us
even in times of need.

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are living

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:37.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
in “critical times

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
hard to deal with.”

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:44.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people have lost all hope,

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and servants of Jehovah

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not free from trials.

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may face loss of property,

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of health,

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:02.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
loss of loved ones.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience deep emotional trauma

00:22:10.456 --> 00:22:14.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even imprisonment for our faith.

00:22:17.963 --> 00:22:22.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our trials are similar to those of Job,

00:22:22.468 --> 00:22:24.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:28.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was so saddened that he once asked,

00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:32.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why didn’t I die at birth?’

00:22:33.646 --> 00:22:37.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we’ve had moments like that.

00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:40.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why should we not lose hope?

00:22:43.447 --> 00:22:48.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because with every trial
comes Jehovah’s support

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:52.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
—support received in many forms:

00:22:53.541 --> 00:22:55.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
material support,

00:23:10.517 --> 00:23:12.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotional support,

00:23:28.827 --> 00:23:31.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual support.

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:44.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while Jehovah

00:23:44.551 --> 00:23:47.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not remove all our trials now,

00:23:47.971 --> 00:23:50.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust that with his support,

00:23:50.682 --> 00:23:53.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can endure them

00:23:55.562 --> 00:23:59.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they disappear
in “the real life” to come.

00:23:59.984 --> 00:24:03.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 34:17, 18 says:

00:24:03.988 --> 00:24:07.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They cried out, and Jehovah heard . . .

00:24:07.658 --> 00:24:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:19.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can see that even though
our peace has been disturbed,

00:24:19.086 --> 00:24:22.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can enjoy peace with God.

00:24:22.757 --> 00:24:26.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about our second question.

00:24:26.052 --> 00:24:28.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, that question was,

00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:32.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who will restore universal peace?

00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:34.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we already saw the answer

00:24:34.102 --> 00:24:37.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we referred to Genesis 3:15,

00:24:37.689 --> 00:24:39.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first prophecy in the Bible.

00:24:39.857 --> 00:24:43.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
It mentioned the promised offspring, or Son,

00:24:43.111 --> 00:24:47.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that one is Jesus Christ
—the Prince of Peace.

00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:49.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has the key role

00:24:49.158 --> 00:24:52.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
in restoring universal peace.

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:54.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very soon,

00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:58.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s going to take the decisive action
to remove this old world

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take progressive steps

00:25:01.755 --> 00:25:05.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:09.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why can we be so sure

00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:12.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will come soon?

00:25:12.265 --> 00:25:14.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a very simple answer

00:25:14.351 --> 00:25:19.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
—by seeing the current events
that are happening in the world today.

00:25:19.231 --> 00:25:21.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as we look around us,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see so many things that are happening

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:26.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
that proves to us

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus will soon step in to help us.

00:25:30.784 --> 00:25:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can we say that?

00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:34.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s have a look together

00:25:34.955 --> 00:25:39.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the famous prophecy
that’s recorded in Matthew chapter 24

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 24:3.

00:25:45.841 --> 00:25:49.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the apostles
at this particular time

00:25:49.762 --> 00:25:53.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
were asking Jesus a very important question.

00:25:53.557 --> 00:25:57.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s at the second part of verse 3.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says they asked: “Tell us,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when will these things be,

00:26:03.609 --> 00:26:06.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what will be the sign of your presence

00:26:06.445 --> 00:26:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of the conclusion
of the system of things?”

00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:15.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you remember, no doubt
from your previous studies of the Bible,

00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:19.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jesus then went on to list
many events that would occur

00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:21.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the last days.

00:26:21.335 --> 00:26:23.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
He mentioned wars;

00:26:23.338 --> 00:26:26.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
he mentioned earthquakes;
he mentioned famines

00:26:26.758 --> 00:26:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all sorts of pestilences.

00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly we have seen those things happen
in recent times.

00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:38.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to all of that, Matthew 24:14

00:26:38.812 --> 00:26:42.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned the need to preach
the “good news of the Kingdom.”

00:26:43.566 --> 00:26:48.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there could be some who
perhaps may doubt a little

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:52.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say: ‘Well, there’s been wars
all through time.

00:26:52.325 --> 00:26:56.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There’s been earthquakes at other times,
not just in the last days,

00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:58.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and food shortages.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So why can we be so sure

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that this is the time

00:27:04.254 --> 00:27:07.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when we know that Jesus
will soon bring about

00:27:07.924 --> 00:27:10.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
an end to wickedness?’

00:27:10.552 --> 00:27:13.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s use an illustration.

00:27:13.305 --> 00:27:17.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us are familiar
with using a computer.

00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:20.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you sit at your computer,

00:27:20.104 --> 00:27:24.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s the first thing that you need to do
after you’ve turned it on?

00:27:24.692 --> 00:27:28.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually, you have to type in a password,
don’t you?

00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:30.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you have to get it right.

00:27:30.489 --> 00:27:34.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to put in all those numbers
and letters that are required.

00:27:34.869 --> 00:27:39.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you won’t be able
to start working on the computer.

00:27:39.832 --> 00:27:43.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these days people are very concerned

00:27:43.252 --> 00:27:45.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
about having strong passwords.

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:49.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think if you had a password

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:53.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had 24 different letters and numbers?

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a very strong password,

00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:59.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it would be very difficult for someone

00:27:59.227 --> 00:28:03.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just randomly try and find out
what those numbers are

00:28:03.272 --> 00:28:06.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unlock your computer.

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:09.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does that relate
to the sign that Jesus gave?

00:28:09.862 --> 00:28:14.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that if you look back at Matthew 24:3,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
the question was not
the “signs” of your presence

00:28:18.872 --> 00:28:20.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the “sign.”

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like a password—one sign.

00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:28.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then that sign
has many different features

00:28:28.214 --> 00:28:32.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in fact, at least 24 different features.

00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:37.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though there have been wars
in the past,

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:39.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the time when we see

00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:43.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those features
coming together at one time.

00:28:43.271 --> 00:28:46.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that way, we could say
it opens the fulfillment

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Bible prophecy.

00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:53.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as we look around us,
as we listen to the news each day,

00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:57.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see
that there is a definite fulfillment

00:28:57.244 --> 00:28:59.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what Jesus said.

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:02.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, the end is close.

00:29:02.332 --> 00:29:06.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just like a jigsaw puzzle,
to use another illustration.

00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:08.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you have all the pieces
of a jigsaw puzzle

00:29:08.922 --> 00:29:11.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you start to put them all together,

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
eventually when all the pieces are in place,

00:29:14.303 --> 00:29:16.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the picture is clear, isn’t it?

00:29:16.472 --> 00:29:20.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly how we should feel

00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:23.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the prophecy that Jesus gave.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, very soon,
he is going to step in and take action.

00:29:29.527 --> 00:29:32.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, sometimes we may feel,

00:29:32.405 --> 00:29:36.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yes, we’ve known about this
for quite some time.’

00:29:36.117 --> 00:29:41.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it means that we’ve had to wait
a long time.

00:29:41.122 --> 00:29:43.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that doesn’t negate the fact

00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:47.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the evidence of the last days is here.

00:29:47.253 --> 00:29:50.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could illustrate it this way:

00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:52.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us have gone to an airport

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet someone
who’s coming maybe from overseas

00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:57.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
or another part of the country.

00:29:57.931 --> 00:30:02.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, since 9/11,
it’s very hard to go to an airport

00:30:02.018 --> 00:30:07.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and actually stand on the side of the runway
and see the plane land.

00:30:07.023 --> 00:30:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually, what happens?

00:30:09.025 --> 00:30:13.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once you get to the airport, you’re allowed
to go into a large room with other people,

00:30:13.655 --> 00:30:17.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all you see are monitors on the wall.

00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:20.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what may the monitors say?

00:30:20.287 --> 00:30:24.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you see, it says there
that the flight has left.

00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:29.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then later, maybe the monitor says
the flight is on time.

00:30:29.296 --> 00:30:33.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it says the flight has landed.

00:30:33.091 --> 00:30:36.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it says the flight is taxiing.

00:30:36.678 --> 00:30:38.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it says it’s at the gate.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now you start to get really excited,
don’t you?

00:30:42.392 --> 00:30:46.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet you haven’t seen the plane,
and you haven’t seen your friend yet.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you can see from the indications

00:30:49.942 --> 00:30:52.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what you see on the monitor

00:30:52.027 --> 00:30:54.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it must be close.

00:30:54.113 --> 00:30:57.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then all of a sudden, the doors open
and people start to come out.

00:30:57.992 --> 00:31:00.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now you’re really excited
because you know,

00:31:00.494 --> 00:31:03.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, you’re going to meet your friend.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:08.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that is similar
to how we can view the last days.

00:31:08.169 --> 00:31:11.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
There has been a lot of things happening
that we don’t actually see.

00:31:11.464 --> 00:31:15.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we see the indications
of what’s happened.

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:17.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that very soon

00:31:17.595 --> 00:31:22.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, the angels, and the 144,000

00:31:22.058 --> 00:31:25.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
will take steps to remove this old world

00:31:25.228 --> 00:31:27.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take further steps

00:31:27.522 --> 00:31:30.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the restoration of peace.

00:31:30.525 --> 00:31:32.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful promise?

00:31:34.237 --> 00:31:37.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
So naturally, that takes us
to the third question:

00:31:37.907 --> 00:31:41.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will universal peace be restored?

00:31:41.995 --> 00:31:45.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will Jesus need to do?

00:31:45.331 --> 00:31:50.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, we could say
there are two actions required.

00:31:50.044 --> 00:31:53.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
One is to remove Satan

00:31:53.256 --> 00:31:55.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the peace disturbers.

00:31:55.884 --> 00:31:58.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the second action

00:31:58.386 --> 00:32:02.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to undo all the evil that Satan has done.

00:32:03.934 --> 00:32:07.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we don’t want a Band-Aid solution
—do we?—

00:32:07.562 --> 00:32:11.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you’re just hiding something
that’s very serious

00:32:11.191 --> 00:32:13.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
by putting a Band-Aid over it.

00:32:13.568 --> 00:32:16.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
So not only does Jesus need to take away

00:32:16.321 --> 00:32:18.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
those that are disrupting the peace,

00:32:18.991 --> 00:32:21.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also has to take steps

00:32:21.118 --> 00:32:24.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
to heal mankind and to heal the earth

00:32:24.705 --> 00:32:28.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that all the evil, the bad things
that Satan has done,

00:32:28.584 --> 00:32:30.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be overturned.

00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:34.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about those two actions
for a moment.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the first one
is to remove the peace disturbers.

00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:42.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
What steps are involved with that?

00:32:42.306 --> 00:32:46.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, this is a progressive action.

00:32:46.477 --> 00:32:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we take our Bibles
and turn to the book of Revelation,

00:32:50.606 --> 00:32:55.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see there are several things
mentioned here that help us to see

00:32:55.194 --> 00:32:59.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
how progressively Jesus
has and will bring about

00:32:59.949 --> 00:33:03.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
this removal of peace disturbers.

00:33:03.703 --> 00:33:07.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to Revelation chapter 12,

00:33:07.498 --> 00:33:09.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s read together verse 9

00:33:11.043 --> 00:33:13.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation 12.

00:33:13.046 --> 00:33:15.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, immediately, no doubt you remember

00:33:15.715 --> 00:33:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Revelation 12
is talking about the time

00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus’ government, his Kingdom,
was established in the heavens.

00:33:23.348 --> 00:33:26.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was in 1914.

00:33:26.476 --> 00:33:28.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 9, it mentions

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened shortly after that time.

00:33:32.273 --> 00:33:34.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it:

00:33:34.275 --> 00:33:37.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So down the great dragon was hurled,

00:33:37.487 --> 00:33:41.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the original serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan,

00:33:41.616 --> 00:33:45.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth;

00:33:45.287 --> 00:33:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was hurled down to the earth,

00:33:47.581 --> 00:33:50.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his angels were hurled down with him.”

00:33:51.751 --> 00:33:54.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that word
that came up several times

00:33:54.921 --> 00:33:56.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“hurled” down?

00:33:56.923 --> 00:34:01.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Jesus didn’t go and say to Satan:
‘Well, look, if you don’t mind,

00:34:01.762 --> 00:34:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we’d like you to relocate to the earth.

00:34:04.973 --> 00:34:07.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever you’re ready.’

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Satan was hurled down.

00:34:09.812 --> 00:34:12.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what confidence that gives us!

00:34:12.022 --> 00:34:14.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that Jesus has the power

00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:17.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to remove Satan from the heavens.

00:34:17.903 --> 00:34:20.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gives us some idea
of what’s going to happen in the future

00:34:20.948 --> 00:34:23.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the earth.

00:34:23.284 --> 00:34:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, now we’re living in a time
when Satan and his demons

00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:29.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
are here in the vicinity of the earth,

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are causing so much trouble.

00:34:32.835 --> 00:34:36.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s another step that Jesus will take

00:34:36.088 --> 00:34:39.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
in removing those who disrupt the peace?

00:34:39.925 --> 00:34:43.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at another chapter
in the same book,

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:45.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation chapter 19

00:34:47.183 --> 00:34:49.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation chapter 19.

00:34:49.852 --> 00:34:54.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to read starting at verse 19
right through to 21.

00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:58.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might mention before we start reading it

00:34:58.611 --> 00:35:03.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
that here it describes
political organizations, kings,

00:35:03.616 --> 00:35:08.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who oppose
Jesus and Jehovah God.

00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:11.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in a symbolic way,
it refers to these as beasts,

00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:14.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
as organizations,

00:35:14.127 --> 00:35:16.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have disrupted the peace.

00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:19.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what happens to them:

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:23.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw the wild beast
and the kings of the earth and their armies

00:35:23.386 --> 00:35:28.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“gathered together to wage war
against the one seated on the horse

00:35:28.391 --> 00:35:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and against his army
[now, that one is Jesus Christ].

00:35:33.396 --> 00:35:35.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the wild beast was caught,

00:35:35.899 --> 00:35:38.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and along with it the false prophet

00:35:38.318 --> 00:35:41.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that performed in front of it the signs

00:35:41.154 --> 00:35:45.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with which he misled those who received
the mark of the wild beast

00:35:45.742 --> 00:35:48.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those who worship its image.

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:50.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“While still alive,

00:35:50.497 --> 00:35:53.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they both were hurled into the fiery lake

00:35:53.792 --> 00:35:56.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
that burns with sulfur.”

00:35:56.128 --> 00:35:59.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what happens
to these political organizations

00:35:59.381 --> 00:36:02.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
in opposition to Jehovah and Jesus?

00:36:02.384 --> 00:36:07.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, we see the word
“hurled” down into destruction.

00:36:07.056 --> 00:36:09.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the rest of mankind

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
that opposes Jesus’ rule?

00:36:12.186 --> 00:36:15.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at verse 21.

00:36:15.022 --> 00:36:16.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the rest were killed off

00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:21.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the long sword
that proceeded out of the mouth

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the one seated on the horse.

00:36:24.073 --> 00:36:28.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all the birds
were filled with their flesh.”

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:32.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s a very interesting comment,
isn’t it?

00:36:32.206 --> 00:36:35.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us to see here

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:39.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all those who oppose Jesus

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:43.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be destroyed
in the battle of Armageddon.

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s another step

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:49.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
in getting ready for universal peace.

00:36:49.432 --> 00:36:52.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, Satan is cast out of heaven.

00:36:52.852 --> 00:36:55.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then secondly, at Armageddon,

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:59.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those humans who rebelled against Jesus

00:36:59.067 --> 00:37:01.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reject his rule

00:37:01.361 --> 00:37:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be taken away, destroyed.

00:37:04.614 --> 00:37:06.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s something else too.

00:37:06.074 --> 00:37:09.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at chapter 20 of Revelation

00:37:09.494 --> 00:37:13.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 20 and verses 1-3:

00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:19.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw an angel coming down
out of heaven with the key of the abyss

00:37:19.796 --> 00:37:22.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a great chain in his hand.

00:37:22.007 --> 00:37:25.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He seized the dragon, the original serpent,

00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:27.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is the Devil and Satan,

00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:30.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and bound him for 1,000 years.

00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:34.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he [notice the word again]
hurled him into the abyss

00:37:34.394 --> 00:37:37.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and shut it and sealed it over him,

00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:40.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that he would not mislead
the nations anymore

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:43.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until the 1,000 years were ended.

00:37:43.737 --> 00:37:47.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
After this he must be released
for a little while.”

00:37:49.285 --> 00:37:53.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we notice from this description?

00:37:53.205 --> 00:37:56.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, gradually, in a progressive manner,

00:37:56.792 --> 00:38:00.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will eradicate and remove

00:38:00.212 --> 00:38:04.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who disrupt peace.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Satan and his demons
are cast down to the earth.

00:38:07.678 --> 00:38:12.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the battle of Armageddon,
those who rebelled will be destroyed.

00:38:12.516 --> 00:38:15.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Satan will be put

00:38:15.019 --> 00:38:18.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a symbolic prison, in this abyss,

00:38:18.064 --> 00:38:21.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 1,000 years along with his demons.

00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:25.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the first action
that Jesus needs to do

00:38:25.947 --> 00:38:29.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to get rid of these troublemakers.

00:38:29.158 --> 00:38:32.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
That opens up the way
for what the Bible refers to

00:38:32.787 --> 00:38:36.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ

00:38:36.875 --> 00:38:39.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his Kingdom and corulers.

00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:42.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is going to happen

00:38:42.964 --> 00:38:46.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
during that Thousand Year Reign?

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:51.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember we said that it’s not
a Band-Aid-type solution, is it?

00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:53.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will need to help

00:38:53.224 --> 00:38:57.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
mankind and the earth to heal.

00:38:57.062 --> 00:39:00.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice, please, how this is described for us

00:39:00.273 --> 00:39:03.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a scripture that we’ve already read.

00:39:03.026 --> 00:39:08.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to it again—1 John 3:8.

00:39:09.116 --> 00:39:11.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember in the beginning of that verse,

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s where it told us how universal peace

00:39:14.746 --> 00:39:16.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
was disrupted in the beginning,

00:39:16.915 --> 00:39:19.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the time when that angel

00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:22.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the Devil and started sinning.

00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:27.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what it says
in the second part of this verse:

00:39:28.093 --> 00:39:30.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this purpose

00:39:30.304 --> 00:39:34.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Son of God was made manifest,
[to do what?]

00:39:34.433 --> 00:39:38.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to break up [or to destroy]
the works of the Devil.”

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that an amazing concept?

00:39:43.526 --> 00:39:47.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus not only removes
those who disrupt peace,

00:39:47.446 --> 00:39:50.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he will “break up
the works of the Devil,”

00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:54.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things that he’s done
over these thousands of years

00:39:54.203 --> 00:39:56.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s been ruling this earth.

00:39:56.455 --> 00:39:58.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means all the evil,

00:39:58.499 --> 00:40:01.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the suffering, death,

00:40:01.752 --> 00:40:05.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of that will be taken away.

00:40:05.047 --> 00:40:08.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mankind will be gradually healed.

00:40:08.342 --> 00:40:12.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus started to break up
the works of the Devil

00:40:12.972 --> 00:40:16.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he willingly gave his life as a ransom.

00:40:16.392 --> 00:40:19.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even now we have the opportunity

00:40:19.687 --> 00:40:23.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain a measure of peace
with Jehovah and with others.

00:40:23.483 --> 00:40:25.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can ask Jehovah for forgiveness

00:40:25.944 --> 00:40:29.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the ransom sacrifice.

00:40:29.114 --> 00:40:32.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during the Thousand Year Reign,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be further things
that Jesus will accomplish.

00:40:36.538 --> 00:40:40.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice these three aspects:

00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:44.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will undo all harm.

00:40:44.254 --> 00:40:46.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that includes sickness, war,

00:40:46.965 --> 00:40:49.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
disease, famine, all these problems;

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the harm will be undone.

00:40:53.138 --> 00:40:56.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will also undo death

00:40:56.642 --> 00:41:00.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
by resurrecting those who have died.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he will also undo sin

00:41:04.274 --> 00:41:08.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping mankind to grow to perfection.

00:41:08.153 --> 00:41:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful promise,

00:41:10.406 --> 00:41:14.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
undoing all these works of the Devil?

00:41:14.118 --> 00:41:17.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then by the end of the thousand years,

00:41:17.037 --> 00:41:20.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will we see with regard to the earth?

00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:23.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be a paradise.

00:41:23.169 --> 00:41:25.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be exactly

00:41:25.337 --> 00:41:28.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah purposed it to be
in the beginning.

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:32.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus, by means of the Kingdom,

00:41:32.178 --> 00:41:36.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have completely broken up
the works of the Devil.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, is that the time then

00:41:39.477 --> 00:41:42.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
when universal peace is restored?

00:41:42.855 --> 00:41:46.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not quite yet.

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:47.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else has to happen.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to reread another scripture,
and that’s Romans 16.

00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:56.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember we referred to that
in the beginning.

00:41:56.703 --> 00:42:00.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we see a very interesting connection

00:42:00.373 --> 00:42:02.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
between two different things.

00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:05.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s Romans 16:20:

00:42:07.005 --> 00:42:10.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For his part, the God who gives peace

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[will do what?]

00:42:12.802 --> 00:42:17.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
will crush Satan under your feet shortly.”

00:42:18.308 --> 00:42:21.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the connection here?

00:42:21.144 --> 00:42:23.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Universal peace is connected

00:42:23.647 --> 00:42:27.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the crushing of Satan the Devil.

00:42:27.943 --> 00:42:31.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
So universal peace can only be restored

00:42:31.196 --> 00:42:35.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Satan has been destroyed.

00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:39.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what events will occur
leading up to Satan’s destruction?

00:42:39.788 --> 00:42:42.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember,
as we read already in Revelation,

00:42:42.875 --> 00:42:44.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is going to be allowed

00:42:44.877 --> 00:42:48.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be released from that prison
(the symbolic prison),

00:42:48.797 --> 00:42:52.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll have an opportunity
to try to mislead

00:42:52.051 --> 00:42:55.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
people who are living on the earth
at that time.

00:42:55.554 --> 00:43:00.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who join Satan
will be destroyed forever.

00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:05.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Satan will be permanently destroyed.

00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:08.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what will happen to those perfect persons

00:43:08.484 --> 00:43:11.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
who prove faithful to Jehovah?

00:43:11.237 --> 00:43:13.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what the Bible says

00:43:13.239 --> 00:43:16.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we turn to the book of Romans,

00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:21.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 8:21

00:43:22.415 --> 00:43:24.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 8:21:

00:43:26.127 --> 00:43:28.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That the creation itself

00:43:28.588 --> 00:43:32.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will also be set free
from enslavement to corruption

00:43:32.592 --> 00:43:35.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and have the glorious freedom

00:43:35.344 --> 00:43:37.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the children of God.”

00:43:37.722 --> 00:43:40.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that really mean?

00:43:40.058 --> 00:43:43.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
It means that at that point,

00:43:43.436 --> 00:43:48.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone will become part
of Jehovah’s universal family.

00:43:48.107 --> 00:43:51.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
All intelligent creatures
in heaven and on earth

00:43:51.611 --> 00:43:54.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be united as one family

00:43:54.572 --> 00:43:58.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the pure worship
of the one true God, Jehovah.

00:43:58.743 --> 00:44:02.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful time that will be!

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:06.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what further blessings
are involved with this process

00:44:06.334 --> 00:44:10.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
of gradually bringing universal peace?

00:44:10.338 --> 00:44:12.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, during the Thousand Year Reign
of Jesus,

00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:16.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s going to be wonderful blessings.

00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:20.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who are obedient
to Jehovah and Jesus

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
will experience the things
that were described

00:44:22.517 --> 00:44:26.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible book of Psalms, in Psalm 72.

00:44:26.396 --> 00:44:28.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn there together

00:44:28.398 --> 00:44:31.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 72.

00:44:31.443 --> 00:44:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we see portrayed

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:38.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
some very interesting prophetic statements

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Thousand Year Reign.

00:44:40.327 --> 00:44:43.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll notice at the beginning,
it says regarding Solomon—

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
So although initially
this was referring to an extent

00:44:47.459 --> 00:44:49.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to Solomon,

00:44:49.503 --> 00:44:52.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus mentioned
that he’s greater than Solomon.

00:44:52.798 --> 00:44:55.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this has a prophetic application

00:44:55.801 --> 00:44:58.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Thousand Year Reign.

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:00.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what it says about peace.

00:45:00.848 --> 00:45:03.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in verse 1,

00:45:03.184 --> 00:45:05.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll go through to verse 4:

00:45:05.686 --> 00:45:09.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O God, give your judgments to the king,

00:45:09.607 --> 00:45:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and endow the son of the king
with your righteousness.

00:45:13.736 --> 00:45:17.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May he plead the cause of your people
with righteousness,

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of your lowly ones with justice.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the mountains bring peace to the people,

00:45:24.372 --> 00:45:27.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and may the hills bring righteousness.

00:45:27.834 --> 00:45:30.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let him defend the lowly among the people,

00:45:30.545 --> 00:45:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let him save the sons of the poor,

00:45:33.089 --> 00:45:35.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let him crush the defrauder.”

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful description

00:45:39.012 --> 00:45:42.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what will happen
in the Thousand Year Reign!

00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:45.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, all those under Satan’s rule

00:45:45.936 --> 00:45:49.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were lowly, beaten up, disadvantaged

00:45:49.898 --> 00:45:53.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all these will experience relief

00:45:53.151 --> 00:45:57.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the righteous rule
of Jesus Christ.

00:45:57.155 --> 00:46:01.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go down a little further
to verses 12 through 14.

00:46:01.618 --> 00:46:05.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us a little more
about what Jesus will accomplish.

00:46:05.914 --> 00:46:08.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in verse 12, we’re told:

00:46:08.876 --> 00:46:12.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he will rescue the poor
who cry for help,

00:46:12.337 --> 00:46:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also the lowly one
and whoever has no helper.

00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will have pity on the lowly and the poor,

00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:23.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the lives of the poor he will save.

00:46:23.182 --> 00:46:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From oppression and from violence
he will rescue them,

00:46:27.269 --> 00:46:30.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and notice
this very interesting expression]

00:46:30.898 --> 00:46:35.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their blood will be
precious in his eyes.”

00:46:35.736 --> 00:46:37.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:46:37.238 --> 00:46:42.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their blood will be precious in his eyes.”

00:46:42.243 --> 00:46:44.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible, usually the word “blood”

00:46:44.578 --> 00:46:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
is associated with life, isn’t it?

00:46:47.331 --> 00:46:51.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s saying that each person’s life

00:46:51.878 --> 00:46:54.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be precious to Jesus Christ.

00:46:54.797 --> 00:46:57.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful description

00:46:57.425 --> 00:47:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what will happen
during the Thousand Year Reign!

00:47:01.304 --> 00:47:05.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then if we go back a little to verse 5,

00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:09.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll notice that this part of the psalm
helps us to see

00:47:09.312 --> 00:47:12.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
how widespread peace will be at that point.

00:47:12.607 --> 00:47:15.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
It uses very picturesque language.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice there in verse 5, it says:

00:47:18.488 --> 00:47:21.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will fear you
as long as there is a sun

00:47:21.825 --> 00:47:25.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[well, we know the sun continues on,
so they’ll continue to fear him]

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and as long as the moon remains,

00:47:28.248 --> 00:47:31.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for generation after generation.

00:47:31.668 --> 00:47:35.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will be like the rain
that falls on the mown grass,

00:47:35.255 --> 00:47:38.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like showers of rain that water the earth.

00:47:38.884 --> 00:47:42.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In his days the righteous will flourish,

00:47:42.471 --> 00:47:46.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and peace will abound
until the moon is no more.

00:47:46.433 --> 00:47:50.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will have subjects from sea to sea

00:47:50.604 --> 00:47:54.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the River to the ends of the earth.”

00:47:54.775 --> 00:47:58.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, what a beautiful description

00:47:58.445 --> 00:48:02.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the peaceful arrangements
that will prevail

00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:06.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Thousand Year Reign
of Jesus’ Kingdom!

00:48:07.621 --> 00:48:11.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then the thousand years finish.

00:48:12.668 --> 00:48:16.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we expect when that reign ends?

00:48:16.881 --> 00:48:19.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’re going to enjoy
our consideration

00:48:19.967 --> 00:48:24.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a very special part of the Scriptures
—1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:48:24.597 --> 00:48:26.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn there with me,

00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:30.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to go through
and look at what these verses tell us

00:48:30.436 --> 00:48:34.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
about after the end
of the Thousand Year Reign.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
The section of Scripture
we’re going to consider

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
is 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:45.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 24-28.

00:48:46.494 --> 00:48:49.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in verse 24, we’re told:

00:48:49.289 --> 00:48:51.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Next, the end,

00:48:51.749 --> 00:48:55.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he hands over the Kingdom
to his God and Father,

00:48:55.503 --> 00:48:57.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he has brought to nothing

00:48:57.589 --> 00:49:01.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all government and all authority and power.

00:49:01.259 --> 00:49:03.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he must rule as king

00:49:03.261 --> 00:49:07.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until God has put
all enemies under his feet.

00:49:07.015 --> 00:49:09.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the last enemy, death,

00:49:09.684 --> 00:49:12.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to be brought to nothing.

00:49:12.062 --> 00:49:16.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God ‘subjected all things
under his feet.’

00:49:16.024 --> 00:49:19.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But when he says
that ‘all things have been subjected,’

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is evident that this does not include

00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:26.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One who subjected all things to him.

00:49:26.159 --> 00:49:29.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But when all things
will have been subjected to him,

00:49:29.705 --> 00:49:33.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then the Son himself
will also subject himself

00:49:33.542 --> 00:49:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the One who subjected all things to him,

00:49:37.087 --> 00:49:41.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God may be all things to everyone.”

00:49:44.052 --> 00:49:48.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do these verses tell us
about the end of the Thousand Year Reign?

00:49:48.974 --> 00:49:52.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back to verse 24.

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says: “Next, the end . . .”

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this “end” mentioned here
is not Armageddon.

00:49:59.985 --> 00:50:03.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the end of the Thousand Year Reign.

00:50:04.907 --> 00:50:07.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the Thousand Year Reign,

00:50:07.702 --> 00:50:11.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are some other things too
that will have finished.

00:50:11.414 --> 00:50:13.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means for a start,

00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:16.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
the end of the Kingdom arrangement.

00:50:16.878 --> 00:50:19.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will also be an end to sin,

00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:22.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means that mankind will no longer need

00:50:22.133 --> 00:50:25.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ransom or a mediator or priesthood.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:28.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 26, notice it says:

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:32.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The last enemy, death,
is to be brought to nothing.”

00:50:32.352 --> 00:50:35.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, the graves will be empty.

00:50:35.146 --> 00:50:38.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who have experienced the Adamic death

00:50:38.316 --> 00:50:40.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have been brought back.

00:50:40.944 --> 00:50:45.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mankind will all attain to perfection
with the end of sin

00:50:45.949 --> 00:50:48.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Adamic sin.

00:50:48.535 --> 00:50:51.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at that point in time,

00:50:51.246 --> 00:50:56.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
something very, very special happens.

00:50:56.251 --> 00:50:58.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:50:58.503 --> 00:51:02.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back
to the beginning of our discussion

00:51:02.382 --> 00:51:07.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we talked about the problems
that occurred in the garden of Eden.

00:51:07.387 --> 00:51:11.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Satan the Devil raised some issues

00:51:11.475 --> 00:51:14.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
that resulted in a symbolic court case

00:51:14.853 --> 00:51:18.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
that involves the sanctification
of Jehovah’s name.

00:51:18.607 --> 00:51:21.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Satan had claimed
that Jehovah is a liar,

00:51:21.777 --> 00:51:25.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he doesn’t rule mankind out of love,

00:51:25.489 --> 00:51:27.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he even raised the question later

00:51:27.491 --> 00:51:30.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
about who would actually serve Jehovah.

00:51:30.744 --> 00:51:33.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this issue has continued on

00:51:33.455 --> 00:51:37.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the issue of the sanctification
of Jehovah’s name—right down through history.

00:51:37.835 --> 00:51:42.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And over and over again,
Jehovah’s name has been sanctified.

00:51:42.006 --> 00:51:44.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
His reputation has been vindicated.

00:51:44.967 --> 00:51:46.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see that he’s a loving God,

00:51:46.969 --> 00:51:51.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
unlike Satan
—such a horrible person.

00:51:51.265 --> 00:51:56.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah has stood out
as being a loving heavenly Father.

00:51:57.521 --> 00:52:00.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now at this point in time,

00:52:00.983 --> 00:52:05.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can say the universal court case
comes to a conclusion.

00:52:07.073 --> 00:52:10.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
The issue is settled—the verdict is given.

00:52:11.327 --> 00:52:13.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:52:13.538 --> 00:52:17.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus has just finished ruling mankind
for a thousand years,

00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the 144,000
that have made the earth a paradise.

00:52:22.505 --> 00:52:26.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mankind is now no longer sinners;
they’re perfect.

00:52:26.468 --> 00:52:29.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the problems have been healed.

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:33.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this point in time, what does Jesus do?

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:36.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he follow the example of Satan
and say: ‘Well, you know,

00:52:36.394 --> 00:52:40.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I think we did a very, very good job
for this thousand years.

00:52:40.148 --> 00:52:42.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So let’s just keep everything in place,

00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:46.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll keep on ruling in the Kingdom.’

00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:49.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we saw what he does.

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:51.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point in time,

00:52:51.284 --> 00:52:55.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a marvelous answer in this court case

00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:00.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jesus hands over
the Kingdom back to his Father.

00:53:00.002 --> 00:53:02.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
He submits to Jehovah’s rule.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s just as if Jehovah

00:53:04.172 --> 00:53:07.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
is told by his loving Son, Jesus:

00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:10.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You were right all along.

00:53:10.721 --> 00:53:12.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This whole thing

00:53:12.723 --> 00:53:16.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been a terrible travesty of justice.

00:53:16.268 --> 00:53:19.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan is a despicable liar.”

00:53:19.188 --> 00:53:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all mankind, including Jesus

00:53:22.358 --> 00:53:24.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the 144,000,

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
submit themselves to Jehovah’s rulership.

00:53:27.905 --> 00:53:31.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the end of the universal issue.

00:53:33.285 --> 00:53:37.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will then rule directly
over perfect mankind.

00:53:37.999 --> 00:53:42.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is that the point in time
when universal peace is restored?

00:53:42.503 --> 00:53:45.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, remember, there are some other things
that need to occur.

00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:48.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve already mentioned
that Satan will be released

00:53:48.634 --> 00:53:50.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his symbolic prison.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:54.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll have an opportunity
to try and mislead some.

00:53:54.557 --> 00:53:56.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for those who side with him,

00:53:56.684 --> 00:54:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah morally and ethically
doesn’t have to wait any longer

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:02.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say: ‘Well, let’s have
another court case.’

00:54:02.982 --> 00:54:06.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, they are executed immediately.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the rest of mankind?

00:54:10.281 --> 00:54:13.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
They become Jehovah’s sons and daughters.

00:54:13.201 --> 00:54:16.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can talk to him directly
without the need of a mediator.

00:54:16.663 --> 00:54:20.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then names will be written permanently
in “the book of life.”

00:54:20.917 --> 00:54:25.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ll be approved
to live forever in Paradise.

00:54:25.255 --> 00:54:27.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at this point, when we’re thinking

00:54:27.424 --> 00:54:30.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
about all these beautiful things
that will occur,

00:54:30.427 --> 00:54:33.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s enjoy the final video
of our convention.

00:54:33.889 --> 00:54:38.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlights the blessings
of the Thousand Year Reign and beyond.

00:54:38.477 --> 00:54:41.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also, we’re going to listen

00:54:41.188 --> 00:54:45.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the original song that we will sing
at the conclusion of our program.

00:54:59.999 --> 00:55:06.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an island of calm
In dark stormy seas,

00:55:06.964 --> 00:55:12.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people
are living in peace.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:19.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our eyes of faith,
We see beyond the clouds

00:55:19.727 --> 00:55:25.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
And know that the storm
soon will cease.

00:55:25.733 --> 00:55:32.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:38.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:55:38.454 --> 00:55:45.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:56.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see
Peace at last.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:05.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the new world is here,
All will be one

00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:11.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
On earth
and in heaven above.

00:56:11.905 --> 00:56:18.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace we’ll know
We’ve never known before—

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:24.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
A world ruled
by justice and love.

00:56:24.876 --> 00:56:31.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:56:31.633 --> 00:56:37.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:56:37.514 --> 00:56:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:55.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see
Peace at last.

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:16.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:57:16.637 --> 00:57:22.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:29.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:57:29.609 --> 00:57:35.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see.

00:57:35.114 --> 00:57:42.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the ends of the earth,
There’ll be peace at last

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:48.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all eternity.

00:57:48.003 --> 00:57:55.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the valleys below
To the mountaintops,

00:57:55.302 --> 00:58:06.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
All creation will see
Peace at last,

00:58:06.438 --> 00:58:14.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace at last!

00:58:20.953 --> 00:58:23.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful song!

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what beautiful images to encourage us!

00:58:26.667 --> 00:58:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
So brothers and sisters, we’ve enjoyed
our convention program, haven’t we?

00:58:31.547 --> 00:58:35.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us be determined to keep pursuing peace,

00:58:35.384 --> 00:58:39.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
not an imitation peace, but the real peace.

00:58:39.263 --> 00:58:41.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can enjoy rich blessings now

00:58:41.807 --> 00:58:45.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
by having a peaceful relationship
with Jehovah God,

00:58:45.353 --> 00:58:49.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, trying to continue
to maintain peace with one another

00:58:49.482 --> 00:58:54.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also attaining to this inner peace
—calmness and tranquility—

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we have friendship
with the God who gives us hope.

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:02.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that hope helps us to look to the future,

00:59:02.078 --> 00:59:04.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we have difficulties now,

00:59:04.372 --> 00:59:06.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look forward to the time

00:59:06.541 --> 00:59:10.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
when universal peace is finally restored.

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:14.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the meantime, may the God of peace

00:59:14.173 --> 00:59:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
be with each one of you now and forever!

00:00:01.438 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man Gideon is
the Bible example we will consider.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is the challenge
this talk intends to address?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready for this?

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Differences between fellow Christians.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think: ‘No, how can that be?

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jesus said the identifying mark
of his disciples

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be the “love among [themselves],”
not the differences.’

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is true.

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our Christian brotherhood,
we feel the love.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is prominent.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is dominant.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as individuals,
we are drenched in imperfection.

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Differences will inevitably erupt.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 3:2 doesn’t mince any words.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “We all [all] stumble many times.”

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not constantly, not every day

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but it acknowledges
that we make mistakes many times.

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:00.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother or sister
may say something to hurt us.

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe we push their emotional button
with words,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they push ours.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually, it’s not intentional.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often it’s a misunderstanding.

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:13.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
We or they say something in good faith.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:17.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thinks it appropriate;
the other does not.

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or possibly what we said or did

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
was perceived in a way
that we could not even have imagined.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it happened, and now we must

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
sow peace in order to reap peace.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we plant seeds,

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
some germinate much faster than others.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the opening talk of this symposium,

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:43.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
it acknowledged that a farmer trusts

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will see results in due time.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find ourselves
at odds with a fellow Christian,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible example of Gideon

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to sow and reap peace.

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Gideon was at war with the Midianites,

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he asked his fellow worshippers,
the Ephraimites,

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:08.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help chase them down

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Judges chapter 8.

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had tremendous success.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
We say, “Great.”

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the battle,
the Ephraimites were offended.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
They tried to pick a fight with Gideon.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
They felt that Gideon
did not call them into battle soon enough.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judges 8:1:

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the men of Ephraim said to him:
‘What have you done to us?

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:38.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why did you not call us when you went
to fight against Midian?’

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they quarreled bitterly with him.”

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these are all armed, fighting men.

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this difference of opinion
was allowed to escalate,

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
it could get out of hand very quickly.

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in this case,

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
hand-to-hand combat might have ensued.

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:58.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, though,

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did Gideon sow peace with words?

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verses 2 and 3:

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:07.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He [Gideon] said to them:

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What have I done compared with you?

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are not the gleanings of Ephraim
better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:20.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was into your hand that God
gave Midian’s princes Oreb and Zeeb,

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:25.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what have I done compared with you?’

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[and notice]

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he spoke this way, they calmed down.”

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:36.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in this case,
the germination period was very short.

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:41.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon sowed peace with well-chosen words,

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:45.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he reaped peace in one conversation.

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:52.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a brother prevents the situation

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
from escalating into a confrontation.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know how Jehovah’s people are.

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:10.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
When there’s a need,

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers step up.

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though we had

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:16.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of work to do back then,

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
we always had willing workers

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:25.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so many workers that some started to feel
like they were being overlooked.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Ray!
What’s up?

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:33.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Matt,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hear you’re organizing
the food distribution for our congregation.

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I’m trying my best.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, can I give you a hand?
My truck is all ready to go.

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:46.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
We actually just finished loading up
for the day, so I think we’re good.

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, wow, yeah,
thank you very much for offering.

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:54.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
When’s the next run?

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what, Ray?

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:56.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re about to pull out right now.

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:58.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it OK if I call you back?

00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:00.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray was such a hard worker,

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than most of us even realized.

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:14.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He put his heart into every assignment.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was that?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I told him

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:20.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
we already had all the help we needed,

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
it didn’t go the way I hoped.

00:05:22.217 --> 00:05:23.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray, I think you’re muted.

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what you’re saying is
you don’t think I’m qualified to help out.

00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:33.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, we just—

00:05:33.812 --> 00:05:36.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know how hard
you’re working caring for your mom.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:37.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want to . . .

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:39.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t Paul Thompson on your crew?

00:05:39.693 --> 00:05:40.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but—

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:42.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Oliver Kagan?

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:43.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oliver’s my assistant, yes, but—

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does this work, Matt?

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:47.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, you just use your friends,

00:05:47.743 --> 00:05:49.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you shut the rest of us out.

00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:53.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think I notice
how you brothers ignore me?

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray, I owe you an apology.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:09.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I should’ve spoken with you
about this right from the start.

00:06:11.058 --> 00:06:13.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re working so hard
taking care of your mom.

00:06:13.977 --> 00:06:16.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
The last thing we wanted to do
was make things harder for you.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even more than that,

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:23.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t want to have to ask you
to do something

00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:25.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would put you
or your mother at higher risk.

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:29.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:31.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worry about that too.

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:33.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
your mom
—we wouldn’t want anything to happen to her.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:40.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s one of our congregation treasures.

00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:42.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re not so bad either.

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:49.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seriously, you’re such a good example.

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:52.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how Jehovah must feel when he sees

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:57.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
all that you’re doing
for us and for your mom.

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:00.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:03.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means a lot to me.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
If something comes up
that I can help with then

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:10.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even just a little—
and I can do it from home—

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:12.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a good point.

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:14.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I can get your thoughts
on something, if that’s OK?

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:19.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two good brothers

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
—but because of imperfection,
they were both looking

00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:27.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the exact same situation
from two different perspectives.

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:31.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt was well-intended
in what he did for Ray.

00:07:31.888 --> 00:07:33.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
He realized he was caring

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his ailing mother;
he was trying to protect him.

00:07:36.518 --> 00:07:38.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Ray was offended.

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:40.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even accused Matt of showing favoritism

00:07:40.897 --> 00:07:44.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his friends and ignoring others.

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:47.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did this calm down?

00:07:47.154 --> 00:07:49.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, thankfully,

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:52.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ray went directly to Matt

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:55.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
and expressed his feelings
between the two of them alone.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did that allow for a follow-up?

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Matt now had the opportunity

00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:06.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
to absorb and understand Ray’s concerns.

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:09.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing that was!

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:12.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, what followed after that?

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you remember, when he grasped it,

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:19.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt paused and apologized.

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:22.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words—like Gideon’s, well-spoken—

00:08:22.564 --> 00:08:24.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
calmed Ray down.

00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:27.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a short germination period.

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:30.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sowed and reaped peace
in one conversation.

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:33.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we imitate Gideon

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:37.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there are future differences
with fellow worshippers?

00:08:37.454 --> 00:08:40.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 2:24

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:44.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
—(And you recall that when the men of Ephraim

00:08:44.086 --> 00:08:47.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
confronted Gideon, they were confrontational.

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:51.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were upset;
they were rattling their sabers.)

00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:54.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here, Paul, in effect,

00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:57.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
summarizes for Christians Gideon’s demeanor.

00:08:57.849 --> 00:09:00.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 2:24:

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For a slave of the Lord
does not need to fight,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[you see, with words or swords,
instead like Gideon, it says]

00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:11.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but needs to be gentle toward all,

00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:14.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“qualified to teach, [and notice this]

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:17.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing restraint when wronged.”

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:19.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is not easy to do.

00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:22.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
But “showing restraint when wronged”

00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:26.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a means of sowing peace.

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:30.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if it’s just a minor offense,
we might ask ourselves,

00:09:30.507 --> 00:09:35.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Can I put up with this slight
to avoid a confrontation?’

00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:39.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, in the case with Ray,
he felt deeply hurt.

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:42.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt realized the perspective was different.

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:44.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you remember, in hindsight,

00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:48.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matt admitted,
‘I should have talked to you first.’

00:09:48.942 --> 00:09:52.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
With those words, he planted seeds of peace.

00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:55.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, amazingly,
long before the first century,

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:59.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gideon manifested

00:09:59.035 --> 00:10:02.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
what later became a Christian principle.

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:04.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 2:3, it says:

00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:08.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With humility consider others
superior to you.”

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember Gideon’s exact expression?

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twice he said:

00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:19.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What have I done compared [to] you?”

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
His humility calmed

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:25.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Ephraimites down instantly.

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:27.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do?

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can apologize
for our contribution to the difference,

00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:36.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if the apology is done
on the other person’s terms.

00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:38.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can pray for him.

00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:42.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can give a sincere compliment;
do something kind for the person.

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:45.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we have a discussion,
may our words be gracious

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:48.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the tone kindly.

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:51.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it would be nice if all the differences
between Christians

00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:55.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have a short germination cycle.

00:10:55.342 --> 00:10:59.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of circumstances, personalities,

00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:04.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the nature of the issue,
that’s not always possible.

00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:06.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may we each

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:10.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
be determined to do our part to sow peace

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:15.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, like the farmer,
expect peace in due time.

00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:18.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, oh,

00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:22.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
how sweet restored peace truly is!

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:28.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
will give the next talk
of this symposium, entitled

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:35.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How They Sowed and Reaped Peace
—Abigail.”

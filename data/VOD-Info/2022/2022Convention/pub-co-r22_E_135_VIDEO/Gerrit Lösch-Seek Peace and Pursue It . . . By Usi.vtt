00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it challenging
to use our gift of speech wisely?

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because something powerful
constantly works against us.

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imperfection.

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:16.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tongue is powerful.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can do much good,
but because of imperfection,

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can also cause much harm.

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
This thought is well expressed
in the Bible book of Proverbs.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Proverbs 12:18 says:

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thoughtless speech
is like the stabs of a sword,

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the tongue of the wise is a healing.”

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Proverbs 18:21 states:

00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death and life
are in the power of the tongue;

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who love to use it
will eat its fruitage.”

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Words have power,

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we need to be careful about what we say

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we say it.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:10.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can recall
when someone spoke unkindly to you

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hurt you deeply.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, thoughtful speech

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:20.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
can mend an aching heart
and heal friendships.

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:23.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of imperfection,
we all have difficulty

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
controlling our tongue.

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was true
even of the first-century disciple James.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly acknowledged the challenge
that all humans face

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the third chapter of his inspired letter.

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how James described this

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:47.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
at James 3:3-6, 8:

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:52.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If we put bridles in the mouths of horses

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make them obey us,

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we guide also the whole body.

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look also at ships: Although they are so big

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and are driven by strong winds,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they are steered by a very small rudder

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wherever the man at the helm
is inclined to go.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, too, the tongue
is a small part of the body,

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and yet it makes great brags.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“See how small a fire it takes

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to set a great forest ablaze!

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:28.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tongue is also a fire.

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The tongue represents a world
of unrighteousness

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“among our body members,
for it defiles

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all the body
and sets the whole course of life on fire,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is set on fire by Gehenna.”

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:47.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 8:
“But no human can tame the tongue.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:49.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is unruly and injurious,

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:52.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
full of deadly poison.”

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to inherited imperfection,

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:59.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
our upbringing could also be a factor.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:04.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of September 15, 2006,

00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:08.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 21, paragraph 6 states:

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In addition to human imperfection,

00:03:12.337 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“family environment plays a role
in the misuse of the tongue.

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some people were raised in homes

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where parents were ‘not open
to any agreement, . . .

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
without self-control, fierce.’”

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:31.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite such challenges,
it is possible for each one of us

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:34.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “seek peace and pursue it.”

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus set a good example

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
in using the gift of speech wisely.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used his speech to encourage
and comfort others.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
While on earth, he applied to himself
the words

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Isaiah 61:1,

00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
which states the following:

00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
is upon me,

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because Jehovah anointed me
to declare good news to the meek.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:11.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim liberty to the captives

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the wide opening of the eyes
to the prisoners.”

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:20.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
As recorded at Matthew 12:20,
Matthew applies the words

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Isaiah 42:1-3 to Jesus.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 12:20, he stated:

00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:31.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No bruised reed will he crush,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and no smoldering wick will he extinguish,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
until he brings justice with success.”

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learn an important lesson
from such verses.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus recognized that the tongue has power

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
—power to harm and power to heal.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of February 15, 2015,

00:04:56.984 --> 00:05:01.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
page 13, and paragraph 11, thus stated

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:04.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jesus showed discernment

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:07.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all he said and did.”

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:12.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we imitate Jesus more closely?

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:17.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, what will you do
the next time an opportunity arises

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you to use your gift of speech wisely?

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:23.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how the wise use of the tongue
helps to heal.

00:05:35.147 --> 00:05:36.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just need a bit of help.

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:39.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think I should do
for my winter collection?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I don’t know,
but I love what you did with your new stuff,

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:45.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
this set.

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:51.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve all given me so many great ideas.

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:57.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you make them.

00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:58.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:00.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, girls.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
You love it.

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:08.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, this is my song.

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:10.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mine too.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have a treasured place

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:15.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in Jehovah’s house;

00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He’ll help you out [out].

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:19.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you have . . .”

00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:21.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, I sing like a crow.

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:23.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, stop!

00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:28.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll tell you who else thinks it’s her song,
but you’d better have earplugs handy

00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:31.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Veronica.

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness!
She’s in love with her own voice.

00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:37.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ever sit near her at the hall?

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like she’s the only one that can sing.

00:06:40.212 --> 00:06:41.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she’s such a diva.

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:46.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
My first thought:
‘Oh, no! Here we go again!

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen this movie before.’

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:51.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t think she’s showing off?

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:53.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just about Haley?

00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:57.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems it’s all about Haley.

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve lived it.

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:12.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s a case of her being more careful
how she comes across,

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:14.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s another matter.

00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:17.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she suggest?

00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:20.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
That I should tell her
that she needs to stop.

00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:22.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:25.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially as a pioneer,
what kind of example is she setting?

00:07:25.674 --> 00:07:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
How quickly it snowballs out of control!

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not what I am saying at all.

00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:31.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are such . . .

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow! I can’t believe you.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you that lonely
that you’ve got nothing better to do?

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:41.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haley!

00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:48.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
How difficult it can be to unravel!

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry.

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:55.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you so harshly.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have judged you at all.

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:03.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
A chance to forgive
is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:08.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to a time
when you wanted forgiveness.

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:20.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has anyone ever tried talking to her
about her singing?

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:26.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what I love about Veronica?

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:29.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s probably the most hospitable person
I know.

00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:32.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always open house at her place.

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:34.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can she cook!

00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:35.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you tried her curry?

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
I haven’t tried it yet.

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:37.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s so good.

00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:39.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so good.

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:41.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really look forward to that.

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:42.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really good.

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:43.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, I’ll ask her.

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:46.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
She does these curry nights.

00:08:46.296 --> 00:08:47.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, you’re going to love it.

00:08:50.092 --> 00:08:52.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should use our gift of speech

00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:55.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
to honor God and to benefit others.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if somebody gets angry at us,

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:03.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
our mild reply can diffuse the situation.

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:05.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Proverbs 15:1 says:

00:09:05.857 --> 00:09:08.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A mild answer turns away rage,

00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a harsh word stirs up anger.”

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:15.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also use our gift of speech

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:18.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
to console and encourage others.

00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:24.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 5:11, 14 states:

00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, keep encouraging one another
and building one another up,

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:33.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you are in fact doing. . . .

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:36.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the other hand, we urge you, brothers,

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:40.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to warn the disorderly, speak consolingly

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:42.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who are depressed,

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:46.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
support the weak, be patient toward all.”

00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:49.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even faithful servants of Jehovah

00:09:49.734 --> 00:09:53.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
may at times struggle with depression.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:56.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we help such ones?

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:59.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offer specific, genuine commendation

00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:04.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them see their own value
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Share with them the powerful words
of Bible texts

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:11.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing that Jehovah
truly cares about and loves those

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:15.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
who “are broken at heart”
and “crushed in spirit.”

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:19.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also use the power of our tongue

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:22.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide much needed encouragement
to others.

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:28.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has a fellow believer lost
a loved one in death?

00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:32.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sympathetic words
expressing our care and concern

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
can comfort a grieving heart.

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:40.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is an elderly brother or sister
feeling unneeded?

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:43.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
A thoughtful tongue can reassure older ones

00:10:43.788 --> 00:10:47.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are valued and appreciated.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is someone struggling with a chronic illness?

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:55.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind words shared on the phone or in person

00:10:55.634 --> 00:11:00.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
can do much to lift the spirits
of one who is sick.

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:03.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
How pleased our Creator must be

00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:07.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we use the power of speech
to utter sayings

00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:09.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are “good for building up”!

00:11:10.982 --> 00:11:13.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not be able to fix their problems,

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:16.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can let them know that we love them

00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:19.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we care about them.

00:11:20.116 --> 00:11:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you can arrange
to spend time with him or her.

00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:27.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we can use God’s Word

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:30.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen them.

00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:33.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you may notice
that someone in the congregation

00:11:33.463 --> 00:11:36.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
is discouraged or depressed.

00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:38.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could read an encouraging Bible verse

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even offer to say a prayer.

00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:43.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reassure such ones

00:11:43.848 --> 00:11:47.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
that their brothers and sisters
in the congregation love them.

00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And speak in a way that shows

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:54.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you really mean and believe
what you say.

00:11:56.194 --> 00:11:58.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
This symposium has given each one of us

00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:02.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
much to think about, has it not?

00:12:02.617 --> 00:12:07.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been reminded
that seeking peace is not always easy.

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:10.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have also learned
that the pursuit of peace

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:13.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires effort.

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:17.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what specific ways are you resolved

00:12:17.048 --> 00:12:20.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “seek peace and pursue it”

00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:22.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the days ahead?

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:26.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue to pursue peace

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) by not quickly taking offense,

00:12:31.104 --> 00:12:34.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) by apologizing,

00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:37.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) by forgiving freely,

00:12:37.736 --> 00:12:42.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (4) by using our gift of speech wisely

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:45.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage and comfort others.

00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:48.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may Jehovah, “the God of peace,”

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
bless you abundantly for doing so!

00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the Great Healer.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only he can make the promise:

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say, ‘I am sick.’”

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we be confident

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is going to keep his promise

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring an end to all sickness?

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find assurance

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the words of Isaiah 35:5, 6.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles to that scripture.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we read a promise of healing
that Jehovah made to the nation of Israel.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
This promise gives us hope

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it was actually fulfilled
on a small scale

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 2,500 years ago.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 35:5, 6 reads:

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time
the eyes of the blind will be opened,

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that time
the lame will leap like the deer,

00:00:57.077 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the tongue of the speechless
will shout for joy.

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For waters will burst forth
in the wilderness,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and streams in the desert plain.”

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah recorded this promise 125 years

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the Babylonian army
destroyed Jerusalem.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was fulfilled
after Jehovah freed the Israelites

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:23.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Babylonian captivity in 537 B.C.E.

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:26.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restored them
to their homeland in Israel.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you may ask,

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Were the blind, deaf, lame, and speechless

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
really healed at that time?’

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:40.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer,
we need to apply a basic principle:

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah restores what was lost.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the 70 years of exile,

00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not punish the Israelites
by striking them with physical blindness,

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
deafness, lameness, and loss of speech.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:59.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore,
their restoration would not require

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:02.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
the healing of their physical disabilities.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
these afflictions are a good description

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the self-inflicted spiritual sickness

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had caused the nation
to fall into apostasy

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lose Jehovah’s favor.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw their repentant attitude

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their desire to restore
true worship in Jerusalem.

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
He healed their spiritual sickness

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving their sins

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:31.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restoring them to his favor.

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
they came to their spiritual senses.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
They regained their spiritual vision

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:43.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their ability to hear, obey,

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and speak Jehovah’s word.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:49.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
No longer spiritually lame,

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:53.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were energized
to carry on Jehovah’s pure worship.

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly today, we are eyewitnesses.

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we are the beneficiaries

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:05.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a worldwide spiritual healing program.

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah heals us spiritually by freeing us

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:12.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
from false religious teachings
and unclean practices.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:16.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has brought us into a spiritual paradise,

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
where our spiritual strength
is renewed day by day.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a spiritual sense,

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
the blind are learning to see

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deaf are learning to hear.

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:35.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is spiritual healing the only part
of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise?

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:37.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please open your Bibles to Isaiah 33:24.

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read this verse,
pay attention to the latter part,

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:50.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it contains
the key to understanding

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:54.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
why physical healing
is included in God’s promise:

00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 33:24 says:

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:10.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people dwelling in the land
will be pardoned for their error.”

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:14.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that the end of sickness

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
is related to our being pardoned
for our errors, or sins?

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, that ties the fulfillment

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a spiritual healing.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:29.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, our imperfect, sinful condition

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
is also the reason
that we get physically sick.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, in the new world,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the basis of the healing power
of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice,

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:45.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will experience
a healing of our physical sicknesses.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s promise
that “no resident will say: ‘I am sick’”

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come true in the complete sense.

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:58.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:01.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about the spiritual blessings
we enjoy now

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:05.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imagine what our lives
will be like in the future

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:09.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
when all our physical ailments
will be healed.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clear instruction from Jehovah

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us close to him

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:25.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintains spiritual health.

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:31.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
While false teachings hold many

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the grip of spiritual darkness,

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:38.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah offers true freedom.

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:58.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:03.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us
that perfect physical and mental health

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:14.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
await us in Paradise.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine waking every day

00:06:28.867 --> 00:06:31.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
feeling clean,

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
healthy,

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:39.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy,

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:42.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full of the joy of life.

00:06:57.312 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises:

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:03.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:12.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
How refreshing and heartwarming

00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:16.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think of the global healing
that lies ahead!

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are confident
that this is going to happen.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:20.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:22.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we have already experienced

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:26.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah has healed us spiritually.

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:30.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind
the powerful statement from the video:

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spiritual health we enjoy now

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“reminds us that perfect physical
and mental health

00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
await us in Paradise.”

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:43.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also learned from the video

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:47.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
that clear instruction from Jehovah
draws us close to him

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helps us to maintain
our spiritual health today.

00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:56.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to be taught by Jehovah!

00:07:57.956 --> 00:08:01.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can show our appreciation
for this spiritual healing

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:04.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
by thanking Jehovah in prayer.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:09.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 40:5 mentions another way
we can thank the Great Healer

00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:13.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all he has done and will do for us.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it.

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:18.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 40:5 says:

00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:22.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How many things you have done,
O Jehovah my God,

00:08:22.022 --> 00:08:25.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your wonderful works
and your thoughts toward us.

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:27.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“None can compare to you;

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:30.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if I were to try to tell and speak of them,

00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would be too numerous to recount!”

00:08:35.535 --> 00:08:37.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our gratitude to Jehovah

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:42.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
will move us to tell others
about Jehovah’s wonderful works,

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:46.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak of the many things he has done.

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:50.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will never run out of good things

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say about our God.

00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:54.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who respond favorably

00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:58.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come to know Jehovah
as their Great Healer

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:01.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy his friendship forever.

00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:07.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Granted, today many of us are dealing
with serious health challenges.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:12.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do what we can to share with others
this good news about healing.

00:09:12.656 --> 00:09:16.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we take delight in Jehovah’s promises,

00:09:16.243 --> 00:09:18.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
which cannot fail.

00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:20.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus was on earth,

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
no sickness was beyond his ability to heal,

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:28.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it was
physical, mental, or emotional.

00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:30.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:34.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
such healings will take place
on a much grander scale

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:38.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the cures will be permanent.

00:09:39.724 --> 00:09:43.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of the great crowd
will go through the great tribulation

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
with serious, debilitating illnesses.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:49.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our publications have said
that it seems reasonable

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:54.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expect that shortly after the destruction
of Satan’s system of things,

00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:58.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
miracles like those
that Jesus performed while on earth

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
will no doubt take place on a global scale.

00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:06.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will allow all survivors
of the great tribulation

00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:09.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a satisfying share

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:13.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
in transforming this earth
into a beautiful paradise.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you think and how would you feel
if I showed up to give this talk

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had done nothing to prepare
what to say to you

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:10.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if I had not bothered
to study the outline I was given,

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not remember the theme,
had no idea what the main points are,

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:17.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would have to guess
at what scriptures to use to support them,

00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:20.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then, as I spoke,
I would ramble incoherently?

00:00:20.584 --> 00:00:22.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d make a very bad impression.

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know how I would feel.

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:26.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be a nervous wreck,

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you would wonder why
I did not think enough of you

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put all the time and effort
that was necessary

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
into preparing the talk so that you could get
the most benefit from it.

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:39.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see where I’m going with this?

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could the same things be said

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:46.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you engaged in the ministry
without first preparing what to say?

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:49.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did not review the sample
conversations that had been provided,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not think of how
to start a conversation,

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:55.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and did not know
what scripture to share,

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
how nervous would you be?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what would the householder
think of you?

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:03.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would likely be a very short,
uncomfortable conversation.

00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:07.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the other person may not care
to have you call again.

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:12.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should take some time
to prepare well before we preach.

00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:14.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:17.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we have the best message ever

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:19.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“the good news of peace” 
to share with people—

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we should do our best so that they
will want to listen to what we have to say.

00:01:25.863 --> 00:01:29.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus helped his disciples
to prepare for the ministry.

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:34.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke chapter 10 reports that before
sending out 70 disciples to preach,

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:38.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
he shared with them a pleasant way
to greet each householder,

00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:41.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told them what to talk about
(the Kingdom of God),

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:45.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he told them how to respond
to the varied reactions

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would get in their territory.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:50.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
because the disciples

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
were fully prepared for the ministry,

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoyed some thrilling experiences.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are prepared,

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:03.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are more poised and enthusiastic
and can truly enjoy the ministry.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:10.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the good results of preparing well.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d made some good changes,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we weren’t done.

00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:31.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Yuri what she planned to talk about.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
That started the usual scramble.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we got it—the sample conversation.

00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’ll do.

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:51.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for that to work,
I had to remember the scripture.

00:03:09.682 --> 00:03:13.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were both a little forgetful that morning.

00:03:13.103 --> 00:03:16.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we needed to prepare better.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d been relying on our experience

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not enough on Jehovah.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first we prepared our hearts.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we prepared our minds

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found new ways
to use our preaching tools.

00:03:51.477 --> 00:03:55.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even a little preparation for initial calls

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our returns visits

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:01.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
went a long way.

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:20.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
The husband said,
“Yeah, we needed to prepare better.”

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:23.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought that
about your ministry?

00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:25.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the couple in the video,

00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:29.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can first prepare
our heart and our mind

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then see how best to use
our preaching tools.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:36.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal should be the same
as that of the apostle Paul.

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:40.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 9:23,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wrote that he wanted

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “do all things for the sake
of the good news,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to share it with others.”

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:54.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about some specific things
that we can do to prepare well,

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning with what we can say
on the initial call,

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:03.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether that is done
in person or over the telephone.

00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:07.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each issue of the
<i>Christian Life and Ministry—Meeting Workbook</i>

00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:11.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides us with sample conversations
that give us some helpful ideas.

00:05:11.438 --> 00:05:16.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, you may modify the samples
or use something entirely different.

00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:18.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps a subject from a previous month

00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:23.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a different scripture would have
wider appeal in your territory.

00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:28.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your opening words may be
the most important part of the presentation,

00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
so think it through.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:33.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the introduction
does not arouse interest,

00:05:33.462 --> 00:05:36.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
the other person may terminate
the conversation

00:05:36.298 --> 00:05:38.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we can give a witness.

00:05:38.676 --> 00:05:42.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will be more effective if we
carefully prepare

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first sentence or two that we will say
after giving a customary greeting.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might say,
“Many people are concerned about . . . ”

00:05:52.274 --> 00:05:56.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “I would like
to get your opinion on . . . ”

00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:58.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
or say something else.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then pick a topic that is of local interest

00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:04.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask a well-worded viewpoint question

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:07.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would draw the person
into the conversation.

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:13.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about preparing
for our return visits?

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
That actually begins
on the initial call by leaving a question

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:21.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the person to think about
until you call again.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how the sample initial calls
and return visits

00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:27.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
are set up in the <i>Meeting Workbook</i>.

00:06:27.103 --> 00:06:31.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
By leaving a thought-provoking question
at the end of every visit,

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:36.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can keep the chain of conversations
going as long as possible.

00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:39.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can illustrate it this way:

00:06:39.616 --> 00:06:42.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a freight train
with an engine at the front,

00:06:42.453 --> 00:06:46.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
a caboose at the rear,
and many cars in between.

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:51.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
What keeps all of those cars
moving together down the train track?

00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:55.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a device called a coupler
at the back of each train car

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
that latches onto the coupler
at the front of the car behind it.

00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:02.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
By being coupled, or linked, together,

00:07:02.516 --> 00:07:07.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
the cars all run as a unit along the track.

00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:12.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question that we leave
with a householder at the end of one visit

00:07:12.235 --> 00:07:16.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what we can latch onto at the beginning
of our next visit

00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:21.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can keep the train of thought
going from one conversation to the next.

00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:26.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, on the initial call
you could ask,

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:30.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why is there so much suffering
in the world?”

00:07:30.212 --> 00:07:33.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
After discussing that, raise the question,

00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How does God feel about our suffering?”

00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:40.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t answer the question
until your next visit.

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:44.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
After answering that question
on the first return visit,

00:07:44.477 --> 00:07:49.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
leave the person with this question,
“What will God do to end our suffering?”

00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:53.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will be discussed on your next visit.

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:58.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is also important to have an objective
in mind for each return visit.

00:07:59.535 --> 00:08:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before making the call,

00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:04.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what you want to accomplish
on that call.

00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:06.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you raised a question the last time,

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:11.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re objective will surely include
answering that question from the Bible.

00:08:12.257 --> 00:08:14.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
the ultimate objective is to try to start

00:08:14.885 --> 00:08:18.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Bible study
in the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  brochure.

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:25.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what about preparing
for the Bible studies that we conduct?

00:08:25.647 --> 00:08:27.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we know the material very well,

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:32.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should prepare for each study session
with our student in mind.

00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:36.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means thinking about and anticipating

00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
the views and needs of that individual.

00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:44.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
What points might he struggle
to understand or accept?

00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:47.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also means getting familiar
with the lesson

00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:50.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be covered
in our interactive Bible course.

00:08:50.548 --> 00:08:52.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read the lesson carefully,

00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:56.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
look up the “read” scriptures
to see how they apply,

00:08:56.138 --> 00:08:59.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
watch the videos that will be shown
during the lesson,

00:08:59.642 --> 00:09:02.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and review the items
in the “Explore” section

00:09:02.895 --> 00:09:07.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you will know which of those
will be especially helpful to your student.

00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:12.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will be well-prepared
to conduct the study.

00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:17.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since it is ‘God who makes
the seed of truth grow’ in a person’s heart,

00:09:17.744 --> 00:09:22.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should ask for Jehovah’s blessing
on our preparation for the study

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:25.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can best help
the student spiritually.

00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:29.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will be more effective
in our ministry

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we stay up-to-date
with the latest material

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:36.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and features found
on jw.org and on <i>JW Library®.</i>

00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
So learn how to navigate the website
and the app.

00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:43.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two very helpful features on the website

00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:48.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
are “Bible Questions Answered”
under the Bible Teachings tab

00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:53.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Frequently Asked Questions”
under the About Us tab.

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:57.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can also be found
on the app under “Article Series.”

The apostle Paul described himself
at 1 Corinthians 3:10

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:05.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a skilled master builder.”

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:07.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is because he was engaging

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a spiritual construction work
to build Christian disciples.

00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:17.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are doing the same sort of work
when we engage in the ministry.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:22.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to build effectively,
we must learn to use our tools well.

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:27.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
We especially need to develop skill
in using our principal tool, God’s Word,

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:30.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as learn how to make effective use
of the publications

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our Teaching Toolbox.

00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:37.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
A builder who prepares
before starting to work

00:10:37.622 --> 00:10:40.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
avoids mistakes and frustration.

00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:44.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what the brother said
at the end of the video?

00:10:44.004 --> 00:10:48.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Even a little preparation goes a long way.’

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is what will help you
to do your best in the ministry.

00:10:52.888 --> 00:10:57.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Paul recommended
at 2 Timothy 2:15

00:10:57.727 --> 00:11:00.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
—please follow along in your Bible,
if you will—

00:11:00.938 --> 00:11:05.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s 2 Timothy 2:15:

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:10.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do your utmost to present
yourself approved to God,

00:11:10.657 --> 00:11:13.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,

00:11:13.577 --> 00:11:17.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
handling the word of the truth aright.”

00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:21.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will experience great joy
in the spiritual building work

00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:25.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is taking place now
because you will be ready

00:11:25.256 --> 00:11:29.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and well-prepared to share
“the good news of peace.”

00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:33.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Anthony Morris,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present the next talk
of the symposium,

00:11:36.477 --> 00:11:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be Ready to Share ‘the Good News of Peace’
—Take the Initiative.”

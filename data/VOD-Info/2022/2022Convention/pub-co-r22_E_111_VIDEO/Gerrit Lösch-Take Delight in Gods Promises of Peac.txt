00:00:01 How wonderful and impressive
00:00:04 to realize that Jehovah promises
00:00:07 to raise people from the dead and to end death permanently!
00:00:13 I invite you to read with me that comforting promise
00:00:17 found in Isaiah chapter 25.
00:00:21 Regarding our God, Jehovah,
00:00:24 Isaiah 25:7, 8 says:
00:00:28 “He will do away with the shroud
00:00:30 “that is enveloping all the peoples
00:00:33 “and the covering that is woven
00:00:36 “over all the nations.
00:00:37 “He will swallow up death forever,
00:00:40 “and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
00:00:42 will wipe away the tears from all faces.”
00:00:47 The Watchtower of September 15, 2014,
00:00:52 page 25, said:
00:00:55 “Fittingly, the Bible refers to inherited sin and death
00:01:00 “as ‘the shroud that is enveloping all the peoples
00:01:05 “and the covering that is woven over all the nations.’
00:01:10 “This suffocating covering, or shroud,
00:01:14 “this intricate webwork of condemnation,
00:01:18 entraps all people.”
00:01:21 But how do we know that Jehovah can resurrect the dead?
00:01:26 Because he already brought his people back to life figuratively in the past.
00:01:33 In 537 before our Common Era, Jehovah, in effect,
00:01:38 raised the nation of Israel from the dead,
00:01:41 restoring the people who were held captive
00:01:44 in Babylon for 70 years to their homeland
00:01:48 and reestablishing pure worship.
00:01:53 In 1919, Jehovah freed his modern-day people
00:01:57 from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion,
00:02:02 revitalizing them for renewed activity.
00:02:07 Isaiah 26:19 prophesied this:
00:02:11 “Your dead will live.
00:02:14 “My corpses will rise up.
00:02:17 “Awake and shout joyfully,
00:02:20 “you residents in the dust!
00:02:22 “For your dew is as the dew
00:02:24 “of the morning, and the earth will let those
00:02:28 powerless in death come to life.”
00:02:31 When were God’s people held captive by Babylon the Great?
00:02:35 That spiritual captivity lasted from the second century
00:02:39 of our Common Era to 1919,
00:02:43 when anointed Christians were gathered
00:02:46 into the restored congregation.
00:02:49 God’s people were tested and refined
00:02:52 during the years following the establishment
00:02:55 of God’s Kingdom in the heavens in 1914.
00:02:59 Then, in 1919, Jesus appointed
00:03:04 “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:03:06 over God’s cleansed people to give them spiritual
00:03:10 “food at the proper time.”
00:03:12 This was the year that God’s people started to return
00:03:16 to their God-given spiritual estate.
00:03:20 It was also the time when they
00:03:22 were released from symbolic captivity to Babylon the Great.
00:03:27 How happy we can be, though,
00:03:30 that after God’s people experienced centuries of spiritual oppression,
00:03:35 we as God’s people not only experience a spiritual restoration
00:03:39 and a spiritual paradise but also will see the fulfillment
00:03:43 of Isaiah 25:8
00:03:46 when God “[swallows] up death forever”!
00:03:50 Yes, Jehovah will end death forever.
00:03:55 What a thrilling promise of peace!
00:03:59 Who of us have not lost a loved one to some disease,
00:04:03 perhaps even from COVID-19
00:04:06 or an accident or a disaster?
00:04:09 God here promises that death will be no more,
00:04:13 which suggests that the children who
00:04:16 might be born then will not have to face
00:04:18 the prospect of growing up and then getting old, ending in death.
00:04:24 In addition to Isaiah’s prophecy,
00:04:27 Revelation 21:4 clearly states a similar thought.
00:04:32 There we read that “death will be no more.”
00:04:37 As you watch the following video,
00:04:40 think about what Jehovah has already done
00:04:43 to show his love for us and what he will do for us in the future.
00:04:51 Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.
00:04:55 He restored that ruined nation
00:04:59 as if bringing it back to life.
00:05:06 In 1919,
00:05:08 Jehovah did something similar.
00:05:12 He released his modern-day people from spiritual captivity
00:05:19 and energized them to preach.
00:05:29 Just as Jehovah raised his people from figurative death,
00:05:32 so will he reverse the effects of literal death.
00:05:59 Indeed, God “will swallow up death forever.”
00:06:09 Imagine living longer than any tree
00:06:33 because “death will be no more.”
00:06:43 How we delight in the many things Jehovah gives us!
00:06:47 Today, we are privileged to be among the only group of people
00:06:52 who worship Jehovah in the elevated way that he approves,
00:06:57 as prophesied in Isaiah 2:2.
00:07:02 And think about the overwhelming joy
00:07:05 we will feel when Jehovah resurrects our loved ones!
00:07:11 Thank Jehovah for our precious resurrection hope.
00:07:16 First Thessalonians 4:13 says:
00:07:21 “Moreover, brothers,
00:07:23 “we do not want you to be ignorant
00:07:25 “about those who are sleeping in death,
00:07:27 “so that you may not sorrow
00:07:30 as the rest do who have no hope.”
00:07:34 Meditate on it to strengthen your faith and courage.
00:07:39 Why is it important for us to do so?
00:07:42 Because the threat of death is a powerful weapon.
00:07:47 Those under Satan’s control use it to force people to betray
00:07:51 their friends or to give up their convictions.
00:07:55 But that threat is powerless against us.
00:07:59 We know that if our enemies kill us,
00:08:03 Jehovah will restore us to life.
00:08:06 We are convinced that nothing
00:08:09 they can do can sever
00:08:12 our attachment to Jehovah.
00:08:15 What remarkable wisdom Jehovah has shown
00:08:19 by giving us the resurrection hope!
00:08:21 By means of it, he disarms Satan
00:08:25 of one of his most effective weapons
00:08:27 and at the same time arms us
00:08:30 with unbreakable courage.
00:08:33 Remember that death is temporary and that the life Jehovah
00:08:38 offers each of us will last forever.
00:08:44 In this symposium,
00:08:46 we have learned how Jehovah fulfilled his promises in the past,
00:08:51 how he is fulfilling them today,
00:08:54 and how he will fulfill them in the future.
00:08:57 As we have seen, God’s promises of peace include:
00:09:02 (1) nutritious spiritual and physical food for all,
00:09:08 (2) adequate housing and satisfying work,
00:09:14 (3) freedom from the risk of violence,
00:09:20 (4) perfect physical health,
00:09:24 and (5) the elimination of death.
00:09:29 With Jehovah as our God and best Friend,
00:09:33 we will ‘delight in the abundance of peace forever.’

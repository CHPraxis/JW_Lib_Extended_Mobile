00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his Word, Jehovah has promised

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring peace to his loyal servants.

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve learned, that peace

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:13.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more than the absence of conflict.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves our overall well-being,

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
including our health and security.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:22.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s heartwarming promises

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:25.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill us with appreciation and hope.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible in the 145th Psalm,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us in verses 15 and 16:

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All eyes look hopefully to you;

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you give them their food in its season.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You open your hand and satisfy the desire

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
of every living thing.”

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:50.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium, we will consider the past,

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:53.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
present, and future fulfillment

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
of several Bible prophecies of peace

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are found in the book of Isaiah.

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises to provide an abundance

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
of both literal food and spiritual food.

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Israelites loyally served Jehovah,

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
they experienced the blessings foretold

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 49:10.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah’s servants are experiencing

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of Isaiah 65:13, 14.

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:28.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you’ll find it to say:

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore this is what
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look!

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘My servants will eat,
but you will go hungry.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! My servants will drink,

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but you will go thirsty.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! My servants will rejoice,

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but you will suffer shame.

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:55.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! My servants will shout joyfully

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because of the good condition of the heart,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but you will cry out
because of the pain of heart

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will wail
because of a broken spirit.’”

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we may at times
experience literal hunger,

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:17.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy an abundance
of satisfying spiritual food.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the future,

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will
completely eliminate literal hunger.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about the blessings we enjoy now

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ones we will enjoy in the future.

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Isaiah,

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:42.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised to feed his servants

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
physically

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritually.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah invites us to a banquet

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is spiritually nourishing.

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible-based videos and publications

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:20.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
draw us close to God

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satisfy our hunger for truth.

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:34.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
abundant, healthy food will be more

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
than a promise

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it will be a reality.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.”

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to be among Jehovah’s people!

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spiritual provisions flow to us

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
like an ever-broadening
and ever-deepening river.

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:34.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s not a grain of salt missing

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:38.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor a slice of bread
nor a pat of butter missing.

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:44.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is way too much to eat at one meal.

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:48.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to come
to Jehovah’s table several times a week

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep our spiritual fiber intact

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
and energy strong

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:56.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the work we engage in

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:59.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Kingdom preaching.

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:03.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have an abundance of nourishing food

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Bible-based publications,

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:10.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
recordings and videos,

00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:12.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
meetings and conventions,

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
website material.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has not deviated from his promise.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note this one, Psalm 72:16:

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be an abundance
of grain on the earth;

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the top of the mountains
it will overflow.

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:36.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in the cities people will blossom

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the vegetation of the earth.”

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:47.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then again, Isaiah 30:23:

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will give the rain

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the seed you sow in the ground,

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:57.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the bread that the ground produces

00:05:57.586 --> 00:06:00.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be abundant and rich.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In that day your livestock will graze

00:06:04.593 --> 00:06:07.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spacious pastures.”

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has placed
everything we need on the table.

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:16.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must willfully come to the table

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sit down and eat.

00:06:19.858 --> 00:06:22.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t make us come

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:25.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
like some mothers may have
to demand a reluctant child

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:30.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to the house
from playing and eat a meal.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:36.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be sure to thank Jehovah
for the spiritual food he provides.

00:06:37.918 --> 00:06:41.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 100:2, 3 reminds us:

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:45.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Come into his presence with joyful shouting.

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:55.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Know that Jehovah is God.

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:59.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is the one who made us,
and we belong to him.

00:06:59.648 --> 00:07:03.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are his people
and the sheep of his pasture.”

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show your appreciation.

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:08.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
By studying diligently
and applying what you learn.

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:17.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you lack sufficient material things now,

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:22.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
take delight in meditating
on future Kingdom blessings.

00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:25.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will surely fulfill his promises,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he has always done.

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:31.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 55:10, 11 reminds us:

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For just as the rain and the snow

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:38.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pour down from heaven

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:40.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not return there

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:43.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until they saturate the earth,

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:46.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making it produce and sprout,

00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:51.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“giving seed to the sower
and bread to the eater,

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so my word that goes out
of my mouth will be.

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:59.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not return to me without results,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but it will certainly accomplish

00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:05.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whatever is my delight,

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:08.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it will have sure success

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:10.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what I send it to do.”

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:15.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:19.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:23.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take Delight in God’s Promises of Peace

00:08:23.857 --> 00:08:28.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They Will Build Houses and . . .
Plant Vineyards.’”

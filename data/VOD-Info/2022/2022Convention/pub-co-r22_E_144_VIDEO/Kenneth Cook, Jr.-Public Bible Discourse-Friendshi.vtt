00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it realistic to believe
that you can be a friend of God?

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:08.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
If until now you’ve answered no
to that question,

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
please consider this:

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lives of millions of people today

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
prove that friendship with God is possible.

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:21.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their lives prove that we can find
a peaceful and meaningful life now,

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as hope
for an everlasting and peaceful future.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you desire that for yourself and others,

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
we urge you
to listen to this Scriptural talk.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
We emphasize the need to listen

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:39.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
because many people ignore
that important question,

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, Can you be a friend of God?

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it that many put
such an important question out of their mind?

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are a number of reasons.

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, some believe
that God is impersonal or unknowable

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that he does not exist
and that he’s not interested in humans.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are taught that God is a mystery

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he’s cruel, harsh, and demanding.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many religious leaders claim
that God will punish bad people forever

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a place of torment.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel drawn into friendship
with a God like that?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who in their right mind would?

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still other people, after seeing

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the injustice and suffering
in the world,

00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
have concluded that God must be dead

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that he never existed at all.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then there are those who believe

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they have done
too many bad things in their life

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ever be a friend of God.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do any of those causes for doubt or concern
apply to you?

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, please listen carefully
to the following four key points

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may help you to see
that friendship with God is truly possible.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will then develop each one.

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:58.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll look at how sin
separates us from God.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:03.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we’ll look at how God
has taken the initiative to heal the breach

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:08.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring obedient humans
back into friendship with him.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:11.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, we’ll examine what we can do

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become God’s friend in an everlasting way.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, we will consider
how friendship with God

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings peace now and in the future.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for our first point:

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it that separates us from God?

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:31.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a word, sin.

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does sin separate us?

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the true God is holy, he’s pure,

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:40.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his conduct is perfect.

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not have a trace of sin;
he’s clean in the highest sense.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
No human can be holy to that degree,

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even close.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate: Consider the words
“human” and “imperfect.”

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:56.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
They go together, don’t they?

00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:00.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot fully describe humans
without mentioning imperfection.

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just a part of us,

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:07.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and human history shows this
to be sadly and painfully true.

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then our sins or imperfections

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
create a barrier between us and God.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
This separation is described

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:20.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Isaiah 59:2,

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we are told in part:

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:27.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your own errors have separated you
from your God.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:32.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your sins have made him
hide his face from you.”

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:35.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Separated from God,’ it says.

00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:38.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were born into this state,

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
but God did not create us to be sinful.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:44.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sins are not his fault.

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first humans, Adam and Eve,
were created perfect.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they proved to be ungrateful and selfish,

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they rejected God’s friendship.

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:59.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
They destroyed their peace with God
by sinning against him,

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:01.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they became his enemies.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam then passed sin on

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his descendants, as well as death.

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:09.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read about this terrible inheritance

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Romans 5:12.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:17.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this verse, the apostle Paul summarizes

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
why our inherited sinful condition
leads to death.

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote:
“That is why, just as through one man

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:29.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sin entered into the world
and death through sin,

00:04:29.748 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and so death spread to all men

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:40.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death spread to all men.”

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
This pandemic of sin

00:04:42.344 --> 00:04:45.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a 100 percent infection rate

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a 100 percent mortality rate.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
No human can escape it.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:53.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Paul said: “Death spread . . .

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:04:56.483 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
On our own,
we cannot correct our sinful state.

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:03.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as if we have fallen into a deep pit

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
with seemingly no way out.

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But are we left without hope?

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:08.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, although God views some people
as his enemies,

00:05:12.207 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
he treats others as his friends.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, regarding the man Abraham,

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:22.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible book of James
says in chapter 2 and verse 23

00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:25.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and it was counted to him as righteousness,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he came to be called Jehovah’s friend.”

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:37.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham was as imperfect as we are,

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:40.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he came to be called God’s friend.

00:05:40.068 --> 00:05:43.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has God done
to make it possible for humans

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:46.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain his favor and blessing?

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:50.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply put, our Creator
has taken the initiative.

00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has taken steps to heal the breach
that was caused by sin

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to eliminate the separation
between us and him.

00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:01.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has he done this?

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the Holy Scriptures tell us

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:08.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God desires for us to come to know him
and to be at peace with him.

00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:12.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he appeals to us to do this.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible book of Acts 17:27,

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are told that God wants us
to sincerely seek him

00:06:20.484 --> 00:06:22.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that if we do,

00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:27.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will find that “he is not far off
from each one of us.”

00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:29.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, and very important,

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:32.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
God took the initiative to make this possible

00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:35.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
by providing the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus,

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to redeem us from sin.

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:44.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was an unparalleled act of love.

00:06:44.216 --> 00:06:48.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we now read 1 John 4:10,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
please think about what it says

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:54.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding this matchless act of love
on God’s part

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:59.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we may never forget
that God took the initiative

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:01.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
to heal the breach, so to speak.

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:03.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 4:10 says:

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:06.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The love is in this respect,

00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:08.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not that we have loved God,

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:11.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that he loved us

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:15.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice

00:07:15.163 --> 00:07:17.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our sins.”

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:19.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did God do?

00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God . . . loved us,” it says,

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:24.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and [he] sent his Son.”

00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:28.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
This sacrifice that God provided
by means of his Son

00:07:28.051 --> 00:07:32.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called “propitiatory”
because it can atone for our sins.

00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:35.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here is how it can do so:

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Jesus gave in sacrifice for us

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:40.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
was equal to what Adam lost for us,

00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:44.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, a perfect human life.

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:48.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam exchanged his perfect life for death

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
by his rebellion against God.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:55.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
As mentioned earlier, Adam then
passed sin on to his descendants,

00:07:55.954 --> 00:08:00.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he placed us on a path
outside of God’s friendship.

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:04.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
the death of Jesus allowed for a ransom,

00:08:04.546 --> 00:08:06.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a means to satisfy God’s justice

00:08:06.923 --> 00:08:10.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could receive back
what Adam lost for us.

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
That undeserved gift from God
was given at great cost.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:18.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, our Creator wants us
to come to know him

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:22.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to enjoy a beautiful friendship with him.

00:08:22.814 --> 00:08:27.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should be very grateful
that God took the necessary step

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:30.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
to close the gap
and provide a way for us

00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:33.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become his friend.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next step involves each of us.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is required of us?

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:39.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:43.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must be humble enough
to accept God’s gift.

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are humble, we’ll see
our need for God’s mercy,

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:52.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll then do our part
to show appreciation.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Acts 3:19 tells us

00:08:56.348 --> 00:09:01.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this involves
‘repenting and turning around.’

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:05.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, to receive God’s gift,
which includes his mercy,

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:08.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must adjust our thinking by repenting

00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:13.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then turn around
by adjusting our conduct and course in life

00:09:13.198 --> 00:09:15.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever necessary.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opportunity to do this
is open to all people.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our Creator,
God is not partial in his mercy

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:25.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the friendship he offers.

00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:28.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has kindly put everything in place for us.

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:31.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
All we must do is be grateful and humble

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then take the next step.

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:39.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
That step involves accepting Jesus
and his teachings.

00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:43.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
God requires that we follow
the example of his Son.

00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:46.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
How closely must we do so?

00:09:46.398 --> 00:09:50.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 14:6, Jesus explained:

00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:55.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one comes to the Father
except through me.”

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:01.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No one.”

00:10:01.246 --> 00:10:03.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, to come into God’s friendship,

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:07.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must follow his Son as true Christians.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:13.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far, we have reviewed
how sin separated humans from God.

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:18.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we considered what God has done
to heal the breach, or close the gap,

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:23.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can come back
into his favor as his friends.

00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:26.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s look even further
into what we must do,

00:10:26.062 --> 00:10:29.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
which brings us to the third key point:

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:33.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can a person become God’s friend?

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:35.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to consider what is said

00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:38.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
at James 4:8.

00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:43.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have a copy of the Bible,
we urge you to follow along

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:45.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
—James 4:8.

00:10:45.874 --> 00:10:50.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read it,
please notice first the invitation,

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:53.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the response,

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:56.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finally what we must do.

00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:58.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads:

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Draw close to God,
and he will draw close to you.

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:05.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Cleanse your hands, you sinners,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and purify your hearts, you indecisive ones.”

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, first, what is the invitation?

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:14.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is to “draw close to God.”

00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:18.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is followed
by what response on God’s part?

00:11:18.156 --> 00:11:20.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will draw close to you.”

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for God to do this, what must we do

00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:26.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show that we accept his invitation?

00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:31.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must cleanse and purify ourselves
according to his standards.

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:34.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will take effort.

00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:37.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we must learn about his standards,

00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:40.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we must come to appreciate
that they are the best for us,

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:44.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we must be determined
to follow them.

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:48.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all, we do this
because we want to please God

00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:51.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be his friend.

00:11:51.022 --> 00:11:54.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, how can you develop
a friendship with God?

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show initiative and put forth the effort.

00:11:57.654 --> 00:11:59.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this: If you have a houseplant,

00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:02.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know that it doesn’t grow on its own.

00:12:02.492 --> 00:12:04.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to water it regularly

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:07.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep it in an environment
that helps it to grow.

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:08.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
True?

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:12.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something similar is true
of our friendship with God.

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:17.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
We nurture this friendship by reading
and studying God’s Word, the Bible.

00:12:17.841 --> 00:12:20.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do so,
we learn important things about God.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we learn that God’s name is Jehovah.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as is true of any good friendship,

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:31.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s important that we use his name.

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:36.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re sincere in our efforts
to “draw close” to him,

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:38.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we read at James 4:8,

00:12:38.987 --> 00:12:42.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “draw close” to us.

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:45.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he never abandons his true friends.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:50.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, John 17:3 tells us
that coming to know God

00:12:50.707 --> 00:12:53.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
“means everlasting life” for us.

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:57.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an undeserved kindness
and priceless gift

00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:00.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s true friends!

00:13:00.675 --> 00:13:04.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that you too can enjoy
a bright future as God’s friends,

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:09.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
we warmly invite you to accept
a free interactive Bible course

00:13:09.601 --> 00:13:12.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
offered by Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:16.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the publication <i>Enjoy life Forever! </i>

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what it looks like.

00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:22.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses can help you
to get either a printed

00:13:22.864 --> 00:13:25.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an electronic copy.

00:13:25.492 --> 00:13:27.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
It begins with the lessons:

00:13:27.786 --> 00:13:30.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Can the Bible Help You?”

00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:32.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Bible Gives Hope,”

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Can You Trust the Bible?”

00:13:35.418 --> 00:13:37.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
We urge you to learn these things

00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:40.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to worship God in harmony with the truth

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:43.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is revealed in his Word.

00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:46.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what important points have we considered

00:13:46.012 --> 00:13:49.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding how a person
can become God’s friend?

00:13:49.849 --> 00:13:54.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, get to know God
by reading and studying his Word.

00:13:54.437 --> 00:13:57.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that doing this
“means everlasting life.”

00:13:57.982 --> 00:13:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then,

00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:03.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn about God’s name and use it.

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:05.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’ll list four more things

00:14:05.323 --> 00:14:09.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
that those who desire
to become God’s friends must do.

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:12.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are: imitate God’s qualities,

00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
reject thinking and actions that offend God,

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
associate with those
who want to be God’s friend,

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:22.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid friendship with people

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
who ignore or mock God’s standards.

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:29.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a few things in that list
speak for themselves—don’t they?—

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as associate with those
who want to be God’s friend

00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:36.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid friendship with people
who ignore or mock God’s standards.

00:14:36.938 --> 00:14:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes sense, doesn’t it?

00:14:38.648 --> 00:14:42.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think back to our illustration
about the houseplant.

00:14:42.402 --> 00:14:44.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
You must not only water and nurture it,

00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:47.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you must keep it
in the right environment,

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
one that helps it to grow.

00:14:49.951 --> 00:14:54.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, associating with those
who also want to be God’s friend

00:14:54.372 --> 00:14:57.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the right environment for us.

00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:01.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the requirement
to imitate God’s qualities?

00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:04.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can imperfect people do this?

00:15:04.883 --> 00:15:08.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for a few minutes,
we’ll look at just two of God’s qualities

00:15:08.428 --> 00:15:10.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can imitate him.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will begin with God’s love.

00:15:15.101 --> 00:15:19.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
An important way that we can imitate
God’s love and become his friend

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by applying what his Son, Jesus,
taught us.

00:15:22.525 --> 00:15:24.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Jesus said:

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:27.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as you want men to do to you,

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
do the same way to them”

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:35.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a simple statement
but one that takes effort to apply, true?

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:36.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we do this?

00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:37.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:40.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a person who desires to be God’s friend

00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:43.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
will put forth the effort needed to do this.

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:45.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
To succeed in imitating God’s love,

00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:49.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must try to see people
as Jehovah sees them.

00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must try to put ourselves
in the place of others

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:56.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can understand
their needs, their concerns,

00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:59.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even their pain of heart.

00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:04.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may be challenged physically
because of injury, disease, or aging.

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:06.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others are coping with emotional trials

00:16:06.653 --> 00:16:10.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of depression or anxiety.

00:16:10.156 --> 00:16:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people face difficulties
that we have not experienced.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, a young person
may find it hard

00:16:16.788 --> 00:16:19.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand older people,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he or she will really need to think
about what it must be like

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:24.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be an older person.

00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:29.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is true of you,
how can you imitate God’s love?

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:33.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
One important way is by listening carefully

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:36.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
until you understand
the other person’s feelings.

00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:40.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you do so, you are in a better position

00:16:40.061 --> 00:16:42.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
to imitate God’s love.

00:16:42.647 --> 00:16:45.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who desire to be Jehovah’s friends

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:48.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be moved to imitate his love

00:16:48.027 --> 00:16:52.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
by acting according
to what others really need.

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:55.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to a second
and related quality,

00:16:55.827 --> 00:16:57.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
that of kindness.

00:16:57.829 --> 00:17:02.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone who desires to be God’s friend
must be kind to others.

00:17:02.584 --> 00:17:07.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here again, we can learn much
from what Jesus said and did.

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:09.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Son said that the Most High

00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:13.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.”

00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:17.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus appreciated this outstanding quality
of his heavenly Father,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he imitated God’s kindness.

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Jesus to do so?

00:17:24.063 --> 00:17:26.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
He treated people in a kind manner

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
by anticipating how his words and actions

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:32.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
might affect their feelings.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the Bible tells us

00:17:34.282 --> 00:17:37.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a woman known to be a sinner
approached Jesus,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
weeping and wetting his feet with her tears.

00:17:41.998 --> 00:17:45.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus discerned that she was repentant,

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:47.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knew how heartbroken she would be

00:17:47.795 --> 00:17:50.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he just dismissed her unkindly.

00:17:50.757 --> 00:17:55.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like his heavenly Father,
Jesus looked for the good in her.

00:17:55.595 --> 00:17:58.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know this because he commended her;

00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:01.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
then he forgave her.

00:18:02.143 --> 00:18:04.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following Jesus’ example,

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:07.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can we also imitate God’s kindness?

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:12.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do so by being gentle to all people
whenever possible.

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:17.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind people discern
how to deal with delicate situations.

00:18:17.617 --> 00:18:21.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind people avoid hurting
the feelings of others.

00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:24.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do this, we try to anticipate

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:28.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
how our words and actions might affect them.

00:18:28.252 --> 00:18:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how a true friend of God
will treat others.

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:38.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this review of just a few
of Jehovah’s many outstanding qualities

00:18:38.513 --> 00:18:42.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us an idea of how much we can benefit
from reading the Bible

00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:47.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then applying its many lessons for us.

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:50.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, friendship with God is possible,

00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:54.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can imitate his outstanding qualities.

00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:56.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:18:56.823 --> 00:19:00.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
please take note of how we can use the Bible

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:02.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a friendship with God.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wanted to ask God:

00:19:16.092 --> 00:19:18.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who are you?

00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:20.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where are you?

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:22.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you care about me?”

00:19:23.766 --> 00:19:25.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:19:25.768 --> 00:19:27.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
For centuries,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
people everywhere have felt the need

00:19:30.398 --> 00:19:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know their Maker.

00:19:36.112 --> 00:19:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a woman
who has never known her father.

00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:47.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
All her life she has been told lies
that her father abandoned her.

00:19:51.627 --> 00:19:54.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
But deep inside she feels
—she knows—

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:56.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s not true.

00:19:59.552 --> 00:20:03.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,
she receives a letter from her father.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:11.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
She learns that he is alive
and that, unbeknownst to her,

00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:14.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had been reaching out
to be part of her life

00:20:14.817 --> 00:20:17.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
since the day she was born.

00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:21.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
The daughter learns who her father is,

00:20:28.581 --> 00:20:31.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually

00:20:32.752 --> 00:20:35.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
she finds him.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learn about one another

00:20:51.646 --> 00:20:54.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build a strong bond

00:20:54.273 --> 00:20:57.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they are inseparable friends.

00:20:59.695 --> 00:21:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is like a group

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:05.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
of letters from our heavenly Father.

00:21:07.787 --> 00:21:09.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the Bible,

00:21:09.997 --> 00:21:13.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn how to talk to God,

00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:16.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he responds,

00:21:17.713 --> 00:21:19.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the many ways

00:21:19.757 --> 00:21:22.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
he shows his tender care.

00:21:25.972 --> 00:21:28.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible can help us to do something

00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:30.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may never have thought possible

00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:35.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
—be God’s friend.

00:21:36.399 --> 00:21:39.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
That friendship starts by learning the name

00:21:39.443 --> 00:21:42.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your heavenly Father and new Friend,

00:21:42.113 --> 00:21:44.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
and God tells us his name:

00:21:46.242 --> 00:21:50.413 line:10% position:50% align:center
“You, whose name is Jehovah,

00:21:50.413 --> 00:21:54.083 line:10% position:50% align:center
you alone are the Most High.”

00:21:57.086 --> 00:22:00.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah guarantees that if you

00:22:00.756 --> 00:22:03.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘draw close to him,

00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:06.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will draw close to you.’

00:22:06.804 --> 00:22:10.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Father openly extends friendship

00:22:10.433 --> 00:22:12.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all who search for him.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you accept his invitation?

00:22:22.278 --> 00:22:24.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
To learn more about what the Bible says

00:22:24.739 --> 00:22:28.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this and many other topics,

00:22:28.326 --> 00:22:30.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to jw.org.

00:22:34.832 --> 00:22:38.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
As that thought-provoking video asked,

00:22:38.252 --> 00:22:42.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you see the need
to come to know your Creator?

00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:45.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you willing to put forth
the effort needed

00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept his invitation
and become his friend?

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:54.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, the Bible contains
the guidance that you need,

00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:57.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reward for applying what it says

00:22:57.563 --> 00:23:00.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not reserved for the future only.

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:05.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friendship with God brings peace now.

00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:09.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can have a more peaceful
and meaningful life right now

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
by becoming Jehovah’s friend.

00:23:12.286 --> 00:23:15.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you become a friend of God,
he will listen to your prayers

00:23:15.873 --> 00:23:18.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
and extend his mercy to you.

00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you sense his forgiveness,

00:23:20.503 --> 00:23:23.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will experience deep-seated joy.

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:26.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 32:1, 2 says in part:

00:23:26.717 --> 00:23:30.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy is the one
whose transgression is pardoned,

00:23:30.054 --> 00:23:31.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whose sin is covered.

00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:36.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Happy is the man
whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt.”

00:23:37.436 --> 00:23:42.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to sense Jehovah’s forgiveness!

00:23:42.316 --> 00:23:45.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s forgiveness can free you
from the burden of guilt

00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:49.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you may feel because of past wrongs.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes wrongs
that you may have committed

00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:55.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
before you came to know God
and became his friend.

00:23:55.204 --> 00:23:57.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is such a thing possible for you?

00:23:57.373 --> 00:23:59.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is.

00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:03.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
As our video pointed out,
the Bible teaches us how to pray to God

00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:07.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how God responds to our prayers.

00:24:07.133 --> 00:24:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can be assured
that he will listen to your prayers,

00:24:10.886 --> 00:24:15.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
including your prayers
for his forgiveness and his help.

00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:17.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Proverbs 15:29 we read

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
“hears the prayer of the righteous.”

00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who are the righteous?

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:28.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
The righteous are those who strive
to live by his requirements.

00:24:28.112 --> 00:24:31.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a comfort for us to know
that we can be God’s friend,

00:24:31.824 --> 00:24:34.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he sees what we are trying to do

00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:37.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he listens to us!

00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:39.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is more.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our friendship with God can also result
in peace with other people.

00:24:43.794 --> 00:24:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Jesus urged us
to seek such peace with others.

00:24:48.424 --> 00:24:51.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that we should ‘love even our enemies

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do good to others
without hoping for anything back.’

00:24:55.348 --> 00:24:58.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we read at Luke 6:36 that he added:

00:24:58.642 --> 00:25:00.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue being merciful,

00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:04.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as your Father is merciful.”

00:25:05.232 --> 00:25:08.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such a good example
can touch the hearts of others

00:25:08.569 --> 00:25:13.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move them
to become Jehovah’s friends as well.

00:25:13.449 --> 00:25:16.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the experience of José,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:21.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
who learned how to love
from true friends of God.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the age of 13, José was involved
in guerrilla warfare.

00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:29.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was taught to hate the people
who were allegedly responsible

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the injustices
that he saw all around him.

00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:36.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
His aim was to eliminate those people.

00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:39.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw many of his companions fall in death,

00:25:39.892 --> 00:25:43.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and José became filled
with feelings of bitterness

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and revenge.

00:25:45.272 --> 00:25:48.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
While making grenades or bombs,
he would ask himself:

00:25:48.943 --> 00:25:51.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why is there so much suffering?

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there is a God, does he even notice?’

00:25:54.323 --> 00:25:56.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times, José wept.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was depressed and confused.

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:02.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, José came in contact

00:26:02.123 --> 00:26:05.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a local congregation
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:26:05.584 --> 00:26:08.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
At his first congregation meeting,

00:26:08.003 --> 00:26:10.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
he noticed the loving atmosphere there.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone greeted him
in a warm and friendly manner.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, a discussion on the subject

00:26:17.388 --> 00:26:20.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why Does God Permit Wickedness?”

00:26:20.057 --> 00:26:24.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided answers to the very questions
that he had been asking.

00:26:24.603 --> 00:26:27.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he learned more from the Bible,
José made changes

00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:30.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his way of life and in his thinking.

00:26:30.443 --> 00:26:32.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learned to imitate God’s love

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thereby become his friend.

00:26:35.531 --> 00:26:39.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Breaking his ties with his companions,
though, proved to be challenging.

00:26:39.743 --> 00:26:42.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time he went
to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:26:42.955 --> 00:26:44.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was followed.

00:26:44.957 --> 00:26:48.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some former associates
even attended a few meetings

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
so as to understand what brought about
such a great change in José.

00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:56.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
But once they were satisfied
that he was not a danger to them,

00:26:56.302 --> 00:26:58.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
they left him alone.

00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:02.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
At age 17, José was baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:27:02.975 --> 00:27:04.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
As God’s friend,

00:27:04.977 --> 00:27:08.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
José soon started sharing
what he was learning full-time.

00:27:08.981 --> 00:27:11.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of scheming to kill people,

00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:15.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could now share a message
of love and of hope with them.

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:18.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great reward for choosing

00:27:18.657 --> 00:27:21.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become Jehovah’s friend!

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, even those who were once enemies

00:27:23.662 --> 00:27:26.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
can learn to be at peace with one another

00:27:26.457 --> 00:27:29.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be God’s friends.

00:27:29.251 --> 00:27:31.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned?

00:27:31.253 --> 00:27:33.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have reviewed why friendship with God

00:27:33.547 --> 00:27:36.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
is realistic and possible for us.

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:40.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible tells us that since ancient times,

00:27:40.095 --> 00:27:43.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has called some humans his friends.

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:45.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also looked at what God has done

00:27:45.518 --> 00:27:49.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to heal the breach, or close the gap,
between us and him.

00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:51.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has he done so?

00:27:51.398 --> 00:27:54.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of his Son.

00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Jesus, Jehovah God provided
the ransom sacrifice

00:27:58.572 --> 00:28:02.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was needed to redeem us from sin.

00:28:02.034 --> 00:28:04.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, we looked at what you must do
to take advantage

00:28:04.787 --> 00:28:07.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s mercy and become his friend.

00:28:07.373 --> 00:28:10.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes studying his Word, the Bible,

00:28:10.543 --> 00:28:14.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then imitating his outstanding qualities.

00:28:14.588 --> 00:28:16.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, we considered

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:19.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
how you can find a meaningful life now,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as true peace with others.

00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:26.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises that his friends

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:29.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
will receive eternal life in peace.

00:28:29.603 --> 00:28:33.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is what you yearn for,

00:28:33.065 --> 00:28:35.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
then please accept our invitation

00:28:35.526 --> 00:28:39.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:43.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, you will learn
about an unending future

00:28:43.784 --> 00:28:46.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
when anguish of heart is gone forever,

00:28:46.912 --> 00:28:49.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
an unending future

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:52.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which God will permanently
wipe away tears

00:28:52.209 --> 00:28:54.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the faces of his friends.

00:28:54.837 --> 00:28:58.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
That future is not only possible,

00:28:58.299 --> 00:29:02.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is the future that God promises!

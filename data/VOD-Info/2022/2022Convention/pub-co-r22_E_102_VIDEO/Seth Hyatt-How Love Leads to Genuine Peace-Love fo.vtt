00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:03.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a connection, a relationship,

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
between love and peace?

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if so, what role does love play

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
in achieving genuine peace?

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible helps us to appreciate

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:25.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
that love is an essential element

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
in achieving genuine peace.

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re interested in showing love.

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
As students of the Bible, we know

00:00:37.016 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans were created
in the image of God.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result,
you and I have the ability to show love.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also know that we live in a world

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has a very distorted view

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
and definition of love.

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
That, combined with our own imperfection,

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
means that if we’re not careful,

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:02.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
our view of love can become distorted.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we guard against that?

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:12.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
By allowing Jehovah to teach us how to love.

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you think about it,
what better teacher could we have?

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that “God is love.”

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that Jehovah, our Creator

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
—who knows us better than we know ourselves,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
who embodies, who personifies love—

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
is willing to teach us how to love.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how does he do that?

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:42.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by means of his Word, the Bible,

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by means of his own beautiful example.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we get acquainted with Jehovah,

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learn what love really is.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we put that love to work,

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus did,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we’re in a position

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy genuine peace.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this symposium,

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to explore how love for God,

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
love of neighbor,

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love for God’s Word, the Bible,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to genuine peace.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s talk about love for God.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
How important is that

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we want to enjoy genuine peace?

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus provides some insight
in a statement he made

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:37.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s recorded in our Bibles
at Matthew chapter 22.

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at it.

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 22,

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verse 37.

00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to provide some context for these words,

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus has been asked a question by a man

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is well-versed in the Law.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[What] is the greatest commandment
in the Law?”

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:03.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Jesus responds:

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to him:

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must love Jehovah your God

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘with your whole heart

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and with your whole soul

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with your whole mind.’

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the greatest and first commandment.”

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God”
—a command.

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:30.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for Jehovah is essential.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be
the most important relationship in our life.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
More important than any human,

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:40.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
more important than any thing

00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:43.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we want to love Jehovah.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:45.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
To what extent?

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus says: “with your whole heart.”

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that involve?

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
The context of Jesus’ words

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to understand that he was talking
about a person’s feelings,

00:03:59.718 --> 00:04:02.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotions, desires.

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:07.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
So does love for God involve our emotions?

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it has to involve more
than a simple affection for God.

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:19.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Jesus say next?

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:21.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With your whole soul,”

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:24.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, with your entire being.

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
We use everything we have

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:29.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
to praise Jehovah

00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:32.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prove our love for him.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even more is involved.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus concludes by saying:

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:41.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your whole mind.”

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:45.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our intellectual faculties are involved.

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:47.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re willing to take the time

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to know Jehovah’s thinking

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:53.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make it our thinking.

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to think the way Jehovah thinks.

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to understand his purpose

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:03.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his requirements for us,

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to understand his personality.

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we think about that kind of love,

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s clear that it encompasses

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:20.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
our thoughts, our words, and our actions.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:24.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing is left out.

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that kind of love

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:31.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides a basis for a friendship with God.

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that results in peace with God.

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:40.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there we see the progression.

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:43.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loving Jehovah with our whole heart,

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:46.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
soul, and mind

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:50.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
leads to peace with God.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:53.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we enjoy peace with God,

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:55.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can also enjoy inner peace

00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and peace with those around us.

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:02.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does that work?

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our love for Jehovah
motivates us to imitate him,

00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:10.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we cultivate the qualities

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah displays,

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
for example: patience,

00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:19.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
kindness, mildness

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:23.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
—qualities that make us attractive to others,

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:27.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
and qualities that promote peace with others.

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:31.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you would agree

00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:35.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we want to be at peace with God.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:41.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes our peace can be threatened.

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:44.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may experience pressure.

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may be the subject of some wrong,

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:52.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
some injustice, some evil

00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:56.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
that threatens our peace.

00:06:56.812 --> 00:06:59.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the question is this:

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:02.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we handle things in a way

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is pleasing to Jehovah

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:07.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
or will we become impatient

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
or try to take matters into our own hands?

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:13.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:18.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how a family draws strength
from a Bible account

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:22.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
that highlights love and respect

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:24.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:45.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia!

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:48.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia!

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:50.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurry, you’re going to be late for school!

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:57.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, Mom. I’m going to preach.

00:07:57.914 --> 00:07:58.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you.

00:07:59.124 --> 00:07:59.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love you.

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:01.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye, Mom. Love you.

00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:02.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have a good day.

00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:07.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, Mom.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:08:17.684 --> 00:08:19.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would never; she’s an angel.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all a front.

00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:22.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, she totally just saw us.

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:27.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. I’m totally posting that.

00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:29.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it.

00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:30.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. It’s up.

00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:32.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone . . .

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:33.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you just get that?

00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:33.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at that.

00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:35.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone . . .

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the craziest.

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:37.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:46.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:48.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:50.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:52.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:55.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all an act.

00:08:55.889 --> 00:08:57.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:08:57.766 --> 00:08:58.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, she saw us.

00:08:58.767 --> 00:08:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
She saw us.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t believe it.

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to comment?

00:09:02.104 --> 00:09:02.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:06.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t even think she likes guys.

00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:07.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she’s into girls?

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:09.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true. Yeah.

00:09:09.736 --> 00:09:10.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Comments!

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:12.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody is getting it.

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:14.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bet she’s still a virgin.

00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:29.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, can I see that?

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:31.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:09:32.717 --> 00:09:34.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:36.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:38.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how are you going to do that?

00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:40.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a very good question, actually.

00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:40.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, God promises . . .

00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:42.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no, not God, you!

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:43.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:09:44.688 --> 00:09:46.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me? Well, I try to help others . . .

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:48.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try?

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:49.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man, all you do
is stand next to your little cart

00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:52.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the rest of us
stand up for your rights, bro.

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:54.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m actually neutral when it . . .

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:55.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neutral?

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ain’t no neutral. You’re just a coward.

00:09:59.286 --> 00:10:01.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your trash.

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:18.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did it go?

00:10:18.054 --> 00:10:21.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a tough day at the cart, but I’m OK.

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:35.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:10:35.614 --> 00:10:37.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:39.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:10:39.826 --> 00:10:41.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:42.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia,

00:10:43.747 --> 00:10:45.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
what’s wrong?

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:53.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone, Brooke here.

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:54.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Amanda.

00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:57.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess who just walked in?

00:10:57.636 --> 00:10:59.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Olivia.

00:10:59.554 --> 00:11:01.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s Jake.

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s poll: Would she ever?

00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:05.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, she would never; she’s an angel.

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:06.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it’s all an act.

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:09.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know she’s wild.

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:11.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, she saw us.

00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:17.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry that happened to you.

00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:34.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reminds me of a situation Paul was in.

00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:43.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think it was at Acts chapter 16

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:48.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 23:

00:11:51.398 --> 00:11:54.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After they had inflicted many blows on them,

00:11:56.653 --> 00:11:58.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they threw them into prison

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:04.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and ordered the jailer
to guard them securely.

00:12:06.746 --> 00:12:09.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because he got such an order, he threw them

00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:11.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into the inner prison

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:14.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and fastened their feet in the stocks.

00:12:16.172 --> 00:12:18.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But about the middle of the night,

00:12:18.675 --> 00:12:20.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul and Silas were praying

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and praising God with song,

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prisoners were listening to them.”

00:12:28.727 --> 00:12:30.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think made them want to sing?

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:36.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
They loved Jehovah.

00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:39.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when they focused on that,
how do you think they felt?

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think

00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:51.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
they felt some peace.

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:55.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about we dig a little bit deeper?

00:12:56.546 --> 00:12:57.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:57.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did you notice?

00:13:06.514 --> 00:13:10.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gabe and Olivia are under pressure

00:13:10.518 --> 00:13:15.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Olivia in the classroom,
Gabe at the witnessing cart.

00:13:16.524 --> 00:13:19.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will they handle the pressure

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:24.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that preserves
their peace with Jehovah?

00:13:25.158 --> 00:13:27.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s a good question.

00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:30.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
And really, all of us

00:13:30.622 --> 00:13:33.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to reflect on that question

00:13:33.416 --> 00:13:36.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’re under pressure.

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:39.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah’s way is the best way.

00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:43.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re convinced that his way of ruling
is the best way.

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:48.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we’re subjected to pressure,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps the victim of some injustice

00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:55.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even of some evil,

00:13:57.524 --> 00:14:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may be inclined
to take matters into our own hands.

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:06.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do,

00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:10.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can jeopardize our peace.

00:14:11.663 --> 00:14:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do we demonstrate respect

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s sovereignty?

00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:22.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
The inspired advice
in Romans chapter 12 can help.

00:14:22.757 --> 00:14:26.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look together at Romans chapter 12,

00:14:26.094 --> 00:14:28.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning in verse 17:

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return evil for evil to no one.”

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:40.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this provides the context
for what follows.

00:14:40.442 --> 00:14:43.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may suffer some evil.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Return evil for evil to no one.

00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:51.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take into consideration what is fine
from the viewpoint of all men.”

00:14:51.703 --> 00:14:54.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then notice verse 18:

00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:57.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If possible, as far as it depends

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:59.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on you,

00:14:59.753 --> 00:15:04.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
be peaceable (be a peacemaker)
with all men.”

00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:08.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these words

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:11.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
really heighten our appreciation

00:15:11.765 --> 00:15:15.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s reasonableness.

00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:18.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:20.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah doesn’t ask us

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:24.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something that we can’t do.

00:15:24.068 --> 00:15:27.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t ask us to control others.

00:15:27.864 --> 00:15:29.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
No,

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:35.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the extent “it depends on you.”

00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:38.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah asks that each of us

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:41.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
control ourselves,

00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:46.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
our response to a situation,

00:15:46.049 --> 00:15:48.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be peacemakers.

00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:54.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then an explanation, verse 19:

00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:57.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,

00:15:57.769 --> 00:16:00.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
but yield place to the wrath.”

00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:01.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine;

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:08.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will repay,’ says Jehovah.”

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:12.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the advice is this:

00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:14.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be a peacemaker,

00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:16.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
and leave wrath to God.

00:16:16.788 --> 00:16:21.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let him determine
if and when and upon whom

00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:23.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
vengeance will be brought.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easy to say,

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is it always easy to do?

00:16:31.094 --> 00:16:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
The example of King David

00:16:35.306 --> 00:16:38.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be very helpful to us.

00:16:38.768 --> 00:16:40.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through no fault of his own,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
David became the target

00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:48.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
of King Saul’s murderous hatred.

00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:50.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on several occasions,

00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:53.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul tried to kill David.

00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:56.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
For several years David lived as a fugitive.

00:16:56.536 --> 00:17:00.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there were opportunities during that time

00:17:00.582 --> 00:17:05.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
for David to harm Saul, even to kill him.

00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:10.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could have justified that in his mind.

00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:13.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do you think had he done so

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:17.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would have threatened his peace

00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:20.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his peace, especially, with Jehovah?

00:17:20.852 --> 00:17:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that it would.

00:17:24.063 --> 00:17:27.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did David respond?

00:17:27.066 --> 00:17:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion, he said to his men:

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:34.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint

00:17:34.282 --> 00:17:36.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I should do such a thing to my lord,

00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:39.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
the anointed of Jehovah.”

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:44.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped David?

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:46.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he saw a bigger picture

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
than David and Saul, didn’t he?

He saw a picture with David, Saul,

00:17:53.718 --> 00:17:55.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah.

00:17:55.762 --> 00:17:59.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that if Saul needed to be corrected,

00:17:59.307 --> 00:18:03.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would do it in his time and way.

00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, David was willing to be patient

00:18:06.397 --> 00:18:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he preserved his peace

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:12.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his peace with God, his inner peace,

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his peace with those around him.

00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:18.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful example!

00:18:18.284 --> 00:18:21.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure that if we demonstrate

00:18:21.621 --> 00:18:23.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for Jehovah

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
by respecting his sovereignty
and waiting on him,

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will enjoy peace as well.

00:18:33.132 --> 00:18:35.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assures us

00:18:35.134 --> 00:18:38.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will bless his people

00:18:38.262 --> 00:18:41.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will bless us with peace.

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:44.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us be determined to love Jehovah

00:18:44.227 --> 00:18:47.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our whole heart, soul, and mind

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:51.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to demonstrate our love for Jehovah

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:55.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
by patiently waiting on him
and respecting his sovereignty

00:18:55.697 --> 00:18:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his way of doing things.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we will enjoy

00:18:59.951 --> 00:19:03.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
the incomparable peace of God.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:08.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:12.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:19:12.171 --> 00:19:17.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Love Leads to Genuine Peace
—Love of Neighbor.”

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Incredible!

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the only way to describe it.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The word had gone out that the Jews

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been captives
in Babylon were free to leave

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to return to their homeland, Israel.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:25.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you all know why that was incredible:

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Babylon never released its captives.

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Babylon had been overthrown,

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:34.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the new administration had said

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Jews were free to go.

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:42.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah could have been
responsible for that.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:48.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every family head had a decision to make:

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave Babylon or to stay behind.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you might say:

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There was no decision to make at all.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:01.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not a hard decision.”

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But wait.
Hold it.

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:08.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the Jews had been born in Babylon.

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of their parents

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been born in Babylon.

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the only home they knew.

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their roots were there.

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:26.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And according to certain records,
some of them had gotten prosperous.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them had gotten wealthy.

00:01:28.037 --> 00:01:32.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are records of Jews
buying and selling precious gems

00:01:32.108 --> 00:01:35.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other luxury items.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one says: “I can’t leave Babylon.

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My business partner is a Babylonian,

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the business is doing really well,

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there would be no market
for the products we sell in Israel.”

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another would say:

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My son married a Babylonian woman,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they just had a baby,

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our first grandchild.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s so cute.

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t leave now.”

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:05.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on the one hand,
you have these material benefits

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from remaining in Babylon.

00:02:07.577 --> 00:02:09.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the other hand,

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ability of the Jews
to worship Jehovah freely

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was severely limited.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:19.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s said that there were 50 pagan temples

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:22.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the capital alone.

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was no temple of Jehovah there.

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:29.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Levites weren’t able to follow
the Law of Moses properly.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could only do so to a limited degree.

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:36.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you had material advantages to staying,

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the spiritual blessings
that awaited those who chose to leave

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were going to be immense.

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:46.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for spiritually-minded Jews,

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was no contest

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they wanted to leave Babylon

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reestablish pure worship

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Promised Land in Israel.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if they were physically able to do so,

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would leave Babylon

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:06.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and travel to Jerusalem,

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:10.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city most of them had never seen,

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city in ruins.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah promised to make
the trip from Babylon to Jerusalem

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:21.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as easy as possible.

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to confirm that
and to get a little picture in our minds,

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to read a series
of four different scriptures.

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each scripture is going to add
a little detail to what Jehovah had in mind.

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:37.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first one
is found at Isaiah chapter 40,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 3 and 4.

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:44.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll wait a moment because it’d be good
if we could read this together.

00:03:44.574 --> 00:03:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Isaiah chapter 40,

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:51.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the well-known words of verses 3, 4:

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A voice of one
calling out in the wilderness:

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Clear up the way of Jehovah!

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Make a straight highway through the desert

00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:09.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[a straight highway through the desert]
for our God.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let every valley be raised up,

00:04:12.268 --> 00:04:15.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:17.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The rough ground must become level,

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:21.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the rugged ground, a valley plain.’”

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:26.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, every time I read these words,
I think of Brother Carey Barber.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have loved this passage
because very often in his prayers

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would quote this passage word for word

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good memories of Brother Barber.

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, it talks about making
“a straight highway through the desert.”

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If some of you have gone
to the Ramapo project,

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know what site work is all about.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you like to have
the Construction Committee in Ramapo

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take that job on?

00:04:56.112 --> 00:04:58.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make a straight highway through the desert.

00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:00.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you come to a mountain,
you’ve got to level it.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come to a valley,
you’ve got to bring it up.”

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:04.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be quite a job.

00:05:04.787 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think they have enough on their plate.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t need to worry
about this kind of site work.

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this was going to be a big job.

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the end, it would be a lot easier
to travel on a straight highway

00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than to go up and down
a mountain or down a valley.

00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:23.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it would be a lot faster too.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:26.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know that there
was going to be a straight highway

00:05:26.676 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Babylon and Jerusalem.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else can we learn?

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:33.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 57,

00:05:34.317 --> 00:05:37.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 57:14

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 14 says: “It will be said:

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Build up, build up a road!

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Prepare the way!

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[and here it comes]
Remove any obstacle

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:56.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the way of my people.’”

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we have two details:

00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:01.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s  going to be a straight highway
through the desert,

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the obstacles
are going to be cleared away.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, most highways have a name.

00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:10.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are named after famous people;

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:12.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others have a number.

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this special highway have a name?

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we go to Isaiah 35:8, 9
to find that name.

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:27.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m giving you a real workout this morning,

00:06:27.403 --> 00:06:30.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to do this
to put it all together.

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:33.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 35:8, 9:

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And a highway will be there, yes,

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a way called [here it comes]

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Way of Holiness.

00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:46.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The unclean one will not travel on it.

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:49.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is reserved for the one
walking on the way;

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:52.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“no one foolish will stray onto it.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No lion will be there,

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and no vicious wild beasts will come on it.

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not be found there.

00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the repurchased ones will walk there.”

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:07.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the name?

00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:09.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the special name of this highway?

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Way of Holiness.”

00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:14.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a nice name for a highway?

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:18.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rattlesnakes, bears,

00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:22.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foxes, and cougars are not allowed.

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:25.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t care how cute you think they are.

00:07:25.328 --> 00:07:28.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not allowed on this special highway.

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what else can we learn
about this special highway?

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:39.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, you don’t know who is traveling
in the car next to yours.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be somebody
who has no business driving a car.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The driver could be drunk.

00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:46.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could be on drugs.

00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on this highway,
the unclean one is not permitted.

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:56.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who would break God’s laws
are not permitted to travel on that highway.

00:07:56.993 --> 00:08:01.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re talking about the highway
between Babylon and Jerusalem.

00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:04.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt unclean ones among the Jews

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t be interested
in going back to Israel anyway.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were probably very much at home

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the idolatry of Babylon.

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, their forefathers
were no strangers to idolatry.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So only those who were
clean and acceptable in Jehovah’s eyes

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:25.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were welcome to travel
from Babylon back to Jerusalem.

00:08:25.388 --> 00:08:27.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s be clear.

00:08:27.523 --> 00:08:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know whether
there was any literal roadwork

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
done on the road between Babylon and Israel.

00:08:35.298 --> 00:08:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be all figurative, but there
could have been some roadwork done.

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jehovah told the Jews to do

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jeremiah 31:21.

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:51.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you would ask,
‘Why would Jehovah

00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:55.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
say all of these things
if it was all to be ignored literally?’

00:08:55.518 --> 00:08:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Jeremiah 31:21,

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:
“Set up road markers for yourself,

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:06.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and put up signposts.

00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay attention to the highway,
the way that you have to go.

00:09:09.732 --> 00:09:12.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Return, O virgin of Israel,

00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:16.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
return to these cities of yours.”

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no doubt the first groups to use the road

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would remove obstacles
and level things out the best they could

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that those who followed
would have an easier journey.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:31.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, what have we learned?

00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:33.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have we gleaned
from this series of scriptures?

00:09:33.623 --> 00:09:38.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there was a highway,
a highway through the desert.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve also learned
that it was to be cleared of obstacles.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has a special name,

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Way of Holiness.”

00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:51.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were to be signposts
so that those who traveled the road

00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t get lost
and maybe stray onto some other road.

00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:57.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was the goal?

00:09:57.213 --> 00:10:01.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jehovah want this road
to be prepared so nicely?

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make it as easy as possible

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:08.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Jews to leave Babylon

00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:12.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go back to Israel
and reestablish pure worship.

00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it work?

00:10:16.132 --> 00:10:19.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tens of thousands of men, women,

00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and children responded
to the call (the invitation)

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:28.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with Jehovah’s help,
they arrived safely at their destination.

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might be thinking:
‘This is all very nice.

00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:34.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But what does it have to do with me?

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it have to do with us today?’

00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Plenty.

00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because today, not tens of thousands

00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:46.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but millions of men, women, and children

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are responding to the command,

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the urgent command to “get out of her,”

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get out of “Babylon the Great.”

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the situation
is different from the situation

00:10:57.473 --> 00:11:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Jews in ancient times
because they had a choice.

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:04.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could remain
in Babylon and still serve Jehovah.

00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:07.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But people today have no choice.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must leave Babylon the Great.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:14.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their life depends on it.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, without looking for a type and antitype,

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:22.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to fit everything
in very neatly in this arrangement,

00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can say that there are some similarities

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:28.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between what happened
to the Jews in ancient times

00:11:28.537 --> 00:11:30.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what is happening today,

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in a sense, when you start
to study the Bible with someone,

00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:39.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are pointing him
in the direction of “the Way of Holiness.”

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:42.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some start studying,

00:11:42.017 --> 00:11:44.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they start traveling on the road,
and then they turn back.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But others keep going,

00:11:46.856 --> 00:11:51.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they become dedicated,
baptized disciples of Christ.

00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:54.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some travel in the fast lane.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make rapid progress.

00:11:57.166 --> 00:11:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others sort of take the far right lane,

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:03.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they poke along,
but they keep making progress.

00:12:03.372 --> 00:12:07.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as long as they keep making progress,
we’ll study with them.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some break down,
and that calls for roadside assistance.

00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:18.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s easier to travel
on “the Way of Holiness” today

00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:20.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than it ever has been.

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, friends,

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:27.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is partly due to the spiritual site work

00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:30.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was started centuries ago.

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:32.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:36.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is easier to travel
‘the highway of holiness’ today

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:39.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the spiritual site work

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:42.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was started hundreds of years ago,

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:46.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
long before Babylon the Great fell,

00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
long before the road
was opened for travelers.

00:12:50.953 --> 00:12:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, picture this: It’s the 16th century.

00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With shovel in hand,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are about to start site work
on “the Way of Holiness.”

00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:05.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a mountain ahead of you

00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a mountain of ignorance.

00:13:08.237 --> 00:13:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you realize that if you
are going to start to level that mountain,

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:14.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first thing you’re
going to have to do is get the Bible

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the hands of the people.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years, the Bible was just only in Latin,

00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:23.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and only mostly educated people
could read it.

00:13:23.018 --> 00:13:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even some of the clergy
only knew enough Latin

00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conduct church services;
but otherwise, they couldn’t understand it.

00:13:31.193 --> 00:13:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you’ve been to our beautiful museum

00:13:34.697 --> 00:13:37.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(some of you have taken a tour recently),

00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that translators
in many countries risked their freedom

00:13:41.637 --> 00:13:46.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even their lives to put the Bible
into the language of the common people.

00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:50.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then printers
produced those translations.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of them used an assumed name,

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if they got caught printing a Bible,

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:59.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could be arrested and even worse.

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the mountain had to be leveled

00:14:02.558 --> 00:14:05.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a shovelful at a time

00:14:05.227 --> 00:14:08.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one Bible at a time—

00:14:08.163 --> 00:14:12.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reduce that mountain
on “the Way of Holiness.”

00:14:12.768 --> 00:14:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To get the Bible
into the hands of the people,

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
William Tyndale

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arranged to have thousands of copies

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his translation smuggled into England

00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in bales of cotton and other goods.

00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:27.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was dangerous.

00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:30.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tyndale’s translation was banned in England,

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:33.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you merely possessed
a copy of the Bible,

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:37.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could bring you a stint
in the Tower of London or worse.

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite desperate attempts
to stop work on “the Way of Holiness,”

00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more copies of Tyndale’s Bible were printed

00:14:45.868 --> 00:14:48.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the clergy could ever destroy.

00:14:49.705 --> 00:14:52.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, you’d be interested
in a comment that Tyndale made

00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:55.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his comments on the book of Genesis

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:58.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the 1530 translation
of the book of Genesis).

00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote: “Jehovah is God’s name.

00:15:02.284 --> 00:15:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Neither is any creature so called.

00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:09.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As oft as thou
seist LORD in capital letters,

00:15:09.191 --> 00:15:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is in Hebrew Jehovah.”

00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early on, the name Jehovah
was given some recognition.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with the Bible becoming
more available to the people,

00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:25.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d expect that students of the Bible
would want to share

00:15:25.207 --> 00:15:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their research with others.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the case.

00:15:29.612 --> 00:15:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the years leading up to 1919
when Babylon the Great fell,

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more roadwork was done.

00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:40.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we had men
who shared the fruitage of their research

00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:43.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in tracts, in books
—publications of all kinds—

00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:45.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they wanted the people to know.

00:15:45.494 --> 00:15:49.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to reduce
that mountain of ignorance.

00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:50.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:52.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about 1835,

00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:55.037 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a Bible student by the name of Henry Grew

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:57.039 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wrote a pamphlet

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.608 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the immortality of the soul.

00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that pamphlet,
Grew explained from the Bible

00:16:03.112 --> 00:16:06.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that immortality
is a reward for faithfulness.

00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:08.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not born with it.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he published the tract anonymously

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:13.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he knew there would be trouble.

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:17.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later on,
there was trouble for Henry Grew.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:19.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he publishes a tract.

00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:21.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But two years later,

00:16:21.263 --> 00:16:23.699 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
another Bible student, George Storrs,

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:25.934 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is riding in a train,

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:30.673 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and he looks down and he sees a tract there,

00:16:30.673 --> 00:16:32.841 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s Henry Grew’s tract

00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:34.877 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the immortality of the soul.

00:16:34.877 --> 00:16:36.211 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He reads it.

00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:38.013 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And he becomes convinced that man

00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:39.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t have an immortal soul.

00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:41.016 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So, what does he do?

00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:43.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He picks up a shovel,

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he starts working on the road,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the road “the Way of Holiness.”

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1842, he gave a series of lectures

00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:55.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the intriguing theme
“Are the Wicked Immortal?”

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he later published those lectures.

00:16:57.833 --> 00:17:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how many copies were produced?

00:17:00.636 --> 00:17:04.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two hundred thousand copies

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that series of lectures.

00:17:06.642 --> 00:17:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was decent roadwork
on that “Way of Holiness.”

00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:14.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Storrs knew that he didn’t have
the whole truth on every subject.

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 1847,
he made quite an interesting statement;

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be interesting for us.

00:17:19.922 --> 00:17:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “We . . . do well to remember

00:17:22.324 --> 00:17:26.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have just emerged
from the dark ages of the church;

00:17:26.695 --> 00:17:29.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and [notice this]
it would not be . . . strange

00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if we should find some ‘Babylonish garments’

00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:36.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still worn by us.”

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was right.

00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:43.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylon still had influence in those days.

00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know
that George Storrs had an influence

00:17:46.348 --> 00:17:49.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Charles Taze Russell.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:52.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we know
about Brother Russell and his associates?

00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t the first
to discover that the Trinity

00:17:56.692 --> 00:17:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the immortality of the soul
are false doctrines,

00:17:59.962 --> 00:18:04.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even that Christ’s presence
would be invisible to the human eye.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:08.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They benefited
from the careful preparatory work

00:18:08.103 --> 00:18:12.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that other road workers had done in the past.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:15.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So translators, printers,

00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:19.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible students
were doing spiritual site work.

00:18:19.982 --> 00:18:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we might say
that Brother Russell and his associates

00:18:22.718 --> 00:18:27.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put the final touches
on that “Way of Holiness.”

00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Babylon the Great fell in 1919,

00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:35.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then “the Way of Holiness”
was open for travelers.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Brother Russell died in 1916.

00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:43.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he miss it?

00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he miss the inauguration of the road?

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:49.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think so.

00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t have a bird’s-eye view
of the opening of the road;

00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:55.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had a heaven’s-eye view,

00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:59.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Brother Russell and his associates

00:18:59.121 --> 00:19:01.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had finished their earthly course

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to look down from the heavens.

00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:06.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can you imagine how excited they were

00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they saw the first travelers

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:11.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set foot on “the Way of Holiness”?

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have been
very exciting for them indeed.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wouldn’t be surprising
if Brother Russell and his associates

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:25.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were firmly involved
in the maintenance program

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that “Way of Holiness” today,

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:32.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because every good road
needs ongoing maintenance.

00:19:32.855 --> 00:19:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Way of Holiness” is open,

00:19:34.857 --> 00:19:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maintenance
on that “Way of Holiness” goes on.

00:19:38.327 --> 00:19:40.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s the goal?

00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:43.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s to make it as easy as possible

00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:46.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for people to identify Babylon the Great

00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:49.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to leave Babylon the Great
—that is the goal.

00:19:49.738 --> 00:19:52.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, take the Bible, for example.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were Bible translations in 1919,

00:19:55.244 --> 00:19:57.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of them were

00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:01.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in archaic language
that was hard to understand.

00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:06.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of them didn’t give the divine name
the place of honor that it deserved.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we have the <i>New World Translation</i>.

00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing that has proved to be!

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:15.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so clear, and you don’t have
to mortgage the house to buy a copy,

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:19.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was probably
the case in the 16th century.

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:21.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since 1919,

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there has been an abundance of spiritual food

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:27.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it easier
for people to come into the truth.

00:20:27.376 --> 00:20:29.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just think of this:

00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1919, Babylon the Great fell.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:35.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what else happened in 1919?

00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:39.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What provision did Jehovah
make for these people?

00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:43.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The faithful and discreet slave”
was appointed in that same year.

00:20:43.725 --> 00:20:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the slave didn’t waste any time

00:20:47.062 --> 00:20:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start producing literature

00:20:49.398 --> 00:20:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going to make it easier
for people to come into the truth.

00:20:52.935 --> 00:20:55.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1919, the slave is appointed.

00:20:55.103 --> 00:20:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By 1921, you have a brand new publication, 

00:20:59.908 --> 00:21:02.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Harp of God</i>.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was especially designed for beginners

00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:08.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make it easy for people to study
and read and come into the truth.

00:21:08.617 --> 00:21:11.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was necessary because in 1921

00:21:11.787 --> 00:21:14.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a shortage
of teachers, or publishers,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could conduct Bible studies with people.

00:21:17.492 --> 00:21:20.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you really needed something simple.

00:21:20.495 --> 00:21:25.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And comparatively speaking,
that <i>Harp of God</i>  was simple.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:29.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there were very few publishers
in those days, just a few thousand.

00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:33.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they were workers;
they did a tremendous job!

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:37.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you realize that before <i>The Harp of God </i>
 went out of print,

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:41.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
almost six million copies

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:44.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 22 languages had been circulated?

00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:47.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is evidence

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:50.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maintenance work
on “the Way of Holiness”

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:54.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had begun right after the road opened.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I doubt that very many in this audience

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:01.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have come into the truth
through <i>The Harp of God.</i>

00:22:01.003 --> 00:22:02.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anybody here?

00:22:02.504 --> 00:22:04.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think so.

00:22:04.973 --> 00:22:08.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What publication brought you into the truth?

00:22:08.143 --> 00:22:12.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What publication helped you
to identify “the Way of Holiness”?

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it <i>“The Truth Shall Make You Free</i>,”

00:22:15.984 --> 00:22:18.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“Let God Be True,</i>”

00:22:18.153 --> 00:22:21.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</i>

00:22:21.356 --> 00:22:23.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>You Can Live Forever,</i>

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:27.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Knowledge</i> book, <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:22:28.196 --> 00:22:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Teach Us</i> (<i>What Can the Bible Teach Us?</i> ),

00:22:30.966 --> 00:22:35.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is it our fine,
new publication <i>Enjoy Life Forever!?</i>

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these publications

00:22:38.073 --> 00:22:41.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been used to help people
to break free from Babylon the Great.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is proof positive

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:48.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maintenance
on “the Way of Holiness” is ongoing.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:53.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This roadwork continues,
and it gets better and better.

00:22:55.123 --> 00:22:59.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you studying the Bible with someone
with the help of <i>Enjoy Life Forever!?</i>

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:03.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are, you’re pointing
that person to “the Way of Holiness.”

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:07.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t be afraid to offer studies,

00:23:07.602 --> 00:23:10.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Brother Sanderson mentioned,

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:14.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to business associates, relatives,
schoolmates—anybody you can think of.

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:17.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Offer Bible studies,
and you’ll be surprised

00:23:17.546 --> 00:23:19.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at who will take you up on it.

00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:21.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you do, keep in mind

00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:25.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that while the road
has been made easier for travelers,

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
setting foot on that road
takes courage and effort.

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:32.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s be ready to help
those who are willing to respond.

00:23:33.895 --> 00:23:37.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions have already taken that road,

00:23:37.232 --> 00:23:40.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s our hope
that millions more will do so

00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:42.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the end of this system of things.

00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:46.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we wish them all safe travels.

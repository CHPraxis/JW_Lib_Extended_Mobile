00:00:08 How thrilled we were
00:00:10 at last year’s annual meeting
00:00:12 to receive a new publication:
00:00:14 Enjoy Life Forever! —An Interactive Bible Course !
00:00:19 Already many publishers are having success
00:00:22 in conducting progressive studies using this new tool.
00:00:27 As you listen to experiences from around the world,
00:00:30 note the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.
00:00:34 When they made the announcement
00:00:36 of the new publication,
00:00:37 for me it was just pure excitement.
00:00:40 Actually, I was so overjoyed
00:00:41 that I kept going to the website
00:00:43 around the time of the release,
00:00:45 and at times I would even refresh my browser
00:00:48 a few times a day to see when it was out.
00:00:50 Having all the teaching methods
00:00:52 right in our hands
00:00:53 —what more can we ask for?
00:00:55 We were so excited that during this pandemic,
00:00:59 Jehovah has given us something
00:01:00 to energize our ministry.
00:01:04 When you heard that we would be using a new method for conducting studies,
00:01:09 were you a bit hesitant?
00:01:11 Pay close attention to what experienced teachers are saying
00:01:14 about the benefits of this approach.
00:01:18 Before, it wasn’t uncommon
00:01:20 to hear students start their comments
00:01:22 with expressions like “the paragraph says”
00:01:25 or “as the book mentions.”
00:01:26 Now it’s not like that.
00:01:27 In the old way of teaching,
00:01:30 it was a bit difficult for me to discern
00:01:32 if my Bible students really understood
00:01:34 what they were learning or if the truth reached their hearts.
00:01:38 I think I was using
00:01:40 too many additional points
00:01:41 to convey one idea
00:01:43 and just explaining too much,
00:01:44 so my Bible students would get even more confused.
00:01:49 With some well-educated people,
00:01:52 the studies were in a sense
00:01:53 too easy for them.
00:01:55 They found the answer very easily from the paragraph
00:01:59 and were able to answer correctly,
00:02:01 but it was very hard to know what they really thought about the matter.
00:02:06 With this new book,
00:02:08 it seems like it is easier to see
00:02:10 the person’s genuine thoughts on the matter.
00:02:14 In the previous method,
00:02:16 you would see the student
00:02:18 looking at the book a lot,
00:02:20 but that doesn’t happen now.
00:02:23 When you look at the student,
00:02:25 you can tell he is thinking about the answer
00:02:28 instead of looking for the answer.
00:02:31 They used to enjoy the Bible study in the past,
00:02:34 but now they enjoy it much more.
00:02:38 Now they are able to keep focused
00:02:40 from the beginning to the end of our session.
00:02:44 They feel motivated and closer to Jehovah.
00:02:50 To reach the heart of a Bible student,
00:02:52 we need to understand what he’s thinking and feeling.
00:02:57 How does the Enjoy Life Forever!  book help us to do that?
00:03:01 One of the things I love about it
00:03:03 is how after we read the Bible verse,
00:03:06 there are the questions that follow it
00:03:08 that are perfectly phrased for us.
00:03:10 It really engages our students’ hearts,
00:03:12 and it helps them to understand
00:03:14 the Bible teachings right away,
00:03:16 and it helps us to see what’s in their heart as well.
00:03:19 It lets the student express
00:03:21 what is in his heart,
00:03:23 which allows us to help him.
00:03:25 The first time I looked
00:03:27 through this publication,
00:03:28 I could already see
00:03:30 how appealing its format is.
00:03:32 There are no lengthy paragraphs,
00:03:34 and it is prepared in a very interactive way.
00:03:38 With this new method, I definitely talk less.
00:03:41 My students talk more.
00:03:43 And the one that starts it all off
00:03:45 —the introduction video—
00:03:47 just makes everything fit together.
00:03:50 And one of the amazing things
00:03:52 that it introduces right away is the prayer,
00:03:55 because often as a teacher, we didn’t know exactly
00:03:58 when to introduce prayer or how to do it,
00:04:01 but the video does it for us.
00:04:17 Obviously, teachers are excited about the new book.
00:04:21 But what impact is it having on their students?
00:04:25 Bible students
00:04:27 have been pleasantly surprised.
00:04:29 I asked one student how he felt
00:04:31 to be using this new publication.
00:04:34 And the response was:
00:04:36 “Why didn’t we do this sooner?
00:04:38 It’s great! I’m a lot calmer.”
00:04:41 Another student told me that she was relieved
00:04:44 to no longer have to find the answers
00:04:46 but, rather, to express her thoughts and feelings.
00:04:49 During our discussion
00:04:51 of the “Dig Deeper” section in lesson 02,
00:04:53 my Bible student really appreciated
00:04:55 the scriptures and the beautiful artwork.
00:04:59 He said that he could already see himself in Paradise
00:05:02 enjoying the many promises of Jehovah.
00:05:05 He said that our discussion
00:05:07 made him feel Jehovah’s love.
00:05:10 With the students,
00:05:12 they’re not so overwhelmed with the new book
00:05:14 when we ask them to prepare the lesson.
00:05:16 With the Bible Teach  book, when we would ask them
00:05:18 to prepare these paragraphs,
00:05:21 it was like you asked them to go to the dentist.
00:05:22 They just seemed so intimidated by it.
00:05:24 But now they smile, and they’re like, “OK, I can do that.”
00:05:29 One student in particular
00:05:31 wrote in the “Goal” box:
00:05:33 “I want to share the points
00:05:35 “from this lesson
00:05:36 with my friends and work colleagues within a week.”
00:05:39 And he did.
00:05:41 One of the videos that was really effective
00:05:43 was the one from lesson 04,
00:05:45 My Search for the True God.
00:05:47 It shows the experience of Sister Soten Yoeun.
00:05:50 My students were deeply moved.
00:05:53 They really felt Jehovah’s love for them
00:05:56 and wanted to speak with him.
00:05:58 They felt motivated to pray.
00:06:02 We were studying the first lesson with an 83-year-old lady
00:06:06 when we came across Matthew 7:7.
00:06:11 She read it in her own Bible,
00:06:14 and at first she didn’t quite understand it.
00:06:20 Then we pondered over the verse together with the question.
00:06:22 And then all of a sudden she asked:
00:06:25 “Oh! Does this verse mean
00:06:28 “that I should dig for the answers in the Bible myself
00:06:30 instead of asking a priest?”
00:06:34 It was quite a special moment.
00:06:37 The video
00:06:38 under “Learn to enjoy Bible reading”
00:06:41 was very helpful for one young man.
00:06:43 After watching it,
00:06:45 he set the goal of reading the Bible every day.
00:06:49 With one Bible student,
00:06:51 we had encouraged him to become an unbaptized publisher
00:06:53 in the previous study book.
00:06:56 And now when we were in lesson 02 of our new study publication,
00:07:00 he expressed the desire to become an unbaptized publisher
00:07:04 because he felt he could share one or two points from each lesson
00:07:09 with his friends and others that he knew.
00:07:12 And so now he is approved, and he’s doing very well in the ministry.
00:07:15 Thanks to this new book, I now conduct 15 Bible studies.
00:07:20 The book helps them to maintain the desire and motivation
00:07:24 to keep learning about Jehovah,
00:07:26 his beautiful qualities, and the future that awaits us.
00:07:31 Clearly, our worldwide brotherhood is excited
00:07:35 to use Enjoy Life Forever!
00:07:38 What a tremendous gift from Jehovah!
00:07:41 Of all the facets of our ministry,
00:07:43 without question
00:07:45 conducting a progressive Bible study
00:07:48 is the most satisfying aspect.
00:07:50 And now we have the tool
00:07:52 and the method to make it much easier.
00:07:54 I’m very grateful for this tool.
00:07:56 It really helps us to sense
00:07:59 how close the Governing Body
00:08:01 recognizes we are to the end,
00:08:03 but it in no way feels like a rushed program.
00:08:06 The heart is definitely being reached gently and lovingly,
00:08:10 but then that is what motivates quickly.
00:08:13 Try and introduce it as much as you can.
00:08:14 Start those Bible studies.
00:08:17 And when you do,
00:08:18 please invite me to join in on your new Bible study.
00:08:33 The new book Enjoy Life Forever!
00:08:35 shows clearly that “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:08:37 has been, is, and will continue to give
00:08:41 exactly what we need at exactly the right time.
00:08:45 This publication has the potential
00:08:48 to help many more honesthearted ones
00:08:50 come to know and love our wonderful Father, Jehovah.
00:08:54 May he bless you and your Bible students
00:08:58 as you put to use this new tool.

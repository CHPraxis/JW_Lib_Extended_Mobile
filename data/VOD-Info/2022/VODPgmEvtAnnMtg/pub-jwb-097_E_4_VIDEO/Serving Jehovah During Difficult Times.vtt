all of the things that we need

to accomplish our ministry

no matter what tribulation we face.

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly have experienced
Jehovah’s loving support

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this pandemic.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heavenly Father,
through his organization,

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has provided just what we’ve needed

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure faithfully in our ministry

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to stay strong spiritually.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the direction

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shelter in place
affected circuit overseers,

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
construction servants, field missionaries,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and special pioneers?

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have they been able
to continue in their ministry

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving Jehovah whole-souled and with joy?

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What practical lessons have they learned?

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.114 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To follow the Governing Body’s direction

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:53.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to shelter in place,

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we couldn’t go in to see Steve’s mother.

00:00:56.118 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was in aged care just ten minutes away

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from where we’re based.

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She died while we were sheltering in place.

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This led to another challenge

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—grieving in isolation.

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:12.718 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:14.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the shelter-in-place direction,

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.389 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had a very difficult time.

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had flashbacks

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were very difficult for me.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the Vietnam War,

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was imprisoned
because of taking a neutral stand.

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a reaction to this lockdown

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being confined.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:01.100 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We especially discerned

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.103 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the value of the direction in November 2020

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:05.688 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when, suddenly,

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken to the hospital
because of a serious heart disease

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and severe pneumonia.

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:15.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It turned out that my life was in danger.

00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:19.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctors evaluated
that if I had contracted the coronavirus

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:21.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that condition,

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would not have had a chance to survive it.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While sheltering in place,

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:30.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did these obedient brothers and sisters
stay positive

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintain their physical, emotional,
and spiritual health?

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even through that difficult time,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having <i>Zoom</i>  meetings,

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having the meetings for field service,

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing witnessing by <i>Zoom</i>,

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being with the brothers and sisters

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:50.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I can’t say enough good about it.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In being able
not to meet an hour requirement

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:58.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by going ahead
and being very busy spiritually,

00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:01.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did a phenomenal amount of shepherding,

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthening, and upbuilding
our brothers and sisters

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—folks literally from around the world
that we knew needed help.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:13.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Governing Body
removed the specific hour requirement,

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:20.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we felt their trust.

00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:23.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gave us more flexibility,

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this enabled us to reach out

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to relatives not in the truth

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to support them during the pandemic.

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that has led

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:37.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to two, regular, continuing Bible studies.

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.033 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really feel how much

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body cares for us

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every time they mention in their letters

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they do not require us
to reach the required hours.

00:03:49.584 --> 00:03:53.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters today are depressed

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experiencing pandemic fatigue.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually they need someone

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who they can talk to about their problems.

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:02.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of these adjustments,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now have more time to encourage them

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help them to remain spiritually strong.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.423 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since most congregations I serve

00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:38.883 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
don’t have Internet access,

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I make video recordings for all the talks.

00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:48.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I make a simple platform
and set up the microphone and cell phone

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:50.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I use to create the video.

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I stand in front
and start giving the talk.

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What blessings did they receive
from their obedience?

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy to start
a Bible study during the pandemic,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when I saw how quickly
the student was making progress.

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of my health,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each study session
was about 15 to 20 minutes long.

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:18.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to find a good place
to conduct the study at the hospital,

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:20.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mainly in the hallway.

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:22.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day after the concluding prayer,

00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed the door
to a doctor’s office was open.

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:31.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctor was listening
to our whole Bible study discussion.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy
she attended the study as well.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:04.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, in my circuit,

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:07.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
59 Bible students progressed to baptism.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unity within families is another blessing.

00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents are spending a lot of time

00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:18.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conducting Bible studies with their children.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Christian life is compared to a race,

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:27.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is not a short race.

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are unexpected things
that can happen to us.

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:37.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By striving to obey from the heart now,

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:40.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be prepared to obey the directions

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are going to receive
in the great tribulation.

00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:49.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are sure that this is not the last time

00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:51.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to be obedient.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see Bible prophecies being fulfilled

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:56.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right in front of our eyes,
and ahead of us are

00:06:56.646 --> 00:06:59.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even greater events
that will bring larger trials.

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:05.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:2, 3 helps us
despite trials to keep joy

00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:08.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—deep joy—
in our hearts,

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:10.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it assures us
that all difficult situations

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to work on endurance.

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this quality will help us
to cope with trials to come.

00:07:19.085 --> 00:07:22.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally have benefited from following

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:24.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body’s direction.

00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:28.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve actually felt joy every day,

00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:33.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I can only put that down
to the blessing from Jehovah God

00:07:33.558 --> 00:07:36.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our efforts to be obedient.

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:41.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve both benefited
from the direction from the Governing Body

00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:43.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we trust

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:45.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christ Jesus is directing them.

00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:51.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so absolutely grateful

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:56.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Governing Body for providing direction

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is blessing every single one of us
around the earth.

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:03.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like you,

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:06.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these dear ones have made great sacrifices

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:11.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue serving Jehovah
whole-souled during this pandemic,

00:08:11.054 --> 00:08:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt we’ve all learned the value

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:16.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of applying the words at 2 Timothy 4:2:

00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:21.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Preach the word; be at it urgently

00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:24.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in favorable times and difficult times.”

00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, neither this pandemic

00:08:28.655 --> 00:08:30.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor any other difficult times to come

00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will stop our preaching work

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:36.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, more importantly, prevent

00:08:36.537 --> 00:08:38.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s loving care.

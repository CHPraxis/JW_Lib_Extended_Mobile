In January of 2020,

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:05.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we started seeing news reports

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.821 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about a disease outbreak in Wuhan, China.

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now at the time, it seemed localized
and was not of global concern.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a short time later,

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the numbers were going up

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the virus began to spread.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Borders were closing,
and airports were shutting down.

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:30.551 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On January 22, the Coordinators’ Committee

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
received their first letter from a branch

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:34.054 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the coronavirus.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The letter was from the Korea branch.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after that,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wrote to all branches in and around Asia

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and included guidelines on what to do

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they had an outbreak in their territory.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had dealt with local epidemics before

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nothing like this on a worldwide scale.

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was clear that the virus
was going to affect almost every aspect

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our theocratic operations.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during those first few months of 2020,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organization would be faced
with a huge amount of decisions.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:05.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have to realize that this was catching us

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.005 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
right in the middle of our activities.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our schedule for the whole year
had already been planned.

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had shepherding visits to branches,
regional conventions,

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even special conventions.

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we had Gilead graduation

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:24.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Memorial coming up right in front of us.

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were we going to do?

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the first things

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:30.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body decided

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:32.529 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was that the Coordinators’ Committee

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.531 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would become the central channel

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.661 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of communication regarding COVID-19.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.373 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile, the graduation

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:45.209 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the 148th class of Gilead

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.503 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was in two weeks.

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we have guests come?

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should there be a live audience?

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was not much time
to make these decisions.

00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:59.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, after prayer and discussion,

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire Governing Body decided

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to have a live audience

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:09.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Gilead graduation that weekend.

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was unheard of!

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next thing we needed to figure out

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was whether to lock down
headquarters at Bethel.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I clearly remember it was a Friday night,

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
March 13.

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were getting reports of COVID cases

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregations around Bethel.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also knew that the Bethelites

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be going out to their congregation
and other activities over the weekend.

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were going to do something,
we needed to do it quickly.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We called each member of the Governing Body

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explained the situation.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all were unanimous

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should lock down Bethel immediately.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So within the hour, a message went
to the entire headquarters

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and United States Bethel family to stay in,

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:58.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you were out,
to return to Bethel immediately.

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:00.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometime later,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned that there were
some COVID cases at Patterson.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had moved ahead,
potentially we could have spread COVID

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the whole Bethel family!

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really felt Jehovah’s protective hand.

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:20.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same weekend as the Gilead graduation,

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Memorial invitation campaign

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:23.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was scheduled to begin.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so branches were asking:

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it safe to go door to door
and to distribute invitations?

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:31.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we can’t meet at our Kingdom Halls?

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the virus had spread in many countries,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became evident

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:41.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we needed to suspend
the public ministry.

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a very serious decision.

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we prayerfully analyzed
the situation,

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:54.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realized we would not be showing respect

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:58.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sanctity of life or love of neighbor

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:01.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continued house to house.

00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:04.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our preaching work shifted to letter writing

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:07.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and telephone witnessing.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a huge witness
has been given in this way!

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing to me personally
when I saw how quickly

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers could adapt to using

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Zoom, </i>phone witnessing, letter writing.

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of it being
a huge setback for the work,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was almost as though
the work even moved ahead.

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were also having to deal

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what to do about our Kingdom Halls
and our meetings.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, some of the brothers
were thinking,

00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe we could just simply watch
the prerecorded meetings

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on <i>JW Stream</i> ®.’

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, while that’s an excellent provision,

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were going to do this for a long time,

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be wonderful to use a tool

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:54.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would allow the brothers and sisters
to come together virtually,

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:58.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to interact and have
that “interchange of encouragement.”

00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:03.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that a few branches
had already started using <i>Zoom </i>

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for congregation meetings,

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:09.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wondered, ‘Could this tool be used

00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for congregation meetings globally?’

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:13.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we asked those branches

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:14.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for their recommendations

00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.421 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on how we could use this tool further.

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:20.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got their comments, we did some testing,

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the Governing Body approved
the global use of <i>Zoom </i> for meetings.

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:25.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the same time, though,

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:27.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Coordinators’ Committee urgently wanted

00:05:27.222 --> 00:05:29.141 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to help those congregations to arrange

00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:30.684 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
dignified <i>Zoom</i>  meetings.

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:34.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so within a week,
technical and theocratic guidelines

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:36.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were released to all congregations.

00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And shortly after that,

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:41.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tens of thousands of <i>Zoom</i>  licenses
were purchased

00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:45.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then provided to many congregations
as part of the disaster relief arrangement.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:50.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, not all publishers
could use <i>Zoom</i>  because of lack of Internet.

00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:52.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the days leading up to the campaign,

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:55.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body provided direction
to all branches

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:58.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to handle those exact situations.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:01.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also announced
that the Memorial talk itself

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:03.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be made available on jw.org.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one branch wrote in
and asked if they could use

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
television and radio broadcasting.

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:12.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thought: ‘That’s a good idea.

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:13.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try it.’

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we saw
how well it worked in that country,

00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:19.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
television and radio were approved

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all branches in Africa

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:23.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only two days before the Memorial.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:26.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thrilling it was
for many friends in Africa

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out, even moments
before the broadcast began,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would be able
to commemorate the Memorial

00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:36.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simultaneously with their brothers
and sisters throughout the country!

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:39.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To have the Memorial
without being able to meet together

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:43.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was so different for all of us.

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that for the 2021 Memorial

00:06:47.552 --> 00:06:49.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was an all-time peak

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 21,367,603?

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:01.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, we have seen Jehovah’s blessing

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:03.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on these arrangements.

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:06.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
While all these new arrangements

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:09.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were being made at a rapid pace,

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the usual work
of the Coordinators’ Committee Office

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t stop because of the pandemic.

00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:16.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still had to deal
with the king of the north

persecuting our brothers.

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:22.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still had disasters
and many other things to contend with.

00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:25.882 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we handled twice as many disasters

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:27.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the 2020 service year

00:07:27.884 --> 00:07:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of the pandemic

00:07:29.803 --> 00:07:31.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
than we did in 2018.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.850 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On a daily basis, we saw clear evidence

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we are living in the last days.

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We had to come up with guidelines

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:40.480 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to help branches determine

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.773 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what aspects of relief work

00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:42.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
could be postponed

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:47.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the same time ensure that urgent
or necessary work went ahead safely.

00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:49.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While there’s no doubt that the pandemic

00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:51.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
complicated disaster relief efforts
considerably,

00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:53.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was so faith-strengthening to see

00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:55.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body refused

00:07:55.787 --> 00:07:59.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to allow those complications
to prevent them from caring for our brothers.

00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:03.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to the impact
these disasters had on our brothers,

00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some countries our brothers

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
couldn’t even get enough food
for their daily needs.

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:12.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could have been because of
government restrictions, supply issues,

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other circumstances
that wouldn’t allow the brothers to work.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:22.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Literally, the branches had to arrange
to provide their “daily bread.”

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branches were encouraged to establish
disaster relief committees

00:08:26.401 --> 00:08:29.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for the needs on a local level.

00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:32.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reminders were provided to help families

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:35.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to prepare a reserve of food,
if at all possible,

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:37.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in case the situation became worse.

00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:42.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the virus affected
not only our meetings at the Kingdom Hall

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:44.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also our circuit assemblies,

00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:48.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regional conventions,
and special conventions.

00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:51.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Governing Body decided to cancel

00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:55.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all live regional and special conventions

00:08:55.764 --> 00:08:58.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 2020.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:01.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That lead to a landmark convention program

00:09:01.853 --> 00:09:04.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on jw.org

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the entire brotherhood enjoyed.

00:09:09.694 --> 00:09:11.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same week in March,

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we approved
that a JW Broadcasting® news release

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:18.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coronavirus outbreak

00:09:18.537 --> 00:09:20.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be developed.

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:23.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So interviews and scripts were prepared

00:09:23.875 --> 00:09:27.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during that Gilead graduation weekend,

00:09:27.337 --> 00:09:31.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the program was recorded and released

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:33.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the following week.

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:36.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body updates

00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been an important way for us to shepherd

00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:43.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire organization during the pandemic.

00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:47.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, once vaccinations
became more prevalent,

00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:49.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we faced another challenge.

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:52.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The United States branch
was struggling to get vaccines

00:09:52.612 --> 00:09:55.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those in the Bethel family
who wanted them.

00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:59.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in early April 2021,
we called together a meeting.

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:03.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all the key individuals there
from the various departments,

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone was given an assignment.

00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:10.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And within two weeks, we had enough vaccines

00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:14.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to vaccinate everyone
in the U.S. Bethel family

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:16.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who chose to be vaccinated.

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, about a week later,
we sent a letter to all branches,

00:10:19.055 --> 00:10:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraging them to investigate
the availability of vaccines

00:10:22.225 --> 00:10:23.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for special full-time servants.

00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:27.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were especially concerned
about special full-time servants

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:30.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving in lands where the government
was not yet making vaccines available.

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:33.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that direction went out,

00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:37.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a tremendous response
from a number of branches

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:40.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were able to obtain vaccines
for special full-time servants

00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:42.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to receive them.

00:10:42.913 --> 00:10:46.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several branches said
that it had seemed impossible

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:50.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get vaccines in their country
at that moment,

00:10:50.003 --> 00:10:53.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they prayed about it,
they followed the direction,

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:58.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then either that same day
or the very next day

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah opened the doors
and suddenly they had the vaccine.

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:05.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these events occurred rapidly,

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:07.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even though it was difficult

00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:09.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make so many adjustments

00:11:09.898 --> 00:11:12.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a short period of time,

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:14.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could see Jehovah’s hand

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:17.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Governing Body’s decisions.

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:20.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Television, radio, videoconferencing

00:11:20.075 --> 00:11:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have all served our brothers well,

00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:26.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which just goes to show
that Jehovah was guiding the Governing Body

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:29.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they made these decisions
so early in the pandemic.

00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:31.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, we’ve always appreciated

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:34.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the direction we receive
from the faithful slave.

00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:37.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at that unique time especially,

00:11:37.217 --> 00:11:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was so encouraging to see Jehovah use them

00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:42.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make these major decisions.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:45.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they made many that one week in March.

00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:47.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there have been many challenges

00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:50.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sad times during the pandemic,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s been amazing

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:55.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see many positive developments.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many inactive ones have returned.

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many Bible studies have been started.

00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:07.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how Jehovah guided us through

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:10.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—decision by decision, step-by-step.

00:12:10.917 --> 00:12:15.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing how Jehovah
led us through this situation

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped me to see that regardless
of what is going to come up in the future,

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:21.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to do the same thing.

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:24.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the Scriptures say, we get our plagues.

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:25.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have those times.

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But overall, when you’re in Jehovah’s arms,

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s the worry?

00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:33.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say that every one
of the Governing Body’s faith

00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:37.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was strengthened
as we got through this trial,

00:12:37.277 --> 00:12:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s just a continuous thing
of our faith being built up.

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:44.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how Jehovah is directing us!

00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:46.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s preparing his people

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:48.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for life in that new world

00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the real life that’s coming.

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:54.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a real privilege
to see Jehovah’s spirit in action

00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:56.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this pandemic.

00:12:56.755 --> 00:13:00.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s strengthened our faith
to see him use the Governing Body

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide Scripturally based direction
and keep the Kingdom work going,

00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:08.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the while showing respect for life.

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:11.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, our trust
in Jehovah’s organization

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:14.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stronger than ever before.

00:13:14.522 --> 00:13:17.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And building this trust now is vital

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:21.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah is preparing us
for future events,

00:13:21.613 --> 00:13:24.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the great tribulation.

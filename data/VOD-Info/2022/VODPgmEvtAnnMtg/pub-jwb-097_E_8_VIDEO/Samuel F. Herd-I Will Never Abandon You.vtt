00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:05.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spoke to Jehovah
just before I stepped out here.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:07.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I asked him:

00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please don’t abandon me.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I’ve ever needed you, I need you now.”

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s because of all
of these beautiful sheep

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:26.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I have the privilege
to speak to for 19 minutes.

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:30.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I want to make
the most of these 19 minutes,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
because sometimes
we have to make adjustments.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may have heard of a few adjustments

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our understanding of things already today.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there could be more adjustments

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will have to be made later on.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may recall that we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to think a certain way
some ten years ago

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:57.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the following matter.

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt that some of the anointed

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
would survive Armageddon

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move right on into the Paradise

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the other sheep

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:12.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe stay there for a given time

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then be brought to life in heaven.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:21.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we understand it,

00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:25.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
some things Jehovah
will not permit us to see,

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:29.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we read over it many, many times.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t see it until Jehovah

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
puts the light on it.

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:39.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what I’m about to reveal to you today,

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is behind it

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:44.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not the Governing Body,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
not any human here on the earth,
but Jehovah God.

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helps us to see things.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may recall

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 24

00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:58.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 29-31.

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:02.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve read it many times; I have too.

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:05.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what it says,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we felt
a little differently

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:12.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
earlier on when we read it

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:14.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
—verse 29:

00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Immediately after the tribulation
of those days

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now remember this,

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“immediately
after the tribulation of those days],

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light,

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:32.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the stars will fall from heaven,

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the powers
of the heavens will be shaken.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:40.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the sign of the Son of man
will appear in heaven,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all the tribes of the earth

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will beat themselves in grief,

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will see the Son of man
coming on the clouds of heaven

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:56.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with power and great glory.

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:59.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will send out his angels

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with a great trumpet sound,

00:03:02.198 --> 00:03:04.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now note the following]

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:07.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will gather his chosen ones

00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“together from the four winds,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from one extremity of the heavens

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the other extremity.”

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, do you see the point?

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand now

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:27.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of Christ’s anointed brothers

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be in heaven with him

00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:34.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Armageddon starts.

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the understanding that we have today.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:40.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is exciting!

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:44.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think so because of a few reasons,

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here are a few.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:50.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few of the other sheep

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
have expressed a concern on this subject.

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:56.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have said: “Does this

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“new understanding mean

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:03.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we will lose
all the anointed Christians,

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:06.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“including the Governing Body

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:09.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just when we need them

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the most?

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Will we feel abandoned

00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:18.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our time of need?”

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let me reassure you

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:24.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will not be abandoned.

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what this talk is all about.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need not think that you will be abandoned

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:34.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the anointed

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
not being in your midst any longer.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to discuss three questions.

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here they are
if you’re writing things down.

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:46.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

00:04:46.602 --> 00:04:48.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will not happen

00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the last of the anointed
leaves the earthly scene?

00:04:54.177 --> 00:04:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number two:

00:04:57.513 --> 00:04:59.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
that such things will not happen?

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen?

00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to look at these questions.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, then, what will not happen?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’d like to tell you very briefly

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:17.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
two sad stories

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:21.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
to illustrate what will not happen.

00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:25.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now here is sad story number one:

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember Jehoiada?

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:32.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a faithful high priest,
one of the best.

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:36.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he died, he was given an unusual honor.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was buried with the kings.

00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:44.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his life,
he protected the young King Jehoash

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped him to be a good king

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
who stayed faithful to Jehovah.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:55.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when old Jehoiada died,

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:58.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
the young king soon went bad.

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:01.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
He listened to wicked princes,

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he turned away from Jehovah.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s sad story number one.

00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:14.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
On its heels, we have sad story number two:

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember
that the apostle John took great joy

00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:21.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his spiritual children.

00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:24.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a good influence on them.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:28.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped many Christians to remain faithful.

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:32.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened when John died?

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he was

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sole surviving apostle,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last restraint against apostasy.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after John passed off the scene,

00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:50.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was not long

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:53.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
before something happened.

00:06:53.763 --> 00:06:55.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened when John died?

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the last restraint against apostasy

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he was the last restraint,
and now he’s gone.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:17.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after John passed off this earthly scene,

00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was not long before apostasy

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:25.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
spread like wildfire.

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And within a few decades,

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Christian congregation
went off into captivity

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Babylon the Great

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the world empire of false religion.

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:41.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why mention

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
those sad stories?

00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:46.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the reason:

00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:51.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may wonder

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in our midst today
in the Christian congregation):

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What’s going to happen when all the anointed

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:06.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘are taken to heaven?

00:08:06.302 --> 00:08:08.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will the great crowd be left

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘in the lurch?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will they

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘stray into some kind of trouble,

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe even apostasy?’

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do you think?

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you heard any signs of that already?

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s the answer: No.

00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:38.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not going to stray into apostasy

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:41.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
—absolutely not.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:44.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those Bible accounts actually

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
teach us what will not happen.

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us to the second question:

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:54.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:57.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
that such things will not happen?

00:08:58.554 --> 00:09:01.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer has a lot to do

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:04.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
with when we live.

00:09:06.495 --> 00:09:08.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not live in ancient Israel.

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:16.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t see anyone dressed like

00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:18.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
an Israelite.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of you brothers wear skirts.

00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, there’s one!
No, there’s none.

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:32.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no,

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t live in ancient Israel.

00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now you may wonder,
‘Why does that matter?’

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:40.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that nation was heading

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
for trouble from its early days.

00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:50.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Deuteronomy 31:29,

00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:53.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses uttered

00:09:53.042 --> 00:09:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
this inspired prophecy

00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
about those rebellious people.

00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:00.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is how it reads:

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know that after my death

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:05.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will surely act wickedly

00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:07.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and turn aside from the way

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
about which I have commanded you.”

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:13.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Moses’ words came true

00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:15.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
many times, not just once.

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:19.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, Jehovah had to cast off
those wicked people.

00:10:19.602 --> 00:10:24.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when King Jehoash went bad,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was just acting like many other

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
kings of Judah and Israel.

00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today things are
different among God’s people.

00:10:33.783 --> 00:10:37.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind, we do not live at the end

00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:39.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the first century C.E.

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why does that matter?

00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:46.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember in Matthew 13

00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:50.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his illustration
of the wheat and the weeds,

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:54.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus had foretold
that a great apostasy would take place.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul confirmed that Jesus’ prophecy
was already beginning

00:11:01.477 --> 00:11:05.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come true in the first century.

00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:10.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter and John verified
the same in their writings.

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:13.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the second century C.E.,

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:15.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Christian congregation

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:19.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
was corrupted and went off
into spiritual captivity

00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:21.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Babylon the Great.

00:11:21.497 --> 00:11:24.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus’ inspired prophecy

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:28.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
was fulfilled; it came true.

00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:32.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, today, things are very different

00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:35.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
among God’s people—much different.

00:11:35.177 --> 00:11:38.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
At what time are we living?

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we said, “Not back then.”

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:43.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know the answer to that.

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re blessed to be living
in a special time period.

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this began as far back as 1914.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s more than just “the last days”

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this old system of things.

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:04.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why is that?

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the Bible says—Acts 3:21.

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:12.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says it’s also called

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:16.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the times of restoration of all things.”

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let the word “restoration”
linger in your mind.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does that matter?

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re living in “the times
of restoration of all things”

00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:32.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
because pure worship has been restored.

00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:36.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re bathing in it.

00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:39.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the worship of Jehovah will <i>never </i>

00:12:39.775 --> 00:12:43.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
be corrupted <i>ever</i>  again

00:12:43.212 --> 00:12:46.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all eternity.

00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:50.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that is something to swallow

00:12:50.252 --> 00:12:53.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s tasty indeed.

00:12:53.823 --> 00:12:57.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s read Isaiah 54:17 together.

00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:03.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made this long-range prophecy
through Isaiah.

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:06.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is what it says:

00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:09.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No weapon formed against you
will have any success,

00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will condemn
any tongue that rises up

00:13:12.475 --> 00:13:14.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘against you in the judgment.

00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is the heritage

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:19.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘of the servants of Jehovah,

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:22.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their righteousness is from me,’

00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:25.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
declares Jehovah.”

00:13:25.154 --> 00:13:27.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about that, please.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No weapon

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“formed against you

00:13:32.862 --> 00:13:37.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have any success.”

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:39.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophecy says that this is

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:42.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
our “heritage.”

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:45.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those inspired words are being fulfilled

00:13:45.174 --> 00:13:48.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
now—today.

00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:51.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing can take that away,

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even “the god of this system things,”

00:13:54.984 --> 00:13:57.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan himself.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember our second question:

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:03.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:05.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when the anointed are taken to heaven,

00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
the great crowd
won’t drift away into trouble?

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:12.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:14.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they won’t rebel

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:16.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way that Jehoash did

00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:19.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehoiada died

00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
or drift off into apostasy

00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way the second-century Christians did

00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:26.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the last of the apostles,

00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:29.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
John, died off?

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:39.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s just a matter of turning the page.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the answer is

00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we do not live in ancient Israel

00:14:50.506 --> 00:14:52.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we do not live

00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:56.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the second century C.E.

00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:59.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live in a wonderful time

00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:01.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
of—what?—

00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:03.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
restoration

00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:09.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah has guaranteed us

00:15:09.858 --> 00:15:14.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘no weapon formed
against us will succeed.’

00:15:14.196 --> 00:15:16.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, our third question:

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:18.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen when the anointed
are taken to heaven?

00:15:20.936 --> 00:15:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, try to imagine that time.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a second.
It’s over.

00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:31.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
The great tribulation is underway.

00:15:31.046 --> 00:15:35.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babylon the Great, the world empire
of false religion, is destroyed first.

00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:37.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of it!

00:15:37.152 --> 00:15:39.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Events that God’s organization

00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:44.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
has prepared us for over many decades

00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
are happening before our eyes.

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then comes something else

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:54.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have been told to expect.

00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:56.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s that?

00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:58.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time during the great tribulation

00:15:58.507 --> 00:16:01.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before the war of Armageddon,

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:05.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
the remaining ones of Christ’s anointed
are taken to heaven.

00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:08.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think will happen next?

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:15.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will the great crowd wander
about lost and confused

00:16:15.858 --> 00:16:17.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
like sheep without a shepherd?

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:24.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jesus is the Shepherd.

00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:27.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will never fail to do his job.

00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:32.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind that the anointed

00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:35.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not the head of our organization.

00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:40.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is.

00:16:41.817 --> 00:16:45.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we hope all parents today
raising children

00:16:45.854 --> 00:16:47.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
will teach them that fact.

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s own Son in charge,

00:16:52.194 --> 00:16:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ’s followers here on earth
will have nothing to fear.

00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:59.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we do not know every detail

00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:03.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how Christ will lead
his people at that time.

00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are some Bible examples

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:07.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may reassure us.

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:13.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, when Moses died
before Israel entered the Promised Land,

00:17:13.048 --> 00:17:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened to God’s people?

00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:18.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, without that faithful man,

00:17:20.155 --> 00:17:22.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
were they left in the lurch?

00:17:22.524 --> 00:17:24.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is no, not at all.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as they were Jehovah’s people,

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided for them.

00:17:30.632 --> 00:17:32.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he provided richly for them.

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:34.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had an abundance.

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:37.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before Moses died,

00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told him to commission Joshua
to lead the people.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:45.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses had been training Joshua for decades.

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, there were many
other capable men taking the lead

00:17:49.518 --> 00:17:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘chiefs of thousands, hundreds,
fifties, and even tens.’

00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:56.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people were well cared for.

00:17:57.926 --> 00:18:01.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank God for Moses and Joshua.

00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:04.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example is that of Elijah.

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:07.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had been taking the lead in pure worship

00:18:07.202 --> 00:18:09.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the Israelites for decades.

00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the time came for Jehovah to transfer him

00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:16.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a different assignment
down south in Judah.

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:21.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were faithful people in the ten-tribe kingdom
of Israel left in the lurch?

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Far from it.

00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:26.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah had been training

00:18:26.388 --> 00:18:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha for years.

00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:31.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there were also
“the sons of the prophets”

00:18:31.827 --> 00:18:34.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
evidently organized into schools

00:18:34.463 --> 00:18:36.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
of some kind; we don’t know.

00:18:36.632 --> 00:18:39.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were many faithful men

00:18:39.101 --> 00:18:41.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping to lead God’s people.

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:47.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose kept advancing,
and he cared for his faithful people.

00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:50.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with those examples in mind,
what do you think

00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:53.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
will happen when the anointed
are taken to heaven?

00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:56.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t need to wonder.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles or iPads, and look

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:05.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 13:5b.

00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “For he has said:
‘I will never leave you,

00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:11.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will never abandon you.’”

00:19:13.936 --> 00:19:17.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
That tells us the simple, reassuring truth

00:19:17.439 --> 00:19:21.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
will “never abandon” his faithful ones.

00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:26.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Moses and Elijah, faithful anointed ones

00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:29.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
who take the lead today
understand the importance

00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:31.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
of training others.

00:19:31.987 --> 00:19:33.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s ongoing.

00:19:33.222 --> 00:19:35.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has been training men

00:19:35.524 --> 00:19:39.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the other sheep to take
the lead for many decades now.

00:19:39.695 --> 00:19:41.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re familiar with the many schools

00:19:41.897 --> 00:19:45.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
to train elders and missionaries
and traveling overseers

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:47.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and branch personnel.

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to that, the Governing Body
has personally been training helpers

00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:54.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the various committees
of the Governing Body.

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
These faithful men are right now

00:19:57.346 --> 00:20:00.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
carrying a very heavy load of responsibility.

00:20:00.816 --> 00:20:02.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Believe me,

00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:04.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a member of the Governing Body,

00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:07.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say for the rest of us

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need the helpers

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:12.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given us.

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:15.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for them every day.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re well-prepared
to continue in this work,

00:20:19.034 --> 00:20:21.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for Christ’s sheep

00:20:21.069 --> 00:20:25.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction of Jesus himself,
the head of the congregation.

00:20:25.407 --> 00:20:27.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is the point?

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:29.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply this:

00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:31.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the anointed are taken
to heaven near the very end

00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:35.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the great tribulation
but before Armageddon,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be no interruption
of pure worship here on the earth.

00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:42.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pure worship will keep right on going.

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:46.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thank

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:50.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah for the leadership
of Jesus Christ.

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:53.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of God’s worshippers in heaven

00:20:53.402 --> 00:20:56.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
or on earth will miss a beat.

00:20:58.273 --> 00:21:01.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, there will be an attack
from Gog of Magog,

00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:03.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it will not get very far.

00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:04.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to fail.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will not stop the great crowd
from worshipping Jehovah

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looking to him to rescue them.

00:21:10.819 --> 00:21:15.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a Rescuer he will prove to be!

00:21:15.324 --> 00:21:17.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do we answer the third question?

00:21:17.426 --> 00:21:20.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we partly know what will happen

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:23.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the great crowd when
the anointed are taken to heaven,

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:26.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that may still leave us wondering:

00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:28.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What about the anointed?

00:21:28.603 --> 00:21:33.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What will they do after they
depart the earthly scene?

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to know.’

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible answers that directly.

00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:47.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation chapter 17,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are able to learn in verse 14

00:21:52.594 --> 00:21:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the political elements of this world
will foolishly battle with the Lamb.

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:59.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will lose, of course.

00:21:59.001 --> 00:22:02.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verse says: “The Lamb will conquer them.”

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who will help him?

00:22:04.506 --> 00:22:07.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verse continues: “Also, those with him

00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:11.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are called and chosen
and faithful will do so.”

00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:15.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, who are called, chosen, and faithful?

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, it will be
 the resurrected anointed.

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:20.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the anointed are called to heaven,

00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:25.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the first assignments is to fight.

00:22:25.027 --> 00:22:26.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s interesting.

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:33.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us were fighters

00:22:33.835 --> 00:22:36.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we became true Christians.

00:22:36.905 --> 00:22:40.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even served
in various branches of the military

00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:46.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
—didn’t we, Brother Morris?

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were green berets
but not Brother Morris.

00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:01.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we became Christians.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:05.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned “the way of peace,”
and we let go of such warfare.

00:23:05.567 --> 00:23:08.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Figuratively speaking, we pulled the pin

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our last hand-grenade

00:23:11.573 --> 00:23:14.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tossed it into the air,

00:23:14.709 --> 00:23:17.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
killing no one or nothing

00:23:17.879 --> 00:23:21.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just a loud kaboom.

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:27.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in heaven, we will serve along
with Christ and his holy angels,

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:30.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
waging the final war against God’s enemies.

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’ve ever thought
that you might feel left in the lurch

00:23:35.464 --> 00:23:38.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the anointed are taken to heaven,
think of this:

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
On earth, none of us Christians
are allowed to fight.

00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:44.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us anointed ones
are too old to fight,

00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we were allowed to.

00:23:49.111 --> 00:23:51.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in heaven,

00:23:51.113 --> 00:23:53.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be mighty spirit creatures

00:23:53.748 --> 00:23:57.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
fighting alongside
our Warrior-King Jesus Christ.

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:02.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Believe me, we can and will do

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
you significantly more good in heaven

00:24:05.794 --> 00:24:09.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
than we ever could as imperfect humans

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
here on this earth!

00:24:30.118 --> 00:24:34.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m not done, but I should be.

00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the other sheep,

00:24:38.627 --> 00:24:42.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will you need to do
during that climactic time?

00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:45.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply this: hide.

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:46.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:48.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 26:20, he wrote:

00:24:48.937 --> 00:24:51.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Enter your inner rooms,

00:24:51.106 --> 00:24:53.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and shut your doors behind you.

00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:55.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hide yourself for a brief moment

00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:59.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the wrath has passed by.”

00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:01.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be hide-and-seek.

00:25:01.816 --> 00:25:05.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will hide,
and they will seek to find you,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:08.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they will not.

00:25:08.023 --> 00:25:10.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have anything to worry about?

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:13.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have nothing to worry about

00:25:13.828 --> 00:25:16.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nothing at all—

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:19.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah will never

00:25:19.467 --> 00:25:21.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
abandon you.

00:25:22.137 --> 00:25:26.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no justifiable reason
to worry about the future.

00:25:26.441 --> 00:25:30.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just be there,
brothers and sisters, to enjoy it.

00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:35.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jehovah loves you
and he will never abandon you.

00:25:36.184 --> 00:25:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please believe it.

00:25:38.186 --> 00:25:42.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will not be disappointed.

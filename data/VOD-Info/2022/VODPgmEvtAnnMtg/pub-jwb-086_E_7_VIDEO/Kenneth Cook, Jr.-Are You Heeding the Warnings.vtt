We live in a time
that will end in final judgment

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of God’s Kingdom.

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:10.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus described this time

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he gave his disciples a prophetic sign

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding his invisible presence

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at “the conclusion of the system of things.”

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since his prophecy applies to our day,

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:27.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should be very interested in its details.

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also points to a bright future

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who heed its warnings.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the prophecy

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Matthew chapters 24 and 25,

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark chapter 13,

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Luke chapter 21.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After revealing many of the things

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would occur, Jesus provided warnings

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his disciples by means of three parables.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:56.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, he gave the parable of the virgins,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.743 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
then the parable of the talents,

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:02.178 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and finally the parable

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:05.181 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the sheep and the goats.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:08.551 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The parables show how a person’s behavior

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.088 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will affect his or her final judgment.

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The two parables apply to those

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(the first two) with the heavenly hope,

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:19.963 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the third parable applies

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:22.632 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to those with an earthly hope.

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:25.668 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Yet no matter what our hope may be,

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:28.304 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all of us can learn from the warnings

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:30.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
found in Jesus’ parables.

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:33.610 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with the third parable.

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:37.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the parable of the sheep and the goats,

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus described the final judgment

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sheeplike ones and goatlike ones

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the great tribulation.

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah’s appointed Judge and King,

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will be completely righteous

00:01:50.627 --> 00:01:53.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the judgment that he gives.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a thorough Judge,

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is already observing
the actions, attitudes,

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speech of all people,

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including how they treat
his anointed brothers.

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the start of the great tribulation,

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:11.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will have identified those

00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:15.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are sheeplike or goatlike
in their conduct and attitude.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that time onward,

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who are goatlike
will not seek to change.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:23.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, those who are sheeplike

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who have the hope
of living forever on earth

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:30.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to remain faithful
in order for Jehovah

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep their names “in the book of life.”

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, just before Armageddon,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Son will pass final judgment

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all of those then living here on earth.

00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:46.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persons who are judged to be righteous

00:02:46.015 --> 00:02:49.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will enter into everlasting life on earth.

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a marvelous reward

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who keep their integrity!

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:57.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Jesus’ third parable

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to those
who hope to live on the earth,

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anointed ones too must listen

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:05.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the warning message found in that parable.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jesus is observing their actions,

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:13.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attitudes, and speech as well.

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They too must prove
to be righteous and faithful.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, a few questions remain.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, how are anointed Christians

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undergoing a period of judgment today?

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what warnings did Jesus provide for them?

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answers to both questions

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the first two parables
of Matthew chapter 25.

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:41.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To prepare us for this review,

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:45.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s briefly consider
how anointed Christians are chosen.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll start by looking
at a lesson from ancient times.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the priesthood
was established in ancient Israel,

00:03:54.617 --> 00:03:58.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah decided
who would serve as high priest

00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the underpriests
at the tabernacle.

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 28:1 tells us

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he selected
“Aaron, along with his sons.”

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:12.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one could rightly question
Jehovah’s choice,

00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those chosen
had to prove worthy of their calling.

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similar to what he did back then,

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:24.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah chooses those
who will serve as priests in heaven.

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:27.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began by selecting Jesus

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:29.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as High Priest.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:32.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Jesus was a perfect man,

00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:36.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not choose that role for himself.

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Hebrews 5:5

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:42.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the Christ did not glorify himself

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by becoming a high priest.”

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, those who will serve
as priests in heaven

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not choose themselves for this assignment.

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:56.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are selected by Jehovah

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anointed with his holy spirit.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:03.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows each one
whom he has anointed for this service.

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:07.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do faithful anointed ones
view their heavenly calling?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person is anointed by God,

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:16.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she knows without a doubt
that it is from Jehovah

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that one accepts
Jehovah’s choice with gratitude.

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of feeling proud or haughty,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anointed ones strive

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imitate Jesus’ example of humility.

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re helped to do so
by keeping in mind

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lessons and warnings

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are found in Jesus’ parables for them.

00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s noteworthy
that just before relating his parables,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke
about a “faithful and discreet slave”

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would distribute spiritual food

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the proper time during the last days.

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That slave pictures a small group

00:05:57.073 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of anointed Christian men today,
the Governing Body.

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:03.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For their faithful service, Jesus said

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:08.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be a reward,
but he also provided a warning.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spoke about what would happen

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that slave ever lost sight
of Jesus’ future return

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:18.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to mistreat his fellow slaves.

00:06:18.027 --> 00:06:20.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that were to happen,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that slave would be viewed as evil and would,

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Matthew 24:51 states,

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be ‘punished with the greatest severity.’

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note that Jesus was not prophesying

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be an evil slave.

00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:43.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a warning, not a prophecy.

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:45.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the warning?

00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:49.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That the faithful slave
needs to remain watchful.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, it is not just
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who must remain watchful.

00:06:54.797 --> 00:06:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of his parables, Jesus warned

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all anointed ones must likewise prove

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:05.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be discreet, faithful, and watchful.

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did Jesus make his point?

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:13.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the parable of the virgins, Jesus spoke

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:16.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ten virgins who went out
to meet a bridegroom.

00:07:16.552 --> 00:07:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hoped to accompany
the bridegroom into his marriage feast.

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:23.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus described five of the virgins

00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as discreet and five as foolish.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Greek word used for “discreet”

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveys the idea of understanding,

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:36.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forethought, discernment, and wisdom

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:39.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a practical sense.

00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the discreet virgins were wise,

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they showed this by being ready

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the bridegroom arrived
in the middle of the night.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had lamps to light their way.

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:56.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Matthew 25:4 adds
that “the discreet [virgins]

00:07:56.526 --> 00:08:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took oil in their flasks
along with their lamps.”

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they had the means
to keep their lamps burning.

00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they proved to be ready,

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could follow the bridegroom
into his marriage feast.

00:08:12.508 --> 00:08:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This action depicts genuine anointed ones

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entering into their heavenly reward.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be judged as worthy

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join the Bridegroom, Jesus,
in his heavenly Kingdom.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the foolish virgins?

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, unlike the discreet virgins,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the foolish ones were not ready
when the bridegroom arrived.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their lamps died out.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, they
could not follow the bridegroom

00:08:39.735 --> 00:08:42.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter into his marriage feast.

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they later tried to do so,

00:08:45.474 --> 00:08:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they heard the bridegroom tell them:

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not know you.”

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the lesson and warning

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:56.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was illustrating?

00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:59.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was showing that only anointed Christians

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “keep on the watch” and prove to be ready

00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will follow him into the reward.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, though, that Jesus did not say

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be
a large number of foolish ones

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be unprepared
when he comes in this way

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the great tribulation.

00:09:16.272 --> 00:09:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, too, this is a warning, not a prophecy.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not focused
on five of them being discreet

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and five of them being foolish.

00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:29.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was simply letting anointed ones know

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:34.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would happen
if they failed to “keep on the watch.”

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:37.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a sobering thought.

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:40.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all true Christians
should listen to the warning

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:47.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found in the parable of the virgins.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must “keep on the watch”

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:51.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and always be ready

00:09:51.807 --> 00:09:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry out our service to God.

00:09:56.112 --> 00:09:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after using the parable of the virgins

00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to emphasize the need to be discreet,

00:10:01.817 --> 00:10:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus related a parable
that highlights the need to be faithful.

00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:10.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the parable of the talents, or money.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this parable, Jesus tells about two slaves

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were faithful to their master

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:18.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one slave who was not.

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the two slaves prove to be faithful?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the faithful slaves worked hard

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to increase the money
that their master entrusted to their care

00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:31.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before he traveled abroad.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he returned, the faithful slaves

00:10:34.784 --> 00:10:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had more to give back
than what they had received

00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:40.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were blessed for doing so.

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the third slave,
the sluggish one?

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do with what he had received?

00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the sluggish slave
buried what he had been given

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:54.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and failed to increase his master’s talents.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the master returned,
that slave had nothing additional

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give to his master.

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even tried to blame the master,

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling him “a demanding man.”

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, that slave
did not receive greater blessings.

00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:13.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than that, what he had been given

00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:15.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was taken away from him,

00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was cast out
of the master’s household.

00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the master’s response mean
for each of his slaves,

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:27.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whom do they picture today?

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two faithful slaves
depict anointed Christians

00:11:32.041 --> 00:11:36.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who proved to be valued members
of the master’s household.

00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:39.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Master, Jesus, invites them

00:11:39.882 --> 00:11:42.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “enter into the joy of [their] master.”

00:11:42.718 --> 00:11:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That joy pictures their heavenly reward.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
the bad example of the sluggish slave

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides a warning for anointed ones.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:11:56.298 --> 00:12:00.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anointed ones
do not remain alert and watchful,

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:04.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could become self-satisfied
with what they have received.

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:08.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might not extend themselves
in Kingdom service.

00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could lose sight
of their responsibilities

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fail to do as 2 Peter 1:10 urges,

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they are told “to make the calling

00:12:17.686 --> 00:12:21.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and choosing sure for themselves.”

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If any of them
become like the sluggish slave,

00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:28.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would not be approved
to enter into the heavenly Kingdom

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:31.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share in the joy of the Master.

00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once again,

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:37.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was providing
a warning, not a prophecy.

00:12:37.873 --> 00:12:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, all anointed Christians

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must strive to be both discreet and faithful.

00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all true Christians are determined
to remain faithful to Jehovah.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are secure in our relationship with him.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not concerned if Jehovah

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:04.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chooses to anoint
some faithful ones in more recent years.

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:09.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We recall what Jesus said
regarding the “11th-hour” workers

00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his illustration about the vineyard.

00:13:11.807 --> 00:13:16.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can read about it in Matthew chapter 20.

00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who were invited
to work in the vineyard later in the day

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received the same reward
from the master of the vineyard

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as those who were invited
to work in it earlier in the day.

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, Jehovah and his Son
know how many anointed ones to call

00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to complete
the number of 144,000

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:39.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the end comes.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter when they are selected,

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:45.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each anointed one
who is judged to be faithful

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive their heavenly reward.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now with that in mind, let’s consider

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 24:40, 41.

00:13:56.385 --> 00:13:58.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, we’ll see how these verses

00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:02.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
connect to Jesus’ parables for the anointed.

00:14:02.858 --> 00:14:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 24:40, it reads:

00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then two men will be in the field;

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“one will be taken along
and the other abandoned.

00:14:13.302 --> 00:14:16.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Two women will be grinding at the hand mill;

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one will be taken along
and the other abandoned.”

00:14:22.678 --> 00:14:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
some similarities to the parables?

00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:29.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke of two men working in a field

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:32.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of two women working at a hand mill.

00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:36.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outwardly, they appear to be the same.

00:14:36.525 --> 00:14:41.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in each case, Jesus said
that “one [would] be taken along

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other abandoned.”

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then urged his followers
to “keep on the watch, therefore,

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you do not know
on what day your Lord is coming.”

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:56.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said something very similar

00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:59.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after relating the parable of the virgins.

00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:03.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In both examples, he provided a warning.

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:08.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the parable of the virgins
applies to anointed Christians,

00:15:08.023 --> 00:15:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do Jesus’ comments
about those who are taken along

00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also apply to the anointed?

00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:15.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It appears that they do.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here again,
Jesus was providing a warning.

00:15:20.035 --> 00:15:24.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his great prophecy regarding
“the conclusion of the system of things,”

00:15:24.406 --> 00:15:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find that Jesus lovingly highlights

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both the good news of the Kingdom,

00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as warning messages for all people,

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:35.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including his followers.

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down to this day,
our message follows the same pattern.

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:45.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is both one of salvation
as well as one of warning.

00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:47.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we must continue to do all that we can

00:15:47.796 --> 00:15:50.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver Jesus’ twofold message

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:54.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help others to act on it
while there is still time.

00:15:54.436 --> 00:15:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Jehovah and his Son want us

00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:02.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain discreet,
faithful, and on the watch.

00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we considered?

00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:09.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the virgins in Jesus’ illustration

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found out that the door was shut,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they heard the bridegroom tell them:

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:15.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not know you.”

00:16:15.824 --> 00:16:18.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the slaves

did not enter into his master’s joy

00:16:21.196 --> 00:16:24.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but was thrown outside into the darkness.

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:27.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also indicated

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that not all would be taken along
into the heavenly reward.

00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:35.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a serious warning
for those who have the heavenly hope!

00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, we are confident

00:16:38.514 --> 00:16:42.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the full number of them will be filled.

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:47.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, this is a time of judgment
for all of God’s people,

00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:51.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the righteous sheep
who yearn to live forever on earth.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is no reason for any of us

00:16:54.463 --> 00:16:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fear the final judgment that is yet ahead.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loving heavenly Father
promises to give us

00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:05.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“power beyond what is normal” so that we may,

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:09.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Luke 21:36 says,

00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:13.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“succeed in . . .
standing before the Son of man.”

00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:18.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, whether our hope
is heavenly or earthly,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must heed the warnings
found in Jesus’ parables

00:17:22.691 --> 00:17:27.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thereby keep our names
“written in the book of life.”

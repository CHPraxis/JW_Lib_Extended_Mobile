00:00:01 What will you do in the face of Satan’s attack?
00:00:05 Well, that’s a relevant question for all of us here
00:00:09 because without exception,
00:00:11 we’re under a vicious, intense attack.
00:00:15 But the question is,
00:00:17 As the battle intensifies in our individual cases,
00:00:22 will we be able to stand our ground,
00:00:25 bravely fight,
00:00:27 and come off victorious?
00:00:29 Well, obviously your desire is to be victorious—isn’t it?—
00:00:33 or you wouldn’t be attending this special program.
00:00:36 But we need more than just the desire
00:00:41 if we’re going to ensure victory.
00:00:44 In fact, to win any battle,
00:00:47 we need accurate knowledge of three things:
00:00:51 We need to know our enemy,
00:00:53 know his strategy,
00:00:55 and know what we have to defend ourselves.
00:00:58 Now, first, let’s talk about our enemy, Satan.
00:01:02 He is no ordinary foe.
00:01:05 Jehovah educates us regarding this enemy we’re fighting.
00:01:10 For one thing, he’s a premeditative murderer.
00:01:14 Look at what he did to Job’s attendants
00:01:17 —slaughtered them with marauder bands.
00:01:20 Others were consumed with fire.
00:01:22 Look at what he did to Job’s ten children.
00:01:26 He simultaneously murdered
00:01:29 all ten of them with a violent windstorm.
00:01:32 Yes, he’s a premeditative murderer.
00:01:34 He wants to murder into everlasting death every one of us here.
00:01:39 Now, on top of this, he is highly intelligent.
00:01:44 As one brother said,
00:01:46 “He may be evil, wicked, murderous, but he’s not stupid.”
00:01:51 He’s highly intelligent.
00:01:53 In fact, think about this:
00:01:55 The fact that he was once in the truth
00:01:57 makes him more intelligent in a sense, or (we could say) clever,
00:02:01 because he has knowledge of having been in the truth.
00:02:04 John 8:44 says:
00:02:06 “He did not stand fast in the truth.”
00:02:09 But he was in the truth.
00:02:10 Now, to illustrate how this makes him more dangerous,
00:02:14 think about a few of the false brothers
00:02:17 during World War II
00:02:19 who left the truth
00:02:21 and joined the Nazis in persecuting the brothers in the truth.
00:02:26 They had knowledge of who were taking the lead.
00:02:29 They knew where they lived.
00:02:31 They knew the strategy that was being utilized.
00:02:34 They were more dangerous, weren’t they?
00:02:36 Well, it’s the same with Satan.
00:02:37 Second Corinthians 11:14 says:
00:02:41 “Satan . . . keeps disguising himself
00:02:44 as an angel of light.”
00:02:46 Now, it’s very easy for him
00:02:48 to pretend to be what he used to be.
00:02:51 So that makes him more dangerous.
00:02:54 Now, open up, please, to Revelation chapter 12
00:02:57 —a very familiar scripture.
00:02:59 But let’s reason on this to help us further
00:03:03 not to underestimate, or underrate, our enemy
00:03:07 —Revelation 12:7.
00:03:11 “And war broke out in heaven:
00:03:14 “Michael and his angels battled with the dragon,
00:03:18 “and the dragon and its angels battled
00:03:21 “but they did not prevail,
00:03:23 “nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven.
00:03:26 “So down the great dragon was hurled,
00:03:30 “the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan,
00:03:34 “who is misleading the entire inhabited earth;
00:03:38 “he was hurled down to the earth,
00:03:40 and his angels were hurled down with him.”
00:03:43 And then look at verse 12:
00:03:45 “On this account be glad,
00:03:48 “you heavens and you who reside in them!
00:03:51 “Woe for the earth and for the sea,
00:03:54 “because the Devil has come down to you,
00:03:58 “having great anger,
00:04:00 knowing that he has a short period of time.”
00:04:03 Now, you notice, he’s not just mad.
00:04:06 He has “great anger.”
00:04:09 Why is he so angry?
00:04:12 Well, for one thing, after he lost the war in heaven,
00:04:16 he wasn’t merely asked to leave heaven
00:04:18 and then he quietly left.
00:04:21 We read that “he was hurled” out of heaven,
00:04:24 and that denotes thrown with great force.
00:04:28 So that undoubtedly added to his great anger.
00:04:31 But also think about this:
00:04:33 The tremendous reduction of his sphere of movement
00:04:37 adds undoubtedly to his great anger.
00:04:40 Before being cast out of heaven,
00:04:42 apparently he had access
00:04:44 to both the vast, vast physical and spiritual heavens,
00:04:48 but now he’s confined to the vicinity
00:04:52 of this little, tiny earth.
00:04:55 And if you think about it, not only does that make him mad,
00:04:58 it makes him more dangerous, doesn’t it?
00:05:00 Before being cast out of heaven,
00:05:03 undoubtedly he would try to turn away the angels part of the time
00:05:07 and he would try to turn away humans.
00:05:10 He was divided in his attention.
00:05:12 But now we have his undivided attention, don’t we?
00:05:16 So that’s bad for us, and that makes him dangerous.
00:05:19 Here’s another illustration about the increasing of the danger.
00:05:24 I’d like you to imagine that all of the Mafia members,
00:05:29 all of the drug cartel members,
00:05:32 and all of the terrorists on the entire planet Earth were gathered up
00:05:37 and were confined to New York City, the city limits,
00:05:40 and you lived there too.
00:05:42 Now, can you imagine the escalation of crime and evil
00:05:46 that would take place there?
00:05:48 Additionally, we read that he’s mad and angry
00:05:52 because he knows his time is short.
00:05:55 Now, if that was true back around 1914,
00:05:59 what about today, over 100 years later?
00:06:02 He knows his expiration date is almost here.
00:06:06 So you add it all up, and his anger
00:06:08 is truly, really white hot, you could say.
00:06:13 And he has hordes of demon helpers.
00:06:16 That makes him more dangerous too.
00:06:18 Do you think it would be possible
00:06:20 for a demon to block one of Jehovah’s good angels?
00:06:24 Well, be careful how you answer that.
00:06:26 Daniel 10:13
00:06:29 talks about the demon prince of Persia
00:06:32 blocking Jehovah’s good angel “for 21 days.”
00:06:37 Now, how was that possible?
00:06:39 Well, we don’t know for sure,
00:06:40 but perhaps the demon prince
00:06:42 before becoming a demon had been a cherub or a seraph.
00:06:47 And maybe the one sent on the assignment was a messenger angel.
00:06:50 Of course, Michael came to help the good angel,
00:06:53 and he was able to get past that demon.
00:06:56 But that scripture and others
00:06:59 help us not to underestimate the demons.
00:07:02 We can’t underestimate “the ruler of the demons”
00:07:05 nor these demons who work under his supervision.
00:07:09 So adding it up,
00:07:11 we find that Satan is a premeditative murderer.
00:07:16 He’s highly intelligent.
00:07:19 He has great anger
00:07:21 because of his great reduction of sphere of movement
00:07:24 and because of his expiration of time,
00:07:27 and he has hordes of demon helpers.
00:07:30 Now, Jehovah has given us all this information,
00:07:33 not just to fill up pages in the Bible
00:07:36 but so that we are determined
00:07:38 to recognize the enemy we’re up against
00:07:40 and that we’re determined to fight even harder
00:07:43 so that we can be victorious.
00:07:46 But now let’s take a little time
00:07:48 to get to know our enemy’s strategy.
00:07:51 Again, thanks to Jehovah, we’re not in the dark, are we?
00:07:55 Second Corinthians 2:11 says
00:07:58 “so that we may not be overreached by Satan,
00:08:02 for we are not ignorant of his designs.”
00:08:07 Why are we not ignorant?
00:08:09 Well, very kindly Jehovah has exposed
00:08:11 the full spectrum of Satan’s designs,
00:08:16 his strategies, his maneuvers.
00:08:18 He’s exposed all of them in his Word, the Bible.
00:08:21 Now that’s very kind of Jehovah —isn’t it?—
00:08:24 very kind of Jehovah.
00:08:25 Even though the Bible was written (the completion of it)
00:08:30 over 1,900 years ago,
00:08:32 Jehovah, let’s say 100 years after the Bible had been written,
00:08:36 didn’t come to the realization:
00:08:39 ‘Oh, no! I forgot to put one of Satan’s tricks in the Bible.
00:08:43 Oh, no! My people won’t be ready for it.’
00:08:46 No, Jehovah has exposed every one of them
00:08:50 in his Word, the Bible.
00:08:52 Well, what two basic categories
00:08:55 does God’s Word indicate
00:08:58 that Satan’s strategies can be divided into?
00:09:01 Well, first, we have the frontal attack.
00:09:03 Now, that’s characterized by bannings, imprisonments,
00:09:08 threats, and acts of violence,
00:09:10 such as were used on our brothers in Malawi in the past
00:09:14 and are being used today in Russia on our brothers.
00:09:18 And you don’t have to scratch your head and say,
00:09:20 ‘I wonder if I’m being persecuted.’
00:09:22 When you have the frontal attack, it’s obvious, isn’t it?
00:09:25 It’s clear—the frontal attack.
00:09:28 Has this proved to be Satan’s most successful method of attack?
00:09:34 No, not really.
00:09:36 Here’s just one experience
00:09:38 out of thousands that could be related to substantiate this point.
00:09:42 Now, this experience centers
00:09:44 around a 29-year-old brother
00:09:47 named August Dickmann.
00:09:49 Now, you probably remember this experience.
00:09:52 He was put in Sachsenhausen concentration camp
00:09:55 in 1937,
00:09:57 but then three days
00:09:59 after World War II began
00:10:02 in 1939,
00:10:04 he was ordered to sign his military induction slip.
00:10:09 Of course, he refused to do that.
00:10:11 Now, the camp commander was furious.
00:10:13 So he got permission from Himmler,
00:10:17 the head of the SS guard,
00:10:20 to publicly execute August
00:10:23 in front of all the camp inmates.
00:10:26 And he arranged a special assembly
00:10:30 after he got this permission,
00:10:32 and he had Jehovah’s Witnesses right down in front,
00:10:34 where they would get the full impact of the execution of our dear brother.
00:10:39 Well, after he was executed,
00:10:41 all the other inmates were dismissed,
00:10:44 but Jehovah’s Witnesses had to stay.
00:10:47 And with great enthusiasm,
00:10:50 the camp commander said to the Witnesses there,
00:10:53 he said, “Who is now ready to sign the declaration?”
00:10:59 Well, not one
00:11:01 of more than 400 Witnesses responded.
00:11:05 But then two stepped forward.
00:11:08 No, not to sign
00:11:10 but to ask that their signatures given about a year earlier
00:11:15 be annulled.
00:11:17 What a slap in Satan’s face!
00:11:20 And that really illustrates
00:11:22 the poor success rate of this frontal attack, see,
00:11:25 and many other experiences could be related.
00:11:28 And it’s certainly proving true
00:11:30 of our brothers in Russia today, including elderly ones.
00:11:32 The frontal attack has a very poor success rate
00:11:36 —a slap in Satan’s face.
00:11:38 But, now, what is the second category of strategy
00:11:43 that sadly has claimed many spiritual victims?
00:11:47 Let’s go to Ephesians chapter 6,
00:11:50 and here we can identify in verse 11
00:11:55 this second category.
00:11:57 “Put on the complete suit of armor from God
00:12:02 “so that you may be able to stand firm
00:12:05 against the crafty acts of the Devil.”
00:12:10 So notice that —“crafty,” sneaky, underhanded, devious.
00:12:14 Satan uses these,
00:12:17 and he’s brought down many away from Jehovah and out of the truth.
00:12:22 These “crafty acts” remind me
00:12:25 of an illustration years ago
00:12:27 in one of our publications of a soldier
00:12:29 who was looking in the distance for the enemy to come over the horizon.
00:12:33 He was looking for the frontal attack,
00:12:36 but he wasn’t looking in the rocks down by his feet.
00:12:39 There was a poisonous snake lurking.
00:12:42 And that powerfully made the point:
00:12:43 You have to watch, yes, for the frontal attack
00:12:46 but especially for the snake-in-the-rocks attacks of the Devil
00:12:51 that can really bring you down without you realizing what has happened.
00:12:55 But Jehovah assures us that we can succeed
00:12:59 in triumphing over both of these categories of attacks.
00:13:03 In fact, Psalm 91:13 is a beautiful thought.
00:13:08 It says, and Jehovah assures:
00:13:10 “You will trample underfoot
00:13:13 “the maned lion
00:13:16 and  the big snake.”
00:13:19 And the Insight  book explains that apparently in that scripture,
00:13:23 “the maned lion” represents the frontal attack,
00:13:26 the open attacks of Satan,
00:13:28 whereas “the big snake” represents the sneaky, crafty acts of the Devil.
00:13:33 But Jehovah says “you will trample” both of them “underfoot.”
00:13:38 So we can be successful over both of them.
00:13:41 Well, what are some of these snakelike, crafty acts?
00:13:44 Well, let’s just discuss two examples.
00:13:47 Here’s one: materialism.
00:13:50 Now, this has brought down many elders, ministerial servants,
00:13:55 pioneers, publishers —a very successful crafty act of the Devil.
00:13:59 It’s no coincidence that this world
00:14:03 is powerfully geared to promote materialism.
00:14:07 Relentless advertising messages
00:14:10 are designed to indoctrinate deeply
00:14:13 the idea that acquiring abundant material possessions
00:14:18 and acquiring happiness
00:14:20 are inseparably linked and directly proportional.
00:14:24 That’s really the message the world gives.
00:14:27 Isn’t that true?
00:14:29 And if we’re not careful, we can begin to think
00:14:32 like these advertising messages want us to think
00:14:35 —that we’re a poor, poor loser
00:14:38 if we don’t acquire abundant material things.
00:14:41 So, what can happen?
00:14:42 We could get sucked into this little by little.
00:14:45 We buy one item.
00:14:46 No problem, we can handle that.
00:14:49 We buy something else.
00:14:50 Well, now we need to work a little bit of overtime
00:14:53 to make the payments.
00:14:55 We keep buying.
00:14:56 Now we need to take a second job.
00:14:58 Little by little, we’re missing meetings, service,
00:15:01 and there’s less time for personal study —“the more important things.”
00:15:05 And little by little
00:15:07 (we could call Satan the god of gradualism),
00:15:11 he’ll take us away from Jehovah by means of materialism.
00:15:15 Well, here’s one more example:
00:15:17 bad association.
00:15:20 At 1 Corinthians 15:33, Jehovah says:
00:15:24 “Do not be misled.
00:15:27 Bad associations spoil useful habits.”
00:15:32 We might try to mislead ourselves:
00:15:34 ‘Oh, I can handle it; I’m strong enough.
00:15:37 Maybe I’ll even bring this person into the truth.’
00:15:40 Or others may try to mislead us.
00:15:42 But Jehovah says: “Do not be misled.”
00:15:45 And then he gives the terrible consequences.
00:15:49 Think of this illustration:
00:15:51 If you lock a man and a skunk in a closet,
00:15:56 when they come out, will the skunk smell like the man
00:16:01 or will the man smell like the skunk?
00:16:04 Well, you know the answer,
00:16:06 and Jehovah knows it works the same way with bad association.
00:16:11 Well, those are just two examples of crafty acts of the Devil.
00:16:16 There are many others.
00:16:17 They’re all exposed, though, as we said before.
00:16:19 Jehovah kindly has done that.
00:16:21 But now think of this.
00:16:22 Think of this illustration: If you’re walking in darkness
00:16:26 with a loving friend
00:16:28 and he shines a flashlight on a trap
00:16:32 that is right in front of you,
00:16:34 does the light of that flashlight remove the trap?
00:16:38 No, it just shows you where it is.
00:16:41 Now it’s up to us to go around the trap.
00:16:43 Isn’t that true?
00:16:44 How foolish to go ahead and step in that trap
00:16:47 that our friend has illuminated!
00:16:49 Well, Jehovah is the Friend in that illustration.
00:16:52 But we have to do our part, don’t we?
00:16:55 Well, we’ve thus far discussed our evil enemy
00:17:00 and his sinister strategy, which Jehovah has exposed.
00:17:04 But, now, what do we have to defend ourselves?
00:17:07 One major component of our defenses
00:17:11 is knowledge, see,
00:17:13 what we’ve just discussed:
00:17:15 knowing our enemy, knowing his strategy,
00:17:18 and then wisely utilizing that knowledge
00:17:22 provides a real protection for us.
00:17:25 There’s a saying, “To be forewarned
00:17:29 is to be forearmed.”
00:17:31 Similarly, Proverbs 4:5, 6 says in part:
00:17:37 “Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding . . . ,
00:17:41 and it will protect you.”
00:17:43 But now, additionally, we have our spiritual armor.
00:17:47 Ephesians 6:12, 13 says in part:
00:17:50 “We have a struggle . . .
00:17:52 “against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.
00:17:57 “For this reason
00:18:00 “take up the complete suit of armor from God,
00:18:04 “so that you may be able to resist . . .
00:18:07 and . . . stand firm.”
00:18:09 We’ve had some beautiful Watchtower  study articles recently
00:18:13 about each of those six pieces of that armor
00:18:17 and how we can put on and keep on each piece of the armor.
00:18:21 Without our armor, we are defenseless.
00:18:25 We’d be like a soldier on a raging battlefield,
00:18:29 dressed only in his underwear.
00:18:33 How long do you think he would survive?
00:18:36 Minutes, if that long.
00:18:39 And not only do we need the armor, but we need every piece of the armor.
00:18:42 And that’s what Ephesians 6:13 says, “the complete suit of armor.”
00:18:47 One piece of armor missing could be tragic.
00:18:52 Now, let’s illustrate this.
00:18:53 Let’s say a soldier forgets to put on his bootlike sandals.
00:18:58 He goes out into this raging battlefield,
00:19:01 and he steps on a long, sharp thorn
00:19:04 just as he’s attacked by an enemy soldier.
00:19:07 Who is going to win?
00:19:08 Well, it’s obvious.
00:19:10 We need every piece of the armor.
00:19:12 Additionally, an indispensable part of our defense system
00:19:17 is Jehovah’s holy spirit.
00:19:19 At Zechariah 4:6, the thought is made:
00:19:24 “‘Not by a military force, nor by power,
00:19:28 but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”
00:19:33 See, we don’t fight this battle in our own strength.
00:19:36 We have to have Jehovah’s holy spirit.
00:19:39 And if we have holy spirit  and we’re empowered by it,
00:19:42 if we think about it, there is no breaking point to our integrity.
00:19:47 You probably have heard the illustration
00:19:49 of the straw that broke the camel’s back.
00:19:52 And literally with a camel,
00:19:54 you could keep piling more and more weight,
00:19:57 so that finally you could put so much weight
00:19:59 (just a little more weight) that you could break its back.
00:20:01 Satan could do that to us —couldn’t he?—
00:20:03 if we were on our own.
00:20:05 But Jehovah knows when we’ve done our part
00:20:08 and we’ve gone as far as our imperfect flesh will take us,
00:20:11 and then he steps in and makes up any deficit.
00:20:16 Satan piles more; Jehovah makes up for the shortfall.
00:20:21 Satan piles more; Jehovah makes us equal to that challenge.
00:20:25 And since Jehovah is the Almighty,
00:20:27 there is literally no breaking point to our integrity.
00:20:31 In fact, one brother living in a banned country
00:20:34 refused to violate his Christian neutrality,
00:20:38 so he was stripped naked, forced to lie facedown,
00:20:42 and ruthlessly beaten for six hours on his back and his legs.
00:20:47 Spectators fainted because it was so ruthless.
00:20:50 But yet, here’s what that brother said sometime later.
00:20:52 He said: “Regardless of the amount
00:20:55 “of insulting and beatings that we received,
00:20:59 “a few seconds would pass
00:21:02 “and we would not feel anything more
00:21:04 “even though the beatings continued.
00:21:07 We were feeling that Jehovah God was always with us.”
00:21:13 Well, there we have three aspects of our defense system.
00:21:17 There are others.
00:21:18 But we discussed that we have God-given knowledge:
00:21:21 We know our enemy, we know his strategy,
00:21:23 and we know what we have to defend ourselves.
00:21:26 But then we have our spiritual armor,
00:21:28 and we have Jehovah’s holy spirit.
00:21:31 If we do our part,
00:21:33 unquestionably Jehovah always does his part.
00:21:38 And this combination is going to be unconquerable.
00:21:41 So as the battle intensifies in our individual cases,
00:21:46 we’re not going to have to turn and cowardly flee.
00:21:51 We’ll be able to stand our ground.
00:21:53 We’ll be able to bravely fight,
00:21:56 and with Jehovah’s help,
00:21:58 we will come off completely victorious
00:22:01 in the face of Satan’s attack.

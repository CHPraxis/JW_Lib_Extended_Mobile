00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:05.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do
in the face of Satan’s attack?

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a relevant question
for all of us here

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
because without exception,

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:15.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re under a vicious, intense attack.

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:17.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question is,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the battle intensifies
in our individual cases,

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
will we be able to stand our ground,

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:27.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
bravely fight,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come off victorious?

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously your desire
is to be victorious—isn’t it?—

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:36.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you wouldn’t be attending
this special program.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need more than just the desire

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re going to ensure victory.

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, to win any battle,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need accurate knowledge of three things:

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to know our enemy,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
know his strategy,

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and know what we have to defend ourselves.

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first,
let’s talk about our enemy, Satan.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is no ordinary foe.

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:10.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah educates us
regarding this enemy we’re fighting.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
he’s a premeditative murderer.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at what he did to Job’s attendants

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:20.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
—slaughtered them with marauder bands.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others were consumed with fire.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:26.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at what he did to Job’s ten children.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
He simultaneously murdered

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
all ten of them with a violent windstorm.

00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:34.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he’s a premeditative murderer.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:39.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to murder into everlasting death
every one of us here.

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:44.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on top of this,
he is highly intelligent.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
As one brother said,

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:51.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He may be evil, wicked, murderous,
but he’s not stupid.”

00:01:51.094 --> 00:01:53.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s highly intelligent.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:55.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, think about this:

00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:57.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that he was once in the truth

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:01.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes him more intelligent in a sense,
or (we could say) clever,

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he has knowledge
of having been in the truth.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 8:44 says:

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He did not stand fast in the truth.”

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was in the truth.

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:14.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to illustrate
how this makes him more dangerous,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about a few of the false brothers

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
during World War II

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:21.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
who left the truth

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joined the Nazis
in persecuting the brothers in the truth.

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had knowledge
of who were taking the lead.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew where they lived.

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew the strategy
that was being utilized.

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were more dangerous, weren’t they?

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s the same with Satan.

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 11:14 says:

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Satan . . . keeps disguising himself

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an angel of light.”

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s very easy for him

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:51.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pretend to be what he used to be.

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:54.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that makes him more dangerous.

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:57.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, open up, please,
to Revelation chapter 12

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very familiar scripture.

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:03.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s reason on this to help us further

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to underestimate, or underrate, our enemy

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation 12:7.

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And war broke out in heaven:

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:18.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Michael and his angels battled
with the dragon,

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the dragon and its angels battled

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they did not prevail,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor was a place found for them
any longer in heaven.

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So down the great dragon was hurled,

00:03:30.393 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the original serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth;

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was hurled down to the earth,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his angels were hurled down with him.”

00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:45.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then look at verse 12:

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On this account be glad,

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:51.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you heavens and you who reside in them!

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Woe for the earth and for the sea,

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:58.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the Devil has come down to you,

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“having great anger,

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:03.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that he has a short period of time.”

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice, he’s not just mad.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has “great anger.”

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is he so angry?

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:16.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
after he lost the war in heaven,

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:18.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t merely asked to leave heaven

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he quietly left.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:24.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read that “he was hurled” out of heaven,

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:28.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that denotes thrown with great force.

00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:31.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that undoubtedly added to his great anger.

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:33.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
But also think about this:

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tremendous reduction
of his sphere of movement

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:40.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
adds undoubtedly to his great anger.

00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:42.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before being cast out of heaven,

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
apparently he had access

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:48.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
to both the vast, vast physical
and spiritual heavens,

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:52.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now he’s confined to the vicinity

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this little, tiny earth.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:58.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,
not only does that make him mad,

00:04:58.614 --> 00:05:00.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
it makes him more dangerous, doesn’t it?

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before being cast out of heaven,

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
undoubtedly he would try to turn away
the angels part of the time

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would try to turn away humans.

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:12.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was divided in his attention.

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:16.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we have his undivided attention,
don’t we?

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s bad for us,
and that makes him dangerous.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another illustration
about the increasing of the danger.

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:29.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like you to imagine
that all of the Mafia members,

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the drug cartel members,

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of the terrorists
on the entire planet Earth were gathered up

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were confined to New York City,
the city limits,

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you lived there too.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you imagine
the escalation of crime and evil

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would take place there?

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:52.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we read that he’s mad and angry

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he knows his time is short.

00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if that was true back around 1914,

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
what about today, over 100 years later?

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:06.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows his expiration date is almost here.

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:08.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you add it all up,
and his anger

00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:13.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
is truly, really white hot,
you could say.

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he has hordes of demon helpers.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:18.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes him more dangerous too.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think it would be possible

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a demon to block
one of Jehovah’s good angels?

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, be careful how you answer that.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel 10:13

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
talks about the demon prince of Persia

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:37.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
blocking Jehovah’s good angel “for 21 days.”

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how was that possible?

00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know for sure,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
but perhaps the demon prince

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
before becoming a demon
had been a cherub or a seraph.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe the one sent on the assignment
was a messenger angel.

00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:53.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
Michael came to help the good angel,

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:56.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was able to get past that demon.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:59.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that scripture and others

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us not to underestimate the demons.

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:05.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t underestimate
“the ruler of the demons”

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:09.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor these demons
who work under his supervision.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
So adding it up,

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:16.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that Satan
is a premeditative murderer.

00:07:16.586 --> 00:07:19.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s highly intelligent.

00:07:19.122 --> 00:07:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has great anger

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:24.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his great reduction
of sphere of movement

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of his expiration of time,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has hordes of demon helpers.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:33.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah has given us
all this information,

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just to fill up pages in the Bible

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:38.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so that we are determined

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:40.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
to recognize the enemy we’re up against

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we’re determined
to fight even harder

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:46.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can be victorious.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s take a little time

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to know our enemy’s strategy.

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:55.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, thanks to Jehovah,
we’re not in the dark, are we?

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:58.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 2:11 says

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:02.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may not be overreached by Satan,

00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:07.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
for we are not ignorant of his designs.”

00:08:07.036 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are we not ignorant?

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:11.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, very kindly Jehovah has exposed

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
the full spectrum of Satan’s designs,

00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:18.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
his strategies, his maneuvers.

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s exposed all of them
in his Word, the Bible.

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:24.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that’s very kind of Jehovah
—isn’t it?—

00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:25.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
very kind of Jehovah.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:30.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though the Bible was written
(the completion of it)

00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 1,900 years ago,

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:36.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, let’s say 100 years
after the Bible had been written,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t come to the realization:

00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:43.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, no! I forgot to put one
of Satan’s tricks in the Bible.

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:46.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no! My people won’t be ready for it.’

00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:50.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah has exposed every one of them

00:08:50.413 --> 00:08:52.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his Word, the Bible.

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:55.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what two basic categories

00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:58.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
does God’s Word indicate

00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:01.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan’s strategies can be divided into?

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first, we have the frontal attack.

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:08.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s characterized
by bannings, imprisonments,

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:10.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
threats, and acts of violence,

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as were used on our brothers
in Malawi in the past

00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:18.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are being used today
in Russia on our brothers.

00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you don’t have to scratch
your head and say,

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I wonder if I’m being persecuted.’

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you have the frontal attack,
it’s obvious, isn’t it?

00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:28.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s clear—the frontal attack.

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:33.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this proved to be
Satan’s most successful method of attack?

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:09:36.192 --> 00:09:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s just one experience

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:42.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of thousands that could be related
to substantiate this point.

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:44.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this experience centers

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:47.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
around a 29-year-old brother

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:49.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
named August Dickmann.

00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you probably remember this experience.

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was put
in Sachsenhausen concentration camp

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:57.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1937,

00:09:57.313 --> 00:09:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then three days

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:02.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
after World War II began

00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:04.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1939,

00:10:04.754 --> 00:10:09.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was ordered to sign
his military induction slip.

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:11.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, he refused to do that.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the camp commander was furious.

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he got permission from Himmler,

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:20.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
the head of the SS guard,

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:23.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to publicly execute August

00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:26.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
in front of all the camp inmates.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:30.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he arranged a special assembly

00:10:30.012 --> 00:10:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
after he got this permission,

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:34.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had Jehovah’s Witnesses
right down in front,

00:10:34.517 --> 00:10:39.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they would get the full impact
of the execution of our dear brother.

00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:41.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after he was executed,

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the other inmates were dismissed,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah’s Witnesses had to stay.

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:50.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with great enthusiasm,

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:53.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
the camp commander
said to the Witnesses there,

00:10:53.969 --> 00:10:58.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said,
“Who is now ready to sign the declaration?”

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:01.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, not one

00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:05.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 400 Witnesses responded.

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then two stepped forward.

00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not to sign

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:15.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to ask that their signatures
given about a year earlier

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:17.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
be annulled.

00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:20.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a slap in Satan’s face!

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:22.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really illustrates

00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
the poor success rate
of this frontal attack, see,

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:28.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many other experiences could be related.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s certainly proving true

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:32.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers in Russia today,
including elderly ones.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:36.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
The frontal attack
has a very poor success rate

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:38.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a slap in Satan’s face.

00:11:38.848 --> 00:11:43.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now,
what is the second category of strategy

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:47.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sadly has claimed
many spiritual victims?

00:11:47.256 --> 00:11:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Ephesians chapter 6,

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here we can identify in verse 11

00:11:55.231 --> 00:11:57.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
this second category.

00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:02.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may be able to stand firm

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:10.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:14.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice that
—“crafty,” sneaky, underhanded, devious.

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan uses these,

00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:22.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s brought down many
away from Jehovah and out of the truth.

00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:25.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
These “crafty acts” remind me

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:27.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an illustration years ago

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
in one of our publications of a soldier

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:33.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was looking in the distance
for the enemy to come over the horizon.

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:36.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was looking for the frontal attack,

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:39.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he wasn’t looking
in the rocks down by his feet.

00:12:39.275 --> 00:12:42.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a poisonous snake lurking.

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that powerfully made the point:

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:46.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to watch,
yes, for the frontal attack

00:12:46.148 --> 00:12:51.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially for the snake-in-the-rocks
attacks of the Devil

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can really bring you down
without you realizing what has happened.

00:12:55.624 --> 00:12:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah assures us that we can succeed

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:03.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
in triumphing over both
of these categories of attacks.

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:08.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Psalm 91:13 is a beautiful thought.

00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:10.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says, and Jehovah assures:

00:13:10.606 --> 00:13:13.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will trample underfoot

00:13:13.742 --> 00:13:16.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the maned lion

00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>and</i>  the big snake.”

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:23.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Insight</i>  book explains
that apparently in that scripture,

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:26.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the maned lion”
represents the frontal attack,

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
the open attacks of Satan,

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas “the big snake” represents
the sneaky, crafty acts of the Devil.

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:38.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah says
“you will trample” both of them “underfoot.”

00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can be successful over both of them.

00:13:41.604 --> 00:13:44.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what are some
of these snakelike, crafty acts?

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:47.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s just discuss two examples.

00:13:47.643 --> 00:13:50.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one: materialism.

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:55.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this has brought down
many elders, ministerial servants,

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
pioneers, publishers
—a very successful crafty act of the Devil.

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:03.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s no coincidence that this world

00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:07.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
is powerfully geared to promote materialism.

00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Relentless advertising messages

00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:13.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
are designed to indoctrinate deeply

00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:18.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea that acquiring
abundant material possessions

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and acquiring happiness

00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:24.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
are inseparably linked
and directly proportional.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s really the message the world gives.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:32.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re not careful,
we can begin to think

00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:35.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
like these advertising messages
want us to think

00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:38.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that we’re a poor, poor loser

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we don’t acquire abundant material things.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can happen?

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:45.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could get sucked
into this little by little.

00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:46.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
We buy one item.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
No problem, we can handle that.

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:50.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
We buy something else.

00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:53.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we need
to work a little bit of overtime

00:14:53.609 --> 00:14:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the payments.

00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:56.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep buying.

00:14:56.545 --> 00:14:58.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we need to take a second job.

00:14:58.747 --> 00:15:01.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little by little,
we’re missing meetings, service,

00:15:01.717 --> 00:15:05.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s less time for personal study
—“the more important things.”

00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And little by little

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:11.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
(we could call Satan the god of gradualism),

00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll take us away from Jehovah
by means of materialism.

00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:17.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s one more example:

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:20.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
bad association.

00:15:20.035 --> 00:15:24.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 15:33, Jehovah says:

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:15:27.443 --> 00:15:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might try to mislead ourselves:

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, I can handle it; I’m strong enough.

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:40.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I’ll even bring this person
into the truth.’

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or others may try to mislead us.

00:15:42.257 --> 00:15:45.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah says: “Do not be misled.”

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:49.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he gives the terrible consequences.

00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:51.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of this illustration:

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you lock a man and a skunk in a closet,

00:15:56.839 --> 00:16:01.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they come out,
will the skunk smell like the man

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
or will the man smell like the skunk?

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know the answer,

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:10.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah knows it works the same way
with bad association.

00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:16.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those are just two examples
of crafty acts of the Devil.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:17.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many others.

00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:19.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re all exposed, though,
as we said before.

00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:21.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah kindly has done that.

00:16:21.797 --> 00:16:22.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now think of this.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:26.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of this illustration:
If you’re walking in darkness

00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:28.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a loving friend

00:16:28.537 --> 00:16:32.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he shines a flashlight on a trap

00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:34.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is right in front of you,

00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:38.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
does the light of that flashlight
remove the trap?

00:16:38.447 --> 00:16:41.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it just shows you where it is.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s up to us to go around the trap.

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:44.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:16:44.787 --> 00:16:47.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
How foolish to go ahead and step in that trap

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our friend has illuminated!

00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:52.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah is the Friend
in that illustration.

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have to do our part, don’t we?

00:16:55.698 --> 00:17:00.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve thus far discussed our evil enemy

00:17:00.502 --> 00:17:04.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his sinister strategy,
which Jehovah has exposed.

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:07.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now,
what do we have to defend ourselves?

00:17:07.376 --> 00:17:11.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
One major component of our defenses

00:17:11.013 --> 00:17:13.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
is knowledge, see,

00:17:13.148 --> 00:17:15.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’ve just discussed:

00:17:15.317 --> 00:17:18.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing our enemy, knowing his strategy,

00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:22.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then wisely utilizing that knowledge

00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:25.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides a real protection for us.

00:17:25.527 --> 00:17:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a saying,
“To be forewarned

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:31.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to be forearmed.”

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Proverbs 4:5, 6 says in part:

00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:41.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Acquire wisdom,
acquire understanding . . . ,

00:17:41.443 --> 00:17:43.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will protect you.”

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:47.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, additionally,
we have our spiritual armor.

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:50.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 6:12, 13 says in part:

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:52.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have a struggle . . .

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:57.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against the wicked spirit forces
in the heavenly places.

00:17:57.893 --> 00:18:00.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this reason

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:04.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“take up
the complete suit of armor from God,

00:18:04.399 --> 00:18:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may be able to resist . . .

00:18:07.035 --> 00:18:09.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
and . . . stand firm.”

00:18:09.404 --> 00:18:13.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had some beautiful
<i>Watchtower</i>  study articles recently

00:18:13.709 --> 00:18:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
about each of those six pieces of that armor

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:21.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can put on
and keep on each piece of the armor.

00:18:21.283 --> 00:18:25.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without our armor,
we are defenseless.

00:18:25.487 --> 00:18:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d be like a soldier
on a raging battlefield,

00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:31.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
dressed only in his underwear.

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:36.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long do you think he would survive?

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Minutes, if that long.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:42.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not only do we need the armor,
but we need every piece of the armor.

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:47.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what Ephesians 6:13 says,
“the complete suit of armor.”

00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:52.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
One piece of armor missing could be tragic.

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:53.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s illustrate this.

00:18:53.949 --> 00:18:58.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s say a soldier forgets
to put on his bootlike sandals.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
He goes out into this raging battlefield,

00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:04.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he steps on a long, sharp thorn

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he’s attacked by an enemy soldier.

00:19:07.596 --> 00:19:08.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is going to win?

00:19:08.964 --> 00:19:10.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s obvious.

00:19:10.098 --> 00:19:12.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need every piece of the armor.

00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:17.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, an indispensable part
of our defense system

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:19:19.474 --> 00:19:24.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Zechariah 4:6, the thought is made:

00:19:24.012 --> 00:19:28.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:33.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by my spirit,’
says Jehovah of armies.”

00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, we don’t fight this battle
in our own strength.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to have Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:19:39.228 --> 00:19:42.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we have holy spirit 
and we’re empowered by it,

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:47.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we think about it,
there is no breaking point to our integrity.

00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:49.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
You probably have heard the illustration

00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the straw that broke the camel’s back.

00:19:52.507 --> 00:19:54.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And literally with a camel,

00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:57.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could keep piling
more and more weight,

00:19:57.546 --> 00:19:59.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that finally you could put so much weight

00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:01.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
(just a little more weight)
that you could break its back.

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:03.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan could do that to us
—couldn’t he?—

00:20:03.752 --> 00:20:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we were on our own.

00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah knows when we’ve done our part

00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:11.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve gone as far
as our imperfect flesh will take us,

00:20:11.927 --> 00:20:16.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he steps in
and makes up any deficit.

00:20:16.932 --> 00:20:21.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan piles more;
Jehovah makes up for the shortfall.

00:20:21.203 --> 00:20:25.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan piles more;
Jehovah makes us equal to that challenge.

00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:27.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since Jehovah is the Almighty,

00:20:27.442 --> 00:20:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is literally no breaking point
to our integrity.

00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:34.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
one brother living in a banned country

00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
refused to violate his Christian neutrality,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he was stripped naked,
forced to lie facedown,

00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:47.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ruthlessly beaten for six hours
on his back and his legs.

00:20:47.362 --> 00:20:50.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spectators fainted
because it was so ruthless.

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:52.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But yet,
here’s what that brother said sometime later.

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:55.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:
“Regardless of the amount

00:20:55.304 --> 00:20:59.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of insulting and beatings that we received,

00:20:59.608 --> 00:21:02.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a few seconds would pass

00:21:02.077 --> 00:21:04.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we would not feel anything more

00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:07.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even though the beatings continued.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:12.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were feeling
that Jehovah God was always with us.”

00:21:13.322 --> 00:21:17.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have three aspects
of our defense system.

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:18.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are others.

00:21:18.593 --> 00:21:21.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we discussed
that we have God-given knowledge:

00:21:21.763 --> 00:21:23.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know our enemy,
we know his strategy,

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:26.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know what we have
to defend ourselves.

00:21:26.234 --> 00:21:28.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we have our spiritual armor,

00:21:28.971 --> 00:21:31.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:21:31.673 --> 00:21:33.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do our part,

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:38.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
unquestionably Jehovah always does his part.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this combination
is going to be unconquerable.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the battle intensifies
in our individual cases,

00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:51.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not going to have to turn
and cowardly flee.

00:21:51.093 --> 00:21:53.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be able to stand our ground.

00:21:53.862 --> 00:21:56.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be able to bravely fight,

00:21:56.198 --> 00:21:58.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with Jehovah’s help,

00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:01.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will come off completely victorious

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of Satan’s attack.

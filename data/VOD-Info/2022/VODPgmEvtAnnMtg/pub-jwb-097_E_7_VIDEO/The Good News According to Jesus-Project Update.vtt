At the 2020 annual meeting,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we announced an exciting new video project,

00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:09.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris made
the following encouraging statement.

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:16.328 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Will there be challenges?

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Oh yeah, guaranteed.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.666 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But if Jehovah wants something done,

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.668 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that’s what happens.

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How true those words have proven to be!

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To date,
the largest feature drama

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services had produced

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a little over 100 minutes in length. 

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:41.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>
spans nearly 1,000 minutes of content!

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are happy to update you
on this exciting project

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share different ways Jehovah
has helped us to overcome various challenges.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters already serving
at the Australasia branch were key

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to helping us get the facilities ready.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they handle this special assignment,
especially during the pandemic?

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.215 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were all very excited,

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.842 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but as the scope

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.469 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of this project became clear,

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.679 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there were times when we wondered how

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our small publisher base
of around 68,000

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be able to fully support
this large undertaking.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re a small department,

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:25.814 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a small branch that we’re at.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:27.399 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And all of a sudden,

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.401 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we had this project highlighted

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was three times our normal workload.

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after we received approval
for the project, the branch territory

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
experienced terrible bushfires
raging right throughout the country.

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Straight after this were floods.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, many of our brothers
experienced double disasters.

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we then started to recover from this

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and build momentum to start the project,

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the COVID-19 pandemic began.

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the deliveries
of construction materials

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming into the branch
had to be quarantined

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:04.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(all of the bulk supplies
that the Construction Department was using).

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that meant there was a time period

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those things to be unavailable for use.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the logistics 

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of (once all those bulk supplies
came out of quarantine)

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then moving them to where they’re needed
on the site 

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when new deliveries
are coming in and managing

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:19.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that safely
with the COVID-19 risks

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the risks of interaction
with the delivery drivers and the contractors

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was complicated
and very time-consuming for all involved.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed help from our brothers 
and sisters outside of Bethel.

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we put the call out,
and they came from all over

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the branch territory to help.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of them traveled days on rough
and rugged roads

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come and help us.

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they arrived,

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spent a time in quarantine,
and then they were able to come

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us safely on-site.

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.273 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There were specific items

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:50.733 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
needed for the project.

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:52.401 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we asked the brothers and sisters

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to help to see where or how

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:56.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could obtain them.

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:59.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so heartwarming
to see all the responses flooding in.

00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within a short amount of time,
we had received offers

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:06.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for donations or loans 
for much of the heavy machinery

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or large equipment we needed

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even things like plants for landscaping.

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we brought in a number
of temporary workers,

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:17.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a number of remote workers
as well were added to the team.

00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:20.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Branch Committee
made available a large car parking area

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could
quarantine off all of the deliveries

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and handle those things safely
and in line with the guidelines.

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:27.978 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So at the beginning of the project,

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:30.355 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the number was about 200 people

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:31.899 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the family,

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that quickly grew to around 500.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while we have a beautiful kitchen
here to serve food from,

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wasn’t really designed
for 500 meals each day.

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Branch Committee

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as our various departments,

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although they had
a heavy workload themselves,

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to extend a helping hand.

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:55.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we lost commuters,

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we gained some workers
from various departments

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helped us in various tasks
within Food Service.

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:07.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was clear to everybody
in the department and at the branch

00:04:07.226 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it really needed to be a team effort,

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everybody went above and beyond
to make this work.

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that only takes you so far.

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s blessing on the arrangements,

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:20.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the qualities that he helps us to show,

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the motivation that he helps us to have

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome those challenges
and to take on things that really

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are beyond what we can normally cope with

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:32.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—seeing that particularly
as we look back on a number

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those challenges
and how they’ve been overcome—

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see Jehovah’s involvement day to day.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother had a trailer 
that was going to be donated to the project,

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t have the funds
to pay for the freight.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:47.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the very same time,
a sister contacted the branch

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to donate specifically
to the project.

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The amount she donated
was the amount that was needed

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cover the freight
to bring the trailer to Bethel.

00:04:56.692 --> 00:05:00.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother made a 30-hour
round-trip to deliver

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:03.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large quantity of goods
he manufactured for us.

00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made this trip, not once or twice,
but multiple times,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even planning the work 
around two surgeries he had to have.

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A number of trucks were required
to freight the goods,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so members of his family and congregation

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:22.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared in the driving
while local brothers extended hospitality.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very impressed

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:27.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the level of appreciation

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:30.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sense of gratitude
that permeates the family.

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing that is

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:37.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a real boost for us and a real blessing.

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:41.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel very appreciative for everyone
who’s been able to help on this project,

00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we recognize the personal

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:46.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and collective sacrifices
that have been made.

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:49.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those who have been able
to come in and help us on the project

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell us how thankful they are
to have had a share in the project.

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah can create
a situation like this.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:03.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always finds a way
to help us do his will,

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often providing solutions
we never thought possible.

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:13.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to preparing
the Australasia facility for the project,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much work has been done

00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:20.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with script development, casting,
and location scouting.

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:22.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has this progressed?

00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:25.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We recognized that there

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:29.368 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be many needed adjustments

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:30.702 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the branch there

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:33.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as far as facilities are concerned.

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:35.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that there would be the need

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:37.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many volunteers to be involved

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the project,
and we knew it was going to be

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coordinated from halfway around the world.

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:47.094 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The challenge with finding locations

00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:48.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the Gospel accounts

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that they need to look like ancient lands

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:53.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but be placed in a modern world.

00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:57.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to have no signs of civilization

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet be close enough to civilization
to support our modern filming operations.

00:07:03.402 --> 00:07:06.363 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’re asked to flesh out an entire world,

00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:08.407 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a culture,

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hundreds or,
actually, thousands

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:13.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of characters that appear in these accounts

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:15.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to do so with very limited information

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:17.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually in the Bible.

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:20.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we add enough details
to connect with the audience

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:24.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do so without overstepping
by introducing teachings

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:29.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ideas that contradict
the Bible’s message?

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can truly say it was a worldwide effort
on the part of our brothers and sisters.

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:36.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was especially encouraging

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:38.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how young ones

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:40.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responded to this need.

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:42.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were looking to extend themselves

00:07:42.607 --> 00:07:44.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their service to Jehovah,
and they were willing

00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:46.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to adjust their secular jobs.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were willing to move

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to other locations in order to be able

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support this project.

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:56.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were looking at how we could

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:59.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
accomplish so many auditions

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a shorter period of time.

00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:04.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we came up with the idea
of a self-guided audition

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we put a package together

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:10.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identifying how the audition needs

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:14.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be accomplished and we send it
to the publisher that’s being auditioned,

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:16.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they record their own audition

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:18.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send it back to us for processing.

00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:23.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were at some of the locations,
we actually did test filming.

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:27.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We put actors in wardrobe in front
of the camera and re-created certain scenes

00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:31.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how this location
could be used for our project.

00:08:31.573 --> 00:08:35.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to travel to more than
a dozen locations during a month,

00:08:35.952 --> 00:08:39.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone returned happy and healthy.

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:41.166 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There are some accounts in the Gospels

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.085 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that reference large groups,

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:44.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
such as the Sermon on the Mount

00:08:44.753 --> 00:08:46.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when Jesus preached from the boat.

00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:48.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would we show that many people?

00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The team took time to test various methods,

00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:56.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including some computer graphics
as well as different styles

00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:59.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and methods to be used
to duplicate people

00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:01.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for these large crowds.

00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:04.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The production team was able to see

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did and did not work,
and this is very beneficial because it helps

00:09:08.693 --> 00:09:12.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
us to plan appropriately
for the actual production day.

00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:15.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it’s simply a matter
of going and doing

00:09:15.617 --> 00:09:17.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as much research as possible
to find out what is known.

00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
there’s an entire team

00:09:20.997 --> 00:09:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devoted to doing research
for our publications.

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:25.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have access
to those brothers and sisters.

00:09:25.502 --> 00:09:28.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that has been
incredibly valuable for every screenwriter

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this project is to see

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
members of the Teaching Committee
sit at every table read for each script

00:09:35.178 --> 00:09:37.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then proceed to give us direction,

00:09:37.514 --> 00:09:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask questions, give us direction

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:44.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what to go and research further,
what to remove, and (in many cases)

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what to add.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:47.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows how deeply they’re

00:09:47.482 --> 00:09:49.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invested in the story of Jesus’ life.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like Jehovah
had taken us and placed us

00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:56.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a land thousands of years ago.

00:09:57.576 --> 00:10:01.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got to these various locations,
we literally would

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:03.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jump out of the vehicles
and run across the landscape

00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:05.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in excitement for how
we could potentially use them.

00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:10.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the biggest challenges we had
was getting everyone back into the vehicles

00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:13.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could go on to the next location.

00:10:13.383 --> 00:10:16.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to one property, and when
we talked with the brother,

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “This isn’t my property.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This belongs to Jehovah.

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:24.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m holding onto it (I’m not sure why),

00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:27.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hoping that perhaps Jehovah
can use it in some way.”

00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:31.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think 
about all of our brothers and sisters

00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:34.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming together to support this initiative,

00:10:34.237 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really has been a blessing
to be able to witness that.

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:39.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really reminds me of what is said

00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:43.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 133:1,
where it said it would be “good”

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:46.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see brothers and sisters
‘dwelling together in unity.’

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve seen that goodness.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen our brotherhood really
rally around supporting this project

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:54.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many ways.

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:56.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it has contributed toward

00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:59.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spirit that has allowed Jehovah
to bless the work.

00:11:01.348 --> 00:11:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see how the design
and construction aspects

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:08.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the work are progressing,
including the historical sets?

00:11:10.023 --> 00:11:12.275 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, one of the biggest challenges we’ve had

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:14.277 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the Design/Construction world

00:11:14.277 --> 00:11:16.696 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to get the mentality

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:19.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re designing
and building something

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:22.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that needs to look 2,000 years old.

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:25.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re used to building modern buildings,

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:26.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we’re used to using the materials

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we have today,

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.167 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but to now use those

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:31.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide something that was ancient,

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:33.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going
to be quite the challenge.

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:35.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In Jesus’ ministry,

00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:37.342 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he went to numerous different towns,

00:11:37.342 --> 00:11:38.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and those towns

00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:39.970 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would have had different looks

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the natural products

00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:45.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were available to the tradesmen then
to build those buildings.

00:11:48.395 --> 00:11:49.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Back in ancient Israel,

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:52.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the building materials would have been stone,

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.609 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so they would have used limestone, basalt,

00:11:54.609 --> 00:11:57.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
field stones,
and even clay bricks.

00:11:57.112 --> 00:11:58.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s probably

00:11:58.947 --> 00:12:02.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just over 100 doors and gates out there.

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:05.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are also over 200 windows,

00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:07.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve got shutters,
and all of these need

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:10.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either timber lintels or timber sills.

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:14.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have tradesmen
who are used to getting things,

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:16.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say, nearly perfect.

00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:20.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normally as a renderer, or a plasterer,
you would cover up cracks,

00:12:20.844 --> 00:12:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here we’re having
to actually create these.

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:25.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That can be quite a challenge.

00:12:27.183 --> 00:12:29.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back a few years ago,
there were various branches

00:12:29.644 --> 00:12:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were put forward as possibilities,
as options.

00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:36.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the end,
the Australasia branch was chosen.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time
in the Design/Construction world,

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:42.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we thought,
‘Well, that was an interesting choice.’

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:47.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during 2020, during the pandemic,
we found out in retrospect

00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:50.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was one
of the only places on earth

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where this project could be completed now.

00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:56.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the low incidence
of COVID in the country,

00:12:56.296 --> 00:12:58.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were able to use outside contractors

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:02.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come in to the project
to do part of the site work for us.

00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:06.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s been a blessing to have
the project take place

00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:09.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at this location.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:12.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those that we had on-site here
already were very

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:15.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open-minded,
and they had a lot of creative thinking

00:13:15.732 --> 00:13:18.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it came to building historical

00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:21.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets now with modern materials.

00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:26.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have about 7,000 square meters
of render to accomplish,

00:13:26.743 --> 00:13:30.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll have two teams working full-time

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:33.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for several months to accomplish this.

00:13:39.005 --> 00:13:42.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this particular type of work,
nobody’s trade really counted;

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:44.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everybody had to try.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:46.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of our sisters, in fact,

00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:49.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were the ones that had the skills
that were needed to create

00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:52.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the historical effect that was required.

00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:58.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To achieve the weathering
that would happen on the stone

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it sat there for hundreds of years
out in the weather—

00:14:01.611 --> 00:14:05.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The water would get into the stone
and slowly break it down.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then there are going to be areas

00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:11.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the stone that are softer,
so they’ll wear away quicker.

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:14.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then that’s done with the wire brush.

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:17.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then some spots with the acetone,

00:14:17.377 --> 00:14:20.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it puts little divots into the stone,

00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:23.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which occur naturally in limestone.

00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:26.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the project is completed in the backlot,

00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:28.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters will have applied 

00:14:28.054 --> 00:14:33.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to four and a half thousand square meters
of stone finish to the buildings.

00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been amazing to see how

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:44.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a variety of backgrounds (despite this),

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:47.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve been able to achieve
quite amazing things

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:52.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just their willing spirit,
prepared to take

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on board the instruction.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can see Jehovah’s blessing behind it.

00:14:57.167 --> 00:15:02.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the temple area, in the backlot,
there are a little over 4,000 square meters

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:05.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of concrete that has been made
to look like stone.

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:09.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one of the contractors who quoted
on the job was actually a brother.

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:12.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that particular brother said:
“Well, you know what?

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:13.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can volunteer to do this.

00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:16.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there are enough brothers around
that we can bring together,

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:20.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we would be more than happy
to be able to do it on a volunteer basis.”

00:15:20.231 --> 00:15:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So an isolated area was set up where
these brothers could

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:26.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
test and sample and produce

00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the concrete that was needed
for the floor finish of the temple.

00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:32.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for over 27 days of straight pours,

00:15:32.702 --> 00:15:35.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had approximately 30 brothers and sisters

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.791 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
each day come in and work tirelessly

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.292 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be able to accomplish

00:15:39.292 --> 00:15:41.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this temple floor for us.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.006 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The last day of the concrete pour,

00:15:45.006 --> 00:15:47.509 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we wanted to surprise the brothers,

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:50.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because someone had made
a sign saying: “United in spirit.”

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:54.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But actually,
the construction Bethelites surprised us.

00:15:54.557 --> 00:15:58.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all had balloons and signs,
and it spelled out “Thank you.”

00:15:58.686 --> 00:16:01.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that just reflected
how we love each other

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:04.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we’d give our life for each other

00:16:04.192 --> 00:16:08.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we both serve the same God
and we love Jehovah.

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through lots of sleepless nights
and a bit of prayer about it,

00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:15.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we ended up finding a brother
who owned a sawmill and had property

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with trees on it,
and he willingly chopped down the trees

00:16:19.499 --> 00:16:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his property
and provided them for us

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:24.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—delivered them to site
and actually donated them to us.

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were exactly what we needed.

00:16:28.132 --> 00:16:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also had specific prayers
at certain times about certain matters,

00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then 30 minutes later,
we’d receive answers.

00:16:34.722 --> 00:16:36.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That definitely also is no coincidence.

00:16:36.808 --> 00:16:41.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then obviously getting
the right approvals just at the right time

00:16:41.354 --> 00:16:44.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite objections—we know
that there’s no one else other than

00:16:44.858 --> 00:16:47.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah that could have a hand in that.

00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:51.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s obvious that Satan has put
everything he can in front of us,

00:16:51.406 --> 00:16:55.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah has provided every time
at the right time.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no coincidence that his hand
has been on this,

00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:03.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there is no doubt that he
wants people to know about his Son, Jesus.

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:06.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing the collaboration in our
monthly meetings

00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:08.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the entire team where we have

00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:12.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the World Headquarters Legal Department,
the World Headquarters Computer Department,

00:17:12.176 --> 00:17:15.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the Purchasing Department,
we have Design/Construction,

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the Regional Video Teams,
we have Audio/Video Services

00:17:18.933 --> 00:17:22.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of these groups
along with the branch in Australasia—

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:27.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working together for a common goal
as a team

00:17:27.901 --> 00:17:31.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been amazing
and a very faith-strengthening experience.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were happy to share this update with you.

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:38.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you might still be wondering:

00:17:38.411 --> 00:17:43.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How are actors being prepared to reach
our hearts through their performance?

00:17:43.416 --> 00:17:48.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How will the tone and filming style
be selected to represent

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Gospel accounts?’

00:17:50.506 --> 00:17:53.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe the biggest question you have is,

00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:56.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will cameras start rolling?

00:17:56.262 --> 00:17:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay tuned for a future update.

00:18:00.725 --> 00:18:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the powerful impact

00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this video series will have on people!

00:18:06.689 --> 00:18:11.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help you and me
follow Jesus’ footsteps closely.

00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help us draw closer to Jehovah,

00:18:14.364 --> 00:18:17.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom Jesus
perfectly imitated as a human.

00:18:17.575 --> 00:18:20.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the benefits go far beyond you and me.

00:18:20.662 --> 00:18:24.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As stated in the 2020 annual meeting,

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:29.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is likely that this series will be used
to touch the hearts and minds

00:18:29.587 --> 00:18:34.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of billions of resurrected ones
in the coming new world.

00:18:34.592 --> 00:18:39.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think how
this video series could help them

00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn about the example that Jesus set.

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:47.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how the visual portrayal
of his warm, humble,

00:18:47.271 --> 00:18:49.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approachable personality

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:53.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help them
to come to know Jehovah intimately.

00:18:53.778 --> 00:18:58.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How exactly will we use this new series
to teach resurrected ones?

00:18:58.783 --> 00:19:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will have to wait and see
what Jehovah directs.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:07.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident Jehovah
is blessing this work.

00:19:07.834 --> 00:19:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will continue 
to look to Jehovah for direction

00:19:11.254 --> 00:19:15.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we move ahead
with <i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

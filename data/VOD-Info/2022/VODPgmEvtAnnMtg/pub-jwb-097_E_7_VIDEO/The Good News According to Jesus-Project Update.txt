00:00:01 At the 2020 annual meeting,
00:00:03 we announced an exciting new video project,
00:00:06 The Good News According to Jesus.
00:00:09 Brother Anthony Morris made the following encouraging statement.
00:00:14 Will there be challenges?
00:00:16 Oh yeah, guaranteed.
00:00:18 But if Jehovah wants something done,
00:00:20 that’s what happens.
00:00:23 How true those words have proven to be!
00:00:27 To date, the largest feature drama
00:00:30 Audio/Video Services had produced
00:00:32 was a little over 100 minutes in length.
00:00:36 The Good News According to Jesus spans nearly 1,000 minutes of content!
00:00:42 We are happy to update you on this exciting project
00:00:46 and share different ways Jehovah has helped us to overcome various challenges.
00:00:53 Brothers and sisters already serving at the Australasia branch were key
00:00:58 to helping us get the facilities ready.
00:01:01 How did they handle this special assignment, especially during the pandemic?
00:01:08 We were all very excited,
00:01:10 but as the scope
00:01:11 of this project became clear,
00:01:13 there were times when we wondered how
00:01:15 our small publisher base of around 68,000
00:01:18 would be able to fully support this large undertaking.
00:01:21 We’re a small department,
00:01:23 and it’s a small branch that we’re at.
00:01:25 And all of a sudden,
00:01:27 we had this project highlighted
00:01:29 that was three times our normal workload.
00:01:31 Right after we received approval for the project, the branch territory
00:01:36 experienced terrible bushfires raging right throughout the country.
00:01:41 Straight after this were floods.
00:01:43 So, many of our brothers experienced double disasters.
00:01:46 As we then started to recover from this
00:01:49 and build momentum to start the project,
00:01:51 the COVID-19 pandemic began.
00:01:56 All of the deliveries of construction materials
00:01:59 coming into the branch had to be quarantined
00:02:01 (all of the bulk supplies that the Construction Department was using).
00:02:04 And so that meant there was a time period
00:02:06 for those things to be unavailable for use.
00:02:08 And then the logistics
00:02:10 of (once all those bulk supplies came out of quarantine)
00:02:12 then moving them to where they’re needed on the site
00:02:15 when new deliveries are coming in and managing
00:02:17 that safely with the COVID-19 risks
00:02:19 and the risks of interaction with the delivery drivers and the contractors
00:02:23 —it was complicated and very time-consuming for all involved.
00:02:27 We needed help from our brothers  and sisters outside of Bethel.
00:02:30 So we put the call out, and they came from all over
00:02:33 the branch territory to help.
00:02:35 Many of them traveled days on rough and rugged roads
00:02:39 to come and help us.
00:02:40 When they arrived,
00:02:42 they spent a time in quarantine, and then they were able to come
00:02:45 and help us safely on-site.
00:02:48 There were specific items
00:02:49 needed for the project.
00:02:50 So we asked the brothers and sisters
00:02:52 to help to see where or how
00:02:54 we could obtain them.
00:02:56 It was so heartwarming to see all the responses flooding in.
00:02:59 Within a short amount of time, we had received offers
00:03:02 for donations or loans  for much of the heavy machinery
00:03:06 or large equipment we needed
00:03:08 and even things like plants for landscaping.
00:03:12 So we brought in a number of temporary workers,
00:03:14 and a number of remote workers as well were added to the team.
00:03:17 And the Branch Committee made available a large car parking area
00:03:20 so that we could quarantine off all of the deliveries
00:03:23 and handle those things safely and in line with the guidelines.
00:03:26 So at the beginning of the project,
00:03:27 the number was about 200 people
00:03:30 in the family,
00:03:31 and that quickly grew to around 500.
00:03:35 And while we have a beautiful kitchen here to serve food from,
00:03:39 it wasn’t really designed for 500 meals each day.
00:03:43 The Branch Committee
00:03:45 as well as our various departments,
00:03:47 although they had a heavy workload themselves,
00:03:50 were able to extend a helping hand.
00:03:52 Where we lost commuters,
00:03:55 we gained some workers from various departments
00:03:58 who helped us in various tasks within Food Service.
00:04:03 So it was clear to everybody in the department and at the branch
00:04:07 that it really needed to be a team effort,
00:04:09 and everybody went above and beyond to make this work.
00:04:13 But that only takes you so far.
00:04:15 Jehovah’s blessing on the arrangements,
00:04:17 the qualities that he helps us to show,
00:04:20 the motivation that he helps us to have
00:04:22 to overcome those challenges and to take on things that really
00:04:26 are beyond what we can normally cope with
00:04:29 —seeing that particularly as we look back on a number
00:04:32 of those challenges and how they’ve been overcome—
00:04:34 you see Jehovah’s involvement day to day.
00:04:36 A brother had a trailer  that was going to be donated to the project,
00:04:40 but he didn’t have the funds to pay for the freight.
00:04:44 At the very same time, a sister contacted the branch
00:04:47 and wanted to donate specifically to the project.
00:04:51 The amount she donated was the amount that was needed
00:04:53 to cover the freight to bring the trailer to Bethel.
00:04:56 One brother made a 30-hour round-trip to deliver
00:05:00 a large quantity of goods he manufactured for us.
00:05:03 He made this trip, not once or twice, but multiple times,
00:05:08 even planning the work  around two surgeries he had to have.
00:05:11 A number of trucks were required to freight the goods,
00:05:15 so members of his family and congregation
00:05:18 shared in the driving while local brothers extended hospitality.
00:05:22 I’m very impressed
00:05:24 with the level of appreciation
00:05:27 and the sense of gratitude that permeates the family.
00:05:30 And seeing that is
00:05:33 a real boost for us and a real blessing.
00:05:37 We feel very appreciative for everyone who’s been able to help on this project,
00:05:41 and we recognize the personal
00:05:43 and collective sacrifices that have been made.
00:05:46 And those who have been able to come in and help us on the project
00:05:49 tell us how thankful they are to have had a share in the project.
00:05:53 Only Jehovah can create a situation like this.
00:05:59 Jehovah always finds a way to help us do his will,
00:06:03 often providing solutions we never thought possible.
00:06:08 In addition to preparing the Australasia facility for the project,
00:06:13 much work has been done
00:06:15 with script development, casting, and location scouting.
00:06:20 How has this progressed?
00:06:23 We recognized that there
00:06:25 would be many needed adjustments
00:06:29 to the branch there
00:06:30 as far as facilities are concerned.
00:06:33 We knew that there would be the need
00:06:35 for many volunteers to be involved
00:06:37 in the project, and we knew it was going to be
00:06:41 coordinated from halfway around the world.
00:06:45 The challenge with finding locations
00:06:47 for the Gospel accounts
00:06:48 is that they need to look like ancient lands
00:06:51 but be placed in a modern world.
00:06:54 They need to have no signs of civilization
00:06:57 and yet be close enough to civilization to support our modern filming operations.
00:07:03 You’re asked to flesh out an entire world,
00:07:06 a culture,
00:07:08 and hundreds or, actually, thousands
00:07:10 of characters that appear in these accounts
00:07:13 and to do so with very limited information
00:07:15 actually in the Bible.
00:07:17 How do we add enough details to connect with the audience
00:07:20 but do so without overstepping by introducing teachings
00:07:24 or ideas that contradict the Bible’s message?
00:07:29 We can truly say it was a worldwide effort on the part of our brothers and sisters.
00:07:34 It was especially encouraging
00:07:36 to see how young ones
00:07:38 responded to this need.
00:07:40 They were looking to extend themselves
00:07:42 in their service to Jehovah, and they were willing
00:07:44 to adjust their secular jobs.
00:07:46 They were willing to move
00:07:48 to other locations in order to be able
00:07:51 to support this project.
00:07:54 We were looking at how we could
00:07:56 accomplish so many auditions
00:07:59 in a shorter period of time.
00:08:01 So we came up with the idea of a self-guided audition
00:08:04 where we put a package together
00:08:07 identifying how the audition needs
00:08:10 to be accomplished and we send it to the publisher that’s being auditioned,
00:08:14 and they record their own audition
00:08:16 and send it back to us for processing.
00:08:21 While we were at some of the locations, we actually did test filming.
00:08:23 We put actors in wardrobe in front of the camera and re-created certain scenes
00:08:27 to see how this location could be used for our project.
00:08:31 We were able to travel to more than a dozen locations during a month,
00:08:35 and everyone returned happy and healthy.
00:08:39 There are some accounts in the Gospels
00:08:41 that reference large groups,
00:08:43 such as the Sermon on the Mount
00:08:44 and when Jesus preached from the boat.
00:08:46 How would we show that many people?
00:08:48 The team took time to test various methods,
00:08:52 including some computer graphics as well as different styles
00:08:56 and methods to be used to duplicate people
00:08:59 for these large crowds.
00:09:01 The production team was able to see
00:09:04 what did and did not work, and this is very beneficial because it helps
00:09:08 us to plan appropriately for the actual production day.
00:09:13 And so it’s simply a matter of going and doing
00:09:15 as much research as possible to find out what is known.
00:09:17 And, of course, there’s an entire team
00:09:20 devoted to doing research for our publications.
00:09:22 And we have access to those brothers and sisters.
00:09:25 Something that has been incredibly valuable for every screenwriter
00:09:28 on this project is to see
00:09:31 members of the Teaching Committee sit at every table read for each script
00:09:35 and then proceed to give us direction,
00:09:37 ask questions, give us direction
00:09:40 on what to go and research further, what to remove, and (in many cases)
00:09:44 what to add.
00:09:46 It shows how deeply they’re
00:09:47 invested in the story of Jesus’ life.
00:09:50 It felt like Jehovah had taken us and placed us
00:09:53 into a land thousands of years ago.
00:09:57 When we got to these various locations, we literally would
00:10:01 jump out of the vehicles and run across the landscape
00:10:03 in excitement for how we could potentially use them.
00:10:06 One of the biggest challenges we had was getting everyone back into the vehicles
00:10:10 so that we could go on to the next location.
00:10:13 We went to one property, and when we talked with the brother,
00:10:16 he said: “This isn’t my property.
00:10:19 “This belongs to Jehovah.
00:10:21 “I’m holding onto it (I’m not sure why),
00:10:24 hoping that perhaps Jehovah can use it in some way.”
00:10:27 And when you think  about all of our brothers and sisters
00:10:31 coming together to support this initiative,
00:10:34 it really has been a blessing to be able to witness that.
00:10:37 It really reminds me of what is said
00:10:39 at Psalm 133:1, where it said it would be “good”
00:10:43 to see brothers and sisters ‘dwelling together in unity.’
00:10:46 And we’ve seen that goodness.
00:10:48 We’ve seen our brotherhood really rally around supporting this project
00:10:53 in so many ways.
00:10:54 And it has contributed toward
00:10:56 a spirit that has allowed Jehovah to bless the work.
00:11:01 Would you like to see how the design and construction aspects
00:11:05 of the work are progressing, including the historical sets?
00:11:10 Well, one of the biggest challenges we’ve had
00:11:12 in the Design/Construction world
00:11:14 is to get the mentality
00:11:16 that we’re designing and building something
00:11:19 that needs to look 2,000 years old.
00:11:23 Now, we’re used to building modern buildings,
00:11:25 and we’re used to using the materials
00:11:26 that we have today,
00:11:27 but to now use those
00:11:29 to provide something that was ancient,
00:11:31 that was going to be quite the challenge.
00:11:34 In Jesus’ ministry,
00:11:35 he went to numerous different towns,
00:11:37 and those towns
00:11:38 would have had different looks
00:11:39 because of the natural products
00:11:41 that were available to the tradesmen then to build those buildings.
00:11:48 Back in ancient Israel,
00:11:49 the building materials would have been stone,
00:11:52 so they would have used limestone, basalt,
00:11:54 field stones, and even clay bricks.
00:11:57 There’s probably
00:11:58 just over 100 doors and gates out there.
00:12:02 There are also over 200 windows,
00:12:05 and we’ve got shutters, and all of these need
00:12:07 either timber lintels or timber sills.
00:12:11 You have tradesmen who are used to getting things,
00:12:14 you could say, nearly perfect.
00:12:16 Normally as a renderer, or a plasterer, you would cover up cracks,
00:12:20 but here we’re having to actually create these.
00:12:23 That can be quite a challenge.
00:12:27 Back a few years ago, there were various branches
00:12:29 that were put forward as possibilities, as options.
00:12:33 And in the end, the Australasia branch was chosen.
00:12:36 At that time in the Design/Construction world,
00:12:39 we thought, ‘Well, that was an interesting choice.’
00:12:42 But during 2020, during the pandemic, we found out in retrospect
00:12:47 that it was one of the only places on earth
00:12:50 where this project could be completed now.
00:12:52 Because of the low incidence of COVID in the country,
00:12:56 we were able to use outside contractors
00:12:58 to come in to the project to do part of the site work for us.
00:13:02 So it’s been a blessing to have the project take place
00:13:06 at this location.
00:13:09 Those that we had on-site here already were very
00:13:12 open-minded, and they had a lot of creative thinking
00:13:15 when it came to building historical
00:13:18 sets now with modern materials.
00:13:21 So we have about 7,000 square meters of render to accomplish,
00:13:26 and we’ll have two teams working full-time
00:13:30 for several months to accomplish this.
00:13:39 In this particular type of work, nobody’s trade really counted;
00:13:42 everybody had to try.
00:13:44 And many of our sisters, in fact,
00:13:46 were the ones that had the skills that were needed to create
00:13:49 the historical effect that was required.
00:13:55 To achieve the weathering that would happen on the stone
00:13:58 if it sat there for hundreds of years out in the weather—
00:14:01 The water would get into the stone and slowly break it down.
00:14:05 So then there are going to be areas
00:14:07 of the stone that are softer, so they’ll wear away quicker.
00:14:11 So then that’s done with the wire brush.
00:14:14 And then some spots with the acetone,
00:14:17 it puts little divots into the stone,
00:14:20 which occur naturally in limestone.
00:14:23 Once the project is completed in the backlot,
00:14:26 the brothers and sisters will have applied
00:14:28 up to four and a half thousand square meters of stone finish to the buildings.
00:14:38 It’s been amazing to see how
00:14:40 with a variety of backgrounds (despite this),
00:14:44 they’ve been able to achieve quite amazing things
00:14:47 with just their willing spirit, prepared to take
00:14:52 on board the instruction.
00:14:54 And we can see Jehovah’s blessing behind it.
00:14:57 In the temple area, in the backlot, there are a little over 4,000 square meters
00:15:02 of concrete that has been made to look like stone.
00:15:05 Well, one of the contractors who quoted on the job was actually a brother.
00:15:09 And that particular brother said: “Well, you know what?
00:15:12 “I can volunteer to do this.
00:15:13 “And there are enough brothers around that we can bring together,
00:15:16 and we would be more than happy to be able to do it on a volunteer basis.”
00:15:20 So an isolated area was set up where these brothers could
00:15:24 test and sample and produce
00:15:26 the concrete that was needed for the floor finish of the temple.
00:15:29 So for over 27 days of straight pours,
00:15:32 we had approximately 30 brothers and sisters
00:15:35 each day come in and work tirelessly
00:15:37 to be able to accomplish
00:15:39 this temple floor for us.
00:15:42 The last day of the concrete pour,
00:15:45 we wanted to surprise the brothers,
00:15:47 because someone had made a sign saying: “United in spirit.”
00:15:50 But actually, the construction Bethelites surprised us.
00:15:54 They all had balloons and signs, and it spelled out “Thank you.”
00:15:58 I think that just reflected how we love each other
00:16:01 and how we’d give our life for each other
00:16:04 because we both serve the same God and we love Jehovah.
00:16:08 Through lots of sleepless nights and a bit of prayer about it,
00:16:11 we ended up finding a brother who owned a sawmill and had property
00:16:15 with trees on it, and he willingly chopped down the trees
00:16:19 on his property and provided them for us
00:16:21 —delivered them to site and actually donated them to us.
00:16:24 And they were exactly what we needed.
00:16:28 We also had specific prayers at certain times about certain matters,
00:16:31 and then 30 minutes later, we’d receive answers.
00:16:34 That definitely also is no coincidence.
00:16:36 And then obviously getting the right approvals just at the right time
00:16:41 despite objections—we know that there’s no one else other than
00:16:44 Jehovah that could have a hand in that.
00:16:47 So it’s obvious that Satan has put everything he can in front of us,
00:16:51 but Jehovah has provided every time at the right time.
00:16:55 It’s no coincidence that his hand has been on this,
00:16:58 and there is no doubt that he wants people to know about his Son, Jesus.
00:17:03 Seeing the collaboration in our monthly meetings
00:17:06 with the entire team where we have
00:17:08 the World Headquarters Legal Department, the World Headquarters Computer Department,
00:17:12 we have the Purchasing Department, we have Design/Construction,
00:17:15 we have the Regional Video Teams, we have Audio/Video Services
00:17:18 —all of these groups along with the branch in Australasia—
00:17:22 working together for a common goal as a team
00:17:27 has been amazing and a very faith-strengthening experience.
00:17:32 We were happy to share this update with you.
00:17:35 But you might still be wondering:
00:17:38 ‘How are actors being prepared to reach our hearts through their performance?
00:17:43 ‘How will the tone and filming style be selected to represent
00:17:48 the Gospel accounts?’
00:17:50 And maybe the biggest question you have is,
00:17:53 When will cameras start rolling?
00:17:56 Stay tuned for a future update.
00:18:00 Imagine the powerful impact
00:18:03 this video series will have on people!
00:18:06 It will help you and me follow Jesus’ footsteps closely.
00:18:11 It will help us draw closer to Jehovah,
00:18:14 whom Jesus perfectly imitated as a human.
00:18:17 But the benefits go far beyond you and me.
00:18:20 As stated in the 2020 annual meeting,
00:18:24 it is likely that this series will be used to touch the hearts and minds
00:18:29 of billions of resurrected ones in the coming new world.
00:18:34 Just think how this video series could help them
00:18:39 learn about the example that Jesus set.
00:18:42 Imagine how the visual portrayal of his warm, humble,
00:18:47 and approachable personality
00:18:49 will help them to come to know Jehovah intimately.
00:18:53 How exactly will we use this new series to teach resurrected ones?
00:18:58 We will have to wait and see what Jehovah directs.
00:19:03 We are confident Jehovah is blessing this work.
00:19:07 And we will continue  to look to Jehovah for direction
00:19:11 as we move ahead with The Good News According to Jesus.

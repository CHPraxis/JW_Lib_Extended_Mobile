00:00:02 Are you there?
00:00:04 Is your name there?
00:00:06 Is your name “written in the book of life”?
00:00:10 What “book of life”?
00:00:12 Well, in Malachi chapter 3,
00:00:15 we notice that it refers to “a book of remembrance.”
00:00:19 And this book has a record of all those
00:00:23 ‘who fear Jehovah and treasure his name.’
00:00:28 Yes, this “book of remembrance” is a record of all those
00:00:32 who are in line to receive everlasting life.
00:00:35 So all of us want to have our names written in that book, don’t we?
00:00:41 But if we do have our name in that book,
00:00:45 does that mean that we automatically will receive everlasting life?
00:00:50 No.
00:00:52 We remember what Jehovah said to Moses,
00:00:54 as recorded in Exodus chapter 32.
00:00:57 There he said: ‘Anyone who sins against me,
00:01:01 I will wipe out from my book.’
00:01:04 So names can be erased
00:01:07 from this book of life.
00:01:10 It’s as if our names are written in this book of life
00:01:13 in pencil.
00:01:15 So all of us surely want to make sure
00:01:18 that our names remain in this book of life
00:01:21 right through to the time that they are written permanently in the book
00:01:26 in pen, as it were.
00:01:28 But whose names are in this book of life?
00:01:33 We’re going to consider together five different groups of persons,
00:01:38 some of whom have their names in the book of life and others who don’t.
00:01:43 So let’s watch this presentation that discusses these five groups.
00:01:57 The first group:
00:01:59 Those who have been selected to rule with Jesus in heaven.
00:02:03 Are their names written in this book of life?
00:02:07 According to Philippians 4:3,
00:02:10 the answer is yes.
00:02:13 But even though they’ve been anointed with holy spirit,
00:02:16 they still need to remain faithful
00:02:19 in order to have their names written permanently in this book.
00:02:24 The second group:
00:02:26 the great crowd of Armageddon survivors.
00:02:29 Are the names of these faithful ones now written in the book of life?
00:02:34 Yes.
00:02:36 What about after they survive Armageddon?
00:02:39 Will their names still be in the book of life?
00:02:41 Yes.
00:02:43 How do we know?
00:02:45 At Matthew 25:46, Jesus says
00:02:49 that these sheeplike ones depart
00:02:51 “into everlasting life.”
00:02:54 But does that mean they are granted everlasting life
00:02:57 at the beginning of the Thousand Year Reign?
00:03:00 No.
00:03:02 Revelation 7:17 tells us
00:03:05 that Jesus “will guide them to springs of waters of life.”
00:03:10 So they don’t immediately receive everlasting life.
00:03:14 However, their names are written in the book of life
00:03:17 in pencil, as it were.
00:03:20 The third group:
00:03:22 the goats who will be destroyed at Armageddon.
00:03:26 Their names are not in the book of life.
00:03:30 2 Thessalonians 1:9 tells us:
00:03:33 “These very ones will undergo the judicial punishment
00:03:37 of everlasting destruction.”
00:03:41 The same could be said of those
00:03:43 who have deliberately sinned against the holy spirit.
00:03:47 They too receive everlasting destruction,
00:03:51 not everlasting life.
00:03:54 So the first three groups are
00:03:56 the anointed,
00:03:58 the great crowd,
00:03:59 and the goats.
00:04:01 Of these three,
00:04:03 only two are found in the book of life.
00:04:06 Now let’s talk about two more groups:
00:04:09 Those who will be resurrected
00:04:12 in the new world.
00:04:14 First, though, let’s read together
00:04:16 Acts 24:15.
00:04:19 There the apostle Paul says:
00:04:22 “I have hope toward God,
00:04:24 “which hope these men also look forward to,
00:04:27 “that there is going to be a resurrection
00:04:29 “of both the righteous
00:04:32 and the unrighteous.”
00:04:35 So the fourth group are the righteous who have died.
00:04:39 These include some of our loved ones.
00:04:42 Are their names written in the book of life?
00:04:45 Yes.
00:04:47 Revelation 17:8 tells us
00:04:50 that this book has been in existence since “the founding of the world.”
00:04:55 Jesus referred to Abel as living “from the founding of the world,”
00:04:59 so we can assume that his name
00:05:02 was the first name written in that book.
00:05:05 Since that time, millions of other righteous ones
00:05:09 have had their names added to this book.
00:05:12 Now, here’s an important question:
00:05:15 When these righteous ones died,
00:05:18 were their names taken out of the book of life?
00:05:21 No.
00:05:23 They’re still living in Jehovah’s memory.
00:05:26 Remember, Jesus said that Jehovah
00:05:29 “is a God, not of the dead, but of the living,
00:05:32 for they are all living to him.”
00:05:35 The righteous will be restored to life here on earth
00:05:38 with their names still written in the book of life.
00:05:42 They did good things before they died.
00:05:45 So that is why they will be part
00:05:48 of the resurrection of the righteous ones.
00:05:52 No doubt some of them will receive privileges,
00:05:55 such as serving “as princes in all the earth.”
00:05:59 Finally, let’s talk about the resurrection of “the unrighteous.”
00:06:04 For the most part, the unrighteous didn’t have an opportunity
00:06:08 to develop a relationship with Jehovah.
00:06:11 They did not live righteous lives.
00:06:14 So that’s why they are called unrighteous.
00:06:18 When these unrighteous ones are resurrected,
00:06:21 are their names written in the book of life?
00:06:25 No.
00:06:26 But their being resurrected gives them an opportunity
00:06:30 to have their names eventually written in the book of life.
00:06:35 These unrighteous ones will need a lot of help.
00:06:40 In their former life, some of them practiced
00:06:42 horrible, vile things.
00:06:45 So they’ll need to learn to live by Jehovah’s standards.
00:06:49 To accomplish this,
00:06:51 God’s Kingdom will sponsor the greatest educational program
00:06:56 in all human history.
00:07:00 Who will teach these unrighteous persons?
00:07:04 Those who have their names written in pencil in the book of life
00:07:07 —the great crowd and the resurrected righteous ones.
00:07:12 How can these unrighteous ones
00:07:15 have their names written in the book of life?
00:07:19 They will need to develop a relationship with Jehovah
00:07:22 and dedicate their lives to him.
00:07:25 But will all the unrighteous accept that opportunity?
00:07:29 No.
00:07:31 Remember, all these unrighteous ones
00:07:34 will be under the careful watch of Jesus
00:07:37 and his fellow judges.
00:07:39 Isaiah 65:20 tells us
00:07:42 that those who refuse to accept this help
00:07:44 will be removed.
00:07:47 No one will be allowed to cause any ruin in the new world.
00:07:51 So any who display a wicked attitude during the thousand years
00:07:56 will be removed.
00:07:58 With all these facts in mind then, let’s now read together
00:08:03 John 5:28, 29.
00:08:07 Jesus said: “Do not be amazed at this,
00:08:11 “for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs
00:08:16 “will hear his voice and come out,
00:08:19 “those who did good things
00:08:21 “to a resurrection of life,
00:08:23 “and those who practiced vile things
00:08:26 to a resurrection of judgment.”
00:08:31 Now, for a few moments, let’s think about those verses
00:08:35 at John 5:28, 29.
00:08:39 Up to now, we have understood Jesus’ words to mean
00:08:44 that the resurrected ones will do “good things”
00:08:48 and that some will do “vile things” after their resurrection.
00:08:53 But notice there in verse 29, Jesus didn’t say
00:08:56 that they will  do these good things
00:09:00 or they will  practice vile things.
00:09:04 He used the past tense, didn’t he?
00:09:06 Because he said that they “did good things”
00:09:09 and that they “practiced vile things.”
00:09:12 So this would indicate to us that these deeds, or actions,
00:09:16 were committed by these ones
00:09:19 prior to their death
00:09:22 and before they would be resurrected.
00:09:25 So that makes sense —doesn’t it?—
00:09:27 because no one is going to be allowed to practice vile things in the new world.
00:09:33 So, what did Jesus mean when he mentioned
00:09:36 these two factors?
00:09:39 Well, for a start, we could say
00:09:41 that the righteous ones still —when they’re resurrected—
00:09:46 have their names written in the book of life.
00:09:50 It’s true that Romans 6:7 says that when someone dies,
00:09:55 his sins are canceled
00:09:57 but (take note of this) not their record of faithfulness.
00:10:02 That’s not canceled.
00:10:04 So the righteous ones are resurrected into the new world,
00:10:09 and their names are still in the book of life.
00:10:13 Of course, they need to remain faithful during the thousand years
00:10:16 to keep their names in that book of life.
00:10:20 But what about the unrighteous ones?
00:10:22 Well, these are the ones who did vile things
00:10:25 before they died.
00:10:28 So when they are resurrected,
00:10:30 they don’t have their names in the book of life.
00:10:33 It’s not a resurrection to life;
00:10:35 it’s a resurrection to judgment.
00:10:39 Now, why do we say that?
00:10:41 Because there we could say that the word “judgment”
00:10:46 is not referring to a condemnation.
00:10:50 It’s not referring to something that is totally negative.
00:10:54 It’s true that at times the word “judgment” can have that meaning.
00:10:58 But in the context of these verses,
00:11:02 it seems that Jesus is using the word “judgment”
00:11:05 in a more neutral sense.
00:11:08 So it means more of an evaluation
00:11:11 or a probation period.
00:11:14 So the unrighteous ones
00:11:17 will have an opportunity to accept this wonderful educational work
00:11:22 that’s going to be done in the new world.
00:11:25 And during that time, they will be evaluated.
00:11:29 And if they dedicate their lives to Jehovah,
00:11:32 then their names will be written into the book of life.
00:11:37 Now at this point, you’re probably thinking,
00:11:40 ‘Hmm, is this an adjustment to our understanding?’
00:11:45 Yes, it is.
00:11:47 So now you’re thinking, ‘Now, can you just run that past me again?’
00:11:53 Well, let’s look at this little summary that will help us.
00:11:57 When Jesus spoke at John 5:29
00:12:01 of those who would receive a resurrection of life,
00:12:05 he was referring to those who did good things
00:12:09 before they died
00:12:11 —those whose names are written in the book of life.
00:12:15 The resurrection of judgment
00:12:17 at John 5:29
00:12:19 involves the resurrection of those
00:12:21 who practice vile things
00:12:23 before they die
00:12:26 and whose names are not yet written
00:12:28 in the book of life.
00:12:31 But whether previously righteous or unrighteous,
00:12:34 all these resurrected ones will need to obey
00:12:38 the laws in the new scrolls
00:12:40 referred to at Revelation 20:12.
00:12:43 There it says: “I saw the dead,
00:12:46 “the great and the small, standing before the throne,
00:12:50 “and scrolls were opened.
00:12:52 “But another scroll was opened;
00:12:54 “it is the scroll of life.
00:12:57 “The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls
00:13:01 according to their deeds.”
00:13:04 Yes, they will be judged individually
00:13:08 “according to their deeds.”
00:13:11 But what deeds?
00:13:13 Will it be their deeds committed before they die?
00:13:16 No.
00:13:18 Otherwise, the resurrection of the unrighteous
00:13:21 would have been a pointless waste.
00:13:23 Here, then, their deeds cannot be deeds from their former life.
00:13:28 Rather, this verse must refer to their deeds
00:13:32 in response to their training in the new world.
00:13:37 Even such faithful men as Noah, Samuel, David, and Daniel
00:13:41 will have to learn about the sacrifice of Christ
00:13:44 and exercise faith in it.
00:13:48 All of this also helps us to understand
00:13:51 an amazing prophecy in the book of Daniel.
00:13:55 Let’s turn there.
00:13:57 It’s Daniel 12:1-3.
00:14:02 There it says: “During that time
00:14:05 “Michael [who is Jesus Christ]
00:14:07 “will stand up [that is, at Armageddon],
00:14:11 “the great prince who is standing
00:14:14 “[since 1914]
00:14:17 “in behalf of your people.
00:14:19 “And there will occur a time of distress
00:14:22 “[that is, the great tribulation]
00:14:24 “such as has not occurred
00:14:27 “since there came to be a nation until that time.
00:14:30 “And during that time your people will escape,
00:14:34 “everyone who is found written down in the book
00:14:38 [and this refers to the great crowd].”
00:14:41 But notice what follows:
00:14:45 “And many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up,
00:14:49 “some to everlasting life
00:14:52 and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt.”
00:14:59 So looking at Daniel 12:2,
00:15:03 it seems appropriate, too, that we adjust
00:15:05 our understanding of this verse.
00:15:08 Notice that there it speaks about people waking up
00:15:11 in the form of a resurrection,
00:15:13 and this occurs after what’s mentioned in verse 1
00:15:16 —after the great crowd survives the great tribulation.
00:15:21 So this obviously is talking about a literal resurrection
00:15:26 of the righteous and unrighteous.
00:15:29 But what does it mean when it mentions there, in verse 2,
00:15:33 that some will be raised to everlasting life
00:15:37 and others to everlasting contempt?
00:15:41 What does that really mean?
00:15:44 Well, when we notice that, we notice that this is a little different
00:15:48 from what Jesus said in John chapter 5 when he spoke about life and judgment.
00:15:52 But now, here he is talking about everlasting  life
00:15:57 and everlasting  contempt.
00:16:00 So that term “everlasting” helps us to realize
00:16:03 that this is talking about the final outcome,
00:16:08 after these ones have had an opportunity
00:16:11 to accept the education.
00:16:13 So those who are resurrected who make good use
00:16:17 of this education,
00:16:19 well, they will continue on and ultimately receive
00:16:23 everlasting life.
00:16:25 But then on the other hand, any who refuse to accept
00:16:28 the benefits of that education
00:16:31 will be judged as worthy of eternal destruction.
00:16:35 Now let’s finally read verse 3:
00:16:41 “And those having insight
00:16:43 “will shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven,
00:16:47 “and those bringing the many to righteousness
00:16:49 like the stars, forever and ever.”
00:16:54 This is speaking about the massive educational work
00:16:57 that will be done in the new world.
00:17:00 The glorified anointed ones will shine brightly
00:17:04 as they work closely with Jesus to direct the education work
00:17:08 that will bring the many to righteousness.
00:17:11 What a joy it will be for them to take part
00:17:15 in this amazing work in their role as priests.
00:17:19 They will assist with “the healing of the nations.”
00:17:22 And what a privilege it will be to see obedient humans
00:17:26 become free from the burden of sin and death and gain perfection!
00:17:37 Of course, we have to realize that at that time on earth,
00:17:41 there won’t be just the resurrected ones, will there?
00:17:45 There will be the survivors of Armageddon
00:17:47 and any children that are born in the new world.
00:17:50 These ones will ultimately attain to perfection.
00:17:55 So is that when they get their names written,
00:17:58 as it were, in ink in the book?
00:18:01 Not quite yet.
00:18:04 Why not?
00:18:05 Well, because perfection doesn’t automatically mean
00:18:09 that someone would get everlasting life.
00:18:11 Remember the case of Adam and Eve: They were perfect.
00:18:15 But before they could attain to everlasting life,
00:18:18 they had to prove their obedience to Jehovah.
00:18:21 Yes.
00:18:22 So we realize, then,
00:18:24 that in the case of Adam and Eve, they failed.
00:18:28 So questions are raised
00:18:30 with regard to all these perfect ones on the earth at that time
00:18:34 (the resurrected ones, the survivors of the great tribulation,
00:18:37 as well as any children that will have been born):
00:18:40 Will they stand faithful?
00:18:43 Will they continue to support Jehovah’s sovereignty?
00:18:48 Or will some of them be like Adam and Eve
00:18:51 —be perfect but then unfaithful?
00:18:54 Well, the book of Revelation helps us to understand
00:18:58 that to answer that question Satan is released from the symbolic prison,
00:19:03 and he has an opportunity
00:19:05 to test the integrity of Jehovah’s servants.
00:19:08 So each person on earth
00:19:10 will have a personal opportunity
00:19:13 to show where they stand on the issue of universal sovereignty.
00:19:18 And their individual response
00:19:21 will show whether or not their names should be written permanently
00:19:25 in the book of life.
00:19:27 Some, an unspecified number,
00:19:30 will turn their backs on Jehovah and will not support his sovereignty.
00:19:34 What will happen to those ones?
00:19:36 Well, Revelation 20:15 tells us, doesn’t it?
00:19:39 Anyone who isn’t “found written in the book of life”
00:19:44 will receive everlasting destruction.
00:19:47 But this is the good news:
00:19:50 The majority of perfect mankind
00:19:53 will find themselves passing the final test.
00:19:57 Yes, and their names will be written permanently
00:20:01 in the book of life.
00:20:03 Isn’t it exciting to think
00:20:05 about what’s going to happen in the future?
00:20:08 Yes, now is the time that Jehovah is preparing his people
00:20:11 for this massive educational work
00:20:14 that is going to take place in the new world.
00:20:17 So now is the time for each one of us to think about that question:
00:20:22 Are you there?
00:20:24 Is your name in the book of life?
00:20:27 Yes, may your name be found written
00:20:30 in Jehovah’s book of life,
00:20:32 and may it remain there forever!

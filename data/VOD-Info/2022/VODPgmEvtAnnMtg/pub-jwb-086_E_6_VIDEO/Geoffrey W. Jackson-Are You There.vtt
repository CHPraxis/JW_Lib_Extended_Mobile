00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:04.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you there?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your name there?

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:10.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your name “written in the book of life”?

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What “book of life”?

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in Malachi chapter 3,

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we notice that it refers
to “a book of remembrance.”

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:23.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this book has a record of all those

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘who fear Jehovah and treasure his name.’

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:32.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this “book of remembrance”
is a record of all those

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are in line to receive everlasting life.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:40.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of us want to have our names
written in that book, don’t we?

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we do have our name in that book,

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:50.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does that mean that we
automatically will receive everlasting life?

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember what Jehovah said to Moses,

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded in Exodus chapter 32.

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:01.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he said: ‘Anyone who sins against me,

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will wipe out from my book.’

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So names can be erased

00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this book of life.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if our names are written
in this book of life

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:15.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in pencil.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of us surely want to make sure

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our names remain in this book of life

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:26.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right through to the time
that they are written permanently in the book

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in pen, as it were.

00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whose names are in this book of life?

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to consider together
five different groups of persons,

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:43.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of whom have their names
in the book of life and others who don’t.

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:48.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s watch this presentation
that discusses these five groups.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.502 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first group:

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have been selected
to rule with Jesus in heaven.

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:07.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are their names written in this book of life?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Philippians 4:3,

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answer is yes.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:16.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even though they’ve been anointed
with holy spirit,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they still need to remain faithful

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to have their names
written permanently in this book.

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:26.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second group:

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great crowd of Armageddon survivors.

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:34.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are the names of these faithful ones
now written in the book of life?

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:39.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about after they survive Armageddon?

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will their names still be
in the book of life?

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:43.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 25:46, Jesus says

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:51.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these sheeplike ones depart

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:54.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into everlasting life.”

00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does that mean they are granted
everlasting life

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:00.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the beginning of the Thousand Year Reign?

00:03:00.563 --> 00:03:02.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 7:17 tells us

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus “will guide them
to springs of waters of life.”

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:14.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they don’t immediately receive
everlasting life.

00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, their names are written
in the book of life

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:20.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in pencil, as it were.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third group:

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:26.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goats who will be destroyed
at Armageddon.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:30.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their names are not in the book of life.

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Thessalonians 1:9 tells us:

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These very ones will undergo
the judicial punishment

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:41.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everlasting destruction.”

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:43.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same could be said of those

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have deliberately sinned
against the holy spirit.

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:51.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They too receive everlasting destruction,

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:54.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not everlasting life.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first three groups are

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the anointed,

00:03:58.254 --> 00:03:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great crowd,

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.624 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the goats.

00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:03.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Of these three,

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only two are found in the book of life.

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s talk about two more groups:

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who will be resurrected

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world.

00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, though, let’s read together

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 24:15.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There the apostle Paul says:

00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:24.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have hope toward God,

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:27.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which hope these men also look forward to,

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there is going to be a resurrection

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:32.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of both the righteous

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:34.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the unrighteous.”

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fourth group are
the righteous who have died.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These include some of our loved ones.

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are their names written in the book of life?

00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 17:8 tells us

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:55.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this book has been in existence
since “the founding of the world.”

00:04:55.144 --> 00:04:59.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus referred to Abel as living
“from the founding of the world,”

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can assume that his name

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the first name written in that book.

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:09.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since that time,
millions of other righteous ones

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had their names added to this book.

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:15.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s an important question:

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When these righteous ones died,

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:21.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were their names
taken out of the book of life?

00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re still living in Jehovah’s memory.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jesus said that Jehovah

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a God, not of the dead,
but of the living,

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for they are all living to him.”

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The righteous will be restored to life
here on earth

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their names still written
in the book of life.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did good things before they died.

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is why they will be part

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:52.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the resurrection of the righteous ones.

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:55.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt some of them
will receive privileges,

00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as serving
“as princes in all the earth.”

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:04.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s talk about the resurrection
of “the unrighteous.”

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:08.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the most part, the unrighteous
didn’t have an opportunity

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:11.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not live righteous lives.

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s why they are called unrighteous.

00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When these unrighteous ones are resurrected,

00:06:21.998 --> 00:06:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are their names written in the book of life?

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But their being resurrected
gives them an opportunity

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have their names eventually written
in the book of life.

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These unrighteous ones
will need a lot of help.

00:06:40.016 --> 00:06:42.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their former life, some of them practiced

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
horrible, vile things.

00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:49.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they’ll need to learn
to live by Jehovah’s standards.

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish this,

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:56.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom will sponsor
the greatest educational program

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all human history.

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will teach these unrighteous persons?

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have their names written
in pencil in the book of life

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the great crowd
and the resurrected righteous ones.

00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:15.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can these unrighteous ones

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have their names written in the book of life?

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will need to develop
a relationship with Jehovah

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:25.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dedicate their lives to him.

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But will all the unrighteous
accept that opportunity?

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:31.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:34.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, all these unrighteous ones

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be under the careful watch of Jesus

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his fellow judges.

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 65:20 tells us

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those who refuse to accept this help

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be removed.

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will be allowed to cause
any ruin in the new world.

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:56.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So any who display a wicked attitude
during the thousand years

00:07:56.425 --> 00:07:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be removed.

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:03.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With all these facts in mind then,
let’s now read together

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:28, 29.

00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Do not be amazed at this,

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the hour is coming
in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:08:16.012 --> 00:08:19.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will hear his voice and come out,

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those who did good things

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to a resurrection of life,

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:26.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those who practiced vile things

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:35.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for a few moments,
let’s think about those verses

00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 5:28, 29.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:44.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Up to now, we have understood
Jesus’ words to mean

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the resurrected ones
will do “good things”

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that some will do “vile things”
after their resurrection.

00:08:53.449 --> 00:08:56.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice there in verse 29,
Jesus didn’t say

00:08:56.986 --> 00:09:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they <i>will</i>  do these good things

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they <i>will</i>  practice vile things.

00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:06.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the past tense, didn’t he?

00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:09.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he said that they “did good things”

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they “practiced vile things.”

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this would indicate to us
that these deeds, or actions,

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:19.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were committed by these ones

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prior to their death

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:25.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and before they would be resurrected.

00:09:25.514 --> 00:09:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that makes sense
—doesn’t it?—

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:32.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because no one is going to be allowed
to practice vile things in the new world.

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:36.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jesus mean when he mentioned

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:39.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these two factors?

00:09:39.395 --> 00:09:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for a start, we could say

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:46.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the righteous ones still
—when they’re resurrected—

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:50.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have their names written in the book of life.

00:09:50.439 --> 00:09:55.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that Romans 6:7 says
that when someone dies,

00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his sins are canceled

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but (take note of this)
not their record of faithfulness.

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not canceled.

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:09.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the righteous ones are resurrected
into the new world,

00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their names are still
in the book of life.

00:10:13.229 --> 00:10:16.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they need to remain faithful
during the thousand years

00:10:16.932 --> 00:10:20.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep their names in that book of life.

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the unrighteous ones?

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these are the ones who did vile things

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they died.

00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when they are resurrected,

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:33.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t have their names
in the book of life.

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a resurrection to life;

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a resurrection to judgment.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:41.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do we say that?

00:10:41.924 --> 00:10:46.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because there we could say
that the word “judgment”

00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not referring to a condemnation.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:54.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not referring to something
that is totally negative.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that at times the word “judgment”
can have that meaning.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the context of these verses,

00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that Jesus
is using the word “judgment”

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a more neutral sense.

00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:11.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it means more of an evaluation

00:11:11.654 --> 00:11:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a probation period.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:17.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the unrighteous ones

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:22.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have an opportunity to accept
this wonderful educational work

00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:25.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to be done in the new world.

00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during that time, they will be evaluated.

00:11:29.472 --> 00:11:32.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they dedicate their lives to Jehovah,

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then their names will be written
into the book of life.

00:11:37.747 --> 00:11:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now at this point, you’re probably thinking,

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:45.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Hmm, is this an adjustment
to our understanding?’

00:11:45.254 --> 00:11:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is.

00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now you’re thinking,
‘Now, can you just run that past me again?’

00:11:53.229 --> 00:11:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at this little summary
that will help us.

00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:01.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus spoke at John 5:29

00:12:01.003 --> 00:12:05.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who would receive
a resurrection of life,

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:09.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was referring to those
who did good things

00:12:09.078 --> 00:12:11.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they died

00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:15.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those whose names are written
in the book of life.

00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The resurrection of judgment

00:12:17.787 --> 00:12:19.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 5:29

00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves the resurrection of those

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who practice vile things

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they die

00:12:26.028 --> 00:12:28.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whose names are not yet written

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whether previously righteous
or unrighteous,

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these resurrected ones will need to obey

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:40.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the laws in the new scrolls

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referred to at Revelation 20:12.

00:12:43.612 --> 00:12:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says: “I saw the dead,

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great and the small,
standing before the throne,

00:12:50.252 --> 00:12:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and scrolls were opened.

00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But another scroll was opened;

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is the scroll of life.

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:01.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dead were judged out of those things
written in the scrolls

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to their deeds.”

00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they will be judged individually

00:13:08.237 --> 00:13:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to their deeds.”

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what deeds?

00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:16.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will it be their deeds committed
before they die?

00:13:16.812 --> 00:13:18.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, the resurrection
of the unrighteous

00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have been a pointless waste.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:28.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, then, their deeds
cannot be deeds from their former life.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, this verse must refer to their deeds

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in response to their training
in the new world.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even such faithful men
as Noah, Samuel, David, and Daniel

00:13:41.937 --> 00:13:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have to learn
about the sacrifice of Christ

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exercise faith in it.

00:13:48.177 --> 00:13:51.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this also helps us to understand

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an amazing prophecy in the book of Daniel.

00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:57.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there.

00:13:57.353 --> 00:14:00.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Daniel 12:1-3.

00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says: “During that time

00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Michael [who is Jesus Christ]

00:14:07.963 --> 00:14:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will stand up [that is, at Armageddon],

00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great prince who is standing

00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:17.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[since 1914]

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in behalf of your people.

00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur a time of distress

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:24.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, the great tribulation]

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such as has not occurred

00:14:27.182 --> 00:14:30.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since there came to be a nation
until that time.

00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:34.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And during that time
your people will escape,

00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everyone who is found
written down in the book

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and this refers to the great crowd].”

00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:45.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice what follows:

00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:49.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And many of those asleep
in the dust of the earth will wake up,

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some to everlasting life

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others to reproach
and to everlasting contempt.”

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:03.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So looking at Daniel 12:2,

00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:05.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems appropriate, too, that we adjust

00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:08.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our understanding of this verse.

00:15:08.557 --> 00:15:11.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that there it speaks
about people waking up

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of a resurrection,

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this occurs
after what’s mentioned in verse 1

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:21.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after the great crowd survives
the great tribulation.

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:26.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this obviously is talking
about a literal resurrection

00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:29.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the righteous and unrighteous.

00:15:29.378 --> 00:15:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean
when it mentions there, in verse 2,

00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:37.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some will be raised to everlasting life

00:15:37.987 --> 00:15:41.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others to everlasting contempt?

00:15:41.957 --> 00:15:44.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that really mean?

00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:48.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we notice that,
we notice that this is a little different

00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from what Jesus said in John chapter 5
when he spoke about life and judgment.

00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:57.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here he is talking
about <i>everlasting</i>  life

00:15:57.106 --> 00:16:00.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>everlasting</i>  contempt.

00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:03.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that term “everlasting”
helps us to realize

00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is talking about the final outcome,

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after these ones have had an opportunity

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept the education.

00:16:13.956 --> 00:16:17.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those who are resurrected
who make good use

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:19.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this education,

00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:23.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, they will continue on
and ultimately receive

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everlasting life.

00:16:25.334 --> 00:16:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then on the other hand,
any who refuse to accept

00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the benefits of that education

00:16:31.507 --> 00:16:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be judged
as worthy of eternal destruction.

00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:39.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s finally read verse 3:

00:16:41.216 --> 00:16:43.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And those having insight

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:47.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will shine as brightly
as the expanse of heaven,

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:49.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those bringing the many to righteousness

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the stars, forever and ever.”

00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:57.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is speaking
about the massive educational work

00:16:57.666 --> 00:17:00.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be done in the new world.

00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:04.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The glorified anointed ones
will shine brightly

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:08.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they work closely with Jesus
to direct the education work

00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:11.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will bring the many to righteousness.

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:15.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it will be for them to take part

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this amazing work
in their role as priests.

00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will assist
with “the healing of the nations.”

00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:26.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a privilege it will be
to see obedient humans

00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:31.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become free from the burden of sin and death
and gain perfection!

00:17:37.873 --> 00:17:41.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we have to realize
that at that time on earth,

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:45.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there won’t be
just the resurrected ones, will there?

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be the survivors of Armageddon

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and any children that are born
in the new world.

00:17:50.986 --> 00:17:55.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These ones will ultimately attain
to perfection.

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:58.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is that when they get their names written,

00:17:58.927 --> 00:18:01.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it were, in ink in the book?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not quite yet.

00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:09.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because perfection
doesn’t automatically mean

00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone would get everlasting life.

00:18:11.874 --> 00:18:15.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the case of Adam and Eve:
They were perfect.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before they could attain
to everlasting life,

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had to prove their obedience to Jehovah.

00:18:21.483 --> 00:18:22.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:24.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we realize, then,

00:18:24.887 --> 00:18:28.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the case of Adam and Eve,
they failed.

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:30.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So questions are raised

00:18:30.325 --> 00:18:34.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to all these perfect ones
on the earth at that time

00:18:34.062 --> 00:18:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the resurrected ones,
the survivors of the great tribulation,

00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:40.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as any children
that will have been born):

00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they stand faithful?

00:18:43.939 --> 00:18:48.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they continue to support
Jehovah’s sovereignty?

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or will some of them be like Adam and Eve

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—be perfect but then unfaithful?

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:58.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the book of Revelation
helps us to understand

00:18:58.153 --> 00:19:03.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that to answer that question
Satan is released from the symbolic prison,

00:19:03.158 --> 00:19:05.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has an opportunity

00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:08.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to test the integrity of Jehovah’s servants.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each person on earth

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have a personal opportunity

00:19:13.969 --> 00:19:18.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show where they stand
on the issue of universal sovereignty.

00:19:18.507 --> 00:19:21.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their individual response

00:19:21.343 --> 00:19:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show whether or not their names
should be written permanently

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.

00:19:27.783 --> 00:19:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some, an unspecified number,

00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will turn their backs on Jehovah
and will not support his sovereignty.

00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:36.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will happen to those ones?

00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:39.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Revelation 20:15 tells us, doesn’t it?

00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:44.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyone who isn’t “found written
in the book of life”

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:47.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive everlasting destruction.

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:50.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is the good news:

00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:53.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority of perfect mankind

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:57.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will find themselves passing the final test.

00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and their names
will be written permanently

00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.

00:20:03.018 --> 00:20:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it exciting to think

00:20:05.254 --> 00:20:08.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what’s going to happen in the future?

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, now is the time
that Jehovah is preparing his people

00:20:11.927 --> 00:20:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this massive educational work

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is going to take place in the new world.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now is the time for each one of us
to think about that question:

00:20:22.104 --> 00:20:24.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you there?

00:20:24.106 --> 00:20:27.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your name in the book of life?

00:20:27.376 --> 00:20:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, may your name be found written

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:32.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s book of life,

00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:35.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may it remain there forever!

00:00:07 Our military forces are committed to peace.
00:00:11 We have chosen peace.
00:00:13 Our wish, our prayer, is for peace.
00:00:17 We yearn for peace.
00:00:19 We pray for peace.
00:00:25 For thousands
00:00:26 of years, humans have tried
00:00:29 to find peace
00:00:35 —peace as individuals,
00:00:41 peace as families,
00:00:47 peace for the entire human race.
00:00:53 We want to lay the foundation of peace for generations to come.
00:00:57 We want to do the hard work now
00:00:59 so our children and our grandchildren can grow up in a peaceful world.
00:01:06 The future we want:
00:01:09 opportunity and security for our families,
00:01:13 a rising standard of living,
00:01:17 a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids
00:01:25 —all that is within our reach.
00:01:30 Yet, despite humans’ best efforts,
00:01:35 peace
00:01:38 has been elusive.
00:02:00 For millenniums,
00:02:02 rulers and governments have tried to achieve peace
00:02:04 through treaties,
00:02:06 resolutions,
00:02:07 summits
00:02:08 and, ironically, war.
00:02:21 Our peace as humans is more fragile than ever.
00:02:26 Man’s efforts to bring about lasting peace
00:02:29 have failed time and time again.
00:02:33 This isn’t surprising to us.
00:02:35 Jeremiah 10:23 tells us:
00:02:39 “It does not belong to man . . . to direct his step.”
00:02:44 Humans were simply not designed to rule themselves.
00:02:49 Good health, safety, overall well-being
00:02:53 —these are becoming harder to find
00:02:55 as we move further into what the Bible
00:02:56 refers to as “the last days.”
00:03:00 As long as human rule continues,
00:03:02 disunity will continue.
00:03:05 It’s true that global peace
00:03:07 cannot be obtained by human efforts alone.
00:03:11 But those who are close to God
00:03:13 can find peace of mind right now.
00:03:15 Isaiah 48:17, 18 says:
00:03:18 “I, Jehovah, am your God,
00:03:21 “the One teaching you to benefit yourself,
00:03:24 “the One guiding you
00:03:25 “in the way you should walk.
00:03:27 “If only you would pay attention
00:03:30 “to my commandments!
00:03:31 “Then your peace
00:03:33 would become just like a river.”
00:03:35 It’s only Jehovah
00:03:38 who has the ability to guide humans
00:03:40 to real, lasting peace.
00:03:43 He promises he will bring this about.
00:03:45 Until this happens,
00:03:47 Jehovah continues to provide ways
00:03:49 for us to experience peace now.
00:03:51 How does he do that?
00:03:53 By giving us “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.”
00:04:13 We aren’t the only ones whose peace has been challenged.
00:04:15 God’s Word is filled with accounts of faithful servants
00:04:18 whose peace was challenged
00:04:20 by the dominating forces of their day.
00:04:23 As we study and meditate on these accounts,
00:04:26 the lessons we learn from them
00:04:29 help us to trust in Jehovah as he guides us to peace.
00:04:34 Understanding how these accounts relate to Jehovah’s purpose to bring peace
00:04:38 by means of his Messianic Kingdom gives us confidence
00:04:41 that his purpose never fails
00:04:44 and he will support and guide us on into the future.
00:04:47 One of Jehovah’s prophets
00:04:48 who learned this lesson firsthand was Jonah.
00:04:53 Jonah lived in the ninth century B.C.E.
00:04:57 Jehovah assigned Jonah to go to Nineveh,
00:05:00 a city of the Assyrian Empire.
00:05:02 Based on what he knew about Nineveh,
00:05:05 Jonah considered this to be
00:05:06 an intimidating and threatening assignment.
00:05:09 The Assyrians were known as fierce warriors,
00:05:12 and Nineveh itself was later described
00:05:15 as a “city of bloodshed.”
00:05:19 So you can understand Jonah’s trepidation when Jehovah asks him
00:05:22 to proclaim a judgment message
00:05:23 against this imposing city
00:05:25 and its pagan inhabitants.
00:05:32 In an attempt to find peace,
00:05:34 Jonah decides to go far away from Nineveh
00:05:37 and boards a boat headed for Tarshish.
00:05:45 Tarshish is generally associated
00:05:47 with modern-day Spain.
00:05:49 So from Israel,
00:05:50 this is the complete opposite direction
00:05:52 of Nineveh.
00:05:57 Jonah found anything but peace.
00:06:05 Look!
00:06:13 By the gods.
00:06:14 Furl the sail!
00:06:24 Now, this was no ordinary storm.
00:06:26 It was so severe that the ship
00:06:29 was in danger of being wrecked.
00:06:30 Captain, we’re taking on too much water!
00:06:34 This storm is from the gods!
00:06:36 Baal!
00:06:37 Eshmun!
00:06:39 The crew cried out to their gods,
00:06:42 but Jonah knew the true Source of the storm.
00:06:45 And now he accepts
00:06:47 personal responsibility for the situation.
00:06:51 Lift me up
00:06:52 and throw me into the sea,
00:06:54 and the sea will calm down for you;
00:06:56 for I know that it’s because of me
00:06:58 that this violent storm has come upon you.
00:07:02 Can you imagine the courage it took
00:07:06 for Jonah to make this request?
00:07:08 He had no way of knowing if Jehovah would save him,
00:07:12 but he did not want others to perish on his account.
00:07:28 In his mercy, Jehovah spares Jonah’s life.
00:07:32 How am I still alive?
00:07:34 What will become of me?
00:07:37 When faced
00:07:38 with a difficult assignment,
00:07:40 Jonah “got up to run away from Jehovah
00:07:43 to Tarshish.”
00:07:45 Jonah’s conscience had to bother him;
00:07:47 he had to be questioning his decision.
00:07:50 He tried to take matters into his own hands,
00:07:53 tried to find his own peace.
00:07:56 Where does he find himself?
00:07:58 In the belly of a fish!
00:08:00 Yet he calls to Jehovah in a moment of despair.
00:08:05 O Jehovah,
00:08:09 out of the depths of the Grave,
00:08:12 I cry to you for help.
00:08:15 Please hear my voice.
00:08:20 What I have vowed, I will pay.
00:08:25 Jonah could have reasoned
00:08:27 that this was the end of his assignment as Jehovah’s prophet.
00:08:34 After all, he did disobey direction.
00:08:39 So likely, he was surprised
00:08:41 to hear the word of Jehovah come to him
00:08:43 a second time.
00:08:52 Jonah!
00:08:54 Get up,
00:08:56 go to Nineveh the great city,
00:08:59 and proclaim to her
00:09:00 the message that I tell you.
00:09:05 Yes.
00:09:07 Yes.
00:09:08 Thank you.
00:09:16 At first, Jonah trusted in himself
00:09:19 and didn’t understand
00:09:20 that Jehovah would protect him from the violent Assyrians.
00:09:24 But after being given a second chance, what happens?
00:09:26 Well, then he puts aside
00:09:28 his human concerns
00:09:32 and looks to Jehovah for protection.
00:09:42 In just 40 days more,
00:09:45 Nineveh will be overthrown.
00:09:48 Jehovah, the true God, has spoken.
00:09:50 This city will be destroyed.
00:09:53 Nineveh will be overthrown.
00:09:55 The true God will overthrow Nineveh.
00:10:01 The true God has spoken.
00:10:03 Eventually, the king himself repents
00:10:05 and orders everyone
00:10:07 in Nineveh to do the same.
00:10:09 Jonah learned a valuable lesson
00:10:12 from this experience.
00:10:15 By originally running away from Nineveh,
00:10:17 he chose to trust in himself
00:10:19 rather than putting his trust in Jehovah.
00:10:22 Are you Jonah?
00:10:25 I am.
00:10:27 Mommy says you saved us.
00:10:30 No, Jehovah saved you.
00:10:34 I was just—I was just a messenger.
00:10:41 Jonah learned
00:10:43 that without a doubt
00:10:44 Jehovah protects those who trust and obey Him.
00:10:47 If Jehovah has asked you to do something,
00:10:49 if he’s asked me to do something,
00:10:52 if he’s leading us,
00:10:54 he absolutely will guide us through it.
00:10:57 Jonah’s account proves this.
00:11:01 Although the Ninevites were spared
00:11:04 because they repented (that’s true),
00:11:07 Assyria later
00:11:09 returned to its evil, wicked ways.
00:11:12 About a century
00:11:13 after Jonah’s judgment message,
00:11:16 King Sennacherib of Assyria brought
00:11:18 his armies against the cities of Judah,
00:11:21 including the city he wanted most
00:11:23 —Jerusalem.
00:11:27 King Hezekiah of Judah
00:11:28 was an outstanding king
00:11:30 who “held fast to Jehovah.”
00:11:32 From the beginning of his reign,
00:11:35 he proved to be zealous for true worship
00:11:37 not only in Judah but in all of Israel.
00:11:40 Hezekiah had done so much to stand up for pure worship,
00:11:44 yet now he is faced with the prospect
00:11:47 of a siege against Jerusalem
00:11:48 by Sennacherib’s armies.
00:11:55 Hezekiah agrees to pay Sennacherib
00:11:57 a tribute in return for peace.
00:11:59 Yet, the armies continue their conquests,
00:12:03 as Sennacherib and his men besiege
00:12:05 the strongly fortified city of Lachish.
00:12:11 From here,
00:12:12 Sennacherib sends a part of his army
00:12:14 as well as military chiefs to Jerusalem
00:12:18 in an attempt to demand surrender.
00:12:21 The spokesman for the group was the Rabshakeh,
00:12:23 who spoke Hebrew fluently.
00:12:25 He loudly ridiculed Hezekiah
00:12:29 and taunted Jehovah,
00:12:31 boasting that Jehovah was no match against King Sennacherib.
00:12:35 Imagine what these soldiers
00:12:37 must have been thinking.
00:12:38 Sennacherib’s armies were on a warpath,
00:12:41 taking city after city.
00:12:45 To Hezekiah, this was a defining moment.
00:12:48 He had to decide if he would trust in himself
00:12:52 or trust in Jehovah.
00:12:58 My brothers,
00:12:59 we must remember that Jehovah
00:13:02 is fully able to rescue us,
00:13:03 just as he has in times past.
00:13:04 God’s Word . . .
00:13:05 King Hezekiah,
00:13:08 will you not even now face the facts?
00:13:11 We are trapped!
00:13:13 The Assyrians are at our gate,
00:13:15 and you cling to the belief
00:13:17 that nothing bad will happen.
00:13:19 You will destroy everything
00:13:21 you so hope to preserve
00:13:22 —the temple, Jerusalem,
00:13:24 our very lives.
00:13:25 Shebna, I am not blind
00:13:26 to the dangers that we face.
00:13:29 I too am afraid.
00:13:31 But if Jehovah
00:13:32 allows Jerusalem to fall,
00:13:33 so be it.
00:13:35 How can we give up what belongs to Jehovah?
00:13:40 So as a man of faith,
00:13:42 Hezekiah focused on Jehovah’s ability
00:13:44 to save His people
00:13:46 despite Sennacherib’s continued advances toward Jerusalem.
00:13:53 I’m curious about this king of yours.
00:13:57 Who does he think
00:13:59 will come to save him from me?
00:14:03 Jehovah, your God,
00:14:07 is weak!
00:14:08 He will cringe before my god Asshur.
00:14:15 Hezekiah remained
00:14:17 determined to trust in Jehovah.
00:14:20 This decision required a tremendous amount of faith,
00:14:25 especially with more than
00:14:27 185,000 Assyrian soldiers
00:14:31 headed toward Jerusalem.
00:14:36 Instead of trusting in himself,
00:14:39 he continued to look
00:14:41 for Jehovah as the Source of true peace
00:14:46 even as an attack seemed imminent.
00:14:53 And Jehovah again
00:14:55 showed just how insignificant
00:14:59 human rulers are in comparison to him.
00:15:20 Hezekiah learned
00:15:22 that when a way out seems impossible,
00:15:24 trusting in Jehovah always leads to success.
00:15:29 Jehovah rewarded that trust with victory over the Assyrians.
00:15:33 This is a lesson we can apply now and in the near future.
00:15:38 There may be situations when true worshippers seem trapped,
00:15:41 but never forget that Jehovah is all-powerful.
00:15:46 He’s leading his people,
00:15:48 and we can follow his guidance with full confidence.
00:15:51 Jehovah will protect those who trust in him at Armageddon.
00:15:56 Jerusalem remained safe
00:15:58 against attack for the time being,
00:16:00 but peaceful conditions didn’t last long.
00:16:06 Hezekiah’s son Manasseh
00:16:08 did what was detestable
00:16:10 in the eyes of Jehovah.
00:16:11 He brought back Baal worship
00:16:13 and personally took its vilest practices
00:16:16 to extremes,
00:16:17 even putting a carved image of a false god
00:16:19 right inside Jehovah’s temple.
00:16:22 So here you have a king
00:16:24 who’s supposed to be protecting the people from idolatrous influence
00:16:28 doing the exact opposite —building altars to false gods.
00:16:32 He even went so far as to pass his own sons through the fire,
00:16:36 sacrificing them to these gods.
00:16:38 The peace with God that Hezekiah
00:16:41 worked so hard to achieve for the nation
00:16:44 is now reversed by the actions of his son.
00:16:47 Because of this,
00:16:49 Jehovah punished Manasseh severely.
00:16:51 He allowed the king of Assyria
00:16:53 to take him captive to Babylon.
00:16:55 While in captivity,
00:16:57 Manasseh ultimately repented.
00:17:00 He humbled himself,
00:17:02 and he stayed faithful
00:17:04 right to the end of his life.
00:17:05 Grandfather!
00:17:06 We can imagine him impressing
00:17:08 the importance of faithfulness
00:17:10 to Jehovah on his young grandson Josiah.
00:17:13 Listen to me.
00:17:16 Jehovah is holy,
00:17:20 and you must serve him
00:17:22 the way he wants us to.
00:17:26 All other gods
00:17:29 are powerless.
00:17:31 Yet, in spite of all this,
00:17:34 the people still thought
00:17:36 that they could serve Jehovah and Baal.
00:17:39 So after becoming king,
00:17:42 Josiah started a campaign against idolatry.
00:17:46 I’ve seen these cheaper.
00:17:49 Take it or leave it.
00:17:58 We start here!
00:18:02 No!
00:18:16 This is what we will do to every false god in the land.
00:18:21 He tore down altars used for false worship,
00:18:24 sacred poles, images, and statues.
00:18:27 He was intent  on cleansing the land of idolatry.
00:18:30 Now, he showed remarkable courage
00:18:33 to stand up for true worship at a time when few were doing so.
00:18:39 There’s no doubt this was a difficult task.
00:18:43 At times, he may have even wondered
00:18:45 if he was doing the right thing.
00:18:47 It’s possible Jehovah provided Josiah
00:18:49 with assurance from the prophet Jeremiah.
00:18:54 This is what Jehovah says: “Look!
00:18:57 “A son named Josiah
00:18:59 “will be born to the house of David!
00:19:02 “He will sacrifice on you
00:19:05 “the priests of the high places,
00:19:07 “those making sacrificial smoke on you,
00:19:11 and he will burn human bones on you.”
00:19:15 That prophecy
00:19:17 made over 300 years earlier confirmed
00:19:22 that Josiah was the one prophesied to act against false worship.
00:19:27 This may have given Josiah even greater incentive and courage
00:19:31 to continue his campaign,
00:19:33 which now included repairing the temple.
00:19:35 These actions contributed
00:19:38 to the peaceful conditions
00:19:39 that elevated pure worship.
00:19:43 Josiah did so much
00:19:45 to restore pure worship.
00:19:46 That is why we love him.
00:19:48 Yet, the peoples’ heart condition remained polluted,
00:19:51 so the nation required severe discipline.
00:19:55 Jeremiah prophesied
00:19:56 a conquest of the Babylonians
00:19:58 against Judah.
00:20:00 All this land
00:20:02 will be reduced to ruins,
00:20:04 and this land and its inhabitants
00:20:05 will have to serve the king of Babylon
00:20:08 for 70 years.
00:20:10 Daniel himself may have heard
00:20:12 Jeremiah speak those words.
00:20:13 And he certainly
00:20:15 saw it come true as he and his family were exiled to Babylon.
00:20:20 Talk about peace being interrupted!
00:20:23 Daniel was a young Judean prince taken
00:20:25 from his homeland
00:20:27 and separated from his family.
00:20:32 But being chosen to receive special training
00:20:34 in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar
00:20:37 presented another set of challenges.
00:20:39 The entire way
00:20:41 of Babylonian life was contrary to what Daniel knew growing up in Judah.
00:20:46 But Daniel was determined not to pollute himself
00:20:49 with foods Jehovah would not approve of.
00:20:54 And Jehovah blessed
00:20:56 Daniel’s determination to be faithful,
00:20:57 as he was selected to serve
00:20:59 as one of King Nebuchadnezzar’s wise men.
00:21:10 Nebuchadnezzar was a warrior-king
00:21:12 intent on building a great empire.
00:21:15 After he officially
00:21:17 took the throne in 624 B.C.E., his domain
00:21:21 grew with each conquest.
00:21:23 Babylon became an epicenter of trade and commerce.
00:21:29 Nebuchadnezzar undertook
00:21:30 huge building projects throughout the city,
00:21:32 which made the city seem impregnable.
00:21:36 Imagine the sense of security the inhabitants of Babylon must have felt,
00:21:41 locked safely behind the city’s walls.
00:21:45 Nebuchadnezzar
00:21:47 attributed the prosperity
00:21:48 and security all around him
00:21:50 to the power of his false gods.
00:21:52 The chief of these false gods was Marduk, the god of war.
00:21:58 Yet, these false gods and their priests would prove to be worthless.
00:22:03 One night,
00:22:06 King Nebuchadnezzar had a strange dream.
00:22:17 Call the wise men!
00:22:21 O king, may you live on forever.
00:22:23 Relate the dream to your servants.
00:22:24 We will tell the interpretation.
00:22:26 No!
00:22:27 If you don’t make the dream known to me
00:22:29 along with the interpretation,
00:22:31 you’ll be dismembered,
00:22:32 and your houses will be turned into public latrines.
00:22:37 There is not a man on earth
00:22:38 who can do what the king demands.
00:22:40 What the king is asking is difficult.
00:22:41 No one exists
00:22:42 who could tell this to the king except
00:22:45 —except the gods.
00:22:53 Seize them!
00:22:55 Kill them!
00:22:59 Jerah.
00:23:00 You’re in danger.
00:23:02 Why? What happened?
00:23:02 I didn’t hear everything,
00:23:03 but the wise men angered the king.
00:23:05 Everyone is to be executed by dawn.
00:23:07 Bring Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah here.
00:23:10 I’ll try to learn more.
00:23:13 This edict to kill all the wise men
00:23:15 would also include Daniel and his companions.
00:23:18 So let’s look at this from Daniel’s perspective.
00:23:21 Here he is, a young man in a foreign land,
00:23:23 serving in the court of one of the most powerful and violent men alive.
00:23:28 And that man is now demanding
00:23:30 that someone, in effect, read his mind:
00:23:33 “Tell me my dream,
00:23:35 and tell me what it means.”
00:23:39 O king,
00:23:41 interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.
00:23:45 He knows your dream and what it means.
00:23:50 Well, where is your God?
00:23:51 Where?
00:23:55 I believe that he— I know that he will reveal it to me.
00:24:00 Please, give me time.
00:24:05 Daniel is not acting
00:24:07 on previous experience.
00:24:09 He hasn’t received interpretations of dreams from Jehovah.
00:24:13 Instead, he is acting on faith
00:24:15 —faith that he had learned
00:24:17 by studying the sacred books of his time.
00:24:20 These books
00:24:21 likely included the inspired writings
00:24:24 of Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other prophets.
00:24:29 Oh, we can only imagine
00:24:31 Daniel poring over these scrolls,
00:24:34 opening up his heart to Jehovah,
00:24:37 begging Jehovah to give him wisdom and understanding.
00:24:39 He loved it.
00:24:41 There’s no doubt that
00:24:43 as Daniel studied these accounts,
00:24:45 his faith was strengthened
00:24:47 and his bond with Jehovah drew even closer.
00:24:51 So even though Daniel knew nothing of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream,
00:24:55 he was fully convinced
00:24:57 that Jehovah would reveal the dream
00:24:59 and its interpretation
00:25:01 and prove to be Daniel’s salvation.
00:25:05 Do we know exactly which accounts
00:25:07 Daniel was able to draw from at this time?
00:25:10 It’s impossible to say for a certainty,
00:25:12 but we do know he had access to “the books.”
00:25:16 He references the prophecies of Jeremiah.
00:25:18 Daniel could see how Jehovah blessed faithful, obedient men in the past.
00:25:23 So by asking Nebuchadnezzar for time,
00:25:26 he wasn’t looking to buy himself
00:25:28 another day of life;
00:25:29 he was allowing Jehovah to reward his faith
00:25:32 by revealing the dream to him.
00:25:37 Daniel strikes a balance here.
00:25:40 Although he is confident
00:25:42 that Jehovah will reveal the dream to him,
00:25:45 he isn’t casual in the way he handled the situation.
00:25:49 He did what any God-fearing man
00:25:52 would do here.
00:25:54 He approached Jehovah in prayer.
00:25:57 O Jehovah,
00:25:59 surely you didn’t bring us here just to die.
00:26:02 What will people say?
00:26:04 We told them
00:26:06 that you are the God of the heavens,
00:26:08 the only God who can reveal secrets.
00:26:12 Please, vindicate yourself.
00:26:56 I have found a man from the exiles of Judah
00:26:58 who can make known
00:27:00 the interpretation to the king.
00:27:01 I know who he is.
00:27:04 Can you really make known to me
00:27:06 the dream that I saw
00:27:07 and its interpretation?
00:27:21 There is a God in the heavens
00:27:23 who is a Revealer of secrets,
00:27:27 and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar
00:27:30 what is to happen
00:27:31 in the final part of the days.
00:27:36 This is your dream:
00:27:46 You saw an immense image.
00:27:56 That image
00:27:58 was standing in front of you.
00:28:02 You yourself are the head of gold.
00:28:07 But after you another kingdom will rise,
00:28:10 inferior to you.
00:28:12 Then another kingdom, a third one, of copper,
00:28:17 that will rule over the whole earth.
00:28:20 As for the fourth kingdom,
00:28:23 it will be strong like iron.
00:28:27 The kingdom will be divided.
00:28:30 And as the toes of the feet
00:28:32 were partly of iron and partly of clay,
00:28:35 so the kingdom will be partly strong
00:28:38 and partly fragile.
00:28:43 This took a tremendous amount of faith
00:28:46 and courage on the part of Daniel.
00:28:48 Now, we may find our peace threatened,
00:28:51 our very lives might be on the line.
00:28:55 In that moment, we can turn to Jehovah God in prayer,
00:28:59 opening up our hearts, confident that he will support us.
00:29:04 Like both Daniel and Jonah,
00:29:07 we’ve been given an assignment
00:29:08 to proclaim a message.
00:29:10 This requires courage to speak out boldly
00:29:13 concerning Jehovah’s judgments
00:29:15 against those who oppose his sovereignty.
00:29:18 Both of these prophets are excellent examples
00:29:20 of Jehovah backing those who trust in him.
00:29:25 Jehovah will always be with us as long as we have faith in him.
00:29:29 When we face situations that seem impossible,
00:29:33 as in the case with Hezekiah,
00:29:35 we have the ability to tap
00:29:37 into the most powerful force there is!
00:29:41 As this system comes to a close,
00:29:44 we will find ourselves in situations
00:29:46 that test our courage and threaten our peace.
00:29:50 We will have to stand up for pure worship
00:29:53 just like Josiah, and this will be unpopular.
00:29:57 But with Jehovah on our side,
00:29:59 we can face those situations with confidence.
00:30:02 He’s all-powerful,
00:30:03 and he’s going to help us through it.
00:30:05 Now, here’s the interesting thing:
00:30:08 Some of the prophecies that Daniel recorded
00:30:12 applied not only to the future of the Babylonian Empire
00:30:16 but also outline world events
00:30:20 to our day and beyond.
00:30:23 And these events are being fulfilled
00:30:27 right before our very eyes!

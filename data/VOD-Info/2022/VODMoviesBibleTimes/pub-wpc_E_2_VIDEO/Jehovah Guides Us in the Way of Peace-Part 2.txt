00:00:07 Bible prophecy is a fascinating subject.
00:00:10 Prophecy is far more than just predictions about the future.
00:00:15 Jehovah knows all the facts.
00:00:18 He can even control and change factors
00:00:21 to ensure the outcome he desires.
00:00:23 At Isaiah 55:11, he says:
00:00:26 “My word that goes out of my mouth . . .
00:00:29 “will not return to me without results, . . .
00:00:32 and it will have sure success.”
00:00:35 Jehovah’s prophecies
00:00:37 have a perfect record of success.
00:00:40 He has led his people in the past.
00:00:43 So when he prophesies
00:00:45 that he’ll lead his people to real, lasting peace in the future,
00:00:50 this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!
00:00:54 The prophecies given to Daniel
00:00:56 clearly show that God’s Kingdom
00:00:59 will without a doubt bring lasting peace for all mankind.
00:01:25 I have found a man from the exiles of Judah
00:01:27 who can make known the interpretation to the king.
00:01:29 I know who he is.
00:01:33 Can you really make known to me
00:01:35 the dream that I saw
00:01:36 and its interpretation?
00:01:47 This is your dream.
00:01:53 Jehovah is the Great Timekeeper.
00:01:56 The prophetic portions of the book of Daniel
00:01:58 build faith by showing that Jehovah knows
00:02:01 the course of history centuries
00:02:03 —even millenniums—in advance.
00:02:05 While portions of these prophecies
00:02:07 were fulfilled in Daniel’s time,
00:02:10 many of the details are being fulfilled
00:02:12 right down to our day.
00:02:16 So as we discover
00:02:17 the significance of these prophecies,
00:02:19 we’re excited about what lies ahead.
00:02:21 And our confidence grows as we discern
00:02:23 how Jehovah has been leading his people all along.
00:02:29 In the days of those kings,
00:02:31 the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
00:02:34 that will never be destroyed.
00:02:39 The divine dream
00:02:41 that Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar
00:02:44 constitutes a prophecy
00:02:46 crucial for the lasting peace of mankind
00:02:50 —a promise from Jehovah to set up a Kingdom
00:02:55 that would be vastly superior to earthly kingdoms.
00:03:00 History has shown us
00:03:02 how every type of human government imaginable has failed.
00:03:07 So how would Jehovah’s government come?
00:03:11 When would it arrive?
00:03:14 These were questions Daniel himself likely had.
00:03:25 Jehovah is “a Revealer of secrets.”
00:03:27 He would eventually answer
00:03:29 these questions in due time.
00:03:32 As a diligent student of the Scriptures,
00:03:35 the prophet Daniel
00:03:37 had full faith and confidence
00:03:39 in Jehovah’s ability
00:03:40 to schedule events and bring them about.
00:03:43 And now likely in his 90’s,
00:03:45 Daniel was particularly interested
00:03:48 in prophecies regarding the restoration
00:03:51 of his beloved city, Jerusalem.
00:03:57 “When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,
00:04:00 “I will turn my attention to you,
00:04:03 “and I will make good my promise
00:04:08 by bringing you back to this place.”
00:04:14 Jeremiah’s prophecy
00:04:16 had given Daniel hope
00:04:18 because it indicated that the Jews
00:04:19 would soon return to their homeland of Judah
00:04:22 and rebuild Jerusalem along with its temple.
00:04:25 That makes sense that Daniel would be interested
00:04:28 in the restoration of the temple because from the time of King Solomon,
00:04:31 the temple in Jerusalem was the world center for worship of Jehovah.
00:04:36 So it was very important to the Jews.
00:04:39 In the Scriptures,
00:04:41 the temple was often called “the house of Jehovah.”
00:04:45 Now, after Jehovah allowed young Daniel and the rest of the Israelites
00:04:50 to be taken captive to Babylon,
00:04:52 the city of Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed.
00:04:56 So naturally, a God-fearing man like Daniel
00:05:00 would be interested in seeing the temple rebuilt.
00:05:04 Again, as a man of faith,
00:05:07 Daniel supplicates Jehovah.
00:05:12 O Jehovah,
00:05:15 do hear,
00:05:19 do forgive.
00:05:21 O Jehovah, do pay attention and act.
00:05:24 Do not delay,
00:05:26 for your own sake,
00:05:29 O my God.
00:05:35 O Daniel,
00:05:38 now I have come to give you
00:05:40 insight and understanding.
00:05:46 The visit of this angel
00:05:48 gave Daniel some answers and a hope.
00:05:52 Jehovah’s messenger provided
00:05:54 so many details of promises to come.
00:05:57 Jehovah assured Daniel
00:05:59 that the Jews would be restored to their homeland.
00:06:02 Their exile in Babylonia was almost over.
00:06:06 But that wasn’t the end of the angel’s message.
00:06:10 He gave Daniel insight
00:06:12 into something of far greater significance.
00:06:16 Daniel was told when God’s people could expect the arrival
00:06:19 of the foretold Messiah.
00:06:20 The Messiah would be the ruler who would make it possible
00:06:23 for obedient humans to regain the blessing of perfect life
00:06:27 —free from sickness, free from death.
00:06:31 The Messiah would pave the way
00:06:33 for lasting peace for mankind.
00:06:37 What a strengthening message
00:06:39 for Daniel to receive!
00:06:42 And he likely had some questions.
00:06:44 The angel told Daniel that Jerusalem and its temple
00:06:48 would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.
00:06:51 Yet, at the time,
00:06:53 Jerusalem and the temple were in shambles.
00:06:57 How would they rebuild it?
00:06:58 And who would be responsible for this?
00:07:01 Babylon had been overtaken by Medo-Persia,
00:07:04 pictured by the silver chest and arms
00:07:07 of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.
00:07:12 Not long after
00:07:13 this change in world rulership,
00:07:15 Persian King Cyrus
00:07:16 issued a royal decree.
00:07:18 It was a commission from Cyrus himself
00:07:21 for the Jews to return to Jerusalem
00:07:23 and rebuild the temple.
00:07:30 King Cyrus’ release of the Jews was in notable contrast
00:07:34 with the Babylonians’ desire to keep them captive.
00:07:37 Cyrus even authorized funds
00:07:39 from the king’s house to cover construction expenses.
00:07:42 Why would this pagan ruler
00:07:45 have any interest in, first of all,
00:07:48 letting the captive Jews free and, second,
00:07:51 financing the rebuilding of their temple in Jerusalem?
00:07:56 Ezra’s words at 2 Chronicles 36:22 tell us:
00:08:00 “Jehovah stirred the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia.”
00:08:06 Jehovah can maneuver events to make sure his word is fulfilled.
00:08:11 He can use anyone to accomplish his purpose,
00:08:15 and this would include even a foreign king, like Cyrus.
00:08:20 So with this decree, the Jews returned to Judah.
00:08:30 Launching a construction project
00:08:32 and resettling an entire city
00:08:34 was a major undertaking.
00:08:37 High Priest Jeshua and Governor Zerubbabel
00:08:40 were appointed to take the lead
00:08:42 in setting up the altar
00:08:44 and rebuilding the temple.
00:08:47 But this wasn’t without its challenges.
00:08:49 Enemies of Judah sought to sabotage the building of the temple,
00:08:53 attempting to disrupt the peace.
00:08:56 Initial attempts
00:08:58 to halt the building progress failed;
00:09:00 however, eventually these enemies succeeded
00:09:02 in having an official ban
00:09:04 placed on the temple-building work.
00:09:06 What was the problem here?
00:09:09 It appears the Jews let fear of man
00:09:11 stop the building work
00:09:14 after about 14 years of constant opposition.
00:09:19 Now, there is a bigger picture at play here.
00:09:21 Remember, Daniel’s prophecy foretold
00:09:24 that Jerusalem and its temple
00:09:26 would be rebuilt before the Messiah arrived.
00:09:29 Yet, with the work halted,
00:09:32 the temple remained unfinished.
00:09:34 What would that mean for the coming of the Messiah?
00:09:37 Jeshua and Zerubbabel needed guidance.
00:09:40 This is where Jehovah steps in to provide encouragement
00:09:45 —first through the prophet Haggai.
00:09:50 Haggai’s clear and powerful message
00:09:52 gets right to the heart of the matter.
00:09:54 He conveys Jehovah’s direction to get up
00:09:57 and keep building the temple despite opposition.
00:10:00 The Jews had a decision to make here.
00:10:03 Would they allow opposition to hinder the work?
00:10:07 Or would they listen to Jehovah’s words
00:10:09 through Haggai and keep rebuilding the temple?
00:10:12 To guide them further, Jehovah spoke to the prophet Zechariah
00:10:17 and gave him visions
00:10:18 to provide the Jews with a message.
00:10:20 Zechariah made it clear to the Jews
00:10:22 that Jehovah would not allow their opposers to harm them
00:10:25 or thwart the temple-rebuilding work.
00:10:28 It was only with Jehovah’s guidance that the Jews would succeed.
00:10:32 Energized by Jehovah’s motivating words through these two prophets,
00:10:36 they courageously resumed construction
00:10:38 of the temple, and it was inaugurated
00:10:41 in 515 B.C.E.
00:10:44 Now, it seems that at some point
00:10:45 over the following decades,
00:10:47 the Jews lost their initial zeal.
00:10:52 The temple was rebuilt and inaugurated,
00:10:55 but Jerusalem’s walls and gates remained unfinished,
00:10:57 with huge gaps left in them.
00:11:00 That was significant because the city was surrounded by enemy nations.
00:11:04 Without the protection of these walls,
00:11:07 Jerusalem seemed vulnerable.
00:11:10 When Nehemiah learned of this,
00:11:12 he was visibly distressed.
00:11:15 What’s going on, Hanani?
00:11:18 How are our people?
00:11:20 Not good.
00:11:22 The conditions are disgraceful.
00:11:26 The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,
00:11:29 and its gates have been burned with fire.
00:11:34 What about the temple?
00:11:35 It stands,
00:11:36 but the services
00:11:37 are nothing but empty rituals.
00:11:40 Most of the people and the priests
00:11:42 ignore God’s Law.
00:11:44 Nehemiah must have been shocked
00:11:46 to hear about the condition of Jerusalem.
00:11:49 At this time, he was serving as cupbearer
00:11:51 to the Persian King in Shushan.
00:11:53 The journey from Shushan to Jerusalem
00:11:56 was about 1,000 miles (1,600 km).
00:11:58 Still,
00:12:00 Nehemiah felt compelled to act.
00:12:09 Nehemiah rejoiced at the prospect
00:12:12 of rebuilding the walls.
00:12:17 The Jews at this time
00:12:19 were still fearful of their opposers,
00:12:21 but Nehemiah was intent on changing that.
00:12:26 He knew that Jehovah was behind the work.
00:12:29 And if Jehovah is behind something,
00:12:32 there’s no amount of opposition that can thwart his will,
00:12:36 so the wall repairs began.
00:12:43 This isn’t to say
00:12:44 that there were not challenges along the way.
00:12:47 Opposers did not give up.
00:12:52 I recommend we turn the accusation
00:12:55 of sedition against Nehemiah.
00:12:58 That’s brilliant!
00:13:00 Yes,
00:13:02 he will beg for our help.
00:13:05 These opposers threatened the Jews,
00:13:07 schemed against them,
00:13:09 and even accused Nehemiah of treason.
00:13:14 Nehemiah’s peace and the peace
00:13:17 of the Jews supporting the work was threatened.
00:13:20 But despite the attempts of opposers,
00:13:24 Nehemiah and the Jews looked to Jehovah
00:13:27 for guidance and kept working.
00:13:33 When Jehovah declares his purpose,
00:13:35 there is nothing that can prevent him
00:13:38 from carrying it out.
00:13:40 So if Jehovah wanted a rebuilt Jerusalem,
00:13:44 complete with rebuilt walls,
00:13:47 Nehemiah would have complete faith in Jehovah’s ability
00:13:51 to support the rebuilding efforts.
00:13:53 And with this support,
00:13:55 the city walls were completed
00:13:58 in just 52 days.
00:14:03 Nehemiah, the wall is complete!
00:14:09 That’s it.
00:14:12 With rebuilt walls and a rebuilt temple,
00:14:16 physically the city was in good condition.
00:14:19 However, about 12 years later,
00:14:22 Nehemiah returned to Shushan.
00:14:25 During his prolonged absence, the spiritual state of the Jews deteriorated.
00:14:30 It was so sad,
00:14:32 as many in Israel fell back into bad practices.
00:14:36 Some in the priesthood,
00:14:37 including High Priest Eliashib,
00:14:40 no longer took their responsibilities seriously.
00:14:43 Therefore, Jehovah raised up the prophet Malachi
00:14:46 to counsel the negligent priests.
00:14:50 Why have you Levites despised Jehovah’s name?
00:14:52 Despised it?
00:14:53 You present a blind,
00:14:55 lame, or sick animal as a sacrifice
00:14:57 and say that it is nothing bad.
00:14:59 Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?
00:15:01 And there’s another thing you do
00:15:03 so that he no longer
00:15:04 looks favorably on anything you offer.
00:15:07 Because you betray the wife of your youth,
00:15:09 although she’s your partner, your legal wife.
00:15:12 The lips of a priest
00:15:14 should safeguard knowledge,
00:15:16 and people should seek the law from his mouth.
00:15:19 But you,
00:15:21 you have made many stumble.
00:15:25 Evidently, Malachi’s words
00:15:28 had little effect on the priesthood.
00:15:30 Despite his warnings, the people refused to change.
00:15:35 When Nehemiah returned, what he found shocked him.
00:15:39 For a long time,
00:15:41 the priests and the Levites
00:15:42 have not taken their duties seriously.
00:15:44 When the people saw that,
00:15:46 they stopped bringing in tithes.
00:15:47 Without the tithes,
00:15:49 most Levites and singers
00:15:51 returned to their fields.
00:15:53 Did Eliashib
00:15:54 not tell the people to bring your provisions?
00:15:57 In your absence,
00:15:58 the prophet Malachi warned him
00:16:00 and all the priests.
00:16:03 But Eliashib—
00:16:05 He took our storeroom
00:16:06 and emptied it of our provisions.
00:16:08 He gave it to Tobiah to use as a dining hall.
00:16:12 In addition
00:16:14 to no longer providing financial support,
00:16:16 the people started conducting business on the Sabbath.
00:16:20 What are you selling today?
00:16:22 Only the best quality fish from Tyre.
00:16:28 They were marrying foreign women.
00:16:29 I’m marrying Gizla today.
00:16:31 Gizla?
00:16:32 That Moabite girl?
00:16:36 I heard you bind yourself with an oath
00:16:38 and a curse not to take a wife from the nations!
00:16:42 This action could have disrupted
00:16:44 the line to the Messiah,
00:16:45 and it definitely threatened to contaminate pure worship.
00:16:49 These men were bringing the restored nation
00:16:52 into disfavor with Jehovah.
00:16:55 This is the same reason why Jehovah allowed Babylon
00:16:58 to destroy Jerusalem in the first place.
00:17:01 So Nehemiah took action against these faithless ones.
00:17:12 Please cleanse this room
00:17:13 and replace the utensils.
00:17:14 No!
00:17:15 Yes, my lord.
00:17:15 And gather all the Levites,
00:17:16 the singers, and the deputy rulers to me.
00:17:18 I’m assigning them all back to their posts.
00:17:20 He enforced the strict observance
00:17:23 of the Sabbath.
00:17:24 What’s the meaning of this?
00:17:25 I had to sleep on the ground last night.
00:17:27 You know God’s Law:
00:17:30 No work,
00:17:32 no business on the Sabbath!
00:17:34 Go!
00:17:35 You and all the Levites, guard the gates
00:17:37 and keep the Sabbath holy.
00:17:39 Don’t let anyone in!
00:17:43 He disciplined those who had taken foreign wives.
00:17:47 Did you not swear never to marry someone
00:17:50 who doesn’t serve Jehovah?
00:17:51 Nehemiah, nobody cares.
00:17:54 Did you not?
00:17:56 Yes! Yes!
00:17:57 Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah
00:17:59 and your own oath?
00:18:02 There’s no doubt
00:18:04 that Jehovah was guiding Nehemiah’s efforts all along.
00:18:08 After a spiritual cleansing was done,
00:18:10 a measure of peace was again enjoyed.
00:18:14 And with this vigorous
00:18:16 rooting out of apostasy,
00:18:18 the record of the Hebrew Scriptures
00:18:20 comes to a close.
00:18:26 Now, we don’t have an inspired record of events
00:18:28 in the centuries leading up to Jesus’ birth,
00:18:31 but history shows that Jerusalem
00:18:33 underwent several changes during these years.
00:18:36 The Medo-Persian Empire
00:18:38 was overtaken by Greece,
00:18:40 represented by the copper belly and thighs
00:18:42 of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.
00:18:46 While the city seemed to survive the change in control
00:18:48 without any physical damage, its spiritual state was threatened.
00:18:53 The Greek Empire set the stage for the spread
00:18:56 of Greek language, culture, and religious thought,
00:19:00 and Israel was affected by this influence.
00:19:04 Years later, King Antiochus IV
00:19:07 was determined to eradicate Jewish worship and customs.
00:19:11 He went so far as to sacrifice a pig
00:19:14 to the Greek god Zeus
00:19:15 at the temple of Jehovah.
00:19:18 This was a vicious attempt
00:19:20 to defile and to stamp out pure worship.
00:19:23 However, the desecration had the opposite effect.
00:19:26 It sparked an uprising
00:19:28 of zealous Jews, and three years later,
00:19:30 they cleansed the temple
00:19:32 and rededicated it to Jehovah.
00:19:35 About a century later,
00:19:37 Jerusalem experienced another change in rulership
00:19:40 as Rome became the dominant world power.
00:19:45 Rome corresponded to the legs of iron
00:19:48 in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image.
00:19:50 Under the rule
00:19:52 of Herod the Great,
00:19:53 Jerusalem enjoyed considerable prosperity.
00:19:56 Herod’s greatest work, however,
00:19:58 was the reconstruction of the temple
00:20:00 and its building complex.
00:20:02 The temple and its daily sacrifices
00:20:04 remained in operation down to Jesus’ day.
00:20:07 The Bible record picks up
00:20:08 before Jesus was born.
00:20:27 May Jehovah have mercy on us!
00:20:28 What’s happening?
00:20:29 Is the sun up already?
00:20:30 Are they . . .
00:20:32 are they . . . angels?
00:20:34 Do not be afraid,
00:20:35 for look!
00:20:37 I am declaring to you good news
00:20:39 of a great joy that all the people will have.
00:20:41 For today there was born
00:20:43 to you in David’s city a savior,
00:20:46 who is Christ the Lord.
00:20:48 Jesus’ birth and ministry
00:20:50 fulfilled many prophecies.
00:20:52 In 29 C.E., Jehovah anointed Jesus with holy spirit.
00:20:56 This corresponds exactly to the words of Daniel’s prophecy
00:21:00 that Jehovah gave him more than 500 years earlier.
00:21:04 The promised Messiah had arrived!
00:21:07 Early in his ministry, Jesus read these words
00:21:11 from the prophecy of Isaiah.
00:21:15 The scroll of Isaiah the prophet reads:
00:21:18 “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me,
00:21:22 “because he anointed me
00:21:24 “to declare good news to the poor.
00:21:27 “He sent me
00:21:29 “to proclaim liberty to the captives
00:21:30 “and a recovery of sight to the blind,
00:21:33 “to send the crushed ones away free,
00:21:36 to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.”
00:21:48 Today this scripture
00:21:50 that you just heard is fulfilled.
00:22:00 Holy spirit empowered Jesus to perform
00:22:03 many miracles in just a few short years on earth.
00:22:06 This had a profound effect on the people living in his day.
00:22:10 I am a very sick woman.
00:22:13 I’ve suffered from a flow of blood
00:22:16 for some 12 years.
00:22:18 He can heal me!
00:22:20 Even if I could touch
00:22:23 just the fringes
00:22:25 of his outer garment, I will get well!
00:22:39 Who touched my outer garment?
00:22:41 Who touched me?
00:22:43 Please, . . .
00:22:46 please forgive me, my Lord.
00:22:48 It was I who touched you!
00:22:52 I have faith in you!
00:22:54 I knew that if I could just touch
00:22:57 the fringes of your outer garment,
00:23:00 I could get well.
00:23:03 Take courage, daughter!
00:23:05 Your faith has made you well.
00:23:12 The miracles Jesus performed were unlike
00:23:14 anything the people had seen before.
00:23:16 Finally, the people had hope
00:23:20 —a hope for the future, a hope for peace.
00:23:23 He even demonstrated that he had power far beyond any human ruler.
00:23:30 Lord, Mary is here!
00:23:40 Lord!
00:23:41 If you had been here,
00:23:44 my brother would not have died!
00:23:55 Lazarus!
00:23:56 Come out!
00:24:16 Free him, and let him go!
00:24:21 There is so much we can learn
00:24:23 from Jesus’ miracles, works, and teachings.
00:24:26 They reveal Jehovah’s purpose and power.
00:24:30 They show how enjoyable,
00:24:31 how peaceful life will be under God’s Messianic Ruler.
00:24:36 Humans alive at this time could see visible proof of this.
00:24:40 Jesus’ ministry accomplished so much
00:24:43 in just three and a half years.
00:24:46 And prophecy regarding the Messiah
00:24:48 continued to be fulfilled as his opposers succeeded
00:24:52 in putting him to death.
00:25:06 With the sacrifice
00:25:08 of Jesus’ perfect human life,
00:25:09 the entire arrangement
00:25:11 for worshipping Jehovah had changed.
00:25:13 There was no longer a need for animal sacrifices.
00:25:17 Pure worship was no longer centered around the temple in Jerusalem.
00:25:22 The only way to worship Jehovah acceptably was through the Messiah.
00:25:27 Now people everywhere could find the way to peace
00:25:31 through faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.
00:25:35 The Jewish system of worship
00:25:37 under the Mosaic Law was over.
00:25:39 Jerusalem and the temple no longer had Jehovah’s favor.
00:25:42 Jesus’ perfect human sacrifice
00:25:45 was the only solution for lasting peace.
00:25:48 So, what did this mean for the city of Jerusalem and the temple?
00:25:53 Well, before his death,
00:25:55 Jesus provided his followers with a warning
00:25:58 regarding Jerusalem’s destruction.
00:26:00 At Luke 21:20, 21, he says:
00:26:04 “When you see Jerusalem
00:26:06 “surrounded by encamped armies,
00:26:08 “then know that the desolating of her
00:26:10 “has drawn near. . . .
00:26:11 “Let those in the midst of her leave,
00:26:14 and let those in the countryside not enter into her.”
00:26:18 A good ruler guides his people.
00:26:21 Although it wasn’t yet time for him to take the throne as Ruler of God’s Kingdom,
00:26:25 Jesus (by the way he acted) gave us insight into the kind of ruler he would be.
00:26:32 By providing first-century Christians
00:26:34 with a warning to leave Jerusalem
00:26:36 and all Judea,
00:26:38 he was guiding them and protecting them.
00:26:41 Jesus prophesied the destruction of the city,
00:26:44 and just a few decades later,
00:26:46 that prophecy came true.
00:26:48 The Roman Empire still had control of Judea,
00:26:51 and tensions ran high
00:26:53 between the Romans and the Jews.
00:26:55 Eventually, the Jews
00:26:57 revolted against Roman rule.
00:27:12 With the city surrounded
00:27:14 and Roman forces closing in,
00:27:15 it seemed there was no way out.
00:27:17 But Jehovah’s word cannot go unfulfilled.
00:27:21 For no apparent reason,
00:27:23 the Roman forces withdrew!
00:27:29 For faithful Christians,
00:27:31 this was their opportunity.
00:27:34 It’s simple:
00:27:36 Those who followed Jesus’ direction
00:27:38 to leave Judea were guided to safety.
00:27:41 For those who delayed,
00:27:43 escape became difficult or impossible.
00:27:54 There was no doubt
00:27:56 that Jerusalem no longer enjoyed Jehovah’s special favor and protection.
00:28:07 The city and its temple
00:28:09 were completely destroyed.
00:28:22 There are parallels we can draw from the warning Jesus gave
00:28:25 to those first-century Christians
00:28:28 to the warning we have been given for our day.
00:28:31 Jesus gave us one composite sign
00:28:33 that indicates the destruction of this current system of things
00:28:37 is very close.
00:28:39 Prophecies in the Bible give us no doubt
00:28:42 that we are living in “the last days.”
00:28:45 Jehovah has not revealed all the details of how everything will work out.
00:28:49 But we know that everything he has revealed will come true.
00:28:53 This includes details outlining how world events
00:28:56 would unfold in the time of the end
00:28:59 before mankind would experience permanent peace.
00:29:02 Remember, Daniel’s prophecy indicated
00:29:06 that there would be only one dominant world power in place
00:29:10 at the time of the end.
00:29:11 By World War I,
00:29:13 the power represented by the feet
00:29:15 of iron and clay had emerged.
00:29:17 During that war, Britain and America
00:29:20 forged a partnership
00:29:22 that continued through the Second World War.
00:29:28 This means a special relationship
00:29:30 between the British Commonwealth and Empire
00:29:33 and the United States of America.
00:29:36 Neither the sure prevention of war
00:29:39 nor the continuous rise
00:29:42 of world organization will begin
00:29:45 without what I have called
00:29:48 the fraternal association
00:29:49 of the English-speaking people.
00:29:56 These two countries
00:29:58 continue to be a dual English-speaking world power.
00:30:02 The characteristics of iron and clay
00:30:04 used to represent this world power are significant.
00:30:08 And as the toes of the feet
00:30:10 were partly of iron and partly of clay,
00:30:13 so the kingdom
00:30:15 will be partly strong and partly fragile.
00:30:23 At times, the United States and Britain
00:30:25 have displayed ironlike strength
00:30:27 through their involvement in armed conflicts.
00:30:32 However, iron mixed with clay is considerably weakened.
00:30:36 This can be observed as common people
00:30:39 undermined the Anglo-American World Power’s ability
00:30:42 to act with ironlike strength.
00:30:46 As the political and social developments
00:30:48 foretold in the Bible come to a climax,
00:30:51 we have a measure of peace.
00:30:53 We know Jehovah will guide his people,
00:30:56 even as the world’s spiritual and moral condition sinks to new depths.
00:31:03 As many in first-century Jerusalem
00:31:05 continued their lives
00:31:07 as if nothing had changed,
00:31:09 so, too, today many
00:31:11 continue on with their lives.
00:31:13 Meanwhile, we remain alert
00:31:15 as we see fulfillment of Bible prophecy
00:31:18 right before our eyes.
00:31:21 In the days of those kings,
00:31:23 the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
00:31:27 that will never be destroyed.
00:31:30 The book of Revelation
00:31:32 tells us what will soon happen.
00:31:34 The political rulers of the world will give the United Nations
00:31:38 unprecedented power and authority.
00:31:41 The apostle Paul foretold that the nations will declare
00:31:44 “Peace and security!”
00:31:47 But it won’t prove to be true peace.
00:31:52 The nations supporting the UN
00:31:54 will attack the institutions of false religion.
00:32:06 Then a coalition of earth’s governments that the prophet Ezekiel
00:32:09 calls “Gog of the land of Magog”
00:32:11 will attack God’s people.
00:32:13 Yet, we don’t need to be fearful.
00:32:17 That’s when we can put into action
00:32:19 all of the lessons we’ve learned.
00:32:21 Those who trust and obey Jehovah’s guidance
00:32:25 can look to the near future with confidence.
00:32:28 As we’ve seen, Jehovah has always been
00:32:31 in control of the situation.
00:32:33 He has never guided his people
00:32:35 in a certain direction but then failed to provide for them.
00:32:38 That’s why we can say that the lessons we learn
00:32:41 from the faithful men we’ve studied
00:32:43 are more than just lessons.
00:32:45 This has been Jehovah paving the way for peace from the start.
00:32:50 Looking back, we see exactly how Jehovah has led his people.
00:32:55 It took many years, but he’s been in control the whole time.
00:32:59 Would it make sense to think he isn’t in control anymore?
00:33:03 No power in heaven or on earth
00:33:06 can prevent Jehovah from accomplishing his express purpose.
00:33:09 He has never relinquished control,
00:33:12 and he is still guiding his people.
00:33:15 Now think about this:
00:33:17 If Jehovah has guided his people to this point,
00:33:22 we can have full confidence
00:33:24 that trust and obedience to his direction
00:33:27 will prove to be our salvation,
00:33:30 even if a way out seems impossible.
00:33:34 Jehovah is all-powerful!
00:33:37 He’s going to help us through whatever we may face.
00:33:45 We won’t have to fight,
00:33:56 and we won’t need to fear annihilation.
00:33:58 Jehovah has things
00:34:01 under control.
00:34:04 “And this kingdom
00:34:06 “will not be passed on to any other people.
00:34:11 “It will crush and put an end
00:34:13 “to all these kingdoms.
00:34:31 And it alone will stand forever.”
00:34:35 God’s Kingdom will fill
00:34:37 and renew the entire earth.
00:34:43 Jehovah’s promises
00:34:45 will be completely fulfilled.
00:34:49 Lasting peace will finally become
00:34:52 a reality for all mankind.
00:34:55 Just imagine what faithful servants
00:34:58 have to look forward to under Jesus’ heavenly rule!
00:35:01 He will be able to provide what no man ever could.
00:35:06 Can you imagine what that will be like?
00:35:30 “For look!
00:35:31 “I am creating new heavens and a new earth;
00:35:35 “and the former things will not be called to mind,
00:35:42 nor will they come up into the heart.”
00:35:48 “The righteous will possess the earth,
00:35:53 and they will live forever on it.”
00:36:17 “He will swallow up death forever,
00:36:22 and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.”
00:36:36 “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes,
00:36:40 “and death will be no more,
00:36:42 “neither will mourning
00:36:44 “nor outcry nor pain be anymore.
00:36:49 The former things have passed away.”
00:37:18 “At that time the eyes
00:37:21 “of the blind will be opened,
00:37:25 “and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.
00:37:34 “At that time the lame
00:37:37 “will leap like the deer,
00:37:40 “and the tongue of the speechless
00:37:43 “will shout for joy.
00:37:50 “For waters will burst forth
00:37:52 “in the wilderness,
00:37:57 and streams in the desert plain.”
00:38:07 “They will build houses and live in them,
00:38:18 and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.”
00:38:33 “For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,
00:38:38 “and the work of their hands
00:38:42 my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.”
00:38:48 “But the meek will possess the earth,
00:38:55 “and they will find exquisite delight
00:38:58 in the abundance of peace.”

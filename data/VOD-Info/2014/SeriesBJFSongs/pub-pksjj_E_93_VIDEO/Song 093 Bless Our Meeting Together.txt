00:00:11 Bless us as we meet together, Great Jehovah, we now pray.
00:00:22 For our meetings we do thank you; May your spirit with us stay.
00:00:43 Help us, Lord, refine our worship; With your Word, oh, do us fill.
00:00:54 Train our minds and tongues to witness; Love within our hearts instill.
00:01:19 So, dear Father, bless our meetings; Grant us peace and unity.
00:01:30 May our words and may our actions Magnify your Sovâ€™reignty.

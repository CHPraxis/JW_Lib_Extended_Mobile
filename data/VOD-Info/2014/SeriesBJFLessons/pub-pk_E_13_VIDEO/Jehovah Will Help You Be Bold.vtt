Hey, Sophia!
What are you reading?

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:43.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um . . .

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:45.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey!

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, give me my hat back!

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on, give it back!
It’s mine!

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel so bad for Zoe.

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her grandma died.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:07.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to tell her about Jehovah,
but I got scared!

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:10.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I was more brave.

00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:12.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can be brave.

00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you what,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s work on a little project together.

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:25.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a little girl
that I want you to meet.

00:02:30.437 --> 00:02:32.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She needed boldness too.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, she looks like me!

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s very much like you.

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s her name?

00:02:39.187 --> 00:02:43.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible doesn’t say.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s in the Bible?

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is she scared?

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:52.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s in a strange place, far from home,

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:56.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surrounded by people
who don’t worship Jehovah.

00:02:58.687 --> 00:03:01.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was taken from her family

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:05.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forced to work in the home
of a mighty warrior called Naaman.

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life as a slave was very hard,

00:03:15.354 --> 00:03:17.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for a little girl.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The warrior was

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a mighty man and fearless.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had defeated many enemies in battle.

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now he was sick.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His illness was like an enemy

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could not defeat.

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:43.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one in the land

00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:45.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew how to help him.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:58.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are <i>you</i> staring at?
Get back to work!

00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:09.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The master is so sick!

00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:12.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no hope left for him.

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of the gods have cured his illness.

00:04:15.312 --> 00:04:16.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can!

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you say?

00:04:18.354 --> 00:04:19.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I said, ”Jehovah.”

00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:21.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never say that name here!

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:23.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you know where you are?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t worship your “God of Israel”!

00:04:25.854 --> 00:04:28.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are our gods!

00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:36.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But-but I was just saying that . . .

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:39.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must learn to keep silent!

00:04:58.145 --> 00:04:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daddy, Daddy!

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:05:02.062 --> 00:05:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-Uh.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your father is sick!

00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:10.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, please, I want to stay!

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:12.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mommy, please!

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry. No!

00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:21.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, my dear.

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:25.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Master, I know what can help.

00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:26.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never say that name here!

00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:32.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must learn to keep silent!

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, can I get you some more food?

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine.

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I’m scared.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss my mom and dad.

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom told me
I could always call on you for help,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nobody here wants me to talk about you.

00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:12.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I know you can help Naaman!

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please make him better
so that he can play with his kids.

00:06:17.854 --> 00:06:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please help me to be brave

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I can tell him about you.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never say that name here!

00:06:42.562 --> 00:06:45.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must learn to keep silent!

00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know who could help your husband.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, the God of Israel, <i>my</i> God!

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His prophet can heal your husband!

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:02.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He <i>must</i> go to him!

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Milady!

00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:44.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Milady!

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:48.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:07:48.312 --> 00:07:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The master has returned!

00:08:06.145 --> 00:08:07.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are healed!

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:08.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daddy, Daddy!

00:08:09.062 --> 00:08:10.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, my love!

00:08:10.562 --> 00:08:11.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I hug you, Daddy?

00:08:11.854 --> 00:08:15.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, come here!
Come here, my son!

00:08:15.812 --> 00:08:18.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm, Daddy, I missed you so much!

00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:29.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I know
that there is no other God anywhere,

00:08:29.062 --> 00:08:31.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only Jehovah.

00:08:33.854 --> 00:08:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, little one.

00:08:35.145 --> 00:08:37.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for telling me about him.

00:08:51.104 --> 00:08:54.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t know what was going to happen
after she spoke up,

00:08:54.229 --> 00:08:57.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she knew no matter what happened

00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:01.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah would be with her.

00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah will be with you too, Sophia!

00:09:04.395 --> 00:09:07.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never be as brave as her.

00:09:07.437 --> 00:09:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course you will, Sophia!

00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:12.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just need a little practice,

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you will be bold too!

00:09:16.312 --> 00:09:17.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what we’re doing tonight?

00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:19.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Family worship?

00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:20.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right!

00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:23.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe tonight we can make
a pretend classroom

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the kitchen.

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can be Zoe,

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:33.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Dad and Caleb can be the other kids.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can practice being bold with us,

00:09:43.354 --> 00:09:45.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then tomorrow

00:09:45.354 --> 00:09:48.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be all set for Zoe.

00:09:58.187 --> 00:10:01.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that I couldn’t be brave,

00:10:01.229 --> 00:10:04.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I learned from the little Hebrew girl.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was just like me,

00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah helped her to be brave.

00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:12.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry about your grandma.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is for you.

00:10:13.895 --> 00:10:16.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will help you feel better.

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:20.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:10:23.437 --> 00:10:24.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye.

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:37.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Timmy, do you want to see
what I was reading on the bus?

00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:39.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure!

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This book teaches us about Jehovah.

00:10:41.145 --> 00:10:42.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah?

00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:44.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!
That’s God’s name.

00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us about a happy future
for the earth,

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plus there’s a bunch of pictures in here

00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:50.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help you learn about him.

00:10:50.395 --> 00:10:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, pretty cool!

00:10:51.854 --> 00:10:52.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you!

00:10:52.895 --> 00:10:54.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye!

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:56.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to tell people
at school about Jehovah.

00:10:58.187 --> 00:11:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m ever afraid,

00:11:01.062 --> 00:11:03.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know he’ll help me

00:11:03.104 --> 00:11:05.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is my Friend.

00:00:02 Hey, Caleb, do you remember our trip to Bethel?
00:00:05 We got to go to Bethel, and I’m really, really glad.
00:00:10 We all said it was the best time that our fam’ly ever had.
00:00:15 The people there at Bethel serve Jehovah ev’ry day,
00:00:20 Working hard in serving others, ‘cause that’s just the Bethel way.
00:00:26 Bethel means the “House of God.”
00:00:31 We call it Bethel because this place is his.
00:00:36 Bethel —It’s the “House of God.”
00:00:41 To serve Jehovah is the best work that there is.
00:00:49 We saw the things they make there —books and Bibles by the ton,
00:00:54 So the truth about God’s Kingdom can go out to ev’ryone.
00:01:00 If you can visit Bethel, you’ll be glad you got to go.
00:01:05 It’s Jehovah’s house of service, and you’ll see it’s really so.
00:01:11 Bethel means the “House of God.”
00:01:15 We call it Bethel because this place is his.
00:01:22 Bethel —It’s the “House of God.”
00:01:25 To serve Jehovah is the best work that there is.
00:01:31 To serve Jehovah is the best work that there is.
00:01:36 I want to go to Bethel when I grow up!

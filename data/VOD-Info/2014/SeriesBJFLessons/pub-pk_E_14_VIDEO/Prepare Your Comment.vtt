Me too!

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK!

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:13.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you want to say?

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I don’t know, Dad.

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you could just say
anything that comes to mind.

00:00:18.812 --> 00:00:21.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you can prepare!

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you prefer?

00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:25.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one . . .

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:25.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yuck!

00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:28.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . or that one?

00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:30.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like that!

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:33.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mother loves you,

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:37.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so she puts the work
into making you something delicious!

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same with you!

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you love Jehovah,

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:44.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you want to give him the best!

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is why you must prepare your comment.

00:00:47.437 --> 00:00:48.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how?

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, you must use the good ingredients.

00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:54.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s prepare a short comment.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 1: What is the question?

00:00:57.562 --> 00:01:01.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 2: Find the answer in the paragraph.

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:05.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 3: Make some notes.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 4: Practice.

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:10.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you are prepared!

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Sophia, you can comment
in your own words.

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:17.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if they don’t call on me, Dad?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will prepare
two or three answers, just in case.

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:23.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if he doesn’t call on me for any of them?
Ah!

00:01:26.104 --> 00:01:29.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quit!

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!
Don’t quit!

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone knows you tried your best

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:36.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you, the brothers, and Jehovah!

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:40.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, something smells good!

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready for dinner?

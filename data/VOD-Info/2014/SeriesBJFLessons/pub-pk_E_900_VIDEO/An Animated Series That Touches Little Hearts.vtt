2012 was the best year of my life!

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:12.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when
the “Become Jehovah’s Friend” series began.

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This series helps us all learn about Jehovah.

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:27.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe you wonder, ‘How does it get made?’

00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:30.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a little field trip and find out.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all starts with the Governing Body.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go, Caleb.

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:36.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks!

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They carefully choose
what lessons they want to teach us.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, they give those ideas
to the animation team at Bethel.

00:00:44.937 --> 00:00:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They talk about it;

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:48.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then they make a story!

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s ready to record!

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caaaaaleb!
Time for dinner!

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:59.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that,
the artists make the story into pictures.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:05.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They draw houses and chairs,
airplanes and bikes,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 3-D people!

00:01:10.062 --> 00:01:12.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The team puts the pictures
together to make a movie.

00:01:12.604 --> 00:01:15.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow! Nice drawings!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens next?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever made stuff with clay?

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what the modelers do,
except on the computer.

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something is missing,

00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:29.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oh, yeah, color!

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s better.

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:35.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they write a story,

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:39.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
record voices,
and design the characters.

00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what comes next?

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey! What’s going on?

00:01:43.312 --> 00:01:45.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, do you need help?

00:01:45.354 --> 00:01:47.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Urrr.
I can’t move.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s because you need a rig.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:50.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A rig?

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
3-D characters need bones and muscles,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like people.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These bones along with hundreds of controls

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:00.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are called a rig.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa! Whoa!

00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:04.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you please stop doing that?

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to test out that rig?

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you all better?

00:02:13.145 --> 00:02:14.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am!

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s animation time!

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animators make 3-D people come to life!

00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, they study people.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:26.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, they can make
3-D people do the same thing.

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:31.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, what happened?

00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It looks like we’re missing something.

00:02:33.187 --> 00:02:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need lights.

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:37.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way everyone can see us.

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:39.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can someone please turn on the lights?

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks!

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s much better.

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see all these pieces flying around?

00:02:49.812 --> 00:02:52.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody has to put them together.

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:54.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s pretty cool!

00:02:57.354 --> 00:02:59.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey! Why is it so quiet?

00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:01.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to make the sound effects!

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:03.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they get to play with toys.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then they write music.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:13.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That includes new songs, like “Pray Anytime.”

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at all these kids!

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kids around the world
record songs in over 100 languages.

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:30.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey! Why do we sound so funny?

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we say needs to be changed

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:34.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into other languages

00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:36.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that kids all over the world

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:37.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can understand us.

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even translate us into sign language.

00:03:44.354 --> 00:03:46.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves children.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This series teaches them
more than what is right and wrong.

00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:00.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It teaches them that Jehovah is real.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it helps them to become His friend.

00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:19.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah, for the videos.

00:04:19.687 --> 00:04:21.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah!

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah, for Caleb.

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:31.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be Jehovah’s friend too,
just like them.

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:33.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you?

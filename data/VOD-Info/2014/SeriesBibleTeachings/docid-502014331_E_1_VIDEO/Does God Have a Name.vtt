00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does God have a name?

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible mentions the names of many gods.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.578 line:10% position:50% align:center
The nations surrounding ancient Israel

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.997 line:10% position:50% align:center
worshipped deities named Ashtoreth,

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.999 line:10% position:50% align:center
Baal, and Molech.

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.751 line:10% position:50% align:center
The first-century Christians lived

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:24.253 line:10% position:50% align:center
among people who worshipped

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
such deities as Artemis,

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hermes, and Zeus,

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the names of those gods

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
are recorded in the Bible.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible acknowledges
that there are “many ‘gods.’”

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the name of one God appears
in ancient manuscripts of the Bible

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
far more times than the names
of all the other gods combined.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you read modern Bibles,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will still find the names
of the other gods.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.452 line:10% position:50% align:center
However, many Bibles have removed the name

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.662 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the most frequently mentioned God.

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name of that God appears some 7,000 times

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the oldest versions of the Bible.

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is the God whose name
has been removed from the Bible?

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first part of the Bible,

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
often called the Old Testament,

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:19.725 line:10% position:50% align:center
was written in Hebrew

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:22.227 line:10% position:50% align:center
and a related language, Aramaic.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Hebrew, God’s name
is represented by four letters.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrew is read from right to left.

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
In English, those four letters

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
are rendered by the consonants YHWH.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original vowel sounds

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
used in God’s name are unknown,

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the four letters representing God’s name

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:47.711 line:10% position:50% align:center
appeared throughout

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.755 line:10% position:50% align:center
ancient Bible manuscripts

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:51.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have been inscribed

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many other locations.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
In English,
a popular rendering of God’s name

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Jehovah;

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
another rendering is “Yahweh.”

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some Bibles use one
of these forms of God’s name

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 83:18

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
and in several other places.

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:15.489 line:10% position:50% align:center
A number of other translations,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures,</i>

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
restore God’s name to the locations
in which it originally appeared.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since God had his personal name

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
included in the Bible some 7,000 times,

00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:35.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
he no doubt wants us
to know and to use that name.

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Law God gave to Israel,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told Moses to write:

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:43.767 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Listen, O Israel:

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:47.438 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.”

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus quoted that passage from the Law,

00:02:51.608 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he obviously knew

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and used God’s personal name.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one of his final prayers before his death,

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:01.118 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to Jehovah God:

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:04.288 line:10% position:50% align:center
“I have made your name known.”

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
A man can have many titles:

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:10.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
husband,

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
father,

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
architect,

00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a personal name, such as John.

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same way,

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:24.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has many appropriate titles:

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almighty,

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Creator,

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Lord.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also has a unique name,

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
one not shared by any other god.

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
That name is Jehovah.

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:43.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may wonder:

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What is God like?

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does God care about you?

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:51.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you know God personally?’

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:57.800 line:90% position:50% align:center

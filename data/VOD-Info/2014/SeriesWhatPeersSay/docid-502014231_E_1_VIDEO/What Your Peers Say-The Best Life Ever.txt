00:00:04 When we’re growing up,
00:00:06 we all have to make decisions.
00:00:09 We all have to choose which path we will take.
00:00:23 My parents raised me as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:28 Our ministry —teaching others about the Bible—
00:00:31 has always been an important part of my life.
00:00:34 When I was a teenager, I wanted to expand my ministry
00:00:38 —to take it to the next level.
00:00:41 There are friends in my local congregation
00:00:43 who had gone to foreign countries and helped teach people the Bible.
00:00:47 Reading experiences from the Yearbook motivated me
00:00:50 that that was a goal that I wanted to set for myself.
00:00:53 After a few years of careful planning and saving,
00:00:57 I was finally able to travel to Malawi.
00:01:05 The people there had such a high respect for the Bible.
00:01:08 You could talk to someone walking down the street
00:01:11 or living in a small house, or even a mansion.
00:01:14 And all were interested in what the Bible had to say.
00:01:20 This one time in Malawi, one of the workers invited us in.
00:01:25 Then the head of the house
00:01:27 invited all the workers and family members,
00:01:30 came into the living room, sat down, and he said,
00:01:33 “OK, what would you like to tell us from the Bible?”
00:01:36 And I’m just sitting there like, “Wow! This is incredible.”
00:01:43 It was so encouraging
00:01:45 to be able to share Bible truths.
00:01:51 Some days you’d be out for 12 hours,
00:01:54 riding home on the bus, dust coming in the windows,
00:01:58 sharing a seat with four people,
00:02:00 even sometimes a chicken would be on your lap.
00:02:04 You’d get off the bus, and you’d have to walk two miles home,
00:02:06 and you’re just exhausted,
00:02:08 but you couldn’t help but have a grin on your face because you felt
00:02:11 like you accomplished something that day
00:02:13 and that you were doing the best work you could possibly do.
00:02:21 It wasn’t easy leaving home, learning a new language,
00:02:24 or even a new culture.
00:02:28 But because of those experiences,
00:02:30 it taught me to rely more on Jehovah.
00:02:37 Sometimes when we’re younger,
00:02:39 we kind of get really involved in whatever environment we’re in.
00:02:49 When you step outside of that box and you experience something
00:02:53 that you’ve never handled before,
00:02:55 it helps you to grow as a person
00:02:57 and serve Jehovah in ways you never thought were possible.
00:03:11 My name is Cameron.
00:03:12 I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:14 And I have the best life ever.

00:00:02 The Bible is the world’s most popular book.
00:00:08 You may already have a copy in your home.
00:00:11 Its wisdom can help you and your family
00:00:14 to enjoy life now
00:00:16 and gain a real hope for the future.
00:00:20 Jehovah’s Witnesses offer a home Bible study program
00:00:23 that is designed to help you get the most out of your own Bible.
00:00:28 You will not be taught religious traditions
00:00:31 —only what the Bible teaches.
00:00:36 The Bible study is free,
00:00:38 and there is no charge for the Bible
00:00:40 or Bible study publication you will use.
00:00:46 You choose when, where,
00:00:49 and how often you would like to study.
00:00:52 You will consider Bible subjects by topic.
00:00:56 A study session may be as short as ten minutes
00:00:59 or up to an hour or more.
00:01:03 Regardless of where or when you choose to study,
00:01:06 you are not obligated to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:10 There are no tests or exams.
00:01:13 And you can learn at your own pace.
00:01:17 The lessons include illustrations and videos
00:01:20 that make learning easier and more enjoyable.
00:01:24 You’ll have the opportunity to read
00:01:26 and research the material before you discuss it with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:31 Study sessions can be held at your home,
00:01:35 over the phone,
00:01:39 or via videoconferencing.
00:01:44 You’ll learn how to apply the Bible’s wisdom
00:01:47 so that you can enjoy life to the full.
00:01:53 To request a Bible study,
00:01:55 speak to one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

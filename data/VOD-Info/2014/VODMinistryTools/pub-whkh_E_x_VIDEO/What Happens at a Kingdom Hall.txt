00:03 All around the world,
00:05 people come together  every week at places
00:08 of worship called Kingdom Halls.
00:14 Have you ever wondered what happens
00:16 inside a Kingdom Hall  of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:20 It’s a place where Bible study programs
00:23 and lectures are held each week.
00:27 The first time I attended a meeting,
00:30 I felt very happy.
00:32 The atmosphere was so good;
00:33 I’ve never seen  anything like it anywhere else.
00:38 The people are loving, orderly,
00:41 and show an interest in people.
00:46 Every meeting is open to the public.
00:48 Seats are free and no  collections are ever taken.
00:53 Families are invited  to attend and learn together.
00:59 All meetings begin and end  with song and prayer.
01:05 One meeting,  usually held on the weekend,
01:08 includes a 30-minute  Bible discourse
01:10 especially designed  for the general public.
01:13 After that, there’s  a question-and-answer discussion
01:17 based on an article in the study edition  of the Watchtower magazine.
01:21 Participation is always voluntary.
01:23 At one of the meetings during the week,
01:26 we not only study the Bible
01:28 but also receive training  in public speaking.
01:34 Everyone is invited  to the Christian meetings,
01:38 including those who are not  Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:44 You can go into any Kingdom Hall
01:46 and receive the same program  of Bible instruction.
01:52 Bible education, upbuilding association,
01:55 and the opportunity  to praise God await you
01:59 at Christian meetings  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

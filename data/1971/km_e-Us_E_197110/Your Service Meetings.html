<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"> <strong>7 min: </strong>Introduction, text comments and appropriate Announcements.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Branch Letter and Theocratic News items.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Use Booklets or Magazine Articles to Start Studies.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">(3 min.) In addition to obtaining subscriptions, which will mean that the magazines go regularly to a home, our desire is to aid interested ones, where possible, through a Bible study. Articles in the magazines may be used to start studies. Also booklets are excellent for starting studies. In fact, thousands in the truth today first studied in the “Look!” or “Good News” booklet. Both booklets are well designed for starting studies. It would be well to include one or both of these booklets among the three booklets given to new subscribers. On the initial call or return visit, here is how the “Look!” booklet has been effectively used to start a study.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(7 min.) Publisher draws attention to the cover of the booklet, how it pictures mankind free from pressures. While householder looks at cover of booklet, from his own copy publisher reads pertinent parts of pars. 1-4, making appropriate comments, asking questions to draw householder into discussion. Thereafter householder is invited to get his copy of Bible to look up together various scriptures on bottom of page 4. After discussing some scriptures, arrangements are made to return and continue discussion of Bible with use of booklet.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Publishers may be reminded of the suggestion to start studies using “Good News” booklet, as found in February 1971 “Kingdom Ministry” under “Presenting the Good News.” (Study can be transferred to “Truth” book whenever appropriate.) Practice sessions at home or with other publishers have helped many to prepare and to have confidence to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If time permits, have some encouraging local experiences dealing with starting studies or sharing in Bible study work.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Theme: Know Jehovah</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">“I am glad to find you at home. I am calling to talk briefly with persons who are concerned about the conditions in the world. Conditions are not good, are they? [Briefly cite an example.] What do you believe the difficulty is? [Let householder comment.] One of the basic problems is that there is so much hatred. People lack love; they so often think only of themselves, isn’t that so? The Bible explains why this situation exists. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>.] Do people really know God? When getting acquainted with someone, one of the first things you learn is his name. But do people know who God is? Even most church members never use his name. But notice what it says here in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>. [Read it.] So, what is God’s name? [Allow for comment.] Notice that it is important to know, not only his name, but also that he is the Most High. That means that his purpose cannot fail. He has promised to destroy the wicked and to make this earth a Paradise for those who love him and their fellowman. Would you like to live then? [Allow for comment.] If so, now is the time to get to know Jehovah and how his purpose affects you. That is why we are offering this new book ‘“The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”​—How?’ It discusses the entire Bible book of Ezekiel and what it means to us. The book is yours, with this booklet, for 50 cents.”</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">If the householder interrupts after your introduction and says that he is too busy or is not interested, you might say: “Well, at least I would like you to know that I am offering to everyone this fascinating new book “‘The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”​—How?’ I would like to leave you a copy for just 50 cents.”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Concluding remarks. Comment on new series of talks to be given covering the new book, as outlined in the insert with this “Kingdom Ministry.” Song 59.</p>

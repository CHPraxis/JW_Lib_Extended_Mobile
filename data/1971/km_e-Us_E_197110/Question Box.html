<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What should those sharing in the vacation pioneer service have in mind in requesting pioneer rates on literature?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The arrangement the Society has made to have a special low literature rate for pioneers is for the purpose of helping them to defray their expenses so that they can continue in the pioneer service. Vacation pioneers may also obtain literature at pioneer rates for literature they place with the public only during the dates shown on their appointment letter.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is not proper for vacation pioneer to obtain literature at pioneer rates for other members of the family who are not pioneering, to stock up literature to be used later on as a congregation publisher, or to obtain expensive items such as the “Aid” book, deluxe Bibles, etc., for personal use or for one’s theocratic library.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ours is not a paid ministry nor one in which we seek advantage for ourselves, so a vacation pioneer desiring to obtain items for personal use would pay the congregation publisher price for it, having in mind that by so doing he is further sharing in the advancement of the Kingdom work.</p>

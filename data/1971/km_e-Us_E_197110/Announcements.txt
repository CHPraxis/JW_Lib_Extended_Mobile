◆ We wish to take this opportunity to thank the more than 825 brothers who wrote the Society by September 15 volunteering to serve at Bethel for one year. One hundred brothers have now been invited to come in during the month of October. If some who were not invited to come on a temporary basis wish to apply for Bethel in the regular way for four or more years of service, they may request an application from the President’s Office or obtain one from their circuit servant.
◆ Literature offer for October: Awake! subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50. (Publishers will remit to accounts servant $1.40; pioneers, 75 cents.) November: “The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”​—How? with a booklet, for 50 cents. If supplies of the new book are not yet available, offer the Truth book for 25 cents. December: New World Translation and Word of God book for $1.25. If the householder already has the New World Translation, then offer the new book “The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”​—How?, with a booklet, for 50 cents.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Fellow Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The United States branch report for the past service year has just been compiled, and what a glorious year it has been in making known Jehovah’s name and fame! We are happy to have this opportunity to share with you some of the highlights. It is a most excellent report. Of course, you’ll want to read all the details when they are published in the forthcoming <em>Yearbook.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We all have a certain feeling of satisfaction when new peaks are reached, do we not? Well, this year’s report shows peaks in publishers, back-calls, Bible studies, hours, magazines and subscriptions. Just think of it, on the average there were 402,893 publishers! This is 31,332 more than last year. April’s peak was 416,789.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To us who have been serving Jehovah for many years this average of 402,893 publishers, just for the United States, is very impressive. We can recall that only twenty years ago there were not even that many publishers of the good news in the whole world!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">All of us worked hard, too, getting 1,587,819 new subscriptions making 35,659,580 back-calls, and averaging 310,449 home Bible studies. Results? Well, if we consider the number baptized as tangible results, then all previous records were shattered with 40,336 being immersed in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This growth in publishers means that more are attending at our Kingdom Halls. So it was necessary to form 242 new congregations. Now there are 5,676 congregations in the 48 states.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">There is something else these figures show that gives us reasons to rejoice. They reflect our growth in spirituality and appreciation. They show that we really count it a privilege to serve Jehovah, and to show loving concern for our fellowman.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There were also some new peaks in both regular and vacation pioneers. 89,660 vacation pioneer appointments were made during the year, a figure that is up from last year’s 78,857 by 10,803. This, too, we can say reflects spiritual growth on the part of many in the organization.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Other figures in the annual report that make us happy include the coverage of unassigned or isolated territory. Whereas in 1950 there were 1,535 such territories, many of which were seldom worked, these have now been reduced to 359. Most gratifying too is the fact that all of these territories were assigned to be worked this past summer.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Yes, the country as a whole received a mighty witness. Can you imagine what a mountain of literature was distributed? Besides tens of millions of handbills and tracts, we placed 101,544,327 books, booklets, Bibles and magazines. Why, that is one or more Bible study helps for every household in the whole country!</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">All in all, it was a tremendous service year and we are looking forward to many new peaks in the months ahead. The potential is there, for although there was a peak of 416,789 publishers, the total attendance during a six-month period at circuit assembly public meetings was 619,904​—a difference of more than 200,000.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In the short remaining time let us, with Jehovah’s help and blessing, continue aiding these persons also to know the God who deserves their worship.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

Helping the Office with Subscriptions
During subscription campaigns the subscription office receives over 10,000 new subscriptions daily. What can the publishers do to help the office process these subscriptions? PRINT all information when filling out subscription slips. What can the accounts servant do to help? He can verify that local zip codes are correct.
In cities with more than one zip code a postal directory can be obtained from your local post office. You may request to be placed on their mailing list so that each time a revised directory is published you will receive a copy. In other cities and towns with only one zip code a list of zip codes in your area may be obtained by contacting your local post office. Accounts servants can use this information to check the zip codes, and if they are correct CIRCLE THE ZIP CODE on the subscription slip IN RED. Publishers should not do this but only accounts servants after checking the zip code for accuracy.
We look forward to another successful subscription campaign in October. Following the above suggestions will help the office to give you the best possible service in processing subscriptions.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>13 min: </strong>Our Conduct Reflects on God’s Name. (Discussion group of several servants and parents) We know Jehovah’s witnesses are all “letters” being observed by all men. They view all Jehovah’s witnesses according to the conduct of those they happen to observe. Thus God’s name is exalted or reproached by what we do. New ones at meetings or assemblies judge us by our courtesy, consideration, orderliness. How are we doing in our congregation meetings? It is good to be there at start, if possible, and beneficial and respectful to stay through closing song and prayer. God has high regard for spiritual food he has arranged for us at meetings, and his “eyes” are upon us for good. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:12</a>) Disorderliness, restlessness, moving about and talking during meetings reflect thoughtlessness, may even be manifestations of disrespect. To help children have proper respect and viewpoint, parents should sit with them at meetings. Basically, proper training begins at home. Only way children will develop respect and realize way God views them is by being trained in proper conduct and deep respect for family and home. This every parent should do, for “a boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:15-20:29:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 29:15</a>) Jehovah’s people certainly want their children, rather, to bring honor to parents, thus honor to God. (Some points may be made as to recent district assembly, with ways we can make conduct even more respectful between now and coming circuit and district assemblies.)</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>14 min: </strong>Do You Have a Training Program Specially Designed for Your Children? (Discussion between several servants and parents) Depending upon the ages of the children in the family, parents need to use discernment in ‘bringing up their children in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>) Nevertheless, basic things are needed in any program, regardless of age. Discuss four basic ways education is imparted, as outlined under “Education” in “Aid to Bible Understanding,” page 487. Discuss how parental training in Israel provides parallels for today’s parents. See page 312 of “Aid,” paragraph six. Stress need to have regular study of the Bible with children at home, specially adapted to their needs. Use all provisions of Jehovah’s organization to give assistance.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>13 min: </strong>Parents Help Children Starting School. (Demonstration)</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">(3 min.) Chairman: September is month most children start back to school. Often there will be new teachers, new classrooms, new situations to cope with in getting started back to school. Parents may find it advisable to accompany their children or arrange to speak with the teacher or principal at an early opportunity. Arrangements can be made to have children excused from participation in flag salute, holiday programs, etc.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">(8 min.) Father goes with young son and daughter to see principal of school. Makes known that family are Jehovah’s witnesses. While children want to cooperate fully in school program of education, certain exercises may conflict with religious beliefs. Discusses flag salute, singing patriotic songs, holiday programs. Children share in discussion appropriately too, giving evidence of good training and conviction on these matters. Principal asks few questions to get clarification on certain matters. Father gives brief witness and places copies of “Evolution” and “Word of God” books with principal.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman: Point out benefits of helping children in this way to get off to good start in school. Coaching them in advance on how to handle these delicate problems at school will help them to face issues courageously and be obedient as well as respectful servants of Jehovah. Even if school has already started, parents can still do this.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Presenting Subscriptions for “Awake!” in October. The special issue of “Awake!” will feature the subject “Relief from Today’s Pressures​—How?” There are so many pressures bearing down on people today, and thus it will not be difficult to get a conversation going about this common problem. All should be interested in finding relief, both now and in the future when God’s kingdom will fully remove the causes of these pressures. With this in mind, you may find the presentation used during the “Watchtower” campaign earlier this year to be effective. The theme of this was “The Government That Will Solve Man’s Problems.” (For a full review, see 12/70 “Kingdom Ministry,” page 2.)</p>

Make your presentation simple, yet meaningful and adaptable to the person with whom you are talking. It will be easy to tie in your presentation with the special “Awake!” and the offer of the year’s subscription for $1.50.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>“Perfection​—What Does it Really Mean?” (“Watchtower,” August 15, 1971) Audience discussion, using questions below. (Balance it out so that all parts receive the necessary coverage. Watch timing.) (a) What question often arises with regard to Adam and Eve as being perfect, yet sinning? (b) If, say, a shirt or a suit wore out after a reasonable length of time, would that mean it was imperfect? (c) What is the definition of “perfect,” and who sets the standards as to what is perfect, in the case of shirt? (d) What, then, does the word “perfection” mean? (e) Who is the final judge of what is perfect, as to mankind and the earth, and why? (f) Would it have been necessary for the first human pair to be incapable of sinning in order to be perfect? Why not? (g) Someone may say, ‘If Adam and Eve had been perfect, then they should have chosen only the right way. They should not have been able to choose the bad.’ What answer could be given? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15</a>) (h) Will humans when perfect be able to perform any skillful work without learning and practicing it? (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 2:52</a>) (i) Will perfection eliminate all problems and the challenge of living? (j) What will perfection remove that troubles mankind today? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 21:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:25-46:15:26" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:25, 26</a>)</p>

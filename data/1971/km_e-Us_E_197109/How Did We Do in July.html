<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We had the joy of seeing 10,918 new brothers and sisters baptized in the United States during July. The total thus far this year is 40,091​—nearly 10 percent of our total publishers. How fine to see that so many taking up the field service appreciate the importance of their personal relationship with Jehovah! And the end is not yet, for 289,318 Bible studies were being conducted with others who also show a desire to enjoy Jehovah’s approval.</p>

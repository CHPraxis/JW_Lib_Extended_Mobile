Largest Vocabulary
Over the centuries the English language has incorporated many words of other languages. Just a few of thousands of such examples are: piano from Italian, fiesta from Spanish, vodka from Russian, sauerkraut from German, tomahawk from American Indian, igloo from Eskimo, blue from French. Thus, today English has the largest and most varied vocabulary of all languages, about 600,000 words. Most persons use only a small fraction in everyday speech.

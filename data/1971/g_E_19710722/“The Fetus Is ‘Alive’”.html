<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Dr. Michael J. Halberstam, a physician in Washington, D.C., wrote an article on abortion in the medical journal <em>Ob.Gyn.News </em>of May 15, 1970. Among the things he discussed, the following is especially worthy of consideration: “Medicine basically is the business of life. The physician is enjoined to protect and preserve life. I am talking now of <em>biological </em>life . . . the life that has to do with the welfare, say, of the mother, a family or of society as a whole.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The physician is taught to make no distinction as to the stage or quality of the life he is to protect.” Then Dr. Halberstam mentioned that “the fetus [unborn child] receives its entire genetic potential of RNA and DNA at conception. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The fetus is also unique. Its exact combination of proteins has never existed before, will never exist again.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“There is no doubt that the fetus is ‘alive,’ though in a special way. As I do not believe in the immortal soul, I do not equate the life of the fetus with the life of the mother, but as a physician I know that it lives and as a human being I am in awe of it.” And Jehovah God’s law to Israel showed that he regarded the fetus or the developing child as alive and so it was respected as a life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:22-2:21:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 21:22, 23</a>.</p>

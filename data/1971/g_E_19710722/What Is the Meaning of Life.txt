What Is the Meaning of Life?
Many are the questions about the meaning of life, such as: What is the origin of life? Why do we grow old and die? What hope is there for the dead? How can you cope with present problems regarding family relations, employment and the high cost of living? Where is this world headed?
You can locate the answers to these and many other questions by using the “Watch Tower Publications Index 1966-1970.” This index will direct you to answers in the Watch Tower publications. For example, it will direct you to any subject discussed in the “Awake!” and “Watchtower” magazines for the past five years. It also has over 130,000 references to choice explanations of Bible texts and where you can find them in Watch Tower publications. Order your copy today. It will be sent for $1.

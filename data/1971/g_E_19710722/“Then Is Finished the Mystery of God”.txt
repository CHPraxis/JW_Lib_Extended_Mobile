“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God”
“I saw a wild beast ascending out of the sea.”​—Rev. 13:1.
Do you know the significance of this grotesque beast of Bible prophecy?
How can its heads be linked with outstanding political powers?
What does the number 666 mean?
You can find the answers to these questions in the Bible study aids “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” and “‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules!” These fascinating books can help you to understand the highly symbolic Bible book of Revelation. Between the two of them the entire book of Revelation is discussed verse by verse. You will find them to be valuable additions to your personal library. Request both books (totaling 1,088 pages) and send only $1.25.

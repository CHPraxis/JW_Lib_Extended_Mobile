<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">●  You might find traveling through the countryside by bus in the Kingdom of Lesotho, an enclave kingdom in the Republic of South Africa, most startling. Buses there have a loudspeaker mounted on the rooftop. The loudspeaker is attached to a microphone inside the bus. Any musically minded passenger or group can sing or play instruments over it as they please. It is said that at times the results can be quite hilarious. But the music-loving Lesotho people think that such music is much better than spending the journey in stuffy silence. Thus travelers in the bus and others along the road are treated to quite an experience by the ‘musical’ buses of Lesotho.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Over the centuries the English language has incorporated many words of other languages. Just a few of thousands of such examples are: <em>piano </em>from Italian, <em>fiesta </em>from Spanish, <em>vodka </em>from Russian, <em>sauerkraut </em>from German, <em>tomahawk </em>from American Indian, <em>igloo </em>from Eskimo, <em>blue </em>from French. Thus, today English has the largest and most varied vocabulary of all languages, about 600,000 words. Most persons use only a small fraction in everyday speech.</p>

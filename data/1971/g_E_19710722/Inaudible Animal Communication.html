<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ Did you know that certain animals communicate with one another with sounds that man cannot hear? The book <em>The Mating Instinct </em>by L. J. and M. J. Milne explains why this is so: “Man’s own hearing extends over a range of pitches from 16 to about 15,000 cycles per second​—some ten octaves—​a spread wherein his own and his mate’s voice may span four octaves if he is a basso profundo and she is high soprano. But sound continues well beyond 15,000 cycles. . . . Man is growing to realize that the usual stillness of the forest at night conceals​—through his own limitations in hearing—​a vast array of squeaky whispers that permit communication between smaller animals.”</p>

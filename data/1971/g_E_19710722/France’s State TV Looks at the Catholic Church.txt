France’s State TV Looks at the Catholic Church
By “Awake!” correspondent in France
“SHOCKED!” “Grieved!” “Confused!” “Cut to the quick!” “I almost cried with shame!”
Rarely had the French television network, run by a state monopoly, raised such a general outcry and aroused such passion among Roman Catholics in France.
The above exclamations, gleaned from the French press, were brought forth by a series of television programs entitled “The Church, Tomorrow?” They were broadcast by the nationwide First Network as a part of its regular program called “Twentieth Century.”
This series, in four parts, ran monthly from December 1970 to March 1971. It was followed by a large audience of televiewers throughout France, and also by many French-speaking people in Belgium and Switzerland.
The opening program was shown on Tuesday evening, December 8, 1970. It dealt with the present condition and the prospects of the Catholic Church in several European countries. However, hardly had that first program begun when it produced an unexpected surprise.
The surprise came at the very beginning when it was announced that certain parts of the program would be shown with a small white rectangle in the corner of the screen. This sign is used by the French TV for sexy and extremely violent films meant for adults only.
For adults only? What could this mean? Many Catholics were startled to learn that a television show about their church would contain things that were unfit for young eyes and ears!
However, as the programs developed it became clear why. Information presented about the moral condition of some clergy indeed proved to be a shocker. Surprising too were the presentations concerning divisions within the Church and the political activity of clergymen.
First of all, what did the programs have to say about the attitudes of some priests on questions pertaining to sexual morality?

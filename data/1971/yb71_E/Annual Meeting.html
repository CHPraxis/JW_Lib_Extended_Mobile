<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In accordance with the provisions of law and the charter of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, the annual meeting of its members was held on October 1 1970, at the Society’s registered offices, 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213. At 9:55 a.m., A. D. Schroeder, who is one of the instructors for the Kingdom Ministry School, spoke to the audience of 2,659 on the day’s text. Promptly at 10:00 a.m. the President of the Society, N. H. Knorr, called the meeting to order and asked G. M. Couch to open with prayer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The report of the Secretary and Treasurer, Grant Suiter, showed that on October 1, 1969, there were 471 members and that during the course of the year there was a drop in membership of thirteen persons, twelve by death and one by expulsion, thus leaving the membership at 458 as of October 1, 1970. Four hundred and forty-eight of these members responded either in person or by proxy to the annual meeting announcement and so there was a quorum to transact the business of the day. Two vacancies on the board of directors were occasioned by the expiration of the terms of T. J. Sullivan and Grant Suiter. Both of these brothers were nominated for reelection and they were unanimously voted in again as directors of the Watch Tower Society for a period of three years.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The question was put before the members as to whether they would want to accept an invitation from the committee of the Jehovah’s Witnesses Assembly Hall located near Buckingham, Pennsylvania, north of Philadelphia, to meet there on October 1, 1971. The motion was made to accept the invitation, and it was unanimously voted that the next annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania would be held in Buckingham, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some brothers had come from faraway places, and the President of the Society invited them to make reports on the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in their lands. G. G. Reuter of Germany was asked to speak, also H. E. Shalkoski reported on the work in Jamaica, where he is branch servant. Hong Kong was represented by the branch servant, K. N. Gannaway.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The President of the Society then spoke to all assembled on the subject “Worldwide Witnessing Versus World Conversion.” The material covered proved to be very upbuilding. Proof was presented showing that, just as in the days of the early Christians when a worldwide witness was given, so today a worldwide witness is being given. Shortly after noon the meeting was adjourned and closed with prayer.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page322" class="pageNum" data-no="322" data-before-text="322"></span>On Friday morning, October 9, 1970, all the members of the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania assembled in the Office of the President.

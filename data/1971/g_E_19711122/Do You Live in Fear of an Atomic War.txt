Do You Live in Fear of an Atomic War?
Many people do, and with good reason. The casualties from such a war could be fantastic​—in the hundreds of millions.
That people would be fearful about the future was foretold in the Bible in a prophecy about our day. But there are good reasons why you need not live in fear. These can be found in the Watchtower magazine.
During the course of a year The Watchtower presents much information from God’s inspired Word that can help you to overcome fear as to the future. Only $1.50 will bring it into your home twice a month for one year.
Please send me the Watchtower magazine for one year. I am enclosing $1.50. Also send me the three gift booklets: When God Is King over All the Earth, “This Good News of the Kingdom” and Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.

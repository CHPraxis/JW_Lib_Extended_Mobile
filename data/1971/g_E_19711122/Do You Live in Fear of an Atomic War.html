<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many people do, and with good reason. The casualties from such a war could be fantastic​—in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That people would be fearful about the future was foretold in the Bible in a prophecy about our day. But there are good reasons why you need not live in fear. These can be found in the <strong>Watchtower </strong>magazine.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">During the course of a year <strong>The Watchtower </strong>presents much information from God’s inspired Word that can help you to overcome fear as to the future. Only $1.50 will bring it into your home twice a month for one year.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send me the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine for one year. I am enclosing $1.50. Also send me the three gift booklets: <em>When God Is King over All the Earth, “This Good News of the Kingdom” </em>and <em>Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.</em></p>

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"> 1. Reportedly, from as far back as when have political rulers not liked to consider themselves as shepherds, and why so?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb">KINGS, princes, presidents and governors of the world, not excluding those of Christendom, have not considered themselves as shepherds. To this day such political rulers have not cared to assume duties like those of a shepherd. This has been true from as far back as the Pharaohs of Egypt of the eighteenth century before our Common Era (1728 B.C.E.). Concerning that land it is reported: “Every herder of sheep is a detestable thing to Egypt.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:32-1:46:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 46:32-34</a>) To worldly rulers the occupation of shepherd appears too lowly to comport with the dignity of their governmental position. It is an occupation that calls for tenderness and compassion such as worldly rulers are not disposed to display toward the masses who “must be kept under.” Also, shepherding is too peaceful an occupation for rulers who are inclined to show belligerency and militancy with the idea of keeping other rulers in their place. So they keep prepared for war.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 2. Is Jehovah too proud to liken himself to a shepherd, and to what did the psalmist David liken Jehovah, and to what did Jehovah liken Moses’ successor Joshua?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>What, though, about the very highest one in all the realm of existence, who is also the Sovereign of the Universe? Is he too proud to liken himself to a shepherd? No! So without offense an ancient king, the psalmist David, spoke of Him as a herder of sheep, saying: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:23:1-19:23:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1</a>) He acts as shepherd toward all his human creatures. Likewise, he speaks of the rulers of His people as shepherds. In the year 1473 B.C.E. he brought his chosen people <span id="page294" class="pageNum" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>into the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua the son of Nun, who belonged to the tribe of Ephraim and who had been commissioned by the prophet Moses to lead Israel, why? For the loving purpose “that Jehovah’s assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:15-4:27:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 27:15-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"> 3, 4. Like men in what occupation did the later rulers of Israel fail to act, and therefore Jehovah addressed himself to them as being what?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In later years the governmental rulers of Jehovah’s people failed to act like unselfish, compassionate Oriental shepherds to their subjects. So Jehovah declared to his prophet Ezekiel what he was determined to do about matters. Ezekiel leads up to a scathing denunciation of these “shepherds” by saying:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>“And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: ‘Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy, and you must say to them, to the shepherds, “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said.”’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:1-26:34:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu"> 5, 6. Through Jeremiah what did Jehovah say concerning the royal shepherd Coniah (Jehoiachin), what did Jehovah say that the rulers were doing to His sheep, but what would He do for them?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>This declaration against the governmental shepherds of Israel is recorded as occurring after Jerusalem’s destruction. But before her destruction the prophet Jeremiah at Jerusalem was inspired to declare something similar in connection with the second-last king on the royal throne, namely, Coniah (or Jeconiah or Jehoiachin), in these words: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Write down this man as childless, as an able-bodied man who will not have any success in his days; for from his offspring not a single one will have any success, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling anymore in Judah.’ [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:3:17-13:3:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 3:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:11-40:1:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Matthew 1:11, 12</a>] ‘Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasturage!’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>“Therefore this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said against the shepherds who are shepherding my people: ‘You yourselves have scattered my sheep; and you kept dispersing them, and you have not turned <span id="page295" class="pageNum" data-no="295" data-before-text="295"></span>your attention to them.’ ‘Here I am turning my attention upon you for the badness of your dealings,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘And I myself shall collect together the remnant of my sheep out of all the lands to which I had dispersed them, and I will bring them back to their pasture ground, and they will certainly be fruitful and become many. And I will raise up over them shepherds who will actually shepherd them; and they will be afraid no more, neither will they be struck with any terror, and none will be missing,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu"> 7. In that connection, what did Jehovah purpose to raise up to King David, and what name would Jehovah bestow on what was raised up?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>“‘Look! There are days coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I will raise up to David a righteous sprout. And a king will certainly reign and act with discretion and execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel itself will reside in security. And this is his name with which he will be called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:22:24-24:23:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 22:24 to 23:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu"> 8. As we read Jehovah’s words addressed through Ezekiel to the “shepherds of Israel,” whom should we have in mind?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Note, now, how, when giving a similar message to his prophet Ezekiel, Jehovah goes into more detail as to the misconduct of the unfaithful “shepherds of Israel.” As we read Jehovah’s words of description, we do well to think, not just of the history of the bad kings of Israel, but of their modern counterpart, the professed Christian kings, princes and governors of Christendom.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 9. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:2-26:34:6" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:2-6</a>, how did Jehovah describe the misconduct of the rulers as “shepherds of Israel,” with what result to the sheep?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: ‘Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who have become feeders of themselves! Is it not the flock that the shepherds ought to feed? The fat is what you eat, and with the wool you clothe your own selves. The plump animal is what you slaughter. The flock itself you do not feed. The sickened ones you have not strengthened, and the ailing one you have not healed, and the broken one <span id="page296" class="pageNum" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>you have not bandaged, and the dispersed one you have not brought back, and the lost one you have not sought to find, but with harshness you have had them in subjection, even with tyranny. And they were gradually scattered because of there being no shepherd, so that they became food for every wild beast of the field, and they continued to be scattered. My sheep kept straying on all the mountains and on every high hill; and on all the surface of the earth my sheep are scattered, with no one making a search and with no one seeking to find.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:2-26:34:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:2-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>THE PREY OF THE GOVERNMENTAL “SHEPHERDS”</strong></p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10. According to religious claims, whose “sheep” are the church people of Christendom, but who have been their visible governmental “shepherds”?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>By virtue of their religious claims the church people of Christendom were Jehovah’s “sheep.” The professed Christian political rulers should therefore have been very careful of how they treated the sheeplike subjects, inasmuch as these were not the property of the political rulers but the property of the God whom they professed to worship. This fact holds true not only respecting the secular authorities of Christendom but also regarding popes, cardinals and archbishops who have held or still hold political office and maintain relations with the political states of this world. For example, since 1929 the popes of Rome have ruled as the absolute sovereign of Vatican City and have maintained diplomatic relations with the political states of this world. The first president of the Republic of Cyprus has been an archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church. Despite their harsh treatment of the sheeplike people, the political rulers of Christendom have had favor and support from the religious clergy and have been the highly regarded church members of their religious systems.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. Despite their claiming to be Christian, how have the political rulers of Christendom treated the “sheep,” and what must be said about their imitating Jehovah’s Fine Shepherd?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Notwithstanding their claims to being Christian, <span id="page297" class="pageNum" data-no="297" data-before-text="297"></span>the political rulers have fattened themselves materially off these poor “sheep.” How unlike the one whom they claim to follow, namely, Jesus Christ, who said: “I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and find pasturage. The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy. I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance. I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:9-43:10:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 10:9-11</a>) Imitate this Fine Shepherd and lay down their lives for the sheep? We have not seen the political rulers of Christendom do this. Just because the religious clergy hobnob with the politicians and rank them high among their church members, let no one think that the heavenly Owner of the “sheep,” Jehovah, approves of the oppressive course of the political rulers of Christendom. To correct any wrong ideas of ours, He declares:</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. What position does the heavenly Owner of the “sheep” take toward those political shepherds, and for what stated reasons?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>“Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah, ‘“As I am alive,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, “surely for the reason that my sheep became something for plunder and my sheep continued to be food for every wild beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, and my shepherds did not search for my sheep, but the shepherds kept feeding themselves, and my own sheep they did not feed,”’ therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah. This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am against the shepherds, and I shall certainly ask back my sheep from their hand and make them cease from feeding my sheep, and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves; and I will deliver my sheep out of their mouth, and they will not become food for them.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:7-26:34:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:7-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. How have the “sheep” of Christendom been sacrificed to various causes, and been scattered and thus fallen prey to “beasts”?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>The political “shepherds” of Christendom <span id="page298" class="pageNum" data-no="298" data-before-text="298"></span>have fought among themselves, one professed Christian ruler against another so-called Christian ruler, and have sacrificed their sheeplike people on the altar of nationalism or religious sectarianism. Some political rulers that have been outstanding favorites of the religious clergy have been dictators. The Christian witnesses of Jehovah have experienced violent persecution at the hand of these dictators and extremely nationalistic, totalitarian rulers. Because of the injustices that are not corrected, many of the oppressed people have fled to various newly formed, revolutionary kinds of organizations and have fallen victim to materialistic radicalism and atheistic communism. There is neither political, national nor religious unity in Christendom. Like bewildered sheep without a shepherd, the people are scattered as prey to “beasts.”</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">14. How did Jehovah deliver his “sheep” out of the mouths of the self-feeding shepherds of ancient Israel, and how will he do a similar deliverance in the case of modern Christendom?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>In the case of ancient Israel of Ezekiel’s day, Jehovah delivered his sheep out of the mouth of the self-feeding shepherds in governmental places by having Jerusalem destroyed and the land of Judah desolated. The king and princes had to vacate their governmental office, being captured by the Babylonians and deported. Some were killed as a penalty for their rebellion. In Babylon they were put in prison or subjected to restraints, being stripped of any rulership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:18-12:25:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Kings 25:18-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:24-24:52:34" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 52:24-34</a>) In modern-day antitype, the destruction of Christendom in the approaching “great tribulation” will absolutely deprive the professed “Christian” political rulers of the religious clergy, for the latter will be put out of religious office by the executional forces of Jehovah. Christendom’s clergy will cease to exist. Any worldly politicians surviving Christendom’s annihilation will be reserved for execution in the final part of the “great tribulation,” namely, in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” at the world situation called Har–Magedon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 19:11-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">15. Thus Jehovah’s true “sheep” will be delivered from the operations of whom, and what prophetic historic guarantee do we have that He will regather his “sheep” into one fold?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span id="page299" class="pageNum" data-no="299" data-before-text="299"></span><sup>15 </sup>Thus the death-dealing removal of all the governmental overseers of the entire worldwide system of things, including the professed Christian rulers of Christendom, will free Jehovah’s true “sheep” from the oppression and self-serving operations of the political “shepherds.” No more will those unfaithful shepherds feed themselves at the expense of Jehovah’s flock of Christian’s witnesses. No matter how scattered these may find themselves because of the opposition and persecution carried on by political elements, Jehovah knows where his true “sheep” have been dispersed. Like a loving Shepherd, he will search for them and regather them into one fold. His solemn promise as made through his prophet Ezekiel stands good today. The way that he fulfilled this promise toward ancient Israel in the year 537 B.C.E. and thereafter was a prophetic guarantee that he would carry out his promise in the future. Hear, now, His words:</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">16. To that effect, what did Jehovah say in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:11-26:34:14" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:11-14</a>?</p>

<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">17. Upon whom does the larger and final fulfillment of that prophecy come, and even now before destruction of Babylon the Great, how has Jehovah shown his ability to gather his spiritual “sheep”?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>In ancient times Jehovah began the fulfillment of this prophecy in the year 537 B.C.E., by the restoration of a faithful remnant of Jewish exiles by the good offices of King Cyrus the Persian, the conqueror of Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:17-14:36:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:17-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:1-15:3:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1 to 3:6</a>) A larger and final fulfillment of this hope-inspiring prophecy takes place on spiritual Israel, “the Israel of God,” to whom the Christian apostle Paul wrote.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:25-60:2:25" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:25</a>) For them the turbulent times of World War I (of 1914-1918 C.E.) had been a “day of clouds and thick gloom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:12-26:34:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:12</a>) That day was darkened because of the religious persecution that Christendom (the dominant part of Babylon the Great) heaped on the remnant of spiritual Israel.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Babylon the Great, however, failed to maintain her oppressive hold on the true-hearted remnant of spiritual Israelites. In the spring of 1919 Babylon the Great suffered a severe fall from her position of religious power over Jehovah’s people, and the shackles of their bondage to her were broken. This was a thing that could have occurred by the power of no one else but Jehovah through his Greater Cyrus, Jesus Christ.

Thousands of persons inside and outside Christendom heard the Kingdom message as preached by Jehovah’s restored remnant and were filled with the desire to become “disciples” of His Son Jesus Christ. Upon properly understanding Jehovah’s requirements for them, they dedicated themselves to him and got baptized in symbol of their dedication, in obedience to Christ’s commandment.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

And I will save my sheep, and they will no longer become something for plunder; and I will judge between a sheep and a sheep.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:17-26:34:22" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:17-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">26. Accordingly Jehovah has cleared out whom from among his restored “sheep,” and what rule laid down by Jesus Christ has He enforced?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[80]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>In keeping with this prophetic promise Jehovah cleared out from among his restored remnant of spiritual sheep those who are greedy and self-seeking, using their brute strength and their horns of power to enjoy the best of things for themselves to the exclusion of weak or sickened other ones, even spoiling things for others that these night not thrive spiritually. Jehovah has allowed no dividing of his “sheep” into a clergy class and a laity class. As Shepherd Judge between his “sheep,” he has enforced the rule laid down through his Son Jesus Christ: “But you, do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers. Moreover, do not call anyone your [spiritual] father on earth, for one is your father, the heavenly One. Neither be called ‘leaders,’ for your <span id="page304" class="pageNum" data-no="304" data-before-text="304"></span>Leader is one, the Christ. But the greatest one among you must be your minister.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 23:8-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">27. How does Jehovah deal with those who try to mislead, and how are all his “sheep” kept spiritually healthy?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>If anyone tries to be like a horned ram or a horned he-goat and lead away Jehovah’s “sheep” after him, Jehovah sees to it that he is expelled. The spiritual food and drink must be made available to all His “sheep,” that the whole flock may be spiritually healthy.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong>THE “ONE SHEPHERD” UNDER ONE GOD</strong></p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">28. Because of His fulfilling what promise have such aggressive ones been judged according to their deserts among Jehovah’s restored “sheep”?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><sup>28 </sup>Why is it today that, among Jehovah’s restored flock of spiritual Israel, persons like aggressive horned rams and he-goats have been judged according to their deserts and been expelled from the “Israel of God”? It is because Jehovah has put a faithful undershepherd in charge of his flock. In this respect he has not failed regarding his promise in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:23-26:34:24" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>: “And I will raise up over them one shepherd, and he must feed them, even my servant David. He himself will feed them, and he himself will become their shepherd. And I myself, Jehovah, will become their God, and my servant David a chieftain in the midst of them. I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.”</p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="qu">29. As in ancient Israel, how is it that Christendom has had political rulers like “shepherd” kings?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><sup>29 </sup>In a correspondency with ancient Israel, Christendom has had men like “shepherd” kings, “shepherd” rulers, in posts of government. For these the clergy have made the claim that such political “shepherds” rule “by the grace of God.” Misguided by the clergy’s misinterpretation of the Holy Scriptures, many such rulers claimed “the divine right of kings.” For instance, King James I, the sponsor of the English Authorized Version of the Bible of 1611, was a stout contender for such “divine right of kings.” Quite to his liking, the dedication of this Authorized Version of the Bible <span id="page305" class="pageNum" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>is addressed as follows: “To the Most High and Mighty Prince James, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.”</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">30. How does the case of those who claim rule by God’s “grace” and “divine right of kings” compare with that of the “one shepherd” who rules over spiritual Israel?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><sup>30 </sup>True, God has permitted such rulers to govern, but such permission does not mean any “Grace of God” to them or impart “divine right” to them. It is not mere divine permission that allows for a certain “one shepherd” to rule over the restored remnant of spiritual Israel. Jehovah himself directly sets him up over them, for that one has the “legal right.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:27-26:21:27" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">31. Who, then, is this “one shepherd” whom Jehovah calls “my servant David,” and why are the words “David” and “shepherd” appropriate for that one?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[85]" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup>Who, then, is the “one shepherd” to whom Jehovah gives the royal governmental position because this one has the “legal right” to it? Jehovah calls him “my servant David.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:23-26:34:23" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:23</a>) This does not mean that Jehovah raises up the original King David from the dead in order to put him in this shepherdlike office. It means a natural descendant of King David, who inherited the royal right from him. Such descendant was the heavenly Son of God, who had his life transferred from heaven to the womb of the Jewish virgin, Mary of Bethlehem, in order that he might be born into the earthly royal line of David, thus to become the “son of David, son of Abraham.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:2:6" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 1:1 to 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:38" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Luke 1:26-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:4-42:3:31" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 2:4 to 3:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:1-45:1:4" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Romans 1:1-4</a>) The fact that the name David means “Beloved” comports well with the declaration that Jehovah made from heaven at the time that Jesus was baptized in water and at the time of his being transfigured on a high mountain: “This is my Son, the beloved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:13-40:3:17" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 3:13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:5" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 17:1-5</a>) Jesus likened all mankind to sheep when he said: “I am the fine shepherd, . . . and I surrender my soul in behalf of the sheep.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 10:14, 15</a>.</p>

Hence the Christian apostle Paul, when writing to the Christianized Hebrews, speaks of Jehovah as “the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an everlasting covenant, our Lord Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:20-58:13:20" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:20</a>) Resurrected back to spirit life such as he originally had, Jesus Christ is now a heavenly Shepherd.

<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">33. When did Jehovah raise up this “one shepherd” over the remnant of spiritual Israel, and how does he deal with the nations?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[87]" class="sb"><sup>33 </sup>When did Jehovah do so? In the year 1914 C.E., when the “appointed times of the [Gentile] nations” ended, about October 4/5 of that war-shattered year. Concerning those Gentile nations the prophecy is made concerning his kingdom that he “is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:5-66:12:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Revelation 12:5</a>) That means the breaking to pieces of all those ungodly nations as though being a potter’s vessel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:8-19:2:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 2:8, 9</a>) But the remnant of spiritual Israel he does not shepherd with such a rod or scepter.</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">34. How did the “shepherd” kings of Christendom treat the anointed remnant during World War I, and when did Jehovah’s “servant David” take over the care of them?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[88]" class="sb"><sup>34 </sup>“He himself will feed them,” says Jehovah, “and he himself will become their shepherd.

<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">35. How did he act toward the remnant of spiritual Israel like ancient Cyrus the Persian, how did he feed them and serve as their “chieftain,” and whom did they acknowledge as their God?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[89]" class="sb"><sup>35 </sup>Like the ancient Persian conqueror of Babylon, <span id="page307" class="pageNum" data-no="307" data-before-text="307"></span>respecting whom Jehovah said: “Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,’” Jesus Christ delivered the remnant of spiritual Israel from Babylon the Great and her political associates from the year 1919 onward. With spiritual food he has fed them till now. He has become their chieftain in whose footsteps they follow as sheep. His God, Jehovah, has become their God. In appreciation of this, the anointed remnant, in the year 1931, embraced the Scripturally based name, “Jehovah’s witnesses.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10-12</a>, <em>AS; NW.</em></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>“OTHER SHEEP, WHICH ARE NOT OF THIS FOLD”</strong></p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">36. After they embraced that name, to what “sheep” was the attention of the anointed remnant specially drawn, and who are those “sheep”?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" data-rel-pid="[90]" class="sb"><sup>36 </sup>Shortly after they began identifying themselves as the Christian witnesses of Jehovah, the attention of the anointed remnant was specially drawn to Jesus’ words, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>: “And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” The “other sheep” mean all the others of the world of mankind for whom the Fine Shepherd surrendered his soul or laid down his life as a ransom sacrifice.</p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="qu">37. What revelation concerning the “other sheep” was given in 1935, and for what future did Jehovah indicate that he was reserving these baptized disciples of Christ?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><sup>37 </sup>In the spring of the year 1935 it was revealed to the anointed remnant that a numberless “great crowd” of these “other sheep” was to be taken out from this system of things before the outbreak of the “great tribulation” upon Christendom. These began being baptized as “disciples” of Jesus Christ. But thereafter Jehovah revealed by his Word and dealings that He was not begetting them to a heavenly future but was reserving them for life in the coming Paradise earth along with all the rest of the “other sheep.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:9-17</a>) Nevertheless, He kept them in association with the anointed remnant that thus there might be “one flock.”</p>
<p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="qu">38, 39. So, according to Jehovah’s promise in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:25-26:34:28" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:25-28</a>, the “great crowd” enjoy what conditions with the anointed remnant?</p>

And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I break the bars of their yoke and I have delivered them out of the hand of those who had been using them as slaves.

According to Jehovah’s “covenant” for Christian peace, he has driven out and kept out all ferocious beastlike personalities dangerous to sheeplike Christians. By his holy spirit operating upon the true baptized disciples of Christ he has transformed their personalities into a peaceful, harmless sheeplikeness. They lovingly seek to protect one another spiritually as well as materially amidst this hostile world. The effect of this has been as predicted: They have come <span id="page309" class="pageNum" data-no="309" data-before-text="309"></span>to know that the God who has broken the bars of their religious yoke of bondage and delivered them from their Babylonish enslavers is the one “whose name is Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>) Little wonder, then, that they take delight in being his active, vocal witnesses.</p>

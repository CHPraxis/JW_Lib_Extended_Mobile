The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures
It is fascinating when you can discern the flavor of the original language in which the Christian Scriptures were written and to see what each expression means. This is possible because of this unique word-for-word translation of the Greek text. The left-hand column contains the original Greek text. Between the lines of the Greek text is found a word-for-word English translation. In the right-hand column appears the modern-language rendering of the New World Translation. This 1,184-page volume will be sent for $3.

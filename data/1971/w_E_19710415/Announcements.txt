DO YOU WANT THE TRUTH?
There are people who do not want the truth told to them because it disagrees with their cherished views. They prefer to believe falsehoods. Jesus Christ found this situation in the first century when he spoke God’s truth to the people of his day. Some received it gladly, but others considered him an enemy because he told them the truth. Many religious leaders in particular did not want it. To them he said: “But now you are seeking to kill me, a man that has told you the truth.” (John 8:40) Are you receptive to the truth? If so, you will want to read the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. That many people want the truth is evident by the phenomenal demand for this hard-covered book of 192 pages. Over 35 million copies have been printed in 67 languages since its release in 1968. This pocket-size book can be had for only 25 cents.

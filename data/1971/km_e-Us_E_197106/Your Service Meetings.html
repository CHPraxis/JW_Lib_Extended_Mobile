Does that mean the entire Bible is available in all those languages? What is meant by “inspiration”? To what extent did God provide details? By what means?

(“All Scripture Is Inspired . . . and Beneficial,” pp. 308, 309, 323-325) How was it originally determined which books belonged in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures?

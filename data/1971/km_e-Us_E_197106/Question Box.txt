● What can be done in field service so the rest of those in a car group do not spend their time waiting for the one making a call?
First, it would be good to adjust the size of the car group to fit the type of territory to be worked. If houses are widely scattered, having just a few publishers in the car will make it easier to keep everyone busy working. If a large number of publishers are going in service, small car groups can be organized, with each group having its own territory. This will cut down on travel in working the territory initially, and later on when back-calls and not-at-home calls are made, will it not?
When homes are far apart, the car driver can leave publishers off at the houses, and then after calling on a home himself, return to pick them up. When homes are closer together, publishers might walk to the next houses. This is making better use of service time than would waiting in the car. And besides, the walking may do us good physically.
Similar suggestions can be applied to car-group back-call work in cities. Two or three smaller car groups are usually preferable to one large group. When possible, areas can be visited where others in the group have back-calls within walking distance. Or, if no one else has back-calls in the vicinity, someone in the group may have not-at-homes nearby that can be worked. Perhaps the person who has the back-call to make can provide not-at-homes for others to do, since that one may have recently been working the territory. Yet another possibility is for others to get out of the car while the back-call is being made and talk to persons passing by. Thus each one can be helped to have a full share in talking to others about God’s kingdom.

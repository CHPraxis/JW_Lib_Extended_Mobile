Announcements
◆ Arrange for witnessing on July 5 holiday.
◆ Congregation accounts are to be audited at the beginning of June.
◆ June offer: New World Translation and Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for $1.25. Offer for July and August: “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” and a booklet for 50c. Any other 50c publication, such as Life Everlasting, ‘Impossible to Lie,’ “Let Your Name Be Sanctified,” may be offered if the congregation has them on hand.
◆ New Publications Available:
The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life​—Hindi
◆ Again Available in U.S.A.:
From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained​—Greek
◆ It will be a great help to the Society if all publishers and pioneers place their orders for literature and renew personal subscriptions through the congregation rather than ordering direct from the Society.
◆ Congregation servants: Have you ordered assembly lapel cards and badge holders yet? So that you will have your supply in sufficient time, be sure to order no later than four weeks before your district assembly begins.
◆ “Is the Truth Transforming Your Life?” is the title of the public talk that will be given by the circuit servants beginning September 5. At circuit assemblies the district servants will give the public talk “Can You Live Forever?​—Will You?”

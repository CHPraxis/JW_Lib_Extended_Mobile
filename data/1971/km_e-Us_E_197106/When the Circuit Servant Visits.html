<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Congregations are growing, and in some places the increase has been such that three or four groups meet in the same hall. So, when the circuit servant visits, it may be necessary to make adjustments in the schedule for the week. For example, if another unit has its service meeting in the hall on Tuesday evening, there is no objection to the circuit servant’s having his first meeting with the entire congregation later in the week, probably on their regular service meeting night. This will avoid disrupting the other group’s program. He should still go through the congregation records on Tuesday afternoon. And, if possible, the congregation servant or his assistant should spend some time with him on that day, to work out details that need attention in connection with the week’s visit. The day and time at which meetings are held are not vital; what is important is that the scheduled meetings be held during the week.</p>

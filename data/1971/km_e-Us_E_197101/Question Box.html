<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● How should the school servant counsel those having reading assignments when the next points for consideration on the Speech Counsel slip do not specifically apply to reading?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Whenever a student has a reading assignment from the Bible, it is suggested that the school servant select the next point or two that apply particularly in a reading assignment, skipping over those points that do not apply. The student should consult with the school servant well in advance as to what he should work on, so that both know the point(s) on which counsel will be given. If the school servant wants to notify the student of these points of counsel at the time that he gives him the assignment for the talk, he may do that. The student can then have these in mind in preparing his talk and can check “Qualified to Be Ministers” under Progressive Speech Training for suggestions as to improvement.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While there are a few points dealing with the composition of a talk that do not apply to a reading assignment, most of the points having to do with delivery will apply to a reading assignment. Since there will be a brief introduction and conclusion, counsel can be given on these when called for on the counsel slip. The points skipped over can be considered at a later time when the student receives an assignment for one of the other talks. This will still maintain a program in which, to a reasonable extent, the points on the counsel slip will be covered in the order in which they are listed.</p>

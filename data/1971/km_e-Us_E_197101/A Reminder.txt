A Reminder
When you send copies of The Watchtower or Awake! or others of the Society’s publications through the mail, do you always put your return address on the outside of the envelope? Please do.
Some items prove to be undeliverable or are refused by the addressee. If the sender’s address is not shown, the envelope will be opened by the post office and then sent to us in Brooklyn. Sometimes there is postage due; in every case the item requires handling by the office. It will help us if you always show your return address on envelopes and packages in which you send literature or letters through the mail.

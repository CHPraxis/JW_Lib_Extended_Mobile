<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DO YOU at times feel that the pressures of life are just too much? Do you long for relief from them?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">More and more people feel that way. This is especially so today because pressures seem to be building up everywhere.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A father supporting a family finds job pressures increasing. National economies seem very unstable. His family’s safety concerns him. A mother feels pressure when she sees the prices of everything continually going up and wonders how she can make ends meet.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Young people see the ‘pressure-cooker’ atmosphere of modern society and are appalled. Observing economic competition, wars, nuclear weapons, pollution, corruption and race hatreds, they ask: ‘Is life worth living at all?’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This situation prompted scientists to write: “Society has reached a stage of development where the stresses and strain produced by its own speed of technological advance are not only overtaking man’s powers of adaptability​—both physical and mental—​but are endangering his very survival.”​—New York <em>Times, </em>June 20, 1971.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How upsetting are today’s pressures? An article in the <em>Reader’s Digest </em>points out this finding of doctors: “Emotional stress can produce real illness​—true changes in the body chemistry and structure of quite normal people. . . . specialists agreed that psychogenic (emotion-caused) disorders account for perhaps two of every three visits to the doctor.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">True, not all stress is bad. Even in thinking, working and playing there is some tension involved. In this connection Vienna-born Dr. Hans Selye says: “We are stressed by joy, by a game. . . . But difficulties arise when a particular stress, either mental or physical, is applied for too long.” So while some stress is normal, too much unrelenting pressure brings irritation, frustration, anxiety and fear. That can be very damaging.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Is there any hope that the world will change so that damaging pressures will be a thing of the past? Based on man’s experience so far, you may quickly answer, NO! Yet, there is every reason to believe that in our time, <em>likely this very decade, </em>permanent relief will be realized!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">How is this possible? Well, let us see. But first, it would be good to take a closer look at the pressures assaulting people today.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What is happening to mankind is significant because it was foretold long ago in the Bible along with God’s sure remedy. With the help of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine you can learn what it all means. <em>The Watchtower </em>also provides upbuilding counsel from the Holy Scriptures to help you cope with personal problems.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Twice a month <em>The Watchtower </em>can come into your home by mail with encouraging Scriptural articles, for only $1 a year. You can subscribe for it from one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who will be offering it in their house-to-house ministry from January through April. Or, if you wish, you may write directly to the Watch Tower Society. See the addresses on the second page of this journal. With your subscription you will receive free three thirty-two-page booklets.</p>

GOOD COMPANIONS
In the field of literature as in actual life it is difficult to find good companions whose association is upbuilding and faith-strengthening. The Bible, of course, is the finest literary companion a person could have. Its wisdom is unsurpassed because of its being the Word of God. Another fine companion is the faith-strengthening 192-page book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? It upholds the Bible as God’s inspired Word, giving sound reasons for doing so. During the month of June, Jehovah’s witnesses will be encouraging people to benefit from the companionship of these two fine books, as they call at the homes of the people. A copy of the entire Bible and the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? will be offered by them for only $1.25. Ask for them. Or, if you wish, you may obtain them by writing to the publishers of this magazine.

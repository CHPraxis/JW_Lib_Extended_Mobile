Get the Bible in Greek
The above illustration from 2Â Timothy 3:1-4 shows you what The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures is like. This fine translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures has the actual Greek text that is used by Bible translators today with a word-for-word translation into English under Greek. You can thus see what the original Greek text of the Bible actually says.
In the right-hand column is the modern-language rendering of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, Matthew through Revelation.

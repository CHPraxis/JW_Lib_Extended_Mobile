Opportunities to Witness at School
THE branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Wiesbaden, Germany, recently received an encouraging letter from a young lady who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses.
She explained that fourteen days after she began to attend a certain school she asked for permission to be absent for a day in order to go to a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. “When the teacher heard that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses,” she wrote, “it was requested that I give an hour’s report about the Witnesses to another class of school that she also taught. I worked up a talk on the subject ‘How Can You Find the True Religion?’ At the conclusion of the report the teacher told the class of eighteen-year-old girls that they were free to ask any questions they wanted to. The students were very impressed and asked many questions. They accepted Bible literature and even requested literature for students who were not in the class.”
During the break between classes the teacher told a fellow teacher what had taken place. As a result the next hour the sixteen-year-old Witness was able to give the report to a second class. And on another occasion she was able to speak to this class on the subject “Who Is God?” At this time there was present a third teacher, who was the instructor of a still different class at school. The second report was given to this other class. Even after graduating from school, the young Witness was asked to return to deliver the talk again. And the teacher asked permission to make a recording of the talk to use it as a basis for future discussions.
In concluding the letter, this young Witness wrote: “My heart is full of thanks to Jehovah for these privileges that he gave me. And I am convinced that many of my brothers who still go to school will have many opportunities in this field if they look for them.”

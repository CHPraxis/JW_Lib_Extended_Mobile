<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“FOR many years I had read the Watch Tower Society’s warnings about getting involved with ESP,” writes a young woman from New York state. “But I somehow never thought those warnings applied to me. Something happened, though, that changed this.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I had always been interested in primitive peoples and their customs. Because of this, I spent considerable time reading about their superstitions, incantations, spells and so forth. I even dabbled in a little self-hypnotism. Eventually I found myself being able to predict what would come in the morning mail. I could tell what each piece would be, whom it was from and to whom it was addressed. I began to have ‘feelings’ about events that had not yet occurred.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Of course, I felt uneasy about this, because I remembered reading experiences and warnings regarding such things in the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Finally, I realized I could not serve the demons and Jehovah at the same time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:21-46:10:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:16-44:16:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 16:16-18</a>) I prayed to Jehovah, increased my personal Bible study and stopped reading books having to do with witchcraft or the supernatural. It was a struggle, as I felt oppressed, as if something was trying desperately to control my mind. Many times I was thrown into depressions. I was unable to do schoolwork without a struggle.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Yet, I knew that I could not afford to lose this battle. Once lost, I knew it could mean my life. After spiritually strengthening myself, I began to feel a lightening of these attacks of depression, but I continued to strengthen myself even more by prayer and Bible study. The words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:17-52:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a> became a part of me​—‘Pray incessantly.’ Gradually I began to feel stronger; no longer was it such a struggle to keep my mind on right things. The battle had been won!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Now that this is over, I have not gone back to the reading of such books that started the whole problem. I often help my classmates to be on guard against ESP, hypnotism, Ouija boards and other forms of spiritism. Having gone through a most unpleasant experience, I can see more than ever the importance of heeding the warnings given in Watch Tower Society’s publications.”</p>

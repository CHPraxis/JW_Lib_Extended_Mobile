<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ Writing to the editor of the New York <em>Times Magazine </em>of September 20, 1970, Dr. Franz E. Winkler states the following of marijuana users: “An early effect of marijuana and hashish use is a progressive loss of will power, already noticeable to the trained observer after about six weeks of moderate use. This loss of will power weakens the ability to resist coercion, so that marijuana users too often fall victim to hard-drug pushers, extortionists and deviates. Soon all ability for real joy disappears, to be replaced by the noisy pretense of fun. While healthy teen-agers will eagerly participate in all kinds of activities, such as sports, hiking, artistic endeavors, etc., a marijuana user will show an increasing tendency to talk endlessly of great goals, while doing nothing about them. Athletic abilities invariably fall off with the use of marijuana. Artistic achievements become meaningless and lose all originality. Instead of developing strong feelings toward others, the marijuana user is apt to wallow in sentimental emotions. Since the drug removes inhibitions, sex life may be stimulated for a brief period but invariably declines within a few years, leaving men all but impotent and women frigid.” Dr. Winkler concluded by noting the subtle, but “deeply tragic deterioration of the personality of the marijuana user.”</p>

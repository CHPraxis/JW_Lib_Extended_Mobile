Do You Know What This Is?
It is a prophetic vision seen by an apostle of Jesus Christ in the first century. You can find it in the twelfth chapter of the Bible book of Revelation.
Would you like to know what this vision means? Would you like to know why it is significant to us today? Then read the book “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” It explains, not only this inspired vision, but also much of the Bible book of Revelation. Its cost is only 50c.
I am enclosing 50 cents, for which I am to receive the book “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” and the gift booklet “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

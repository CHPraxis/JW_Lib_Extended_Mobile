YOU CAN READ HISTORY BEFORE IT OCCURS
A book on history can tell you what has happened in the past, but what book can tell you what will become history at a future date? There is only one, and that is the inspired Word of God, the Bible. Its many prophecies are actually history written in advance. Since they are given careful consideration in the Watchtower magazine, it can help you to see how Bible prophecies pertaining to our day are being fulfilled and what they reveal as coming in the years ahead. Thus you can read history before it occurs and with that knowledge make important decisions regarding your life. A subscription for one year will bring you two issues of The Watchtower every month. That is twenty-four issues for only $1. For sending in your subscription you will receive as free gifts the booklets God’s Way Is Love, Rescuing a Great Crowd of Mankind Out of Armageddon and World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace.

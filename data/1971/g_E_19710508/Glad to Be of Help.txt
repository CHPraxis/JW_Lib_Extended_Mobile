Glad to Be of Help
THE editor of a newspaper in the British Isles wanted to carry a regular religious article in his paper. He contacted all the local clergymen, asking if they would be interested in submitting an article on a regular basis. There was no response. So he contacted a national syndicate that supplies articles to papers all over England. They said that they could not help​—‘there was no call for religious articles.’
One of Jehovah’s witnesses got to hear of the editor’s problem. A Witness minister who handles news releases in connection with the circuit assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses contacted the editor. Several articles were prepared that showed that the Bible is scientifically accurate and is a practical, moral guide for today. The editor liked these 400-word articles. He asked, ‘How long can you keep them up?’ ‘As long as you keep your paper going,’ was the reply. Now every week the local paper has an uplifting article for the benefit of its 42,000 readers, under the heading “The Bible Says . . .”

In What Was He Interested?
● A woman in Fort Pierce, Florida, told one of Jehovah’s witnesses that her husband refused to go to church anymore. She explained why. Their preacher had called on them at their home one day. Upon learning that they were financially unable to contribute to the church because of recent medical expenses, the clergyman left, saying, “When you can afford it, we’ll see you in church!”
How unlike the apostle Paul, a faithful minister of Jehovah God, whose main interest in persons was their spiritual welfare.​—Eph. 1:15-19.

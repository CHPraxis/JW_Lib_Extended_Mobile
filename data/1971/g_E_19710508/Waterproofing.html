<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Waterproofing is not a recent invention of modern man. In fact, it may well be that man learned it from the birds, especially the water birds. These flying creatures are equipped by the Creator with a built-in waterproofing mechanism. They have glands that produce oil. And this oil is secreted over their feathers, thus waterproofing them. Because of his waterproof feathers a duck can sleep on a lake for a whole night without getting soaked. “Wild ducks,” said H. Mortimer Batten in the book <em>Inland Birds, </em>“swim and dive without so much as becoming moist below the surface feathers.”</p>

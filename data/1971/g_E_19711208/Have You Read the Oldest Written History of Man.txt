Have You Read the Oldest Written History of Man?
ACCURATE HISTORY
The Bible contains it​—a written history from man’s very beginning down to the first century of our Common Era. You can find there reliable information about ancient peoples and mighty world powers.
Let the happenings of ancient times unfold before your eyes by reading the “New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.” This is an accurate translation into modern-day English from the languages in which the Bible was anciently written. The cost is only $1.
Please send me the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, for which I enclose $1. Also send me the gift booklet “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

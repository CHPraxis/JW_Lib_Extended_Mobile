Where Can You Get Help to Solve Problems That Arise in Your Life?
The Bible contains the information you need. It has practical counsel for married couples and for single persons. It can help you with problems at home and away from home.
Read the Bible regularly but also increase your understanding of it. Gain the needed knowledge to benefit to the full from its counsel.
A valuable book that can help you to do this is “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.”
This book of 352 pages considers each of the sixty-six books of the Bible, giving a summary of its contents and reasons why it is beneficial. It is a valuable aid in any Bible-reading program, and the cost is only $1.
Please send me “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” for which I enclose $1. Send also the gift booklet The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years.

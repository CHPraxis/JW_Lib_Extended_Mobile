LORD’S EVENING MEAL
On Friday evening, April 9, after 6 p.m. Standard Time, the Christian witnesses of Jehovah will assemble at their Kingdom Halls to commemorate the death of their Lord Jesus Christ. This is a most important occasion, for Jesus himself expressly commanded that his followers do so. (1 Cor. 11:23-26) He instituted this memorial of his death with prospective members of his kingdom, the remnant of whom on that occasion will partake of the emblematic bread and wine. However, all other persons interested in gaining life through the merits of Christ’s sacrifice are welcome. They stand to benefit spiritually by the discussion of the Lord’s evening meal as well as by joining in song and prayer with fellow Christians.
CAN ETERNAL LIFE BECOME A REALITY?
Do you know of any man or woman descended from Adam who is able to live forever? From your own experience and from what you have read of history, you know that there is none. But does this mean that eternal life is impossible? Do we not enjoy many things today that people one hundred years ago thought impossible? Because no man is able to give you eternal life, is that reason to conclude that God cannot? He is not like men who make promises and then fail to keep them. We invite you to examine the convincing evidence proving that eternal life can become a reality for you. Read the books “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and Life Everlasting​—in Freedom Of the Sons of God. Both books may be had for only $1. By ordering them now you will receive as a free gift the booklets God’s Way Is Love and Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.

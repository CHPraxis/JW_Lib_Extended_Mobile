Creation Manifests Design
✔ Biologist W. J. Tinkle and horticulturist W. E. Lammerts commented on the design manifest in creation. What they said about this appears in the book Modern Science and Christian Faith as follows: “In His arrangement of the cells of plants and animals the Creator has written an account which the trained person can read . . . When the outer layer of a leaf is stripped off and examined under a powerful lens, the leaf tissue is magnified revealing its minute arrangement. It is a layer of cells fitted nicely together, all having similar size and shape, and within each cell there is a smaller body called a nucleus. When a thin slice of root tip is magnified still more, using a compound microscope, one observes that the nucleus is made up of regularly shaped parts, including the rod-shaped chromosomes. The more we magnify the things of nature, the more order is revealed to us.
“Such intricate structure is not characteristic of the work of man. When magnified, the edge of a sharp razor blade looks like a jagged and very irregular saw, as if a nervous man had cut out saw teeth with his eyes shut. If we look at fine printing we see irregular blobs of ink on criss-cross fibers of paper. Yet who would look at the razor blade or the piece of fine printing and deny the intelligent planning of the man who formed them?
“Such order and design as we see in nature demands a Designer.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>✔ </strong>Biologist W. J. Tinkle and horticulturist W. E. Lammerts commented on the design manifest in creation. What they said about this appears in the book <em>Modern Science and Christian Faith </em>as follows: “In His arrangement of the cells of plants and animals the Creator has written an account which the trained person can read . . . When the outer layer of a leaf is stripped off and examined under a powerful lens, the leaf tissue is magnified revealing its minute arrangement. It is a layer of cells fitted nicely together, all having similar size and shape, and within each cell there is a smaller body called a nucleus. When a thin slice of root tip is magnified still more, using a compound microscope, one observes that the nucleus is made up of regularly shaped parts, including the rod-shaped chromosomes. <em>The more we magnify the things of nature, the more order is revealed to us.</em></p>

When magnified, the edge of a sharp razor blade looks like a jagged and very irregular saw, as if a nervous man had cut out saw teeth with his eyes shut. If we look at fine printing we see irregular blobs of ink on criss-cross fibers of paper. Yet who would look at the razor blade or the piece of fine printing and deny the intelligent planning of the man who formed them?</p>

An Assembly Not to Be Missed
HAVE you prayed for God’s kingdom to come? Do you long for the time when that kingdom will fulfill the Word of man’s Creator by destroying those who practice wickedness and then making this earth a Paradise? If so, you will do everything possible to be on hand for the discourse entitled “When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God.” This is to be the principal address at each of the assemblies listed below.
Again and again the Bible declares: ‘The nations will have to know that I am Jehovah.’ We now live very close to the time when God will take action to make the nations know him in a way that they have never known him before. What does the immediate future hold for all mankind? These thrilling events will be a principal topic for consideration at each of the forthcoming “Divine Name” District Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Will you be present?
The program at each assembly city (except in the Bahamas) is five days in length. It will open at 1:40 on Wednesday afternoon, and conclude at about 5:15 p.m. on Sunday. Don’t miss any of it.
The assembly highlights are by no means reserved simply for the last couple of days of the program. Starting with the first session, the program is packed with things that are of the greatest interest to every person who wants to be well-pleasing to God. There are discourses and demonstrations that are practical and upbuilding. Portions of the program are outstanding in what they feature for parents and for youths, including powerful dramas of Biblical events and their meaning to us today. And on Friday morning, at each assembly, there will be arrangements for immersion of those who have made the necessary preparation to be baptized as disciples of Jesus Christ.
We urge you to get to the assembly city well ahead of time so that you will be in your seat when the program begins at 1:40 on Wednesday afternoon. To do that, you need to start making plans now. If you do not live in the immediate vicinity of one of the assembly cities, you will no doubt need rooming accommodations. The volunteer workers who care for the assembly organization will be glad to help you to arrange for such accommodations, if you so desire. Simply address your request to Watchtower Convention at the “Rooming” address listed below for the assembly that you plan to attend.
Unless otherwise indicated, the programs for the assemblies listed here will be in English, but, as noted, some of the assemblies will include other languages or, in certain cases, will be exclusively in another tongue.
If you have not already done so, decide now where you will attend, make definite plans to be there, and earnestly seek Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts to do so.

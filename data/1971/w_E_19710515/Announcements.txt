NEWS YOU CAN BELIEVE
Much has been written in recent years about a “credibility gap.” This is because some government officials have said things that have not been in accord with the facts. A “credibility gap” also exists with respect to many news publications for the same reason. Often the truth is distorted because they cater to political or business interests. This is not so, however, with Awake! magazine. It is unaffected by political influence and propaganda. Because it has no advertisers it does not come under pressure to distort things. It does not hesitate to tell the truth. Awake! has no fetters. It recognizes facts, faces facts and is free to publish facts. Have it come into your home regularly. It is published twice a month and can be received by mail for one year for only $1. For subscribing you will receive as a free gift the following booklets: When God Is King over All the Earth, “The Good News of the Kingdom” and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

Was the Ark Big Enough?
The Bible states that an ark saved human, animal and bird life from total destruction in an earth-wide flood. What is the evidence? How could all varieties of animals and birds fit into the ark?
Read the facts in the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? You will find them convincing. A young person who read it wrote: “I just read Is the Bible Really the Word of God? For the first time in my 20 years I can honestly say I believe in God! I have you to thank.”
The book is hard-covered and contains 192 pages. It is only 25 cents.
Please send me Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for which I am enclosing 25 cents.

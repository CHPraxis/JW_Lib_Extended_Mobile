Research in Psychotherapy
◆ Today many psychotherapists, physicians who treat mentally and emotionally disturbed patients, tend to look down on the help that anyone outside their profession may give to those having emotional problems. But do they do so with good reason, in view of what is stated in the book Research in Psychotherapy? Written by two psychologists, it was reviewed in the December 21, 1970, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association by Dr. B. P. Lipton.
Among other things he stated: “There is no evidence that group treatment is any better or worse than individual treatment, that one school of psychotherapy is better than another, that personal therapy improves therapists’ efficacy, or even that experienced practitioners do a better job than inexperienced ones. Indeed, several studies are presented which suggest that nonprofessionals are no less effective or possibly even better than well-trained professionals!”
In view of the foregoing, who is to say that unselfish, mature Christian ministers may not be effective in giving help to lovers of righteousness who come to them with emotional problems? The facts show that they have helped ever so many persons by extending Jesus’ invitation: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls.”​—Matt. 11:28-30.

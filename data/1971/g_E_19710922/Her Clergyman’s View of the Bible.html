<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN Texas a witness of Jehovah made a return call on a woman who had accepted literature explaining the Bible. The woman had read it and was moved to ask whether Jehovah’s witnesses believe that all of the Holy Bible is inspired of God. When the Witness replied that they do, the woman then went on to say that her Methodist clergyman had told the congregation to which she belonged that he did not believe all the Bible. For example, among other things, he claimed that the flood in Noah’s time, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the miracles recorded in the Bible were not true. Yet she noted that he would give a sermon based on a scripture dealing with the flood of Noah’s day.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“How are we to feel about a sermon like that?” she observed. “He is teaching us to believe in something that he has already told us to be untrue!” However, this sincere woman is no longer confused about this matter. She is learning from her Bible study with the Witnesses that “all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Have you heard your minister say that the Bible is not true or is filled with myths? Do you believe this? Why not investigate this matter for yourself? Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to share with you evidence that the Bible is truthfully the Word of God.</p>

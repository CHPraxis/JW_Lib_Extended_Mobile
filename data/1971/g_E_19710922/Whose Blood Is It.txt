Whose Blood Is It?
● Today there are numerous uses to which animal and human blood is put. In addition to being used in transfusions, it is used by some commercial firms for making certain adhesives or food products. But when blood is removed from an animal or human, to whom does the blood belong? The owner of the animal? The human from whom the blood was taken? What do you think?
A three-year-old girl in Bolivia knew the answer. Her Christian parents, in studying the Bible with her, had pointed out that Jehovah God viewed blood as representing life. When blood was removed from a body it was not to be eaten or sold but was to be poured out on the ground. Thus the blood was, in effect, returned to God as the one with whom life originates.​—Lev. 17:11-14.
The young girl’s mother explains what happened one day: “I have some neighbors that share the same patio and who were never interested in hearing me speak about the Bible. One holiday they brought home a sheep to slaughter and feast upon. As the animal was slaughtered, my three-year-old daughter happened to be nearby and she saw the blood flow from the animal. She shouted, ‘The blood belongs to Jehovah! The blood belongs to Jehovah!’ The neighbors never heard such a thing, and they did not know who Jehovah was, so they were left speechless. Hearing my girl’s shouts, I hurried to the patio to see what was the matter. There she was among the grown-ups saying, ‘Don’t touch. Don’t touch. It belongs to Jehovah.’ The neighbors wanted an explanation. I hurried to the house and got my Bible to show them that what my daughter was saying was based upon God’s Word. Now my neighbors are regularly studying the Bible with me and hope soon to be baptized ministers of Jehovah.”
Does your view and do your actions regarding blood reflect the accurate knowledge and respect for it that this young girl had?

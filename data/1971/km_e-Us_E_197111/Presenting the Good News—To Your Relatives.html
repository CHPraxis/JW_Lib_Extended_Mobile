<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We want our relatives to learn God’s truth and to gain everlasting life along will us, don’t we? As Andrew helped his brother Peter, we want to share the truth with our relatives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:41-43:1:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 1:41, 42</a>) Of course, it is wise not to try to tell your unbelieving relatives everything at once. A few main points, or just one, may be enough the first few times. Even if they show little interest, persist in sharing the good news as opportunity affords.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>You will find it helpful to be alert to what interests your relatives. Are they concerned about world conditions, the increase in violence and crime? Then you may have opportunity to talk to them about Bible prophecy and what was foretold for our day. This may lead to your presenting the <em>Truth </em>book and starting a study.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Some brothers report they have found it beneficial to go over the articles in each issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>and then ask themselves, Would any article in this issue be of special interest to a certain relative, young or old? You might even make a list of your relatives, and as you examine the articles, go over the list and determine who might enjoy a certain article. Articles such as “Teaching Your Daughter About Housekeeping” and “Stamp Collecting as a Hobby” are of that sort. To some relatives you might send an article that reports on recent assemblies, along with a brief letter telling them what you did this past summer. If one has a Baptist relative, then the article in <em>The Watchtower </em>on “Baptist Concern over Church Problems” would be a good one to send them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>There are other ways to reach them too. Now that we have the <em>Great Teacher </em>book, why not make it a gift to your young relatives? You may want to write a message on the inside cover, making the book a personalized gift. Because of the nature of the material, it will be welcome in many households. If a child to whom you give the book asks his father or mother to read him the stories, then the parents may learn God’s truth while reading it to the child. It is a direct way to reach the child and an indirect way to reach the parents. The logic and wholesomeness of the material may appeal to the parent, cause him to ask questions and open the way for a home Bible study.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Many publishers report having used the <em>Word of God </em>and <em>Evolution </em>books to help relatives who had little interest or faith in God’s Word or who were opposed. One publisher in Ohio had a grandmother very much opposed to the truth. “After she came to stay a few days with us,” reports the publisher, “my grandmother picked up the <em>Evolution </em>book and began reading it. By the time she left, she had asked for her own copy and had read quite a bit of it. The next time she came, I asked her if she would like to have the <em>Truth </em>book, since she enjoyed the <em>Evolution </em>book so much. She was happy to have it. A study was started and she now attends most of the meetings.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Here is another suggestion. Have you ever made a gift of the <em>Yearbook </em>to a relative? Some publishers have done this, and with good results. They know that their relatives might not read a book about doctrinal matters, so they give them a <em>Yearbook, </em>explaining that it is a book that tells about the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and the work it is doing around the world. You might say, “I thought you would like to read this report on what the Witnesses are doing and the fascinating experiences they have had in various parts of the world.” This year why not order a few extra copies of the <em>Yearbook </em>and give them to your relatives?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>If your relatives live far away, you can witness to them by mail. If any show interest and you cannot personally visit them, feel free to write the Society, and the information will be sent to a congregation in the vicinity where your relative lives.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Often it is true that time and change of circumstance or developments in the world make persons more favorably disposed than in the past. So do not give up in presenting the good news to your relatives.</p>

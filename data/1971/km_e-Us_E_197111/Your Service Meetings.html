<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Explain that offer for the month is “New World Translation” and “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” for $1.25. If the householder already has the “New World Translation,” offer the book “‘The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah’​—How?” with booklet, for 50 cents. If publishers want to keep on using the Scripture presentation that they used during November, that is fine. If some want a different presentation, the following thoughts may be helpful:</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Usually we have little difficulty engaging people in conversation about economic problems, violence, immorality, family difficulties, etc. Your presentation could be designed to invite their expressions on one of these current problems. Then use their response as an opportunity to direct attention to some practical advice from the Bible. (See “Word of God” book, Chapter 11, “Is the Bible Practical for Our Day?” for talking points.) You can read from the Bible, or, if you prefer, read the scriptures out of the book along with the accompanying explanation. Having showed the value of the Bible’s counsel, offer the modern-language “New World Translation” and the “Word of God” book.</p>

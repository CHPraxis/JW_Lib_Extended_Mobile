<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We did very well during the first month of our new service year. We had 408,345 publishers sharing the good news. We placed an average of almost two books per publisher, or a total of 813,403! Isn’t that fine? What a blessing the “Evolution” book will be to those many persons whose minds have been permeated with that godless philosophy! Many will have their thinking readjusted and minds opened to God’s truth because of your good work in September.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Would you like to try some of the suggestions that various traveling representatives of the Society have used recently in getting subscriptions for the magazines? Listed here are five that you may find useful.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. Have a positive approach, drawing attention to the specific contents of the magazines you are presenting.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. Try offering both subscriptions instead of one. One circuit servant reported that he obtained nine subscriptions in just one day by doing this.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. You may find it useful to say that <em>The Watchtower </em>has been published for over 90 years. Obviously, it is quite experienced in presenting spiritual food at the right time.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">4. Some have taken the time to <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>add up the exact number of Scriptural references in one issue of <em>The Watchtower. </em>In many cases there are over 150. Yes, what is presented in <em>The Watchtower </em>is solidly founded in the Bible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">5. If you meet a busy person at the door, you can give him an option. He might want to take just the two latest copies for 10Â cents or he might want a subscription for just $1.50 a year so that one of the magazines will conveniently come to his home on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Likely some of these thoughts will prove helpful to you as they have to others. We sincerely hope so.</p>

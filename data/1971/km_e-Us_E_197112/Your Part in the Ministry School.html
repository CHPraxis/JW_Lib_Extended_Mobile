<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As you may have noticed from the new Theocratic Ministry School schedule, a wealth of information will be covered during the 1972 calendar year. Why? To help us to become better servants of Jehovah God now. Also, to prepare us for life in the new system of things. Surely, if at all possible, you will want to be present for each session of the school to receive education that simply cannot be had anywhere else.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>If you have read the instructions on the new school schedule, you doubtless noted a number of changes. These should make the school more enjoyable and beneficial for all of us.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>As you prepare your talks, you will find that there is an abundance of excellent material. How much of it should you try to cover? Of course, it often is not possible to cover every point. Do not sacrifice good teaching methods. But we ought to discuss more than an isolated sentence or two, and we should not always use only the “milk” of the word and skip over the “meat.” Come to grips with material that will be truly informative to the congregation. There are fine points that aid us to understand certain scriptures more clearly, and we all want to benefit from these.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>It is all right to use field service settings where appropriate. But sisters may at times find that a field service setting would greatly limit their coverage of the material. In that case it would be much better to have the assistant take the part of a person who has a background in the truth. The presentation could then take the form of a discussion with another member of the family or another publisher. And if you want to have your <em>Aid </em>book (or other textbook) in your hand as you discuss the material from it, there is no objection to your doing so.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Even when we are not scheduled to give a talk, preparation for the school is beneficial. It helps us to impress the information more deeply upon our minds and hearts. True, not everyone is able to spend the same amount of time in advance preparation. But we can all do some.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>As an aid in learning, you may also find it helpful to have your book open to the material being discussed by each speaker. When a particularly helpful or interesting point is made, find it in the publication and underscore it. This may help to impress it on your mind, facilitate your finding it in the future and, in the case of the instruction talk, make it easier for you to participate in the oral review.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The Theocratic Ministry School indeed has much to offer us in the months ahead. How fine it will be to listen to the informative, encouraging talks! Additionally, we can be certain of Jehovah’s blessing as we share to the extent possible in making each session of the school an hour of spiritual refreshment.</p>

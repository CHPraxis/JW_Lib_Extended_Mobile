◆ The public talk that will be given by circuit servants starting in February is entitled “A Close Look at the Churches.” It includes the use of colored slides from over twenty countries. The presentation is one that is pointed and heart-searching. By all means, urge all who have shown any interest in the truth to be present. And do not miss it yourself! Also beginning in February, there is a forceful new public talk to be given at circuit assemblies, on the subject “Are You ‘Marked’ for Survival?”
◆ Can you use the world’s holiday season to increase your praise to Jehovah? If your circumstances permit, why not be a vacation pioneer or arrange to spend some full days in field service? Congregation servants can make special arrangements for witnessing for the holidays. It is a good time for field service, since so many people are at home.

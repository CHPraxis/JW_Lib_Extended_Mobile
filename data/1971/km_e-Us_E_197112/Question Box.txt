Question Box
● How can we help those who have been inactive for a long period of time to requalify as publishers of the good news?
Each year circuit servants report that a number of publishers have fallen into inactivity. Often it is because these folks have allowed the pressures and anxieties of this system of things to encroach upon their worship of Jehovah, causing them to slow down. When individuals slow down and stop associating with us at meetings and in the field ministry, there is evidence of serious spiritual weakness. If you encounter such a person, urge him to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall again. In some cases, where there is evidence that the person wants to serve Jehovah again, he might be helped by having a home Bible study, or perhaps using appropriate “Watchtower” articles, to build him up in faith.​—Jas. 2:14; Heb. 5:12-14; 10:23-25.
Because the “older men” in the congregations are especially concerned for the safety and needs of the flock, they are willing to take the necessary time for friendly visits to build up inactive ones through spiritual discussions, provided the inactive ones show a sincere desire to return to the flock of God. When the root cause of the problem is ascertained, the needed spiritual help can be given. They ought to be encouraged to study Jehovah’s Word regularly, both personally and as a family group.​—Isa. 32:2; John 21:15-17.
If someone has been inactive and has not associated with the congregation for a long time, it would be reasonable to expect that the inactive one should meet the basic requirements outlined on page 108 of the “Lamp” book, which includes fairly consistent attendance at the congregational meetings and an earnest desire to be a minister of the good news, before being considered as a publisher once again.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">◆ Can you use the world’s holiday season to increase your praise to Jehovah? If your circumstances permit, why not be a vacation pioneer or arrange to spend some full days in field service? Congregation servants can make special arrangements for witnessing for the holidays. It is a good time for field service, since so many people are at home.</p>

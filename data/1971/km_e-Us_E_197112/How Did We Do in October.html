<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A new peak in publishers, the first in our service year​—this is the good news we have to share with you, brothers! Yes, 418,402 engaged in the field ministry during October. The report underscores your determination: On with the marking work of the King’s secretary! Your good work also resulted in 159,909 subscriptions being obtained. “Awake!” will now be coming regularly into many more homes<strong>. </strong>It helps people to see the religious abominations of Christendom. May many new subscribers become righteously disposed, enabling us to satisfy their spiritual need.</p>

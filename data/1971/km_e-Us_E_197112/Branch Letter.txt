Branch Letter
Dear Fellow Publishers:
More Gilead students have arrived. We wish you could have been with us on October 18 when these ninety-eight brothers and sisters of the 52nd class were introduced to the Bethel family. They are serious-minded and enthusiastic, with a variety of backgrounds, having come from Denmark, Germany, Malagasy Republic, Puerto Rico and from many sections of the United States and Canada. Along with other studies they are learning Portuguese, Spanish, French and Japanese.
It is too early to give you a report on how many ‘Know Jehovah’ books were placed during November, but the Brooklyn plant has shipped out over 1,700,000 copies. Now, during the month of December we have a wonderful follow-up offer for the people, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
Don’t forget, besides English, this delightful Bible translation is printed in Dutch, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish for those reading those languages. And remember, too, for only $5 a large-print edition is available in English for those who prefer it.
We are also pleased to announce that a new Bible study folder is being printed​—20,000,000 of them! These are being shipped free of charge with your Yearbooks. Order more when you need them. Printing of the earlier study folders has been discontinued.
This new folder gives a very fine witness concerning Jehovah himself and it tells the reader about the new ‘Know Jehovah’ book. It also outlines the Bible study arrangement in such a way that you can use any book you may choose.
Be sure to leave the folder when householders do not take other literature. Also leave it where no one is at home. It is like leaving your footprints behind. But not in mailboxes, for that is against postal regulations. Let them know that Jehovah’s witnesses have called again!
Be assured of our love,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

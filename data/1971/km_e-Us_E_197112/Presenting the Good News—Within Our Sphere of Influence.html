<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>How much influence do you have? Perhaps more than you realize. Each one of us has a certain group of relatives, business acquaintances, fellow workers, schoolmates and neighbors who know us well because of our association with them over a period of time. These individuals are really within our sphere of influence and they will likely be more receptive to the Kingdom message when it is presented by someone they already know than by a stranger calling at their doors. Thus we can use our “influence” for good by tactfully taking advantage of opportunities to speak with them about the Bible and even by making opportunities to do this.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Possibly you have tried witnessing to relatives or acquaintances in the past and have found it somewhat difficult, even discouraging. If this has been your experience, perhaps you can improve your methods so as to become more effective. Of course, it is good to realize that not all will be interested the first time you approach them. However, if you are tactful, in the future there will likely be many other opportunities to converse with them about Jehovah’s purposes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>A friendly conversation with anyone provides a fine basis for a witness, since the person is already in a favorable frame of mind. To maintain this, we need to exercise tact and discernment, being sensitive to the attitude of the individual. Sometimes a question will turn a conversation to a subject that will make it easy for us to show what the future holds for this system of things. We can then contrast this with Jehovah’s righteous new order. For example, we can ask: “Do you think the East and the West will ever get together and solve their differences?” “Do you think world conditions will continue to deteriorate?” “Why is there so much trouble in the earth today?” Or, “Why do we all feel so much pressure upon us?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>These and other questions may direct the conversation toward the Bible answer; they may also help us to determine what the other person is thinking. Thus we can tailor our presentations according to the attitude of individuals, making the necessary adjustments or perhaps even discontinuing our efforts entirely for the time being, depending upon the response we get.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Another method that many have found successful is to get others to ask us questions. Even here, though, we must discern whether merely to answer the questions without further comment or to elaborate, perhaps even explaining the Bible’s teaching on related matters.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>On occasion, you might ask if your acquaintance had a good weekend, and when he has commented, you might mention a circuit or district assembly or some other meeting you attended that weekend and something of interest you learned that might stir his curiosity​—perhaps a point from the public talk or something you learned from your Bible reading. Did you enjoy some thought-provoking observation at a recent meeting? or have an interesting experience in the field ministry? Then why not comment on it briefly? Possibly this will evoke some comment or question from your companion. If the approach does not arouse interest, another approach or renewed efforts at a later time may prove successful.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>By using the influence we have with others in the right way and at the right times, we may be able to stir up in them a desire for the truth. What a joy to use our influence on others for their blessing so they may share with us the hope of everlasting life!</p>

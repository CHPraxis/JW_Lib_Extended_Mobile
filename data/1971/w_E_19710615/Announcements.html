<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>BENEFIT FROM THE GREEK TEXT OF THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Even if you cannot read the Greek language, you can still benefit directly from the Greek text of the Bible. This has been made possible by <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</em>. The twenty-seven books of the Christian Greek Scriptures appear in this translation in the Greek language used by the Bible writers. Under each Greek word appears the basic meaning in English. Since Greek and English grammars are different, the English words under the Greek words are not arranged in an order that makes for easy reading. Therefore, on the right side of each page there is a column where the verses are rendered into modern English in harmony with English grammar and according to the sense of the Greek text. By means of this scholarly work you can read the Bible with greater comprehension because you can examine the basic meaning of individual Greek words. <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures </em>is available for only $2. For sending in your order you will receive free the booklet <em>The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years</em>.</p>

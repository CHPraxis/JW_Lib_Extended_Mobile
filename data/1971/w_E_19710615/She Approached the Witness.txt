She Approached the Witness
◆ One of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York city was waiting for a taxi to take her to the Kingdom Hall. A woman approached her and asked if she was a Witness. When she replied that she was, the woman asked if the Witness would kindly send someone to help her study the Bible. This request surprised the Witness, for she had been praying to God for the privilege of helping someone to learn his will. She promised to help the woman, and did so regularly.
However, the astonishing point of this incident was revealed when the woman later disclosed why she approached the Witness that day. She explained: “I was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses before I moved three months ago. On this particular day I had just learned that my father died and I was quite upset. I was returning from making a phone call when I saw this woman standing on the corner. I could not tell by any outstanding feature that she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She did not carry a book bag nor did she have a Bible in her hand. She just had an ordinary purse. But I felt, ‘There is a Witness. Talk to her.’
“I was a little afraid to approach a stranger. But to my great relief, she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Thanks to Jehovah, my study of his Word was resumed. I have progressed in it to the point of being baptized in symbol of my dedication to him, the true God, who really cares for those who seek him.”

Family Fights
● Though marriage is an institution arranged by God, many marriages are by no means godly. (Gen. 2:18-24) Failure to apply the righteous principles regarding Christian life found in the Bible has resulted in marriages fraught with fights and discord.
One of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Netherlands knew of a couple with such a problem. They lived in the apartment above him. This couple fought like “cats and dogs” week after week. In their angry fights they would often throw dishes at each other, so that every now and then they had to buy a new tea or dinner set. Also, they had the habit of vacuuming the apartment in the middle of the night, in the tense period just before or after a family fight.
Yet they could be very kind and helpful too. At the Christmas season the husband was going out to buy a Christmas tree. He offered to purchase and bring back one for the Witness downstairs. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the minister of Jehovah’s witnesses spoke with his upstairs neighbor about the Bible. A study of God’s Word on a regular basis commenced, using the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. The chapter in it entitled “Building a Happy Family Life” was particularly appropriate, for it sets forth the excellent principles of God’s Word, which, when followed, can bring real happiness and peace to a marriage. Within a short period of time the family fights came to an end and the night vacuuming ceased. Now both husband and wife are happily united as baptized ministers of God.
If family fights have been a problem in your case, why not try this solution also? Is it not reasonable that the Author of marriage knows best how humans can find peace and joy in this arrangement?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The famous musician and poet King David of Israel once sang to Jehovah, “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>) In discussing the marvels of the human lungs Professor of Physiology Wallace O. Fenn testified to the truthfulness of this when he said: “The engineering of the breathing apparatus stands among the many marvels displayed by the human body. The lungs offer an area at least half the size of a tennis court for diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between blood and air. The lung membrane through which the exchange takes place is of such exquisite delicacy and thinness that it has not been equaled in effectiveness by any of the artificial lungs designed [by man]. The effort required to renew the air in the lung is negligible, and the energy to sustain it can be supplied . . . by two lumps of sugar or their equivalent per day.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The breathing mechanism is a marvelously well-adapted structure and provides ample reason for any thinking man to stand in awe before the processes that have brought it all to pass: ‘So curiously are we wrought, so fearfully and wonderfully are we made!’”</p>

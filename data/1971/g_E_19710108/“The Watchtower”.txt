“The Watchtower”
Esau sold his birthright for a meal of stew. He did not appreciate a sacred thing.
Many people today are like Esau. They think more of material things than sacred things. God’s written Word is sacred. Do you appreciate it?
“The Watchtower” can broaden your knowledge of God’s Word and strengthen your faith in it. Manifest your appreciation for sacred things by receiving “The Watchtower” regularly. The cost is small, only $1 per year.
Please send me The Watchtower for one year (24 issues), for which I am enclosing $1. Send also the three free booklets God’s Way Is Love, Man’s Rule About to Give Way to God’s Rule and Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">There are about 200,000 known kinds of flowers on earth. They range in size from water blossoms so small they can be seen only with a microscope, to tropical flowers that are three feet wide. Some kinds of flowers have petals. Others look like stars, saucers or balloons. Some even have shapes that resemble insects, spiders or birds. Many flowers have smells that attract the birds or insects that help fertilize them.</p>

A Rabbi’s Commendation
A Jewish woman in Detroit, Michigan, wanted to learn the Bible. One day she asked her husband for permission to go to a church or synagogue to do this. When he refused, she replied, “You just wait and see. Someone will come and want to teach me the Bible.” That very afternoon her door was the first one at which Jehovah’s witnesses called in that area. She eagerly accepted their offer to help her learn the Bible, something for which she had been praying.
After studying the Bible for some time this woman told her husband that she wanted to be baptized as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He became very upset and called a rabbi. The rabbi’s comments were most interesting. He said: “This is a free country. We can worship the way we want to. Jehovah’s witnesses are fine people. Their worship is clean and pure. I have nothing against them, except that they use the New Testament and we don’t. Besides, it is written, ‘choose for yourself whom you will worship!’”

At the annual meeting last year the members determined upon this location for 1971, and accordingly the meeting will be at 10:00 o’clock in the forenoon of Friday, October 1, 1971, at the assembly hall in Buckingham.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It will be appreciated if the members of the corporation will now see to it that the Secretary’s office has their present mailing addresses so that the regular letters of notice and proxies can be sent to them to reach them shortly after September 1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The proxies, which will be sent to the members along with the notice of the annual meeting, are to be returned so as to reach the office of the Secretary of the Society not later than September 15. As each member knows, he should complete and return his proxy promptly whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not.</p>

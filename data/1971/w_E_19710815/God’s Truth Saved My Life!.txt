God’s Truth Saved My Life!
● When my dearly beloved wife passed away I was left very gloomy. I had been told at my church that my wife was in a fiery hell, for she had never been baptized. I was so miserable to be around that my son would not stay at home on the weekends. He left on Friday morning and returned late on Sunday night.
One Friday evening I decided to join my wife in death. I did not want to live another year in misery. In our neighborhood, many poisonous plants grow. I planned to pick some of these, make a brew from them and then drink it, after which I would go to bed.
As I was getting the wood to build a fire, two young women walked up the path to my home. They gave me a short sermon from the Bible. I told them that this was a motherless home but that they were welcome to come in. They did so and we three sat down. For an hour or more we discussed God’s truth in the Bible. On leaving they promised to call back on me next Friday. So I did not gather the greens to make my poison brew that evening.
These two witnesses of Jehovah called back on me faithfully that Friday and others thereafter. Well, about a month later, I made my first visit to a Kingdom Hall here in Seattle, Washington. I have regularly gone there since. Later I was baptized and I am now one of Jehovah’s happy witnesses. I truly feel that those two Witnesses were a provision from God, for the truth they brought saved my life.​—Contributed.

Your Child May Live Forever on Earth!
Does this prospect seem impossible to you? Consider the facts that make it a very real possibility.
They are contained in the two books “Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God” and “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” These two hard-covered books of more than 400 pages each will also give you helpful information on how to have a happy family life, why God has permitted wickedness, the hope for the dead as well as many other subjects. They can be had for 50 cents each.
Please send me Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God and “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” for which I enclose $1. Also send me two gift booklets on Bible topics.

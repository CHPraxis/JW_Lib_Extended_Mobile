<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Jehovah’s witnesses invite you to join them in observing the memorial of Christ’s death on Friday, April 9, after 6 p.m. Go to the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Check with Jehovah’s witnesses locally for the exact time.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On the night that Jesus Christ instituted this memorial he instructed his faithful followers: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) In obedience to these instructions Jehovah’s witnesses observe this memorial once a year on its anniversary date, and they welcome others who wish to join them on this most important occasion.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">No collections will be taken, and visitors will not be expected to do anything but listen to an instructive talk and observe the simple proceedings. You will find the program to be very upbuilding. Set aside the evening of April 9 for this special occasion.</p>

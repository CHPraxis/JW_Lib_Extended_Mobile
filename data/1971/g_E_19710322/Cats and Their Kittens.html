<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you ever wondered why a mother cat will pick a hidden, dark place in which to give birth to her kittens? It is because this protects the eyes of her little ones from bright light. Since a tiny kittenâ€™s eyes do not open fully until eight to ten days after birth, there is the danger that bright light can injure the eyes of a newborn kitten. Though the temptation may be strong, it is best to avoid bringing newborn kittens into brightly lit places to let friends see them.</p>

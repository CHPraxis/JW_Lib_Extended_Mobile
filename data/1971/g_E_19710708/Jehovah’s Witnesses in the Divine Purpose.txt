Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose
“This Good News of the Kingdom Will Be Preached in All the Inhabited Earth”
Jesus Christ spoke this prophecy. Jehovah’s witnesses are fulfilling it by preaching the good news in 206 lands.
Are you familiar with the modern-day history of Jehovah’s witnesses? Do you know what they have had to endure to bring this good news to people? You will find it in the book Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose. The 320 pages of this hard-covered book are of the same size as the magazine you are holding. The cost is only $1.
Enclosed find $1 for the book Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose. Also send me the gift booklet World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace.

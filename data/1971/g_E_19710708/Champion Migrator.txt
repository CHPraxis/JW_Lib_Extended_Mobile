Champion Migrator
● The Arctic tern flies a greater distance than any other migrating bird. Every year it makes a round trip of about 22,000 miles from the northernmost islands of the Arctic to the Antarctic and back again. Without man’s complex navigational equipment, it travels that great distance with pinpoint accuracy.

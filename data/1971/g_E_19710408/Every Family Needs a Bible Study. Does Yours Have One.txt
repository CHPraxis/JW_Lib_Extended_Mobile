Every Family Needs a Bible Study. Does Yours Have One?
What does the future hold for you? How can you protect your loved ones from today’s moral breakdown? Only God’s Word, the Bible, gives the truthful answers that will fill you with hope.
The answers to these questions are available now.
How? Through the home Bible instruction offered by Jehovah’s witnesses.
How much does it cost? Absolutely nothing. The only requirements are that you prepare for the discussions and keep your appointments.
The service is available in your own home (or elsewhere, if you prefer).
To arrange for such personal aid from a qualified instructor for one hour each week, simply contact Jehovah’s witnesses in your area, or fill out and mail the coupon below.

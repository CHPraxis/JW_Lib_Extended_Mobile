What Makes a Nation “Civilized”?
◆ In his book The Grand Alliance Sir Winston Churchill wrote about the rise of Japan after she defeated Russia in 1905. He observed: “It was with amazement that the world saw in 1905 the defeat of Czarist Russia, not only on the sea, but by great armies transported to the mainland and winning enormous battles in Manchuria. Japan now took her place among the Great Powers. The Japanese were themselves astonished at the respect with which they were viewed.” And what did the Japanese think of this?
Churchill quotes them as saying: “When we sent you the beautiful products of our ancient arts and culture you despised and laughed at us; but since we have got a first-class Navy and Army with good weapons we are regarded as a highly civilised nation.”

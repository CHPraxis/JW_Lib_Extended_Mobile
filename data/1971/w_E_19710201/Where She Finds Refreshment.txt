Where She Finds Refreshment
A woman, in her letter “To the Editors” that was recently published in Commonweal magazine, said: “How about Jehovah’s Witnesses as an example of a healthy, growing church? 80 percent of its members are said to be former Catholics.
“Much of the secret of their success can be found by reading their humble publications, Watchtower and Awake. The first studies and discusses the Bible, and the second is on general subjects.
“Why is it, that after I read those magazines, with their rather old-fashioned graphics and cheap paper, I feel refreshed, inspired, and ready to roll up my sleeves again and tackle life (in my case, the raising of seven sons and two daughters)?
“Why is it that after I read certain Catholic publications I feel tired, depressed, and a little bored with religion? After unraveling the tangled web of erudite words some writers weave around a slight thought, I only wish I had expended the energy on some useful task around the house.
“I think the answer is to be found in Matthew, Chapter 18. ‘Unless you change and become as little children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.’
“The Witness magazines’ anonymous writers write clearly and simply. Their object is to share the good word of the Gospel and to encourage you to go to the source of their wisdom. It inspires, instructs, and comforts. It is un-selfconscious.
“I am not a Jehovah’s Witness myself, but it is a great thing that Catholic people are beginning to look their fellow believers in Christ in the eye and seeing a few virtues there.”
As Jesus Christ himself said: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, . . . and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.”​—Matt. 11:28-30.

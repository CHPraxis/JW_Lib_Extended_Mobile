<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Have you been puzzled by the prophetic visions of the Bible book of Revelation? Would you like to know what those visions mean and what the many symbolisms used in them represent? Since so many other prophecies of the Bible mark our period as the “last days” of the present system of things, is it not reasonable to expect an understanding of Revelation to be made available now? Would you be interested in learning how the Revelation relates to us? about the events it foretells for more than a thousand years into the future? You can by reading the books <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God” </em>and <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” </em>God’s Kingdom Rules! Between these two fascinating books the entire Bible book of Revelation is discussed verse by verse. They can open your understanding to the many inspired truths it contains. These two fine Bible study aids can be had for only $1.25. As a free gift you will also receive the booklets <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New” </em>and <em>Rescuing a Great Crowd of Mankind Out of Armageddon</em>.</p>

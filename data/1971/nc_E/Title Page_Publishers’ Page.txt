When All Nations Collide, Head On, With God
WORLD LEADERS of today greatly fear a collision between the two mighty political blocs of nations in a third world war. But have they ever expressed fear of a collision of all nations with God? Which collision would be more consequential? There is all reason to believe that nothing would be worse than such a confrontation with the Creator of the universe.
The information in this booklet is published, not to frighten you, but to brighten your outlook with hope of surviving into a warless, peaceful, loving human society on an unpolluted earth. You will be happier for having read this.

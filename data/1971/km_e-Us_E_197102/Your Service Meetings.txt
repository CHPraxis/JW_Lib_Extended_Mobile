Proportion and watch timing. How did Jesus emphasize the importance of our worship of God? (Matt. 4:10; 22:37) As to witnessing, what is the responsibility of all those dedicated? (Isa. 43:10; Rom. 10:9, 10; “Lamp,” p. 76, par. 1) Who decides the amount of time you spend in service and how? (“Lamp,” p. 72, par. 1; p. 189, par. 2) How urgent is it to spend as much time as possible in preaching? (Matt. 24:14; “Lamp,” p. 210, par. 1) While we should never neglect Scriptural obligations, why must preaching take priority over personal interests? (Matt. 6:33; 1 Cor. 7:29-31; “Lamp,” p. 187, par. 1 to p. 189, par. 1) What part does pioneer service have in getting the preaching work done before the “great tribulation,” and how is it possible for many to share in it now? (“Lamp,” pp. 194, 195) Many are infirm, have health problems, family or other obligations. Still others are not yet able to attain the regular pioneer goals. How should these view such circumstances? (w66, p. 298, par. 20 to p. 299, par. 21; w67, pp. 80-82, pars. 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11; 3/68 “Kingdom Ministry,” “Question Box,” read last par.) If unable to become a regular pioneer, what other privilege is available? (“Lamp,” p. 199; w67, p. 83, par. 12) If unable to vacation or regular pioneer now, should this prevent one from joyfully preaching and worshiping whole-souled? (w68, p. 525, pars. 17, 18; w70, p. 434, par. 8; “Lamp,” p. 207, par. 3, first two sentences) What principles are enunciated in the following scriptures as to our service and worship of God regardless of our “status” in the organization? Luke 21:1-4; 2 Cor. 8:12; 10:12. How has our discussion helped us to avoid becoming complacent, not just offering “token service,” and yet remaining balanced Christians as: (1) publishers and (2) pioneers? (“Lamp,” p. 76, par. 2; p. 77, par. 1; p. 207, par. 3, read beginning with the third sentence; 6/68 “Kingdom Ministry,” “Question Box,” last par.)

How Did We Do in December?
Thrilling indeed is it to see another new peak in publishers! Yes, December’s total of 396,410 is 1,490 more publishers than our previous peak month, October, 1970. And, how pleasurable it is to see the excellent potential for yet more publishers in the near future as reflected in Bible studies increasing in December to 298,599. This is 1,466 more than November’s report. In these thrilling times, we appreciate the importance of regularly sharing in the ministry and starting studies at every opportunity, don’t we?

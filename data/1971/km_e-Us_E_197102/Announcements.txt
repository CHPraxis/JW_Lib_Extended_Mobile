◆ If you have not already done so, order handbills for the special public talk on March 28; also Memorial invitations. Handbills now cost 50c per 1,000, and Memorial invitations cost $1.00 per 1,000. The April 15 Watchtower and the April 22 Awake! will be special issues. Have you ordered sufficient? If not, please do so now.
◆It may be desirable for overseers to arrange a meeting soon for those interested in vacation pioneering in March and April. Many arrangements can be worked out for group witnessing, etc. Applications should be sent in 30 days ahead of time, but those finding later that they can serve may send applications any time.
◆ In many places February 15 is a worldly holiday. Congregations may want to arrange field service accordingly.

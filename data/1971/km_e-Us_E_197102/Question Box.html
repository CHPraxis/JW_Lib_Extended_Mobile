<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● If one has a question or needs counsel, is there any advantage in writing to the Society, rather than telephoning or visiting the office?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There are several advantages, both to you and to the Society. By putting your inquiry in writing, not only do you have an exact record of what you wrote, if you keep a copy, but so does the Society. Experience has shown that, if matters are of importance, it is always best to put them in writing.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When you receive the Society’s letter you will have the advantage of being able to study the answer and the benefit of having something in writing for future reference. Also, the reply in writing gives you the advantage of research and consultation by the brothers in the office, which may be limited when you phone or visit.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Before phoning, visiting or writing to the Society, consider these points: Could you find the answer or counsel in the Society’s publications, thus receiving the obvious benefits of your own research? Have you sought the assistance of your congregation servant or other servants who know you and are thus able to give more <strong>personal </strong>help? (October 1965 “Kingdom Ministry,” “Question Box”; <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:1968923/31-32$p/E:1968924/1-35$p/E:1968925/">December 15, 1968, “Watchtower,” pages 760-764</a>) Rather frequently, too, some matters may be resolved locally by applying Jesus’ fine counsel at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15-17</a>. We are sure that you can see the decided advantages to you and to the Society if matters can be handled locally in these ways.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Of course, if an emergency exists or for some reason you need information or counsel immediately, please feel free to contact the Society. We are here to serve you and will gladly do what we can to help you in any time of need.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Regular orders for books and magazines should be submitted by mail. If an unexpected need arises, we suggest that you send your “Rush” order air mail special delivery or if nearby come to the Society’s factory to pick up supplies during our regular working hours.</p>

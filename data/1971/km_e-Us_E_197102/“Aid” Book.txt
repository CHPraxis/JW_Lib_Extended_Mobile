“Aid” Book
Aid to Bible Understanding (A-E) is out of stock, so the Society is unable to fill orders for it. However there are several thousand copies on hand in congregations in the United States. We suggest that overseers check with nearby congregations either to obtain copies, if they need them, or to share what supply they do have. Any left over, even as few as one or two copies, should be taken to your next circuit assembly. (But please do not return any to the Society.) Sometime during the assembly your circuit servant will announce the number of copies available. Thus, publishers who have not been able to obtain a copy from their congregation should be able to obtain one at their next circuit assembly for use in the Theocratic Ministry School during the months ahead.

CAN YOU FIND THE ANSWERS?
You cannot be expected to know all the answers. But if you know where to find them, you can grow in accurate knowledge of God’s Word. An accurate understanding of his Word of truth is essential for survival through the coming “war of the great day of God the Almighty.” The new Watch Tower Publications Index 1966-1970 will help you to find the answers you need. This Index includes over 130,000 references to scriptures explained and subjects discussed in the complete volume of the Bible reference work entitled “Aid to Bible Understanding” (A-Z), now being produced by the Watch Tower Society. It also covers all the other publications of this Society for the past five years. It will guide you to fine discussions on family life, current topics of scientific and social interest, religious news, articles on animals, and so forth. Please do not order the complete volume of Aid to Bible Understanding until notification is given that it is available, but you may now order the Watch Tower Publications Index 1966-1970. It is available for $1.

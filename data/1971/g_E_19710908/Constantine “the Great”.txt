Constantine “the Great”
● Roman emperor Constantine I, often called “the Great,” made a form of “Christianity” the state religion of the Roman Empire.
Commenting on this emperor, the book History of the Middle Ages says: “The question is much opened to doubt whether Constantine was ever more than a ‘political’ Christian. As for his private life, the execution​—not to say murder—​of his own son and his wife indicates that he was untouched by any spiritual influence in Christianity. To the end of his life he was a pagan to the pagans, a Christian of one stripe or the other to the Christians. He never broke with the tradition of the Roman religion.”​—Page 26.

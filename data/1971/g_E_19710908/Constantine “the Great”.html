<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Roman emperor Constantine I, often called “the Great,” made a form of “Christianity” the state religion of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Commenting on this emperor, the book <em>History of the Middle Ages </em>says: “The question is much opened to doubt whether Constantine was ever more than a ‘political’ Christian. As for his private life, the execution​—not to say murder—​of his own son and his wife indicates that he was untouched by any spiritual influence in Christianity. To the end of his life he was a pagan to the pagans, a Christian of one stripe or the other to the Christians. He never broke with the tradition of the Roman religion.”​—Page 26.</p>

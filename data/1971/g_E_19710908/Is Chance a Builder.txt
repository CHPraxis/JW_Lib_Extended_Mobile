Is Chance a Builder?
Was a computer ever built by chance? Did a stack of parts just happen to fall into proper position? Or was the computer a product of intelligent designing and workmanship?
One cell in your body is more complicated than a computer. How could chance build it, much less your more complex body parts?
What do the facts prove? Is man the product of an intelligent Creator or of unintelligent chance? Obtain the book Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? This pocket-size documented book of 192 pages is only 25c.

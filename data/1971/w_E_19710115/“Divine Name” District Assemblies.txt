“Divine Name” District Assemblies
READERS of The Watchtower will be pleased to know that arrangements are now well under way for a series of district assemblies to be held under the direction of the Watch Tower Society from late June through August in the northern hemisphere. Some who may be newly associated with Jehovah’s witnesses or who are just beginning to study the Bible with them have never attended any of the large assemblies held annually by Jehovah’s witnesses, but we urge you all to be on hand for one of these assemblies this summer.
Each of these “Divine Name” District Assemblies will feature a five-day program, from Wednesday through Sunday, inclusive. There will be a delightful program built around the counsel of God’s Word. You will find the discourses, demonstrations, dramas and experiences to be practical and upbuilding for every member of the family. Plan to be on hand when the program opens early Wednesday afternoon, and enjoy every session right through until the conclusion Sunday afternoon.
Unless otherwise indicated, the programs for the assemblies listed here will be in English, but, as shown, some of the assemblies will include other languages or, in certain cases, will be exclusively in another tongue.
To assist you in making arrangements to be present, the dates and cities of the assemblies are listed here. Decide now where you will attend, make definite plans to be there, and earnestly seek Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts to do so.

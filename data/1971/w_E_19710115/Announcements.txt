ENCOURAGEMENT EVERY DAY
Would you like to receive words of encouragement and be spiritually strengthened every day? Would you like to start each day with an upbuilding thought? Would you like to have something wholesome that can be discussed by your family at the breakfast table? If you would, you will enjoy the 1971 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It has an encouraging Scripture text with a brief comment for every day of the year. Considering this text and comment is a fine way to begin a day. About three hundred pages of the book is devoted to encouraging experiences had by Jehovah’s witnesses as they engaged in their Christian ministry during 1970. These are from more than two hundred lands. This fascinating and encouraging book is available in English, French, German and Spanish. A copy will be sent to you for only 50c.

The Dead Will Live Again!
Your dead relatives may turn over their own tombstones and plow under their own graves.
As fantastic as this may sound, it can happen. The time is coming when the dead will come back to life. It is foretold in the Bible at John 5:28, 29: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” Will you be there to welcome your dead loved ones?
Learn the details about the resurrection of the dead and what is required of you if you wish to be living then. You will find them in the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” This hard-covered book of 416 pages may be had for 50c.
Please send me the book “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” for which I am enclosing 50c. For ordering this book I am entitled to receive the gift booklet “Look I Am Making All Things New.”

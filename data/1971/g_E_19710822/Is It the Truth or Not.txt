Is It the Truth or Not?
●  A man in Lancashire, England, related the following incident: “I felt that Jehovah’s witnesses had something, but my wife did not share my views. One day the local Catholic priest called on us. My wife hoped that he would set me straight. I asked him why Christmas was celebrated on December 25th, when Jesus was not born on that date. He readily agreed that Jesus was born at another time. It was then brought to his attention that the Catholic catechism asks: ‘On what day was our Saviour born?’ and replies, ‘Our Saviour was born on Christmas Day,’ with the footnote explaining, ‘Christmas Day, December 25th.’ We asked the priest if this was the truth. He made no reply.”

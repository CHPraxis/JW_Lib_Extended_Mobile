<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">To remain uninformed about the significance of the things happening around you could amount to just that. You are living in a momentous time of human history that is marked by the fulfillment of Bible prophecies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You can keep awake to these significant events by reading the “Awake!” magazine regularly. It also offers sound counsel for coping with the problems of life. The average printing of each issue now exceeds 7 million copies, a growth of 2 <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2 </sub>million in four years. Send $1.50 and receive it twice a month for one year.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I would like to receive the <em>Awake! </em>magazine by mail for one year, for which I am enclosing $1.50. Also send me as a free gift the three booklets <em>When God Is King over All the Earth, Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way </em>and <em>God’s Way Is Love.</em></p>

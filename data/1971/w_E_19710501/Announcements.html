<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WHY DO YOU GROW OLD AND DIE?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you are a young person, it is not likely that you have given much thought to this question. But if you are an adult in the latter quarter of life, you most likely have. The life-span that seemed to stretch out endlessly before you when you were young now appears very limited. The closer you approach that end the slower you become physically and mentally. When you have enjoyed a lifetime of relatively good health and activity, old age with its many limitations is hard to take. Why is it that you must grow old? Why do you have to die? Is there any hope of its ever being otherwise? There are satisfying answers to these questions, and there is hope for this experience to change. You will find the answers to these questions in the pocket-size, hard-covered book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</em>. During the month of May, Jehovah’s witnesses will be presenting this book in their door-to-door ministry. It can be obtained either from the Witnesses in your community or the publishers of this magazine for only 25c.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The report for March is excellent! It was another month marked with new peaks. Outstanding was the report of 409,413 publishers! That represents 10.2 percent increase over last year’s average, and an increase of 34,535 publishers since last March. Isn’t that thrilling!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is apparent that you were busy during the month gathering together the newly interested ones for the special public talk and the Memorial because back-calls went up to a new peak of 3,338,684. That is 490,843 more than the preceding month, and it is a fine indication of the loving interest that you have in these sheeplike persons.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">And what success was had in obtaining subscriptions? It was the ‘best March’ ever, with 230,301 new subscriptions. As a result, good spiritual food will be supplied regularly to many more households.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For all these evidences of Jehovah’s blessing on the work, we join with you in giving Jehovah thanks!</p>

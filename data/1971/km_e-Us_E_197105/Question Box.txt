Question Box
‚óè When assigned rooms by the convention rooming department, what should you do if you cannot accept the assignment?
When rooming assignments are made for the convention the householder is advised of the name, address and date of arrival of the ones assigned and you are likewise advised of the name and address of the householder. Many householders purchase linens, fix up the rooms, rearrange their own families for sleeping, etc., for those coming, and they have a right to expect them to be there. If for some good reason you have to change your plans and cannot accept the assignment, then you must advise the householder as well as the convention rooming department of this. Otherwise, since Christians are true to their word, you would actually owe the householder the money for the room if you had not informed him of the change in plans in advance.
Does the same principle hold true in regard to accepting volunteer service assignments?
Yes. Christians are honest in all things, and it is only proper to advise the volunteer service department if plans have to be changed and you are unable to fulfill your assignment.

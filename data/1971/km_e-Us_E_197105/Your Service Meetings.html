<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Chairman: Report on how the congregation is doing and commend brothers for activity with magazines. Ask congregation to suggest occasions for presenting magazines: When offer is not taken, incidental witnessing, etc. Some carry them in pocket or purse and offer them when shopping, at gas station, on train or bus, to fellow employees, at school, to salesmen who call at the home, etc.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Encourage publishers always to carry magazines in the ministry and use them well. There is no objection to leaving an older magazine (just one, either “Watchtower” or “Awake!”) and a handbill where people are not home, especially if the magazine can be put under the door or through some open slot for receiving packages. Do not use mail receptacles. Extra magazines that are not current may be used in this way or given free to people who cannot afford to give a contribution. Good experiences have resulted from this.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">As you help new publishers to be regular in the ministry, each week if possible, invite them to come with you and share in magazine work.</p>

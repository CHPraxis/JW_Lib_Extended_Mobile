<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Arouse Their Thinking Ability. Talk and demonstrations. Arousing the thinking ability of people in our territory so they will take the “Evolution” book is the goal of each publisher during the month of September. The book is designed to turn the minds of thinking people from the theory of evolution to creation’s account as outlined in the Bible. September means the opening of most schools. In addition to our regular ministry why not go to colleges, especially on enrollment days, well equipped with a number of the “Evolution” books, getting permission for and arranging a display of the books outside of the school gate or entrance where students can see it? Biology teachers may be better acquainted with the book this semester because the editor of the national magazine “The American Biology Teacher” (January 1971 issue) recommended: “Teachers who wish to become more familiar with creationists’ arguments should read ‘Did Man Get Here by Evolution or Creation?’ published in 1967 by the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society and available locally from Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Students can offer it to any teacher who did not receive it previously and to new classmates also. Another avenue to follow in placing this book is the street witnessing work near schools or in the business areas. One brother reported placing 22, another 30 in approximately an hour. This shows that adults and youths alike can have their thinking ability aroused by this subject and are quick to take a publication that presents factually the case against the theory of evolution. “Kingdom Ministry,” of August and September 1970 under “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201971282/">Your Service Meetings</a>,” has some good suggestions on arousing the thinking ability of people so we can place the “Evolution” book. Demonstrate ways that would apply best to the congregation’s territory. The closing chapters of the “Evolution” book are fine for study material. From this we could switch to the “Truth” book.</p>

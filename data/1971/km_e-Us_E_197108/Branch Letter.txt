Branch Letter
Dear Fellow Publishers:
By now most of us are back home after attending the many “Divine Name” District Assemblies. They were certainly royal banquets of spiritual food​—so faith-strengthening and so timely in these “last days.”
Surprises! Surprises! There seemed to be no end to the surprises. As each day’s program unfolded there was a constant flow of new things learned and old principles emphasized. It was most refreshing to see how much of the program was devoted to helping us to improve our relationship to Jehovah personally. Many favorable comments also were heard about the fine help given to strengthen the bond of love between brothers and the their ties to the organization.
All indications point to a record breaking attendance at the these district assemblies this year. For the first twelve assemblies held in the United States and Canada there was a total attendance of 212,217. Those baptized at these assemblies, 3,734.
And now that the assemblies are practically over with, do you think the Bethel Family will have little to do? All indications around here definitely say No! For example, in late June and early July we received three new rotary presses from Germany. And in the middle of July two more of these presses started to be hauled up from the docks. Then in September we are scheduled to receive five more of these big high-speed rotary magazine presses. Each press will print between 12,000 and 13,000 magazines per hour. So in the months ahead these ten new presses will be able to add upwards of 1,000,000 more in magazines per day to the production!
We know that you too rejoice with us here at Bethel at seeing how marvelously Jehovah is blessing our efforts to publicize the Divine Name and the Kingdom of our God.
Again be assured of our warm love.

Question Box
● What should be the goal of the concluding comments presented at the service meeting?
Certainly the goal should be to stimulate our desire to share in the ministry in various ways and attend meetings during the coming week. While the “Lamp” book on page 54 mentions that field service arrangements are outlined for the days ahead, it is not necessary to go into great detail, giving many addresses or times of meetings. There might be something special on certain holidays. Furthermore, lengthy announcements often may be included in the first part of a meeting. Then the congregation servant can use the final part of the meeting for a discussion of upbuilding Scriptural thoughts.
It should not be necessary to give all the details about the forthcoming meetings. The one concluding a meeting might ask himself, What would be important or stimulating for me to hear? It is important to remind if on the next service meeting a particular magazine will be considered and everyone should bring it. It would be stimulating to give the title for the coming public meeting rather than simply saying there will be a public meeting. The one presenting the closing remarks should try to give crisp, interesting statements that do not drag. It is good to avoid reading personal postcards or letters from individuals in the congregation who may be away on vacation. If a member of the congregation is ill, visiting may be mentioned. It is beneficial for all who attend the meeting to go home with spiritual thoughts so reference can be made to the theme of the service meeting and how it applies in our lives.
If others assigned to parts in the service meeting exceed their allowed time, the brother handling concluding comments will have to cut short his part in order to observe the one-hour meeting limit.

◆ When we leave a handbill or a free magazine in the door of a person who is not at home, it shows consideration to put it out of sight of passersby. If the householder is away on a trip, papers and magazines that remain on the porch for several days may alert thieves that no one is in the house.
◆ The pioneer rate for semimonthly editions will be 75 cents; for six-month new subscriptions and the monthly editions the pioneer rate is 40 cents.

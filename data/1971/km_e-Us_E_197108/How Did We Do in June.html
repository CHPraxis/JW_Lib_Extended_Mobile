<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While many of us were preparing, traveling or attending one of the district assemblies, which started JuneÂ 30, we commendably arranged our affairs to have a good share in the ministry. Our combined effort throughout the month resulted in 738,974 Bibles and books being placed. Excellent indeed! It is interesting to note that, on the average, each special pioneer placed 21.4, regular pioneers 11.2, vacation pioneers 10.5 and publishers 1.2. Yes, people were responsive to our taking the initiative to discuss with them Bible truths and, as we make return visits, undoubtedly many will eagerly respond to our invitation to have a Bible study.</p>

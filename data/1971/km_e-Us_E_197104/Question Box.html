<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What are the qualifications for Bethel service?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">First of all, it is necessary that the individual have a deep love for Jehovah, his Word and his organization, as well as a strong desire to serve his Christian brothers around the world. Applicants agree to serve at Bethel for at least four years and work hard.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Most of the work at Bethel is best cared for by brothers, so the primary need at Bethel is for single brothers between 17 and 35 years of age. Those who apply must be dedicated and baptized for at least a year. Brothers invited to Bethel are usually chosen from applicants who are regular or special pioneers and who have received a minister’s (IV-D) draft classification, or one exempting them from call. Brothers who apply for Bethel service should be in good health and able to work hard, as there is much to be done at the Society’s headquarters and farms with the rapid expansion of Jehovah’s organization world wide.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Single sisters and married couples with no children may also apply. Individuals who do not qualify for Bethel service for one reason or another should not feel discouraged, as there is also plenty to be done in the full-time field work. Any persons between 17 and 35 years of age in good health and who like to work hard may see the circuit servant when he next visits the congregation or they may write to Office of the President, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201.​—See also “Lamp” book, pages 205-208.</p>

How Did We Do in February?
Brothers, it was excellent! We had 401,347 publishers​—our third consecutive peak month! This is truly encouraging. It shows more people are coming to love and serve Jehovah. Our hearts are glad also to see that for the third month in a row Bible studies have increased (to 318,064). And this was the best February ever for subscriptions​—187,113. It is thrilling to have a part in God’s work, isn’t it?

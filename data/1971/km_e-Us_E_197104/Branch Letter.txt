Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Since we wrote you last month, Brother Knorr has returned to Bethel from his service tour through Africa and Europe. He told us some of the heartwarming experiences that occurred along the way.
Flying between points in Africa, he had an experience that, as he put it, made him think of the angelic help we have. Obliged to lay over for a while at the airport in Cameroon, where our brothers have been severely persecuted, he was approached by a man asking, “Are you Nathan H. Knorr?” When he replied that he was, the man extended his hand, saying, “I am your brother.’ Another brother, a congregation servant, was with him. The two brothers just happened to be there at the airport, having no idea that Brother Knorr would be passing through. They were delighted to receive news from the “outside,” inasmuch as no literature had arrived for some months. A thrilling experience indeed.
Brother Knorr also reported that our brothers in Malawi now enjoy relative peace. Though there is still a ban on our work, if anyone physically molests the Witnesses, the molester is the one who is severely punished by the police.
As you know, the Kingdom activity in Spain can at last be done in a public manner. During his visit there Brother Knorr was able to speak to 14,569 in meetings in Madrid and Barcelona. The brothers in Barcelona were so happy that, after singing a song together, they burst into spontaneous applause.
On March 7 we here at Bethel saw the fiftieth class of Gilead graduate. Now over 5,000 students have completed that schooling, and the ones from this last class are on their way to nineteen lands for missionary work.
We live in grand times. May we all share fully in the work to be done, always preaching God’s kingdom with the right viewpoint.
Your brothers,

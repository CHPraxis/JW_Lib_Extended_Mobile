<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman: Outside of classroom sessions there are many opportunities for school-age witnesses to tell schoolmates God’s good news. Lunch time and walking to and from school offer fine opportunities. Often simply a matter of seizing these opportunities.

Both are shy, little fearful about being chided or ridiculed if they tell schoolmates good news. Servant turns to “1971 Yearbook” and considers experience of one who felt as they do.

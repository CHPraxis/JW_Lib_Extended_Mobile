 5 min: Introduction, text and comments.
15 min: Telling Schoolmates God’s Good News.
(2 min.) Chairman: Outside of classroom sessions there are many opportunities for school-age witnesses to tell schoolmates God’s good news. Lunch time and walking to and from school offer fine opportunities. Often simply a matter of seizing these opportunities. Seek Jehovah’s help in prayer if shy about telling good news to schoolmates.
(7 min.) Demonstration. Young brother and sister approach book study servant. Both are shy, little fearful about being chided or ridiculed if they tell schoolmates good news. Servant turns to “1971 Yearbook” and considers experience of one who felt as they do. (p. 150, par. 1) Servant asks if they have taken literature to school. By doing so, you can show classmates what you enjoy reading; schoolmates may want copies. (p. 165, par. 3) Also if students wonder about or ask questions on certain matters, show them what God says in the Bible about such. (p. 245, par. 3) Servant mentions that timeliness of special “Awake!” will interest many students. Two youths now determined to tell schoolmates God’s good news.
(6 min.) Chairman: Another way to give a witness is by good conduct. It may attract right-hearted students. (p. 270, par. 1) Discuss local experiences. Discuss and demonstrate how to offer special magazines to schoolmates.
10 min: Branch Letter. Audience discussion.
15 min: Have You Started a Study?
(2 min.) Studies on increase. If we do not have one yet, we can ask ourselves, “Do I really want one?” Have we followed the suggestion to go to Jehovah in prayer, asking for his help? Excellent suggestions have been given in the June and August 1970 issues of “Kingdom Ministry,” as well as the February and March issues of this year. Have these been reviewed at practice sessions?
(7 min.) Three publishers practice one of the suggested means of starting studies that has worked well locally. Feature either the direct or indirect approach. Mention can be made, too, of the use of the “Good News” or “Look!” booklets to start studies when subscriptions are placed.
(6 min.) Experiences of those who have started studies recently, relating method used.

Also, July 15, 1970 “Watchtower.” What scriptures show that obedience to God is required of all God’s servants? (1 Sam. 15:22; Deut. 10:12, 13; Acts 5:29) What does our obedience to God’s Word demonstrate? Is the Christian obligation to keep the commands of God a restrictive burden, or how should it be viewed? (1 John 5:2, 3; Ps. 112:1; Rom. 16:26) What results come from obedience and from disobedience? (Lev. 26:3-6; Jer. 7:23; Rom. 6:16; 2 Thess. 1:8, 9) Why should obedience be shown (a) to Jesus? (John 14:15, 21; Acts 3:12, 18, 22, 23) (b) to overseers? (Heb. 13:17) (c) by wives to husbands? (Eph. 5:22-24; Col. 3:18) (d) by children to parents? (Col. 3:20; Prov. 30:17) (e) to employers and to governments? (Col. 3:22; 1 Pet. 2:13, 14, 18) Should our obedience to humans make us disobedient to God? (Acts 5:29) What blessing is in store for those showing themselves obedient to Jehovah and to his Son? (Matt. 7:21; Heb. 5:9)
12 min: What Will We Say in May? Offer will be “Truth” book, with which we are well acquainted. Each chapter provides basis for a fresh approach. Discuss possibilities. May use same scripture presentation as during “Watchtower” campaign, perhaps highlighting Chapter 18, regarding obedience to law.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you ever asked yourself this question when you learned of your total activity for a previous month? On considering the matter carefully you likely found that you had not reported all of your activity. The assistant congregation servant faithfully recorded what had been reported, but you found yourself thinking, “I just know I spent more time in the service.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>What can be done to improve reporting? One thing is to have the overall view that we are a part of an organization and our accurate report of our individual efforts helps to make possible a complete record of congregation activity. Such a record provides encouragement to all of us, it serves as a guide in providing spiritual aid to those who need it and it assists in the orderly oversight of the preaching work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 2:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:4-44:4:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 8:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>How often we report is also important. Some wait until the end of the month and try to recall what they did. A weekly report is the answer. Do you have a place where you keep a record of your activity as soon as you return from field service? Some use a calendar or a diary. Others use the margin of the <em>Yearbook, </em>whereas some find it beneficial to carry a report slip with them. They keep it in their songbook or Bible so that after putting their name on it and recording what they have done they will have the slip handy to turn in at the Kingdom Hall when attending the meetings. In fact, many publishers head first for the report box when they come to the meetings or as soon as the meetings are over so they will not forget.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Some book study servants have been very helpful to those of us who forget to report all of our activity. They arrange to have a few slips at the book study location so that they are available to all those who need them. Then reminders are given to turn in the slips at the hall. It is important to have an accurate report, and we know that all of you want to help in this. That is why we have offered these suggestions.</p>

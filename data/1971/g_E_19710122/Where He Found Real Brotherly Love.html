<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young man in Japan belonged to a character-development group called “The New Village.” Members of this group made a point of calling one another “brother,” but this young man found much hypocrisy among them. One day a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses called on him and left him two magazines, one of which contained a report on the “Peace on Earth” Assembly. As he read this he noticed that Jehovah’s witnesses called one another “brother,” and he immediately sought out the local Kingdom Hall to find out if this was really so.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This young man’s visit to the Kingdom Hall convinced him that he had been looking in the wrong place for real brotherly love, and he obtained all the Bible literature that he could lay his hands on. A home Bible study was started with him. After three months he joined in the Christian house-to-house ministry. He continues to study hard so that he may now become a Christian “brother” among Jehovah’s Witnesses.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>.</p>

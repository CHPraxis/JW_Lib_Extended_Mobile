The Heart Muscle
● Did you know that heart muscle cells have inherent power of rhythmic contraction? The heart will beat for a while even if it is removed from the body, and pieces of muscle will beat after removal from the heart. The nerves that connect the heart to the brain modify the beat, but do not initiate it.​—Encyclopædia Britannica (1959), Vol. 15, p. 972.

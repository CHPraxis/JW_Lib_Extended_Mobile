<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Five boys, the youngest just six years of age and the oldest eleven, attempted to rob a bank in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Entering the downtown bank, one of this number of youthful bandits jumped over the counter and started to distribute cash to his accomplices. Police officers apprehended the quintet a couple of blocks away and recovered most of the money. It is little wonder that young children often attempt adult crimes in view of what they see in the movies and on television.</p>

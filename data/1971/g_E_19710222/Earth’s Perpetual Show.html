<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● During every hour the sun is causing a spectacular show somewhere on the earth. As the earth turns, half of it basks in the brilliant light of the sun while the other half is shrouded in nightly gloom. And in this process the light is always pushing back the darkness and the darkness is always creeping back.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The volume <em>The Wilderness World of John Muir </em>describes this continual phenomenon of the earth as follows: “This grand show is eternal. It is always sunrise somewhere; the dew is never all dried at once; a shower is forever falling; vapor is ever rising. Eternal sunrise, eternal sunset, eternal dawn and gloaming, on sea and continents and islands, each in its turn, as the round earth rolls.”</p>

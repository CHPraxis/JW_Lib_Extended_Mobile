Trickery or Spiritism at the Nicene Council?
◆  Sir Edward B. Tylor, in his book Primitive Culture, mentions an incident that was reported to have taken place at the Nicene Council. He states:
“Ecclesiastical history commemorates a miracle at the close of the Nicene Council. Two bishops, Chrysanthus and Mysonius, had died during its sitting, and the remaining crowd of Fathers brought the acts, signed by themselves, to the tomb, addressed the deceased bishops as if still alive, and left the document. Next day, returning, they found the two signatures added, to this effect:​—‘We Chrysanthus and Mysonius, consenting with all the Fathers in the holy first and œcumenical Nicene Synod, although translated from the body, have also signed the volume with our own hands.’”
Was this some sort of trickery or was it an act of spiritism? It is interesting to observe that Tylor refers to the incident in his chapter dealing with spiritism and the practice of spirit writing.
Whether it was spiritism or trickery, the incident is evidence of the superstitious thinking and the kind of mentality of the men involved in the sessions of this council. No wonder such ones were wide open to accepting unscriptural ideas! Yes, it gives some insight into why the Trinity teaching, which dishonors Jehovah God, was upheld and made the basic doctrine of Christendom by the men who met at this council in Nicaea.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When you pick up a newspaper or magazine, do you feel that you can believe everything that it says as being the truth? No doubt you have learned from past experience that what is said is often slanted with half-truths so as to shape your opinion in a certain way. This is very evident when the publication contains political propaganda. But not all magazines are like that. Two magazines that are dedicated to publishing the truth are <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>These magazines tell the truth even when the personal beliefs of some readers may be offended by it. In this they follow the example set by Jesus Christ, who said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>) You can receive these two frank magazines twice a month for one year for $2. As a gift with the subscriptions you will receive the following booklets on Bible subjects: <em>God’s Way Is Love, “This Good News of the Kingdom,” When God Is King over All the Earth, Saving the Human Race​—in the Kingdom Way, World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace </em>and <em>The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years</em>.</p>

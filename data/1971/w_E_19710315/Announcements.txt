“THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE”
Do you believe these words of Jesus Christ? Where do you think the truth of which he spoke can be found? Is not the Bible the logical place for it? By knowing the truth that it contains, a person can be set free from religious falsehoods that bind him to oppressive superstitions, useless rituals and burdensome observances. A book that is helping millions of persons to learn the liberating truth of God’s Word is The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. About 35 million copies in 60 languages have been printed since its release in 1968. It points out the truth of why we grow old and die, where the dead are, the hope for the dead, why God has permitted wickedness and why we can expect a righteous earth-wide government that will bring permanent peace. This hard-covered book of 192 pages has twenty-two chapters that discuss these and many other Scriptural subjects. You can have it for only 25 cents. By obtaining a copy you will be entitled to a free home Bible study course.

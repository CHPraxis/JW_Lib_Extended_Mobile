What Would Your Child Do?
● At an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses a young lad of twelve went to the Lost and Found Department and asked if they had the dollar he had lost. He was given the one turned in that morning, but, after carefully examining it, he exclaimed, “No, I don’t believe that’s my dollar. I’ll wait until after the assembly is over, and if it’s not claimed by then I’ll know it’s mine.”
What a shining example of youth today who have been trained by God’s Word in the way of righteousness! Sunday evening the unclaimed dollar was waiting for the lad when he returned.

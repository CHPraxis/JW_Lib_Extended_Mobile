He Knew Where They Would Be Welcomed
One summer in Michigan a group of persons who work in the farm harvest wanted to attend church on Sunday. They hired a bus to take them. When the group reached the church, they experienced harsh treatment from people of their own denomination. The bus driver, who was the husband of one of Jehovah’s witnesses, though not a Witness himself, observed this. He told the group that he knew a place where they would be welcomed and where they could learn about the Bible. Shortly, the bus group arrived at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses. There they were warmly welcomed and experienced spiritual refreshment.

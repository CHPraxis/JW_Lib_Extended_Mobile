<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">By “Awake!” correspondent in Mexico</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“HIT it, hit it, hit it! To the right! Lower! Now higher!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What’s happening? Why so much shouting by children and adults? Why so much excitement?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As we approach the group, we see two men from two adjacent roofs holding a cord from which an object that looks like a three-pointed star is suspended. “What is that?” we ask.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“It’s a <em>piñata,” </em>the children shout.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A number of blindfolded children have taken turns in trying to break the <em>piñata </em>with a stick. But the men have prevented it by pulling the cord to move the <em>piñata </em>away. Finally, a blindfolded boy strikes the <em>piñata </em>a tremendous blow. It breaks open, and its contents spill onto the floor. There are all kinds of fruit, pieces of sugarcane, oranges, peanuts, <em>tejocotes </em>(a sloe-like fruit), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The children scramble to see how much each one can pick up. After a few minutes nothing is left on the floor except broken pottery and scraps of crepe paper. The cones, which had given the <em>piñata </em>the appearance of a three-pointed star, are taken by the children as trophies.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Our curiosity is aroused. We want to know more about the <em>piñata. </em>What is its origin? Why is it used in Mexico and other Latin-American countries? Is there any significance to breaking it?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>Religious Connections</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The origin of <em>piñatas </em>is not definitely known. But it is believed that the famous Venetian traveler Marco Polo brought them from the Orient to his native city in Italy. Later, in Spain, their use became a part of religious celebrations. Following the Spanish conquest in the western hemisphere they were introduced in Mexico. The materials used to make <em>piñatas </em>are a clay pot, crepe paper, a little glue and cardboard to give form to the figure.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Catholic teachers employed <em>piñatas </em>in giving the Indian natives religious instruction. They were used, for instance, in connection with Lent, which is observed from Ash Wednesday until Easter Sunday. Even today they are used in some places. On the day before Easter a <em>piñata </em>figure of Judas Iscariot is broken, scattering candies that children scamper to pick up.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Piñatas </em>also came to be used in connection with Christmas. A modern writer notes: “Indians were very fond of theatrical representations in the development of rituals. The friars started to put on theatrical representations in connection with the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.” Breaking the <em>piñata </em>came to be the final part of such a theatrical representation.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">It was around the year 1587 C.E. that an Augustinian friar by the name of Diego de Doria received authorization from the Pope to hold Masses during nine days before Christmas. The tradition was taught to the natives that before the birth of Jesus, Joseph and Mary searched for nine days to find lodging. The Bible, however, does not say this. It is just a man-made tradition.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The <em>Posada </em>was the celebration introduced to teach this tradition. It enacted <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>the supposed nine-day search of Mary and Joseph. A young man and young woman were chosen to represent Joseph and Mary. It became the custom to form a group that would sing and pray as they went around pretending to look for lodging. People would gather in church for this theatrical representation.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Later, the celebration was also carried on in the homes of the people, who organized their own <em>Posada. </em>With the passing of time, clay, plaster of Paris and wooden figures of Joseph and Mary were substituted for human representations of them. It became the custom for two children to lead the procession carrying the figures of Joseph and Mary.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Families in Mexico look forward to the <em>Posada </em>on each of the nine nights before Christmas day. Children leading the procession go from room to room, being refused admittance until they come to the room where a <em>nacimiento </em>or nativity scene has been constructed with a miniature well-adorned stable. Here they are admitted and they place the figures of Joseph and Mary in the stable. It is not until the last night of the <em>Posada </em>that a figure representing the babe Jesus is placed there.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The celebration comes to its end with the breaking of the <em>piñata. </em>These <em>piñatas </em>may have many different forms​—ships, clowns, devils, three-pointed stars, rabbits, radishes, watermelons, and so forth. Nowadays the host may invite everyone into his courtyard. There blindfolded persons take turns in trying to strike the <em>piñata, </em>which may be suspended by a cord from the porch roof or a branch of a tree.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Catholic teachers have placed great significance on the use of the <em>piñata </em>in this religious celebration. They have taught that the <em>piñata </em>represents the Devil or a bad spirit. The fact that the person who tries to break the <em>piñata </em>has his eyes covered indicates that he should have blind faith that will overcome the Devil. The articles that are put in the <em>piñata </em>represent the temptations that man has during his life. And breaking the <em>piñata </em>means that he has gained eternal life.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Modern Trend</em></strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Nowadays the <em>Posada </em>in Mexico features disorder, drunkenness and criminal activity. The celebrations are used as an excuse for wild and immoral living. Persons frequently are killed, and others are robbed and injured. Police are kept extra busy during these celebrations.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">One is reminded by the <em>Posada </em>of the early mid-December Roman festival of the Saturnalia. The fact is that encyclopedias say that this pagan festival provided the model for many merrymaking customs of Christmas, of which <em>Posada </em>and the use of the <em>piñata </em>are closely linked.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Today, however, many give little thought to the religious aspects of <em>Posada </em>and the breaking of the <em>piñata. </em>All some businessmen know about it is that selling <em>piñatas </em>is profitable. They may sell for as much as sixteen dollars or so apiece, and during <em>Posada </em>celebrations their cost goes up. <em>Piñatas </em>today are also used extensively for entertainment at social occasions, such as children’s parties and birthday celebrations.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">But even though the use of the piñata is quite popular in some places, there are those who have serious misgivings about the false religious practices connected with it.</p>

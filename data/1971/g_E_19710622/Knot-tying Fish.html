<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">â—† The eel-shaped hagfish is a most unusual creature. It has three hearts, no jaws, no stomach and has teeth on its tongue. When it is disturbed it can produce a large quantity of tenacious slime. It has the unique ability of being able to loop its body into a knot and then pull itself through this knot so as to wipe off from its body slime that could block gill openings.</p>

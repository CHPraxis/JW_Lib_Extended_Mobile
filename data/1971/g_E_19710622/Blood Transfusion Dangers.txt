Blood Transfusion Dangers
The June 1970 issue of Science Digest, page 55, states the following: “Blood transfusions result in 30,000 serious cases of hepatitis and 1,500 to 3,000 deaths in the United States alone each year, according to the National Academy of Sciences​—National Research Council. Moreover, it is estimated five others develop subclinical cases of hepatitis for each full-blown disease.” The publication also noted that a study at the National Institutes of Health showed that “half of a group of 82 patients receiving commercial blood had developed hepatitis within six months after corrective heart surgery.” God’s law prohibiting the taking of any blood into one’s body is, indeed, a protection to those who obey it.​—Acts 15:20, 28, 29.

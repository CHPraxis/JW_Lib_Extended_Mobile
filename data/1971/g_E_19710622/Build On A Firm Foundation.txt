Build On A Firm Foundation
Unless you build your faith on a firm foundation it will collapse like a house built on sand. The truth of God’s inspired Word, the Bible, is the firmest foundation you can find.
How each of the sixty-six books of the Bible can benefit you and make your faith strong is clearly pointed out in “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.”
This 352-page, hard-covered book discusses the contents of each book of the Bible. It can be had for only $1.
Please send me “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” for which I am enclosing $1. For sending in this coupon I will also receive free the booklet When God Is King over All the Earth.

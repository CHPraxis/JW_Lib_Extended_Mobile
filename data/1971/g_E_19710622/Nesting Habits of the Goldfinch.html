<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Most birds begin to raise their families in springtime, but not the American goldfinch. He is an individualist, for he and his mate do not begin to build their nest until July, August or even September. Even his relatives, the sparrows, and other comparable species do not follow this procedure. Why then does Mr.Â Goldfinch put off nest building until the summer months? The answer may be tied to the fact that young goldfinches are fed largely on semidigested seeds that their parents regurgitate directly into their mouths. And in early spring the available seeds are not as plentiful.</p>

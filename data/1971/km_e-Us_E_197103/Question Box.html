<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What procedure should be followed in determining if one should be counted as a new publisher?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To determine whether one is qualified to share in the ministry as an associate of Jehovah’s witnesses, ten basic questions are presented on page 108 of the “Lamp” book as a guide. Before inviting anyone to go along with you in the field service, it would be wise to discuss these righteous requirements together. This can be done when these subjects come up in the Bible study or at other appropriate times. This is not done to pry into one’s personal life, but to have reasonable assurance that one qualifies and will not be misrepresenting Jehovah’s name or His people when serving in the public ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Upon receiving a field service report for a new publisher, the assistant congregation servant will present it to the congregation servant, who then has a personal talk with the individual. (See page 129, par. 2, of the “Lamp” book.) This provides occasion to commend him warmly for the progress made and to encourage him to utilize fully the provisions Jehovah has made. Some of these are personal study, meeting attendance and training for the ministry.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Circumstances vary, but on this occasion the overseer can discuss, to the extent thought necessary, the righteous requirements one must meet before being counted as publisher. The objective is to help the new one understand that God has certain requirements for anyone representing him as a bearer of the good news, without implying that he is doing something wrong. If properly handled, what might be considered a delicate situation will result in little or no embarrassment. This will do much to ensure that Jehovah’s Christian congregation will grow in both quality and quantity to His praise.</p>

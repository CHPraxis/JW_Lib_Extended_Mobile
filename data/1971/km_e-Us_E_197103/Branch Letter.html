<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of our blessings while serving at Bethel is to hear encouraging news during our mealtimes. Brother Henschel recently returned from serving the brothers in Madagascar, Réunion, Mauritius, Ethiopia and Lebanon, as well as being at the assemblies in Africa. He told us that the brothers in Madagascar continue to meet and study the truth, but they must limit their gatherings to small groups in their homes. Their spirits are good in spite of the problems now existing. In Réunion and Mauritius the brothers are able to assemble in Kingdom Halls, and the work goes ahead freely there. More than 900 were able to meet in various homes in Ethiopia during his visit, and the good news continues to be preached in that land. In Lebanon there are many problems common to the Middle East, but the brothers were able to reach a new peak of 1,312 publishers in December. It was possible for some brothers from Syria and Jordan to attend meetings in Lebanon. The brothers in Syria were just released from prison.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Other interesting news reported to us at Bethel came from Spain. The branch servant reported holding their first circuit assembly authorized by the Spanish government. The entire program was handled by the Spanish brothers. The peak attendance was 1,079 at Barcelona. There were 17 immersed. News reporters heard that permission was granted for the assembly so they came and gave very good reports in the national press. The government news agency broadcast the news by radio throughout Spain. Our Spanish brothers are rejoicing and look forward to holding more circuit assemblies in Spain soon.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here in the United States our work is also producing fruitage. From September through January, 101 new congregations were formed as compared with 63 during the corresponding period in the previous year. What a pleasure it is to see Jehovah giving his blessing upon the work!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We are glad to share such good news with you as we all run the race that is set before us.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

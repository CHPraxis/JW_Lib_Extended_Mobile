Announcements
◆ Literature offer: March and April: Watchtower subscription, with three booklets, for $1. May: Truth book on 25c contribution. June: New World Translation and Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for a contribution of $1.25.
◆ The Society recommends that accounts servants type or write on slips of paper the names of all subscribers shown on the subscription record sheets since January 1970. Then these slips can be given to the book study servants for distribution to the publishers. If all of these calls are made and these persons are invited to the special talk and Memorial, surely it will add much to the witness being given at this season of the year.
◆ The Bethel home and factory will be closed on Saturday, April 17, 1971, for spring cleaning. It will not be possible to take tours or to pick up or to place literature and magazine orders on that day.
◆ Regular pioneers serving since February 1, 1971, will be sent a cafeteria ticket with the March 15 pioneer letter, for use at a district assembly during this service year. Special pioneers will receive theirs in April.
◆ Starting the first weekend in May, circuit servants will be giving the public talk “Proclaiming Good News in All the Earth,” which includes the use of eighty colored slides.

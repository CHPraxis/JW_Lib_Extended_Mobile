<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">400,640 shared in January!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>A fine new peak in publishers! Just think of it: During January, though the weather was bitter cold in many places, we pushed up over the 400,000 mark in publishers for the first time. This surpassed December’s peak by 4,230. How fine it is to see that so many new ones are having a part in Jehovah’s service, imitating the example set by Jesus!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>And good results were had by those sharing in the work. You will be pleased to know that, during January, 202,470 new subscriptions were obtained​—11,228 more than last January. And 7,065,949 magazines were placed​—768,800 more than a year ago. There was good follow-up activity too. More are sharing in the Bible study work, and more who obtain the literature are showing a willingness to study. Bible studies went up from 298,599 in December to 309,996 in January. This is cause for rejoicing!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>There is such a variety of talent in Jehovah’s organization today, and we can all use our talents to advance true worship. Some of us do excellently in placing magazines, others are adept at starting studies, still others love to work business territory, and all of us want to be successful in getting subscriptions for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Each one of us can share what he has, to Jehovah’s praise.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Have you thought that you would like to spend one Sunday during March putting forth a greater effort than before to make return visits on those persons who promised to take subscriptions? This extra effort may be just what is needed to obtain <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>subscriptions. Or, perhaps, during March you could make a list of all the persons you know that you would like to see at the Kingdom Hall for the special public talk on March 28 and also for the Memorial on April 9. As you make calls on these persons to invite them to these special meetings you can further acquaint them with the truth, perhaps inviting them to subscribe for the magazines. How wonderful it would be to have outstanding attendances at both the special talk and the Memorial this year! Inviting others to these meetings is something in which all of us can share.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Have you cultivated the ability to do incidental witnessing? It is quite profitable to carry one of the small books with you in your purse or coat pocket so you have something to offer at every opportunity. Copies of the magazines likewise lend themselves nicely to this use, and you may be successful in getting a number of subscriptions in this manner. Witnessing at every opportunity has much to recommend it. For example, in Brazil a brother went to a barbershop operated by another Witness and, on entering, greeted the barber as “Brother.” A lady present exclaimed that it was strange that two brothers should look so unalike. This gave opportunity for a witness that resulted in placing the <em>Truth </em>book and making arrangements for a study. The woman is already attending meetings and witnessing. In East Germany, while brother was in a city to do some business, a young blind man approached him, asking him to lead him to the other side of the street. The brother felt pity for this young man and started to tell him about the wonderful time when all the ailments of mankind that physicians <span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span>cannot cure will be healed under the Kingdom rule of Christ. A fine witness was given and the young man is looking forward to symbolizing his dedication in the near future. By taking advantage of opportunities for incidental witnessing we share with others the good news that we all have.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Indeed, as we reflect on Paul’s words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:4-45:12:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:4-8</a>, we are thrilled with all the various talents and gifts that we are able to blend together in the Christian congregation. During the month of March, if we do what we can and share what we have, we will be enabled to run the race with endurance and to impart a blessing to those who listen to us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 12:1</a>.</p>

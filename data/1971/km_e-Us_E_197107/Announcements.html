<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">◆ The <em>Watch Tower Publications Index </em>for 1966 through 1970 will be ready early in July. Orders for it may be submitted after July 1. This is a cumulative index. It covers the Society’s publications for 1970 as well as including the entries from all the annual indexes back through 1966. Additionally, this <em>Index </em>provides a comprehensive key to the fine information contained in the complete volume of <em>Aid to Bible Understanding </em>(A-Z) being produced by the Society. In the <em>Index </em>there are over 10,000 subject entries and more than 120,000 scripture entries for the excellent material in <em>Aid to Bible Understanding. </em>You will find the Index very helpful in any research that you do with the Society’s publications. The cost is $1 for congregation publishers, 50c for pioneers. The same prices now apply to the 1930-1960 <em>Index. </em>(Please do not order <em>Aid to Bible Understanding </em>until notified that it is available.)</p>

How Did We Do in May?
Another excellent report! It is marvelous to see, after reaching the outstanding peak of 416,789 publishers in April, the fine total of 414,210 publishers reporting in May, just 2,579 less. Truly consistent and loving service!
Interest in our Bible study aids continues to be shown in the territory, too. May of last year and this year were book months. This year we placed 753,542 books, 117,951 more than last May.
And that you were interested in helping those with whom literature was placed is shown in that 339,912 studies were conducted, which is 30,899 more than we conducted last May.
So, the work continues its steady forward movement that we so much enjoy observing. Truly a grand witness was given in May as you brothers kept on showing yourselves willing to be used by Jehovah.

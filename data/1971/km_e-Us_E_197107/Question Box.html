<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What can each one of us do to keep the Kingdom Hall clean?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Kingdom Hall is the center for pure worship in the community. When it is kept clean and attractive inside and out, it can serve to represent Jehovah and his organization in a fine way. All associated with the congregation can help.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Usually the congregation servant works out a schedule for the various congregation book study groups to take turns in cleaning the hall. It is helpful if there is a list of things that need to be done each week. When your study group’s turn comes, be sure to do your part. But what about at other times?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There may be some things you can do to help each week. In some congregations younger publishers working together after each meeting pick up things on the floor and straighten the chairs. In some congregations a family group has taken on this responsibility. The result is, of course, that the appearance of the hall is always very fine.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Parents do well to teach their children to pick up things that fall on the floor, and they ought to see that their children are not responsible for writing on chairs or walls, or defacing the property in any way. Kingdom Hall cleaning can be a very enjoyable time. It offers a good opportunity for parents to train children to accept responsibility and to show appreciation for Jehovah’s place of worship.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Does the outside of your Kingdom Hall need attention? Is the shrubbery kept well and the grass cut? Be alert at all times to things needing attention. Our faithfulness in looking after the Kingdom Hall gives evidence of our love for Jehovah and our desire that his place of worship be a good witness in the community.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">(Note: As mentioned in June “Kingdom Ministry,” since all congregations will likely miss one service meeting during July because of the assemblies, we will leave it to the brothers locally to decide which service meetings should be scheduled for certain weeks.)</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING JULY 11</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">See note above. If most of the publishers will be attending an assembly this week, likely the meeting will not be held. Otherwise, transfer another meeting to this week.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>30 min: </strong>Blessings We Enjoyed at the “Divine Name” District Assembly. Congregation servant should outline this part. He should make assignments and give instructions before brothers leave for their assembly so those assigned can be prepared to report on certain days or certain parts of program. If brothers assigned know prior to their going to the assembly what is expected of them, their reports will be far more complete and interesting. They can then take appropriate notes. In fact, encourage all publishers to take notes. They can then contribute better to these discussions.</p>

All Races Can Live in Peace and Unity
It is already being done despite racial conflicts the world over.
This remarkable feat has been possible as a result of the liberating Bible truths published in The Watchtower. These truths have helped multitudes to transform their minds from the racially divisive thinking they had.
The demand for The Watchtower continues to grow at a time when many other magazines are either suspending publication or cutting down on the number printed. The circulation of The Watchtower now far exceeds that of many popular news magazines. Read it and see for yourself why it is in such demand. For only $1.50 you can receive it twice a month for a year.
I would like to receive by mail The Watchtower, for which I am enclosing $1.50. Also send me the three gift booklets World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace, Godâ€™s Way is Love and Rescuing a Great Crowd of Mankind Out of Armageddon.

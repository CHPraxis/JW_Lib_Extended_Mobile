What Your Voice Reflects
● “The timbre of your voice is the quality which makes it distinguishable from the voices of others,” wrote Beatrice Desfossés in the book Your Voice and Your Speech. “Your voice is a reflection of your inmost self . . . At the same time your voice reacts, chameleonlike, to the people with whom you associate​—your companions in work and play—​and to national and sectional influences. Your voice also varies with the state of your mind and body. Someone who knows you well can detect unerringly the condition of your health and spirits when you speak to him over the telephone. Your voice is the sum of you, tempered by conditions that affect you at the moment.”

Nagging Wives and Heart Disease
● Heart specialist Dr. Frank G. Nolan once expressed his belief that nagging wives may be responsible for a good many of the heart ailments afflicting men. “I wonder,” said the doctor, “if nagging wives are not to blame for much of the heart disease among men? After all, many more men than women die of coronary heart disease. This is something to think about seriously.”
The doctor said that he did not believe that all women caused tensions in their husbands, but he did point out “that the majority of heart ailments are caused by tension and aggravation. A nagging wife is going to cause additional tension and aggravation. I know a lot of big executives suffer from heart ailments but are these ailments due to their jobs strictly? What do we know about the home life of these men? I think wives who have husbands under pressure should give some thought to this.”
How true is the Bible’s observation on nagging wives: “Better is it to dwell in a wilderness land than with a contentious wife along with vexation”!​—Prov. 21:19.

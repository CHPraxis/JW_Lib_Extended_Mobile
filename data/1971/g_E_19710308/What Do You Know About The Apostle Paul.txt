What Do You Know About The Apostle Paul?
With whom is he here making tents? What places did he visit on his evangelizing trips? How do we know which inspired books of the Bible he wrote? What features of them make these books especially beneficial to us?
Would you like to have the answers to these questions? Would you like to know more about Paul? The book that gives the answers is “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” This hardbound book of 352 pages gives not only detailed information about the apostle Paul and his inspired writings but also information about every book in the Bible. Its pages are the size of those in this magazine. The book will be sent to you, postpaid, for only $1.
I am enclosing $1 for the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” As a free gift, I am also to receive the booklet “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”

ILLYRICUM
(Il·lyrʹi·cum).
A Roman province with varying boundaries that roughly corresponded to what is today western Yugoslavia on the Adriatic Sea. Numerous low islands lie parallel to the coast of this region, and behind the pleasant, long and narrow coastal plain rises a chain of rugged mountains. A harsh climate prevails in the dry, stony plateau constituting most of this mountain chain.
After three years of fighting, Emperor Tiberius completely subdued the Dalmatians in 9 C.E., and Dalmatia, Iapydia and Liburnia became the Roman province of Illyricum. The name of the southern portion, “Dalmatia,” eventually came to designate the entire province.
At Romans 15:19 the apostle Paul speaks of preaching in a circuit “as far as Illyricum.” Whether the original Greek is to be understood to mean that Paul actually preached in or merely up to Illyricum cannot be established with certainty.

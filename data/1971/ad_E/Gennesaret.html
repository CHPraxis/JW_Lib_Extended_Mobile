<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A small, somewhat triangular plain bordering on the NW shore of the Sea of Galilee and measuring about 1.5 by 3 miles (2.4 by 4.8 kilometers). In this region, Jesus Christ performed works of miraculous healing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:34-40:14:36" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 14:34-36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:53-41:6:56" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mark 6:53-56</a>) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, this plain was a beautiful, fruitful and well-watered region, where walnut, palm and olive trees thrived, and where figs and grapes were available for ten months out of the year.—<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book III, chap. X, par. 8.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:1-42:5:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 5:1</a>) Some scholars believe that Gennesaret is probably the Greek form for the early Hebrew name Chinnereth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:11-4:34:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 34:11</a>) Others suggest that this name may be derived from two Hebrew words meaning “princely gardens.”—See GALILEE, SEA OF.</p>

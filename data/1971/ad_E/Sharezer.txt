SHAREZER
(Shar·eʹzer) [‘protect the king’].
1. A son of Assyrian King Sennacherib. Sometime after his father’s defeat by Jehovah, Sharezer and his brother Adrammelech killed their father with the sword while he was bowing down to his idol god, after which they fled to the land of Ararat. (2 Ki. 19:7, 35-37; Isa. 37:38) Their brother Esar-haddon, Sennacherib’s successor, claims, in an inscription, to have pursued his father’s murderers.—See ESAR-HADDON.
2. The first named of two representatives of postexilic Bethel sent, about two years before the temple rebuilding was completed, to ‘soften Jehovah’s face’ and inquire about the propriety of fasting.—Zech. 7:1-3; Ezra 6:15.

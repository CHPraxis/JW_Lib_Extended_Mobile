HELI
(He’li) [Gr. form of Eli, meaning Jah is high, ascent or high-placed].
Evidently the father of Mary and maternal grandfather of Jesus Christ. (Luke 3:23) Joseph’s being called “the son of Heli” is understood to mean that he was the son-in-law of Heli. While not listing her, Luke evidently traces the natural descent of Jesus’ mother Mary from David.—Luke 3:31; see GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A powerful ruler, who, prior to the Israelite attack at Bezek, had humbled seventy pagan kings by cutting off their thumbs and great toes. A similar practice was employed at one time by the ancient Athenians, who decreed that prisoners of war should lose their thumbs. Thereafter they could row but were unfit to handle a sword or spear.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Soon after Joshua’s death the combined forces of Judah and Simeon clashed with 10,000 troops of the Canaanites and Perizzites at Bezek, causing Adoni-bezek to flee from the defeat. Upon being captured, his thumbs and great toes were also severed at which time he declared: “Just the way I have done, so God has repaid me.” He was transported to Jerusalem, where he died.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:5-7:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 1:5-7</a>.</p>

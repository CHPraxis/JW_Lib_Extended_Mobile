TRANSPORTATION
Ancient modes and vehicles of conveyance varied with the circumstances of travelers and their destination or the places to which articles were transported.
The camel’s ability to subsist on the common plants of the desert and to go without water for prolonged periods made it an ideal animal for travel in arid regions. Camels served both as mounts and for transporting merchandise from place to place. (Gen. 37:25-28; Judg. 6:3-5; 7:12; 1 Ki. 10:2) Other animals employed as mounts or beasts of burden were the ass (Josh. 15:18; Judg. 5:10; 10:4; 12:14; 1 Sam. 25:42, Isa. 30:6), the mule (1 Ki. 1:33) and the horse. (1 Ki. 4:26; Acts 23:23, 24, 31-33) Ships were used extensively. (2 Chron. 9:21; Ezek. 27:9; Jonah 1:3; Acts 20:13-15; 27:1-44) Wagons were employed to transport both goods and persons. (Gen. 46:5; Num. 7:1-9) Chariots or litters, at times richly decorated, served as a regular means of transport for royalty or men of high station. (2 Ki. 10:15; Song of Sol. 3:6-10; Acts 8:26-31) And the common people usually traveled on foot.—Luke 24:13-15; see CHARIOT; COMMUNICATION; HIGHWAY, ROAD; LITTER; SHIP; WAGON.

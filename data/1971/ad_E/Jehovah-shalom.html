<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name given to the altar that Gideon built at Ophrah W of the Jordan. After having seen Jehovah’s angel, Gideon feared that he would die. But he was assured: “Peace be yours. Do not fear. You will not die.” Out of gratitude, Gideon built the altar, evidently not for sacrifice, but as a memorial to Jehovah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:22-7:6:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 6:22-24</a>.</p>

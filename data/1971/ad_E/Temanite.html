<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A term generally understood to refer to a native of Teman in Edom. An early Edomite king, Husham, came from the “land of the Temanites,” and Eliphaz, one of Job’s three companions, was a Temanite. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:31-1:36:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 36:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:11-18:2:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Job 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:1-18:4:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:7-18:42:7" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 42:7</a>) That Eliphaz came from Teman in Edom is suggested by the understanding that the land of Uz, where Job lived, was near Edom. Some scholars, however, believe that there is a possibility that the Eliphaz named in the book of Job was, not from Teman, but from Tema, a place identified with an oasis on the Arabian Peninsula about 250 miles (402 kilometers) SE of Ezion-geber.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:19-18:6:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 6:19</a>.</p>

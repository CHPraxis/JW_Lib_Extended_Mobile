ASHNAH
(Ashʹnah) [hard, firm].
1. A town of Judah in the Shephelah mentioned among other cities, including Eshtaol and Zorah. (Josh. 15:33) A tentative identification is the village of ʽAslin, between Eshtaol and Zorah, near the edge of the Judean coastal plain.
2. A second town of Judah, listed among nine cities and evidently farther to the S than the first Ashnah. (Josh. 15:43) The identification is uncertain; a suggested site is Idhna, located about midway between Hebron and Lachish, and about five miles (8 kilometers) from Mareshah, which appears in the same list.

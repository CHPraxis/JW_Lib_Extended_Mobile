ACHSAH
(Achʹsah) [anklet, bangle].
The daughter of the Judean spy Caleb whom he offered in marriage as a prize to whoever captured the stronghold of Debir in Judah’s newly acquired territory. Caleb’s nephew Othniel (see OTHNIEL), who evidently became the first judge after Joshua (Judg. 3:9, 10), captured it and as a reward, married his cousin Achsah. When Achsah left for her new home, she requested and received from her father an additional choice gift, a section containing the Upper and Lower Gulloth. (Josh. 15:15-19; Judg. 1:12-15) Achsah may have been the mother of Hathath.—1 Chron. 4:13.

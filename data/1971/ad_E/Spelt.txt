SPELT
An inferior kind of wheat, the kernels of which are not readily separated from the chaff. Spelt was anciently cultivated in Egypt (Ex. 9:32), where, according to the Greek historian Herodotus (Book II, par. 39), it was made into bread. (See Ezekiel 4:9.) The Israelites seem to have planted it as a border around their fields to serve as a kind of fence.â€”Isa. 28:25.

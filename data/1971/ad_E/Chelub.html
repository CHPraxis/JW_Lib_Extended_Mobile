<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. Descendant of Judah; brother of Shuhah and father of Mehir. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:1-13:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:11-13:4:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11</a>) The rendering of the name as “Chelub” is based on the Masoretic text and appears in this form in <em>AV, NW</em> (1961 ed.), <em>Ro, AT</em> and other translations. However, he is called “Caleb” in <em>LXX, SY<sup>p</sup></em> and <em>Vg,</em> and, therefore, this form is found in <em>NW</em> (1955 ed.) and other translations, such as those by <em>Knox</em> and <em>Lamsa.</em></p>

BAALATH
(Baʹal·ath) [mistress].
A border town of the original territory of Dan, mentioned at Joshua 19:44, 45 as being between Gibbethon and Jehud. It is evidently the same place that Solomon later included in his rebuilding program. (2 Chron. 8:5, 6) Its identification geographically is uncertain; Josephus (Antiquities of the Jews, Book VIII, chap. VI, par. 1) refers to it along with Beth-horon as not far from Gezer, another fortified city.—1 Ki. 9:17, 18.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Behth, or, as commonly anglicized, beth [ב]. The second letter in the Hebrew alphabet. The name assigned to the letter means “house.” Later, as a number, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, it denoted two.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It has a labial sound similar to the English “b” when the <em>dagesh lene</em> (a dot placed in the middle of this Hebrew character used to harden the letter’s pronunciation, as בּ) is added. Without the dot it has a softer sound close to “v,” as in the word “vine.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Hebrew, the opening word in each of the eight verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:9-19:119:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:9-16</a> begins with this letter, in keeping with the style of the psalm.—See ALPHABET.</p>

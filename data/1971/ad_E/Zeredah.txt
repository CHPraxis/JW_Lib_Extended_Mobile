ZEREDAH
(Zerʹe·dah).
1. The hometown of Jeroboam, first king of the northern kingdom of Israel. (1 Ki. 11:26) The only indication of its location is the statement: “And there was Jeroboam the son of Nebat an Ephraimite from Zeredah.” On this basis it is generally identified with Deir Ghassaneh (in the region of Ephraim) where the nearby spring called ‘Ain Seridah appears to preserve the original form of the name. This site is about sixteen miles (26 kilometers) SW of Shechem.
2. Reference is made to Zeredah in the “District of the Jordan” in connection with the casting of copper utensils for the temple constructed by Solomon. (2 Chron. 4:17) The parallel text at 1 Kings 7:46 indicates this to be the same place as Zarethan, Zeredah perhaps being a variant spelling of the name.—See ZARETHAN.

MAOCH
(Maʹoch) [oppressed, bruised].
Father of Achish, king of the Philistine city of Gath, with whom David and his six hundred men found refuge from Saul. (1 Sam. 27:1-3) He may be the same person as the Maacah of 1 Kings 2:39, though such identification is not positive. The name Maacah is quite similar to Maoch and it is possible that Achish, who was ruling when David was outlawed, was still the Philistine king of Gath at the commencement of Solomon’s rule.

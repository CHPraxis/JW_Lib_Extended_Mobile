<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ke·liʹta) [perhaps, crippled, dwarfed one, or, adopted one].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. One of the Levites of Ezra’s day who recognized their guilt in taking foreign wives and therefore sent them away in 468-467 B.C.E. He is also called Kelaiah (meaning, perhaps, swift for Jehovah, Jehovah has dishonored, or, dwarf). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:23-15:10:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 10:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:44-15:10:44" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 44</a>) Possibly the same as Nos. 2 and 3.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A Levite who assisted Ezra in “explaining the law to the people” in 455 B.C.E.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:7-16:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 8:7, 8</a>; see No. 1.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. A Levite whose descendant, if not himself, attested by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:38-16:9:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 9:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:1-16:10:1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:10:9-16:10:10" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) If Kelita himself, rather than a descendant, was present when this agreement was made, he may have been the same as No. 1 or No. 2.</p>

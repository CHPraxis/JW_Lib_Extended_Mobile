<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the Palestinian cities allied with Canaanite King Jabin of Hazor to fight against Joshua (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:1-6:11:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 11:1, 2</a>) and summarily defeated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:12-6:11:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 11:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:23-6:12:23" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12:23</a>) Though Dor and its <span id="page463" class="pageNum" data-no="463" data-before-text="463"></span>dependent towns actually lay in Asher’s territory, these were given to the tribe of Manasseh, who proved unable to dispossess the inhabitants remaining there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 17:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:29-13:7:29" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 7:29</a>) Later the territory of Dor, overseen by one of Solomon’s sons-in-law, provided food one month out of the year for the king’s household.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:11-11:4:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The city of Dor is usually identified with el-Burj, just N of the small harbor town of et-Tanturah, hence on the long narrow coastal plain stretching along the Mediterranean Sea from Cape Carmel to the Crocodile River. This location on the coastal plain has caused some discussion as to the meaning of the frequently used phrase “the mountain ridges [from the Hebrew <em>na·phahʹ;</em> “highlands,” <em>AT,</em> “hillsides,” <em>JB;</em> “borders,” <em>AV</em>] of Dor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:2-6:11:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 11:2</a>) Some authorities believe this refers to the cliffs that line much of the coast in this region, thus associating the Hebrew <em>na·phahʹ</em> with the Arabic term <em>nafnaf,</em> meaning “cliff, precipice.” Others believe it may indicate the hilly slopes that begin two miles (3.2 kilometers) inland from Dor and culminate in the heights of Mount Carmel.</p>

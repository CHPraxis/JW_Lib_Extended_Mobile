FINGERBREADTH
The smallest linear measurement mentioned in the Bible. A fingerbreadth equaled a fourth of a handbreadth or a twenty-fourth of a cubit (c. 3⁄4 inch; c. 1.85 centimeters). At Jeremiah 52:21 the thickness of the copper used for the pillars Jachin and Boaz is given as four fingerbreadths (c. 2.9 inches; c. 7.4 centimeters).—1 Ki. 7:15, 21.

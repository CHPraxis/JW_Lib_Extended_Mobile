LAMEDH
[ך] (laʹmed).
The twelfth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, also used later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, to denote the number thirty.
Laʹmedh corresponds generally to our English “l,” which is derived from it through the Greek lamʹbda. In the Hebrew, the psalmist uses this letter at the beginning of each of the eight verses at Psalm 119:89-96.

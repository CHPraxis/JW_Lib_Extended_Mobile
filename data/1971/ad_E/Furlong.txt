The Greek word (staʹdi·on) thus translated denotes a linear measure equal to about 607 feet (185 meters) or one-eighth of a Roman mile (4,860 feet; 1,481 meters). (Rev. 14:20; 21:16) This is the approximate length of both the Attic and the Roman stadium. At 1 Corinthians 9:24 the term staʹdi·on (stadium) is rendered “race,” the length of the Greek race course being one stadium. The stadium of the Olympic course, however, was actually about 631 feet (192 meters).

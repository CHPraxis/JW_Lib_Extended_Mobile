MENUHOTH
(Me·nuʹhoth) [the resting-places].
According to the Masoretic text, apparently a Judean family descended through Shobal. (1 Chron. 2:4, 52) But some scholars prefer emending the Hebrew text to read “the Manahathites,” as in verse 54. (JB, Mo) And a Jewish commentary on Chronicles (Soncino Books of the Bible, p. 15) gives the alternate reading “who supervised half of the resting-places” and notes: “Shobal was in charge of half the caravan stations in the land of Judah.”

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A torrent valley that served as a boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:16:8-6:16:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 16:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:9-6:17:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:9</a>) Today it is usually linked with the Wadi Qanah. This small stream rises in the hill country a few miles SW of Nablus (thought to be ancient Shechem) and, as the Wadi Ishkar, flows in a southwesterly direction and then joins the Yarkon River, which empties into the Mediterranean Sea N of Tel Aviv. However, some scholars believe that in Joshua’s day the lower course of the Wadi Qanah perhaps flowed directly into the Mediterranean at a point about eight miles (13 kilometers) farther N.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 19:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:28-6:19:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 28</a>) It is generally identified with modern Qana, about seven and a half miles (12 kilometers) SE of Tyre.</p>

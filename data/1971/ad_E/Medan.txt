MEDAN
(Meʹdan) [strife, contention].
One of Abraham’s six sons by his concubine Keturah. (Gen. 25:1, 2; 1 Chron. 1:32) The Arabian tribe that descended from Medan has not been identified, and where it settled is unknown. However, “Medan” may be represented in “Badan,” a place S of Tema taken by Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III in the eighth century B.C.E., as the Arabic “m” and “b” are frequently interchanged.

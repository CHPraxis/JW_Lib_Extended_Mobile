TEHTH
or, as commonly anglicized, teth [ט]. The ninth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, used also later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, to denote the number nine. The meaning of the name is uncertain.
The sound represented by the letter corresponds to an emphatic English “t,” produced by pressing the tongue strongly against the palate. Its sound differs from that of the letter taw [ת] primarily because of its lack of aspiration after the “t” sound. In the original Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each verse of Psalm 119:65-72.

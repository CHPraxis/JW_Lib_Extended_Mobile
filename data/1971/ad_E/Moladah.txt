MOLADAH
(Mo·laʹdah) [birth, origin].
One of the cities in southern Judah allotted to Simeon. Moladah remained in the hands of this tribe at least down till David’s reign. (Josh. 15:21, 26; 19:1, 2; 1 Chron. 4:24, 28, 31) After the exile Judeans resettled the site.—Neh. 11:25, 26.
Tell el-Milh, about fourteen miles (22 kilometers) E-SE of Beer-sheba, is often presented as a possible identification for Moladah.

It is harder than quartz and is usually yellow-green, but sometimes green, yellow, blue, white, pale red or colorless. Dark-green beryl is classed as emerald, the blue-green is aquamarine and the rose variety is called morganite. Beryl is found normally in granitic rocks in the form of six-sided crystals. Individual beryl crystals weighing over twenty-five tons have been discovered.</p>

Beryl is mentioned once in the Scriptures, it being the eighth foundation of the wall of New Jerusalem.â€”<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:19-66:21:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>.</p>

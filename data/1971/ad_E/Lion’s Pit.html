<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The place of execution into which the prophet Daniel was thrown but from which he was later removed unharmed, having enjoyed angelic protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:7-27:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 6:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:12-27:6:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:16-27:6:24" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 16-24</a>) This pit had an opening that could be covered with a stone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:17-27:6:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 6:17</a>) It was evidently a sunken or underground place, for Daniel was “lifted up out of the pit.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:23-27:6:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Dan. 6.23</a>.</p>

SALEM
(Saʹlem) [peace].
An ancient city where Melchizedek was king and priest. (Gen. 14:18) The Hebrew spelling of “Salem” suggests a dual form and, therefore, the word may be defined as “twofold peace.” That the name means “peace” is confirmed by the inspired words of Hebrews 7:2.
Ancient Jewish tradition identifies Salem with Jerusalem, and Scriptural evidence supports this. Abraham met the king of Sodom and Melchizedek in the “king’s Low Plain.” As it was there that King David’s son Absalom centuries later erected a monument, this low plain must have been near Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom. (Gen. 14:17, 18; 2 Sam. 18:18) The word “Salem” is, in fact, incorporated in the name “Jerusalem,” and the psalmist used it in parallel with “Zion.” (Ps. 76:2) Also, it would have been fitting for Melchizedek to be king and priest in the very place where later the kings of the Davidic line and the Levitical priesthood served and where Jesus Christ, the one chosen to be a king and priest “according to the manner of Melchizedek,” was offered in sacrifice.—Heb. 3:1; 7:1-3, 15-17.

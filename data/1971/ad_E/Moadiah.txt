MOADIAH
(Mo·a·diʹah) [Jehovah summons, or, perhaps, assembly of Jehovah].
A priestly paternal house of which Piltai was the head in the days of Joiakim. (Neh. 12:12, 17) It has been suggested that “Moadiah” is a variation of the name “Maadiah” and that Moadiah is the same person as the priest Maadiah who accompanied Zerubbabel to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.—Neh. 12:1, 5.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A song of praise to Jehovah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:118:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 113 to 118</a> constitute what is known in Jewish writings as the “Egyptian Hallel.” According to the Mishnah, this Hallel was sung at the temple and in the synagogues on the occasion of the Passover and the festivals of Pentecost, Booths and Dedication. At the celebration of the Passover in the home, the first part of this Hallel (either <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:113:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 113</a> [according to the School of Shammai] or <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:113:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalms 113 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:1-19:114:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 114</a> [School of Hillel]) was recited after the second cup of wine had been poured and the significance of the Passover explained. The Hallel was brought to a conclusion over the fourth cup of wine.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Be·erʹoth Benʹe-jaʹa-kan) [wells of the sons of Jaakan].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place at which the Israelites camped perhaps more than once during their wanderings in the wilderness, the last time being shortly before Aaron’s death on Mount Hor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 10:6</a>) It is tentatively identified with el-Birein, about forty miles (approximately 65 kilometers) SW of Beer-sheba. There are wells here and the probable location of Kadesh-barnea is but a few miles S. Archaeologist Nelson Glueck comments that there are a “strikingly large number of antiquity sites in this district.” (<em>Rivers in the Desert,</em> p. 97) Beeroth Bene-jaakan is evidently referred to as simply Bene-jaakan at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:31-4:33:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 33:31</a>.—See BENE-JAAKAN.</p>

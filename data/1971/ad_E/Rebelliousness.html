<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Disobedience or resistance to and defiance of a superior authority. Pride, selfishness, outside pressures, disagreement with the judgment of a superior, and a desire to get out from under subjection or oppression, either real or imagined, have been among the leading causes for rebellion. In certain cases those who rebelled were not constantly rebellious persons. For example, Moses and Aaron faithfully served Jehovah God for many years. However, when subjected to the pressure of quarreling Israelites on one occasion, they lost self-control and rebelliously failed to give glory to God for a miraculous provision of water.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:12-4:20:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 20:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:24-4:20:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:13-4:27:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 27:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>EARLY HISTORY</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Rebellion against God had its start in the invisible realm. A spirit creature, who later became known as Satan the Devil, by means of a serpent, endeavored to get the first woman Eve to rebel against her Creator. He made rebellion attractive, presenting it as a course that would lead to enlightenment. Eve gave in to the selfish ambition to ‘be like God,’ in the sense of determining for herself what was good and what was bad rather than abiding by God’s judgment on this matter. (See TREES.) Imagining herself to be deprived of something that she had now come to view as rightfully belonging to her, Eve chose to transgress God’s command. Later her husband Adam yielded to her pressure and joined in this rebellion. He did so, not because he was deceived into thinking that the serpent was speaking the truth, but evidently because he selfishly chose the companionship of his sinful wife in preference to the approval of God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:14-54:2:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For centuries afterward it appears that the majority of mankind did not want to submit themselves to God. From the time of Abel’s death until the birth of Noah, a period of more than 926 years, only Enoch is specifically mentioned as one who walked with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:22-1:5:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 5:22</a>) Rebelliousness also continued to spread in the heavenly realm. In Noah’s day, angels, desiring sensual pleasure, disobediently forsook their heavenly posts, materialized human bodies, married women and fathered offspring.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:4-1:6:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:19-60:3:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:4-61:2:5" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:6" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Jude 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By Noah’s time the spirit of rebelliousness had so saturated mankind that Jehovah God saw fit to destroy the human race by means of a flood. Only Noah and his immediate family, eight persons all together, were found worthy of preservation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:5-1:6:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 6:5-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:13-1:7:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 7:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:23-1:7:23" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>IN ISRAEL</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Years later Jehovah God began to deal exclusively with the nation of Israel. Yet throughout Israel’s history there were numerous cases of rebellion against Jehovah and against his representatives, on a national, group or individual level. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:44:6-26:44:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 44:6</a> even applies the name “Rebelliousness” to the house of Israel, as if the nation of Israel came to personify rebelliousness by its disobedient course of action.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jehovah God did not leave such rebelliousness unpunished. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:15-9:12:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 12:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:23-9:15:23" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 15:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:13:21-11:13:22" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 13:21, 22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:13:26-11:13:26" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:10-19:5:10" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> Ps. 5:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:20-23:1:20" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> Isa. 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:10-23:63:10" data-bid="7-7" class="b"> 63:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:16-24:4:18" data-bid="7-8" class="b"> Jer. 4:16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:21-26:20:21" data-bid="7-9" class="b"> Ezek. 20:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:16-28:13:16" data-bid="7-10" class="b"> Hos. 13:16</a>) His law demanded the death penalty for those persisting in rebellion against parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:18-5:21:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 21:18-21</a>) Divine execution came upon proud and ambitious Korah, Dathan and Abiram and those associated with them in the rebellion against Moses and Aaron, God’s appointed representatives. When the Israelites disputed the rightness of this execution and manifested a rebellious spirit toward Moses and Aaron, fourteen thousand seven hundred more perished by a scourge from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:1-4:16:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Num. 16:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:25-4:16:50" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 25-50</a>) Often Jehovah let other nations serve as instruments to inflict punishment upon the Israelites when they yielded to the pressure to be like the surrounding nations and rebelliously abandoned true worship.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:3-7:2:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Judg. 2:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:11-7:2:16" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 11-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:4-7:3:5" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 3:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:26-16:9:27" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Neh. 9:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>King Zedekiah’s covenant-breaking rebellion</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">At the time King Nebuchadnezzar made Judean King Zedekiah a vassal king, he had Zedekiah make a covenant in Jehovah’s name. Therefore, when Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, wanting to be free from subjection to a foreign power, he also rebelled against Jehovah, in whose name he had obligated himself to be a loyal vassal king. Because of this rebellion, Jehovah decreed that Zedekiah would die as a captive in Babylon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:17-12:24:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:17-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:11-14:36:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:11-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:12-26:17:18" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Ezek. 17:12-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>AMONG CHRISTIANS</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Christians have also had to contend with rebellious persons. The apostle Paul foretold an apostasy or rebellion among professed Christians (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:3-53:2:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:3</a>) and, already in his time, apostates existed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:19-54:1:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:16-55:2:19" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 2:16-19</a>) The disciple Jude wrote about those who spoke abusively of “glorious ones” in the Christian congregation. As the destruction of such rebellious ones was certain, Jude referred to that destruction as if it had already taken place, saying: “[They] have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah!”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:8-65:1:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jude 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:11-65:1:11" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 11</a>; see APOSTASY.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Subjection to governmental authority proper</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Rather than rebelling, those desiring to gain God’s approval as Christ’s followers are called upon to be obedient to those taking the lead inside the congregation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 13:17</a>) and to government authorities outside the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:1-56:3:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Titus 3:1, 2</a>) Rebellion against secular governmental authority constitutes a rebellion against God, for these authorities exist by God’s permission and it is his will that Christians be subject to them as long as what they require does not conflict with his law.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Acts 5:29</a>.</p>

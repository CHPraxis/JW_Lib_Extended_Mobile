GESHUR
(Geshʹur) [bridge].
1. An Aramaean kingdom bordering on the Argob region of Bashan E of the Jordan River. Its northerly neighbor was Maacath. Although Israel’s early conquests extended as far as Geshur, the region itself was not taken. (Deut. 3:14; Josh. 12:1, 4, 5; 13:13) It was to Geshur, the realm of his maternal grandfather Talmai, that Absalom fled after murdering his half-brother Amnon. There he continued in banishment for three years, until brought back to Jerusalem by Joab. (2 Sam. 3:2, 3; 13:28-38; 14:23; 15:8) At a later period Geshur and Syria annexed many Israelite cities E of the Jordan.—1 Chron. 2:23.
2. Domain of the Geshurites in southern Palestine, near Philistine territory. (Josh. 13:2; 1 Sam. 27:7-11) With reference to this area the form “Geshur” is not specifically employed.

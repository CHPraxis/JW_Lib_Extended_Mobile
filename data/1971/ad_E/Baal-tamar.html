<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site near Gibeah where Israelite fighting men drew up in formation against the tribe of Benjamin in a costly battle provoked by a revolting sex crime. Some of Israel’s forces were massed at Baal-tamar, while others were placed as an ambush against the Benjamites.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:19:25-7:19:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 19:25-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:20:33-7:20:33" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 20:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The location of Baal-tamar is uncertain; some suggest Ras et-Tawil, a peak about a mile (1.6 kilometers) NE of Gibeah (modern Tell el-Ful), while others associate it with “Deborah’s palm tree,” situated between Bethel and Ramah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:5-7:4:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 4:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The repetition of “<em>bar bar</em>” conveyed the idea of stammering, babble, or unintelligible speech; hence the term “barbarian” was originally applied by the Greeks to a foreigner, particularly one speaking a different tongue. At that time it did not indicate lack of civilization, refinement or good manners, nor convey any feeling of hostile contempt. “Barbarian” simply distinguished especially non-Greeks from Greeks, much the same as “Gentile” divides off non-Jews from Jews. These non-Greeks did not object or feel insulted because they were called barbarians. Some Jewish writers, including Josephus, recognized themselves as being designated by the term; Romans called themselves barbarians until they adopted Greek culture. It is in this not unfavorable light, then, that Paul in writing to the Romans used an all-inclusive expression: “Both to Greeks and to Barbarians.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:14-45:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The principal factor separating Greeks from the “barbarian” world was their language; hence the term had special reference to those who did not speak Greek, as, for example, the inhabitants of Malta who spoke an unrelated tongue. In this instance the <em>New World Translation</em> gives meaning to <em>barʹba·roi</em> by rendering it “foreign-speaking people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:1-44:28:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 28:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:4-44:28:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Writing on the gift of tongues, Paul twice calls one speaking in an unintelligible tongue <em>barʹba·ros</em> (“foreigner”). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:11-46:14:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:11</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:11</a>.) Similarly the <em>Septuagint</em> uses <em>barʹba·ros</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:113:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 113:1</a> (114:1 in Hebrew and English versions) and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:31-26:21:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Because the Greeks felt their language and culture superior to all others, and because of indignities suffered at the hand of their enemies, “barbarian” gradually assumed its common disparaging connotation.</p>

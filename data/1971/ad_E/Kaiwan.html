<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Kaiʹwan) [literally, <em>Ki·yunʹ</em> (according to the Masoretic text), this because of being intentionally vowel-pointed to correspond with the Hebrew word <em>shiq·qutsʹ</em> (disgusting thing); same as Rephan].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently a star god, as indicated by the fact that the name “Kaiwan” is put in a parallelism with the “star of your god.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:26-30:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 5:26</a>) Evidently the Akkadian star <em>kaimanu</em> or <em>kaiwanu</em> is meant, since this occurs in Akkadidan inscriptions as the name of Saturn (a star god). In the <em>Septuagint Version</em> “Kaiwan” is rendered <em>Hrai·phanʹ,</em> presumably the Egyptian designation for Saturn, and in Stephen’s quotation, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:43-44:7:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 7:43</a>, <em>Hrom·phaʹ</em> appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text.—See ASTROLOGERS.</p>

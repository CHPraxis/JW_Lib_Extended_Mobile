OBADIAH, BOOK OF
The shortest prophetic book of the Hebrew Scriptures. Written by Obadiah (concerning whom nothing but the name is known), this book contains a proclamation of Jehovah’s judgment against Edom, presents the reason for that judgment and points forward to restoration for the “house of Jacob.” The extinction of the Edomites as a people and the restoration of the Israelites to their land confirms the accurate fulfillment of Obadiah’s prophecy.—Obad. 17, 18; see EDOM, EDOMITES.
The occasion for the prophecy was the ‘unbrotherly’ treatment that the Edomites rendered to the “sons of Judah” when the latter suffered defeat. The Edomites, through their ancestor Esau, were related to the Israelites. The Edomites rejoiced over Judah’s calamity, shared in taking spoil from the Jews, prevented them from escaping out of the land and even handed them over to the enemy. (Obad. 12-14) As evident from a comparison of Obadiah’s prophecy with the words of Jeremiah (25:15-17, 21, 27-29; 49:7-22) and Ezekiel (24:12-14; 35:1-15), this must have happened in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonian armies and would, therefore, place the book’s composition about the year 607 B.C.E.
Since many of the things foretold in Obadiah’s prophecy were also foretold in the book of Jeremiah, this made the fulfillment of Jehovah’s word regarding Edom doubly certain.—Compare Genesis 41:32.

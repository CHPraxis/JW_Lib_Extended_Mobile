Koa was probably located E of Babylonia and has been generally linked with the <em>Kutu</em> (or <em>Ku</em>), a people who resided E of the Tigris on the steppes between the upper ʼAdhaim and Diyala Rivers. The <em>Kutu</em> are frequently coupled with the <em>Sutu</em> (perhaps the Shoa of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:23-26:23:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 23:23</a>) in Assyrian inscriptions, such records showing them as fighting against Assyria.</p>

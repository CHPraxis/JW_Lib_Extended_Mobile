GIAH
(Giʹah) [burst forth (from a spring?)].
A site near “the hill of Ammah” mentioned in describing the pursuit of Abner by Joab and Abishai. (2 Sam. 2:24) The context suggests to some that Giah was NE of Gibeon in Benjamin’s territory. Certain scholars have proposed sites based on textual emendation, but Giah’s exact location remains unknown.—See AMMAH.

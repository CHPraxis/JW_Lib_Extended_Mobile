DARIC
A Persian gold coin weighing approximately .27 ounce troy (8.4 grams) and hence presently evaluated at $9.48. The obverse side of one daric, coined for two centuries from the latter part of the sixth century B.C.E. onward, depicts a king in a half kneeling position, with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left. The reverse side shows the oblong punch impression made when the coin was stamped. At 1 Chronicles 29:7 one of the figures for temple contributions during David’s reign is stated in terms of darics, although the Persian daric was unknown in David’s time. Evidently the writer of Chronicles converted the original figure into terms then current and familiar to his readers.—Ezra 8:27.

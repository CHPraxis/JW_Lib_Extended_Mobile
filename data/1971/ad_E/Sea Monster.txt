SEA MONSTER
This generally translates the Hebrew word tan·ninʹ (tan·nimʹ at Ezekiel 29:3, “sea monster”; 32:2, “marine monster,” NW). This term is rendered “big snake” (NW) when not mentioned in connection with the sea or water (Jer. 51:34), or when a reference to snakes is definitely indicated by the context. (Ex. 7:9, 12; compare Exodus 4:2, 3) Undoubtedly tan·ninʹ includes a variety of large marine animals (Gen. 1:21; Ps. 148:7), but this term is usually employed in a figurative sense. The destruction of Pharaoh and his hosts appears to be alluded to by the phrase: “You [Jehovah] broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.” (Ps. 74:13) At Isaiah 51:9, “sea monster” appears in parallel with Rahab (Egypt; compare Isaiah 30:7) and hence may denote Egypt, as is probably also the case at Isaiah 27:1 (compare Isaiah 27:12, 13), or the reference is to Pharaoh, as in Ezekiel 29:3 and 32:2. Faithful Job asked whether he himself was a “sea monster” that had to have a guard set over him.—Job 7:12; see LEVIATHAN.

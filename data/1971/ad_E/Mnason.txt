MNASON
(Mnaʹson) [possibly, reminding].
A native of Cyprus and “an early disciple.” Paul and those with him were to be entertained in Mnason’s home as the apostle returned from his missionary journey in c. 56 C.E. Some disciples from Caesarea accompanied Paul’s group on the way from Caesarea to Jerusalem, to bring them to Mnason.—Acts 21:15-17.

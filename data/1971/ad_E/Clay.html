<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A finely divided earthy material that is plastic when wet but hard when dried, particularly by fire. It is largely made up of hydrous aluminum silicates called kaolin. In the lowlands of Palestine there is an abundance of clay, and in Bible times it was used for making pottery and bricks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:4-24:18:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 18:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:6-24:18:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:14-2:1:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ex. 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:14-34:3:14" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Nah. 3:14</a>) (See POTTER.) Due to its ability to receive an impression when moist and retain the same when dry, it was useful for making clay tablets and seal impressions on documents and letters. Some have suggested that clay was used to seal the tomb of Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:66-40:27:66" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 27:66</a>) Clay was used for sealing pottery used for wine or for safe-keeping <span id="page356" class="pageNum" data-no="356" data-before-text="356"></span>of valuable records, such as the deed to Jeremiah’s property. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:14-24:32:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 32:14</a>) The preservation of the Dead Sea Scrolls was due in large measure to the clay jars in which they were found. Jesus made use of clay in healing a blind man.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:6-43:9:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 9:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:11-43:9:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:9:14-43:9:15" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The earthy nature of clay is alluded to in expressions such as ‘the clay of the streets,’ ‘man is made of clay,’ or man is ‘brought down to the clay.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:9-18:10:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:19-18:30:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 30:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:6-18:33:6" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 33:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:6-23:10:6" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Isa. 10:6</a>) Another metaphorical significance attached to the saying that man is made of clay is the fact that Jehovah is the Potter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:29:16-23:29:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 29:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:9-23:45:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 45:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:8-23:64:8" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 64:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:21-45:9:21" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Rom. 9:21</a>) Clay, even when baked hard, is not a strong material, and a mixture of iron and clay is worthless. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:33-27:2:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 2:33-35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:41-27:2:43" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 41-43,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:45-27:2:45" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 45</a>) Clay affords little or no protection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:19-18:4:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:13:12-18:13:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 13:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:25-23:41:25" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa. 41:25</a>) Being a very common commodity, its commercial value is rather insignificant.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:16-18:27:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 27:16</a>.</p>

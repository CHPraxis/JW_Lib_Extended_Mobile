<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Malʹa·chi) [my messenger].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Hebrew prophet and Bible writer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:1-39:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mal. 1:1</a>) The Scriptures furnish no information as to his ancestry and personal life. What is known about him is revealed in the book bearing his name. He is therein shown to have been a man of great zeal for the name and worship of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the name “Malachi” the final letter, “i,” is possibly an abbreviation of the divine name Jehovah. If so, it may have the same meaning as Malachijah, which is “Messenger [Angel] of Jehovah.”</p>

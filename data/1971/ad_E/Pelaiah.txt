PELAIAH
(Pe·laʹiah) [Jehovah is wonderful].
1. A Levite who assisted Ezra in reading and explaining the Law to the Israelites assembled in Jerusalem’s public square. He is probably the same Levite (unless a representative of a family by that name is meant) who attested to the covenant of faithfulness put forward shortly thereafter.—Neh. 8:1, 5-8; 9:38; 10:1, 9, 10.
2. One of the last generation of David’s descendants mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures.—1 Chron. 3:1, 5, 10, 24.

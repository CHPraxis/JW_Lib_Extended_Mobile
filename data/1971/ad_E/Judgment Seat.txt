JUDGMENT SEAT
Usually a raised outdoor platform, approached by steps, from which seated officials could address the crowds and announce their decisions. (Matt. 27:19; John 19:13; Acts 12:21; 25:6, 10, 17) What is thought by some to have been the judgment seat (called the “Bema”) at Corinth, where Paul appeared before Gallio, was built of white and blue marble. (Acts 18:1, 12, 16, 17) Alongside it were two waiting rooms with mosaic floors and marble benches.
Jehovah God has committed all judging to his Son (John 5:22, 27) and therefore all must appear before the ‘judgment seat of Christ.’ (2 Cor. 5:10) This is also rightly called the “judgment seat of God” in that Jehovah is the Originator of the arrangement and judges by means of his Son.—Rom. 14:10.

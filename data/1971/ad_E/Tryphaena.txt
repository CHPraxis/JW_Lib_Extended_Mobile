TRYPHAENA
(Try·phaeʹna) [dainty].
A Christian woman in Rome whom Paul greets in his letter and commends for her hard labor. (Rom. 16:12) Tryphaena and Tryphosa, with whom she is listed, may have been fleshly sisters, for it was not unusual for family members to have names derived from the same root word, as in this case. Both names were common among women of Caesar’s household; but the record is silent as to whether these two women belonged to that household.—Phil. 4:22.

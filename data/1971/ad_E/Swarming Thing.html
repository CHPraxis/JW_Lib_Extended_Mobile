<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The root word from which this term is drawn means to “swarm” or “teem.” The noun appears to apply to small creatures to be found in large numbers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:3-2:8:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:30-19:105:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 105:30</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:7-2:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 1:7</a>.) It first occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:20-1:1:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:20</a> with the initial appearance of living souls on the fifth creative day when the waters began to swarm with living souls. The Flood destroyed earthly ‘swarming things’ outside the ark.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:21-1:7:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 7:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The law regarding clean and unclean things shows that the term may apply to aquatic creatures (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:10-3:11:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 11:10</a>), winged creatures, including bats and insects (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:19-3:11:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 11:19-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:19-5:14:19" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:19</a>), land creatures, including rodents, lizards, chameleons (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:29-3:11:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 11:29-31</a>), and creatures traveling on their “belly” and multi-legged creatures (vss. 41-44). Many, but not all, of these were “unclean” as food under that Law.</p>

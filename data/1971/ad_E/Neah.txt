NEAH
(Neʹah) [possibly, motion or shaking].
A city mentioned in a description of Zebulun’s territorial boundaries. (Josh. 19:10, 13, 14, 16) Neah’s location is uncertain. Some link it with Tell el-Wawiyat, about six and a half miles (10.5 kilometers) N-NW of Nazareth. Others believe Neah to be the same as Neiel (Khirbet Yaʽnin?) and regard it as a city of Asher on the border of Zebulun.—Josh. 19:24, 27.

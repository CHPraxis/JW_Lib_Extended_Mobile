<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The basic terms signifying wisdom are the Hebrew <em>hhokh·mahʹ</em> (verb, <em>hha·khamʹ)</em> and the Greek <em>so·phiʹa,</em> with their related forms. Also, there are the Hebrew <em>tu·shi·yahʹ,</em> which may be rendered as “effectual working” or “practical wisdom,” and the Greek <em>phroʹni·mos</em> and <em>phroʹne·sis</em> (from <em>phren,</em> the “mind”), relating to “sensibleness,” “discretion,” or “practical wisdom.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For <em>hhokh·mahʹ</em> the <em>Commentaries on the Old Testament</em> by Keil and Delitzsch (The Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, p. 230) give the basic sense of “solidity, compactness,” and describe it as “solid knowledge of the true and the right.” The Biblical sense of wisdom, whether expressed by the Hebrew <em>hhokh·mahʹ</em> or the Greek <em>so·phiʹa,</em> lays emphasis on sound judgment, based on knowledge and understanding; the ability to use knowledge and understanding successfully to solve problems, avoid or avert dangers, attain certain goals or to counsel others in doing so. “Wisdom is proved righteous [“justified”] by all its children [or, its works].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:35-42:7:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 7:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:19-40:11:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Matt. 11:19</a>, <em>Kingdom Interlinear Translation</em>) It is the opposite of foolishness, stupidity and madness, with which it is often contrasted.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:6-5:32:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 32:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:29-20:11:29" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Prov. 11:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:6:8-21:6:8" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Eccl. 6:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Wisdom thus implies a <em>breadth</em> of knowledge, and a <em>depth</em> of understanding, these giving the soundness and clarity of judgment characteristic of wisdom. The wise man ‘treasures up knowledge,’ has a fund of it to draw upon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:14-20:10:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 10:14</a>) While “wisdom is the prime thing,” the counsel is that “with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:5-20:4:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 4:5-7</a>) Understanding (a broad term that frequently embraces discernment and insight) adds strength to wisdom, contributing greatly to discretion and foresight, also notable characteristics of wisdom. Discretion implies prudence, may be expressed in caution, self-control, moderation or restraint. The “discreet [<em>phroʹni·mos</em>] man” builds his house on a rock-mass, foreseeing the possibility of storm; the foolish man builds his on sand and suffers disaster.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 7:24-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Understanding fortifies wisdom in other ways. For example, a person may obey a certain command of God due to recognizing the rightness of such obedience, and this is wisdom on his part. But if he gets real understanding of the <em>reason</em> for that command, the good purpose it serves and the benefits accruing from it, his heart determination to continue in that wise course is greatly strengthened. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:33-20:14:33" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 14:33</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:11-20:21:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:11</a> says that “by one’s giving insight to a wise person he gets knowledge.” The wise person values insight (a facet of understanding) and is happy to get any information that will grant him a clearer view into the underlying circumstances, conditions and causes of problems. Thereby he “gets knowledge” as to what to do regarding the matter, knows what conclusions to draw, what is needed to solve the existing problem.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:9-20:9:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 9:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:25-21:7:25" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 7:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:1-21:8:1" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:28:3-26:28:3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Ezekiel 28:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>DIVINE WISDOM</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Wisdom in the absolute sense is found in Jehovah God, who is “wise alone” in this sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:27-45:16:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 16:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:12-66:7:12" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:12</a>) Knowledge is acquaintance with fact, and, being the Creator, who is “from time indefinite to time indefinite” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:1-19:90:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 90:1, 2</a>), God knows all there is to know about the universe, its composition and contents, its history till now. The physical laws, cycles, and standards upon which men rely in their research and invention, and without which they would be helpless, having nothing stable upon which to build, are all of His making. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:34-18:38:38" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 38:34-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ps. 104:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:19-20:3:19" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Prov. 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:12-24:10:13" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Jer. 10:12, 13</a>) Logically, his moral standards are even more vital for stability, sound judgment and successful human living. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4-6</a>; see JEHOVAH [A God of moral standards].) There is nothing beyond his understanding. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:13-23:40:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 40:13, 14</a>) Though he may allow things that are contrary to his righteous standards to develop and even temporarily prosper, the future ultimately rests with him and will conform precisely to his will, and the things spoken by him “will have certain success.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 55:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:9-23:46:11" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 46:9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">For all these reasons it is evident that “the fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 9:10</a>) “Who should not fear you, O King of the nations, for to you it is fitting; because among all the wise ones of the nations and among all their kingships there is in no way anyone like you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:7-24:10:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jer. 10:7</a>) “He is wise in heart and strong in power. Who can show stubbornness to him and come off uninjured?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:4-18:9:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 9:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:16-20:14:16" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Prov. 14:16</a>) In his mightiness he can intervene at will in human affairs, maneuvering rulers or eliminating them, making his prophetic revelations prove infallible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:20-27:2:23" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Dan. 2:20-23</a>) Biblical history recounts the futile efforts of powerful kings with their astute counselors to pit their wisdom against Him and the way God has triumphantly vindicated his servants who loyally proclaimed his message.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:2-23:31:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 31:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:25-23:44:28" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 44:25-28</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:12-18:12:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 12:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>“God’s wisdom in a sacred secret”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The rebellion that broke out in Eden presented a challenge to God’s wisdom. His wise means for ending that rebellion, wiping out its effects and restoring peace, harmony and right order in his universal family formed “a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things,” that is, those systems that have developed during man’s history outside Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:7-46:2:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:7</a>) Its outlines were contained in God’s dealings with, and promises to, his faithful servants during many centuries; it was foreshadowed and symbolized in the Law covenant with Israel, including its priesthood and sacrifices, and was pointed to in innumerable prophecies and visions.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Finally, after more than four thousand years, the wisdom of that sacred secret was revealed in Jesus Christ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:26-51:1:28" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Col. 1:26-28</a>), through whom God has purposed <span id="page1661" class="pageNum" data-no="1661" data-before-text="1661"></span>“an administration at the full limit of the appointed times, namely, to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:8-49:1:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Eph. 1:8-11</a>) God’s provision of the ransom for the salvation of obedient mankind and his purpose for a Kingdom government headed by his Son and able to end all wickedness were revealed. Since God’s grand purpose is founded on and centered in his Son, Christ Jesus “has become to us [Christians] wisdom from God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:30-46:1:30" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:30</a>) “Carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:3-51:2:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Col. 2:3</a>) Only through him and by faith in him, God’s “Chief Agent of life,” can salvation and life be attained. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:15-44:3:15" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> John 14:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:15</a>) There is, therefore, no true wisdom that fails to consider Jesus Christ, that does not base its judgment and decisions solidly on God’s purpose as revealed in him.—See JESUS CHRIST (His Vital Place in God’s Purpose).</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>HUMAN WISDOM—BROAD OR LIMITED, FLESHLY OR SPIRITUAL</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Wisdom is personalized in the book of Proverbs, depicted there as a woman inviting persons to receive what she has to offer. These accounts and related texts show that wisdom is indeed a blend of many things: knowledge, understanding (including insight and discernment), thinking ability, experience, diligence, shrewdness (the opposite of being gullible or naive [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Prov. 14:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:18-20:14:18" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 18</a>]), and right judgment. But since true wisdom begins with the fear of Jehovah God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:10-19:111:10" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Prov. 9:10</a>), this superior wisdom goes beyond ordinary wisdom and includes holding to high standards, manifesting uprightness, righteousness, adherence to truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:2-20:1:3" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Prov. 1:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:20-20:1:22" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 20-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:2-20:2:11" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 2:2-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:6-20:6:6" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 6:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:1-20:8:1" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:5-20:8:12" data-bid="29-6" class="b"> 5-12</a>) Not all wisdom measures up to that superior wisdom.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Human wisdom is never absolute, but is relative. Wisdom on a limited scale is attainable by man through his own efforts, though he must in any case use the intelligence with which God (who even gave the animals certain instinctive wisdom [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:35:11-18:35:11" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 35:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:24-20:30:28" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Prov. 30:24-28</a>]) initially endowed man. Man learns from observation of, and working with, the materials of God’s creation. Such wisdom may vary in type and extent. The Greek word <em>so·phiʹa</em> is often applied to skill in a certain trade or craft; to skill and sound administrative judgment in governmental and business fields; or to extensive knowledge in some particular field of human science or research. Similarly, the Hebrew <em>hhokh·mahʹ</em> and <em>hha·khamʹ</em> are used to describe the ‘skillfulness’ of sailors and ship caulkers (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:8-26:27:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:8, 9</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:23-19:107:23" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 107:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:27-19:107:27" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 27</a>) and of workers in stone and wood (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:15-13:22:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Chron. 22:15</a>), and the wisdom and skill of other craftsmen, some having great talent in a wide variety of crafts.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">All such wisdom may be had even though the possessors lack the spiritual wisdom the Scriptures particularly advocate. Nevertheless, God’s spirit may enhance some of these types of wisdom where they are useful in accomplishing his purpose. His spirit activated those constructing the tabernacle and its equipment and weaving the priestly garments, both men and women, filling them with both ‘wisdom and understanding.’ Thereby they not only understood what was desired and the means for accomplishing the work but also displayed the talent, artistry, vision and judgment necessary to design and produce superb works.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:3-2:28:3" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ex. 28:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:3-2:31:6" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 31:3-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:10-2:35:10" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 35:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:25-2:35:26" data-bid="37-4" class="b"> 25, 26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:31-2:35:31" data-bid="37-5" class="b"> 31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:35-2:35:35" data-bid="37-6" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:1-2:36:2" data-bid="37-7" class="b"> 36:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:4-2:36:4" data-bid="37-8" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:8-2:36:8" data-bid="37-9" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong><em>Ancient wise men</em></strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Men noted for their wisdom and counsel were anciently prized by kings and others, even as in modern times. Egypt, Persia, Chaldea, Edom and other nations had their bodies of “wise men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:11-2:7:11" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ex. 7:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:1:13-17:1:13" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Esther 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:7-24:10:7" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> Jer. 10:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:35-24:50:35" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> 50:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:8-31:1:8" data-bid="38-5" class="b"> Obad. 8</a>) Such bodies evidently included the priests and government officials but were not restricted to such, probably including all those ‘elders’ of the nations who were particularly known for their wisdom and who resided near the capital so as to be available for counseling.

But this human wisdom and ability did not qualify Moses for God’s purpose. After his first attempt (at the age of about forty) to bring relief to his Israelite brothers, Moses had to wait another forty years before God sent him forth, a spiritually wise man, to lead Israel out of Egypt.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:22-44:7:36" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Acts 7:22-36</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:9-5:34:9" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Not always used for good</em></strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Human wisdom can be used for good or for bad. In the latter case it definitely betrays itself as only fleshly wisdom, not spiritual, not from God. Jehonadab was “a very wise man,” but his counsel to David’s son Amnon was based on shrewd strategy and manipulation of people by deceit, bringing dubious success and disastrous consequences. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:1-10:13:31" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2 Sam. 13:1-31</a>) Absalom cunningly campaigned to unseat his royal father David (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:28-10:14:33" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2 Sam. 14:28-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:1-10:15:6" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 15:1-6</a>) and, upon occupying Jerusalem, solicited the advice of two of his father’s counselors, Ahithophel and Hushai, as to further steps to take. Ahithophel’s wise advice was consistently of such accuracy as to make it appear that it came from God. Nevertheless, he had become a traitor to God’s anointed, and Jehovah caused his wise battle plan to be rejected in favor of faithful Hushai’s plan, which skillfully played on Absalom’s vanity and human weaknesses to bring about his downfall.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Investigating the “calamitous occupation” that sin and imperfection have brought mankind, King Solomon weighed the value of the wisdom that men in general develop and attain and found it to be “a striving after wind.” The disorder, perversion and deficiencies in imperfect human society were so far beyond man’s ability to straighten out or compensate for, that those ‘getting an abundance of wisdom’ experienced increased frustration and irritation, evidently due to becoming acutely conscious of how little they could personally do to improve matters.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:13-21:1:18" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Eccl. 1:13-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:29-21:7:29" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 7:29</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:19-45:8:22" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Romans 8:19-22</a>, where the apostle shows God’s provision for ending mankind’s enslavement to corruption and subjection to futility.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Solomon also found that, while such human wisdom produced varied pleasures and proficiency that brought material wealth, it could not bring true happiness or lasting satisfaction. The wise man died along with the stupid, not knowing what would become of his possessions, and his human wisdom ceased in the grave.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Solomon does not say human wisdom is utterly without value. Compared with mere foolishness, which he also investigated, the advantage of wisdom over folly is like that of ‘light over darkness.’ For the wise man’s eyes “are in his head,” serving his intellectual powers that in turn feed the heart, whereas the stupid man’s eyes do not see with thoughtful discernment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:12-21:2:14" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Eccl. 2:12-14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:24-20:17:24" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:22-40:6:23" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:22, 23</a>.)

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><strong><em>the wisdom of God’s sacred secret</em></strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The world of mankind has developed a fund of wisdom over the centuries, much of which is taught through its schools and by other means of instruction, other types of wisdom being acquired by individuals through personal association with others or by experience. For the Christian there is need to know the right attitude to adopt toward such wisdom. In an illustration of an unrighteous steward who manipulated his master’s accounts with certain creditors so as to gain a secure future, Jesus described the steward as ‘acting with practical wisdom <em>[phroʹni·mos,</em> ‘discreetly’].’ This shrewd foresight, however, was the practical wisdom of “the sons of this system of things,” not that of “the sons of the light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:1-42:16:8" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Luke 16:1-8</a>, <em>Kingdom Interlinear Translation</em>) Earlier, Jesus praised his heavenly Father for hiding certain truths from the “wise and intellectual ones” while revealing them to his disciples, who were by comparison like “babes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:21-42:10:24" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Luke 10:21-24</a>) The scribes and Pharisees, educated at rabbinical schools, were among such wise and intellectual ones.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:54-40:13:57" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Matthew 13:54-57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:15-43:7:15" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> John 7:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">In that first century, the Greeks were especially renowned for their culture and accumulated knowledge, their schools and philosophic groups. Probably for that reason Paul paralleled ‘Greeks and Barbarians’ with ‘wise and senseless ones.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:14-45:1:14" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Rom. 1:14</a>) Paul strongly emphasized to the Christians at Corinth, Greece, that Christianity is not reliant on nor characterized by “the wisdom <em>[so·phiʹan]</em> of the world,” that is, the world of mankind alienated from God. (See WORLD [The world alienated from God].) Not that among the multiple facets of the world’s wisdom there was nothing useful or beneficial, for Paul sometimes made use of skill learned in the tentmaking trade and also quoted on occasion from literary works of worldly authors to illustrate certain points of truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:2-44:18:3" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Acts 18:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:28-44:17:29" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 17:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:12-56:1:12" data-bid="75-3" class="b"> Titus 1:12</a>) But the overall outlook, methods, standards and goals of the world—its philosophy—were not in harmony with the truth, were contrary to ‘God’s wisdom in the sacred secret.’</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">So the world in its wisdom rejected God’s provision through Christ as foolishness; its rulers, though they may have been able and judicious administrators, even “impaled the glorious Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:18-46:1:18" data-bid="76-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:7-46:2:8" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>) But God, in turn, was now proving the wisdom of the worldly-wise to be foolishness, putting their wise men to shame by using what they considered “a foolish thing of God,” as well as persons they deemed ‘foolish, weak and ignoble,’ to accomplish His invincible purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:19-46:1:28" data-bid="77-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:19-28</a>) Paul reminded the Corinthian Christians that “the wisdom of this system of things [and] that of the rulers of this system of things” would come to nothing; hence such wisdom was not part of the apostle’s spiritual message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:6-46:2:6" data-bid="78-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:13-46:2:13" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 13</a>) He warned Christians in Colossae against being ensnared by “the philosophy <em>[phi·lo·so·phiʹas,</em> literally “love of wisdom”] and empty deception according to the tradition of men.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:8-51:2:8" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Col. 2:8</a>; compare verses 20-23.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Despite its temporary benefits and successes, the world’s wisdom was doomed to produce failure. But the Christian congregation of God’s anointed had spiritual wisdom that led to “the unfathomable riches of the Christ.” Since that congregation formed part of God’s sacred secret, by his dealings with it and his purposes fulfilled in it “the greatly diversified wisdom of God” was made known or revealed “through the congregation” even to “the governments and the authorities in the heavenly places.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:8-49:3:11" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Eph. 3:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:17-49:1:18" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 1:17, 18</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:12-60:1:12" data-bid="81-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:12</a>.)

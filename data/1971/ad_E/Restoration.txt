RESTORATION
The Greek word a·po·ka·taʹsta·sis occurs only once in the Scriptures, at Acts 3:21. Peter there speaks of the “times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time,” until which times heaven must hold within itself the “Christ appointed,” Jesus.
The Authorized Version here renders a·po·ka·taʹsta·sis as “restitution.” The Greek word itself comes from a·poʹ, meaning “back” or “again,” and ka·thiʹste·mi, meaning “to set in order.” (Compare the use of the verb form, uniformly translated “restore(d)” at Matthew 12:13; Mark 3:5; Luke 6:10.) The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, edited by G. Kittel, states that the basic meaning of the term is “restitution to an earlier state” or “restoration.” (Vol. I, p. 389) It was used by Jewish historian Josephus in referring to the return of the Jews from exile. In papyrus writings it is used of the repair of certain buildings, the restoration of estates to rightful owners, and a balancing of accounts.
The text itself does not specify what the things to be restored are, hence the “all things” must be ascertained by the study of God’s message spoken through his prophets.

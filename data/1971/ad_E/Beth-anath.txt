BETH-ANATH
(Beth-aʹnath) [house of (the goddess) Anath].
One of the fortified cities assigned to the tribe of Naphtali (Josh. 19:38, 39), but from which they did not drive out the Canaanite inhabitants, reducing them instead to forced labor. (Judg. 1:33) It is tentatively identified with el-Baʽneh, about twelve miles (19 kilometers) E of Acco on the edge of a fertile valley running between upper and lower Galilee. The town is mentioned in the lists of various Egyptian rulers of the “New Kingdom” period.

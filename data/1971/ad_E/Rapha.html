<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Raʹpha) [he (God) has healed].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A son of Benjamin, called his fifth at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:1-13:8:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 8:1, 2</a>. His name is absent from the list of those who went into Egypt (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:21-1:46:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 46:21</a>), and from the listing of Benjamin’s tribal families. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:38-4:26:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 26:38-40</a>) This may indicate that, regardless of where Rapha was born, he died soon with no descendants, or else they were absorbed into a different family.</p>

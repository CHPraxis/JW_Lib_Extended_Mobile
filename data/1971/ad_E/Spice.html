In connection <span id="page1541" class="pageNum" data-no="1541" data-before-text="1541"></span>with the burial of King Asa of Judah there was an extraordinarily great funeral burning, not a cremation, however, but a burning of spices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:14-14:16:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:14</a>) Anciently spices were added to wines to increase their “headiness.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:8:2-22:8:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 8:2</a>.</p>

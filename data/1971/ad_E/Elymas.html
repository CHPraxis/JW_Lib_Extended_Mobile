<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The professional name or title of “a certain man, a sorcerer, a false prophet,” named Bar-Jesus, a Jew who lived on the island of Cyprus in the first century C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:6-44:13:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 13:6-8</a>) “Elymas” was not the Greek equivalent of his Hebrew name “Bar-Jesus,” but was, rather, a transliteration of an Arabic word, <em>‘alim,</em> meaning “magi,” “sorcerer.” It was a title originally given to Persian priests of Babylonish sorcery. So when Luke says “sorcerer . . . is the way his name is translated,” the reference is to the assumed name “Elymas,” not “Bar-Jesus.” It was not uncommon for Jews of the time to indulge in magical arts and sorcery, nor, when living in Greek society, to assume a Greek name.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:9-44:8:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 8:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:17-44:19:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:17-19</a>; see BAR-JESUS.</p>

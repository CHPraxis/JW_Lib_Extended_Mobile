<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth·phaʹge) [house of unripe figs].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of this place is believed to derive from that of the late-season figs, which, even when mature, do not give the appearance of being ripe.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Bethphage figures in the account of Jesus’ approach to Jerusalem and as the point from which he sent out his disciples to obtain the ass upon which he rode during his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Nisan 9, of the year 33 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:1-40:21:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 21:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:1-41:11:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mark 11:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:29-42:19:30" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 19:29, 30</a>) The references show it to be near Jerusalem, also near Bethany, and located on the Mount of Olives. While some consider Bethphage to have been located across the ravine to the SE of Bethany at present-day Abu-Dis, the traditional location is between Bethany and Jerusalem at Kefr et-Tur, on the SE slope of the Mount of Olives. From <span id="page225" class="pageNum" data-no="225" data-before-text="225"></span>this point it is but a short distance to the summit of the Mount of Olives, descending from which point the city of Jerusalem would be in full view.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:37-42:19:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 19:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:41-42:19:41" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 41</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Talmudic references to Bethphage indicate it to have been considered as at the limit of the sabbatical zone around the city of Jerusalem.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:12-44:1:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 1:12</a>.</p>

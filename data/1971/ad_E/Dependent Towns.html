<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[literally, “daughters”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Small towns in the neighborhood of a larger town or city. The capital or primary city of a district was the metropolis, or “mother” city, as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:1-13:18:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>: “Gath and its dependent towns” (literally, “Gath and her daughters”). Tyre is called the “daughter” of Sidon, a city evidently older than Tyre, which seems to have been originally a colony of Sidon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:23:8-23:23:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 23:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:23:12-23:23:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:19-1:10:19" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Gen. 10:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:8-6:11:8" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Josh. 11:8</a>) The towns of Judah were dependent on Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:48:11-19:48:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 48:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:8-19:97:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 97:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:51-25:3:51" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Lam. 3:51</a>) Other “mother” cities with dependent towns were Samaria and Sodom (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:53-26:16:53" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 16:53</a>), Rabbah of Ammon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:3-24:49:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 49:3</a>), Kenath (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:42-4:32:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 32:42</a>), Ekron (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:45-6:15:45" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 15:45</a>), Ashdod and Gaza (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:47-6:15:47" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 15:47</a>), Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, En-dor, Taanach and Megiddo.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Josh. 17:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The “daughter” towns either originated from or were politically, economically (and sometimes religiously) dependent on the “mother” city. In some cases the dependent towns were unwalled or less fortified, and in times of siege the inhabitants would seek safety in the “mother” city.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:5-24:4:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:14-24:8:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 8:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The ancient city of Jerusalem as the “mother” of the dependent towns of Judah is used symbolically to picture “Jerusalem above,” Jehovah’s place of safety, in which those seeking righteousness will find refuge in the “day of Jehovah against all the nations.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:26-48:4:26" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gal. 4:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:15-31:1:15" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Obad. 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:17-31:1:17" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:48:11-19:48:13" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Ps. 48:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:32-29:2:32" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> Joel 2:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Babylon the Great is pictured in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation, chapter 17</a>, as a prostitute woman and as a city, with daughters. These are organizations springing from the mother organization. Dependent on her, they will fall to destruction with her.</p>

COZBI
(Cozʹbi) [voluptuousness].
Daughter of Zur, a Midianite chieftain. At the time 24,000 Israelites died for immorality in connection with Baal of Peor, Cozbi was killed along with the Simeonite Zimri, who had brought her into his tent, by having her genital parts pierced through by Phinehas. (Num. 25:1, 6-9, 15, 18) Shortly afterward Cozbi’s father was also killed.—Num. 31:7.

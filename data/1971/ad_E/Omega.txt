OMEGA
[Ω, ω] (o·meʹga, meaning “great o”).
The twenty-fourth and last letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the long form of the letter “o.” However, the distinction between the long and the short was evidently disappearing at the time of the koi·neʹ Greek, thus making this sound close to that of oʹmi·kron.
Numerically, o·meʹga, when accented (ω΄), denotes 800, and, with the subscript (,ω), 800,000.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A reptile is a cold-blooded, vertebrate, air-breathing animal. The Hebrew verb <em>za·hhalʹ</em> means “to glide away,” “to crawl away.” From this root is drawn the word designating reptiles generally. (The same verb was used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:6-18:32:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 32:6</a> by Elihu when he spoke of ‘drawing back.’) As stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:24-5:32:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>, among the things bringing trouble upon idolatrous Israel was to be “the venom of reptiles of the dust,” evidently referring there to poisonous snakes. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:8:17-24:8:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 8:17</a>.) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:17-33:7:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 7:17</a>, the nations that are overwhelmed by God’s power are spoken of as coming out of their defensive positions like excited reptiles.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In addition to serpents, other reptiles mentioned in the Bible are the chameleon, the gecko and other lizards, and the newt, which see under their individual names.</p>

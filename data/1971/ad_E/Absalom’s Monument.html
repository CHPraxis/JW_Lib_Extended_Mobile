<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A pillar erected by Absalom in the “Low Plain of the King,” also called the “Low Plain of Shaveh,” near Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:18-10:18:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 18:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:17-1:14:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Gen. 14:17</a>) The monument was erected by him due to his having no sons to keep his name alive after his death. It thus appears that his three sons mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:27-10:14:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 14:27</a> had died when young. Absalom was not buried at the place of his monument but was left in a hollow in the forest of Ephraim.—2 Sam.18:6, 17.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is a pillar cut out of the rock in the valley of Kidron that has been called the “Tomb of Absalom,” but its architecture indicates it is from the Graeco-Roman period, perhaps of the time of Herod. So there is no basis for associating the name of Absalom with it.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ekʹron) [rooting out].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A leading Philistine city, apparently the northernmost seat of one of their five axis lords. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:3-6:13:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 13:3</a>) Its exact position is uncertain, but of the modern locations suggested, namely, ʽAqir, Qatra and Khirbet el-Muqanna, recent excavation at the latter, twelve miles (19.3 kilometers) E-NE of Ashdod, has unearthed the largest city of its period and gives it current preference as the site of Ekron.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ekron’s history is one of constantly changing domination. Joshua’s conquest did not include Ekron. It was not until later that the Judahites captured it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:2-6:13:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 13:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:18-7:1:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Judg. 1:18</a>) In the initial division of the Promised Land Ekron was on the border between Judah and Dan but within the tribe of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:1-6:15:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:11-6:15:11" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:45-6:15:46" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 45, 46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:40-6:19:43" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 19:40-43</a>) By the time the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, Ekron was back in their possession. The presence of the Ark caused “a death-dealing confusion” to break out in this city, and it was from Ekron that the Ark was finally sent back to the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:5:10-9:5:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 5:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:16-9:6:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 6:16, 17</a>) After another period under Israelite control, the Philistines apparently again had Ekron at the time David slew Goliath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:14-9:7:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 7:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:52-9:17:52" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17:52</a>) It was in the early tenth century B.C.E. that Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt claimed to have taken Ekron. Some two centuries later, according to Sennacherib’s <em>Annals,</em> Ekron’s King Padi was loyal to the Assyrians.</p>

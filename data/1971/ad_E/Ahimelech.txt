AHIMELECH
(A·himʹe·lech) [brother of the king; my brother is king].
1. Son of Ahitub and great-grandson of Eli; high priest at the tabernacle located at Nob. Because of giving aid to David, not knowing he was a fugitive from Saul, Ahimelech, eighty-four other priests of Jehovah and the men, women and children of Nob were massacred by the Edomite Doeg at Saul’s command. Abiathar was the only son of Ahimelech to escape. (1 Sam. chaps. 21, 22) David, later composing Psalm 52, recounted Doeg’s heinous act. (Psalm 52, superscription) Jesus too recalled David’s experience with Ahimelech.—Matt. 12:3, 4; Mark 2:25, 26; Luke 6:3, 4; see AHIJAH No. 3.
2. Son of Abiathar and grandson of Ahimelech, whom Doeg killed.—1 Chron. 18:16; 24:3, 6, 31.
3. A Hittite who was invited but did not accompany David when he slipped into Saul’s camp at night.—1 Sam. 26:6, 7.

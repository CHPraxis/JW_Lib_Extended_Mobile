<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An object such as a pole or pile of stones arranged in a field in such a way as to frighten away birds or other animals. Jeremiah likened the idols of the nations to “a scarecrow [Heb., <em>toʹmer</em>] of a cucumber field.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:5-24:10:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 10:5</a>) The word <em>toʹmer</em> is elsewhere rendered “palm tree.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:5-7:4:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 4:5</a>) The root verb <em>ta·marʹ,</em> from which <em>toʹmer</em> is drawn, is thought to correspond to an Arabic word meaning “to be erect”; <em>toʹmer</em> can therefore mean “palm tree.” But, as to the rendering of <em>toʹmer</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:5-24:10:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:5</a>, modern translators seem generally to agree with the suggestion of Koehler and Baumgartner, in <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> that it be rendered “scarecrow” in this text. Truly the idols of the nations amounted to no more than a scarecrow, a falsity.—<em>AT, Mo, NE</em>, 1970 ed., <em>NW, RS</em>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A calendar is an orderly system of dividing time into years, months, weeks and days. Long before man’s creation God provided the basis for such measuring of time. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:14-1:1:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:14, 15</a> tells us that one of the purposes of the “luminaries in the expanse of the heavens” is that they might serve for “seasons and for days and years.” The solar day, the solar year and the lunar month are thus natural divisions of time, governed respectively by the daily turning of the earth on its axis, by its annual orbit around the sun, and by the monthly phases of the moon in its relation to earth and sun. The division of time into weeks and the division of the day into hours, on the other hand, are arbitrary ones.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From the Bible record we know that from the first man Adam forward time has been measured in terms of years. So we read that Adam was “a hundred and thirty years” of age when he became father to Seth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:3-1:5:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Monthly divisions also came into use. By the time of the Flood we find time divided into months of thirty days, since a period of five months is shown to equal 150 days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 7:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:24-1:7:24" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:3-1:8:4" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 8:3, 4</a>) The same record also indicates that Noah divided the year into twelve months.—See YEAR.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Seven-day periods are mentioned at this time and may even have been in regular use since early in human history. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:4-1:7:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 7:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:10-1:7:10" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:10-1:8:10" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 8:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:12-1:8:12" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 12</a>) There is, however, no evidence of a divinely required weekly sabbath observance by man until God’s positive instructions to Israel following their exodus from Egypt.—See WEEK.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Various calendar systems have been developed by men in the past and a number continue in use today. Early calendars were mainly lunar calendars, that is, the months of the year were counted by complete cycles of the moon, as, for example, from one new moon to the next new moon. On the average, such lunation takes 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.78 seconds. The months were usually counted as of either 29 or 30 days, but in the Bible record the term “month” generally means 30 days.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:13-5:21:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:8-5:34:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 34:8</a>; also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:2-66:11:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 11:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A year of twelve lunar months falls nearly eleven days short of a solar year of 365 <sup>1</sup>⁄<span class="altsize">4</span> days. Since the solar year determines the return of the seasons, there was need to adjust the calendar to this solar year, and this resulted in what are called “lunisolar” or “bound solar” years; that is, years in which the months were lunar but the years were solar. This was done by the addition of a number of days each year or of an additional month during certain years to compensate for the shortness of the twelve lunar months.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>HEBREW CALENDAR</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Israelites used such a lunisolar or bound solar year calendar. This is evident from the fact that Jehovah God established the beginning of their sacred year with the month Abib in the spring and specified the celebration of certain festivals on fixed dates, festivals that were related to harvest seasons. For these dates to have coincided with the particular harvests, there had to be a calendar arrangement that would synchronize with the seasons by compensating for the difference between the lunar and solar years.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:1-2:12:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 12:1-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:15-2:23:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 23:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:4-3:23:16" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Lev. 23:4-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Bible does not indicate what method was originally used to determine when additional days or an additional or intercalary month should be inserted. It is logical, however, that either the vernal or the autumnal equinox served as a guide to indicate when the seasons were falling behind sufficiently to require calendar adjustment. (See YEAR.) Though not specifically mentioned in the Bible, a thirteenth month that was added by the Israelites to accomplish this adjustment was called, in post-captivity times, Veadar, or Adar Sheni (II).</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In written history we do not find record of a definitely fixed or standardized form of Jewish calendar until the fourth century of our Common Era (about 359 C.E.), when Hillel II specified that the leap years of thirteen months should be the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th of each nineteen years. Such a nineteen-year cycle is commonly called the Metonic cycle, after the Greek mathematician Meton (of the fifth century B.C.E.), although there is also evidence that such a cycle was perfected before him by the Babylonians. (See <em>Babylonian Chronology</em> by Parker and Dubberstein [1956 ed.], pp. 1, 3, 6.) This cycle takes into account that every nineteen <span id="page279" class="pageNum" data-no="279" data-before-text="279"></span>years the new and the full moons fall again on the same days of the solar year.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The Jewish months ran from new moon to new moon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:23-23:66:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 66:23</a>) Thus, one Hebrew word, <em>hhoʹdhesh,</em> rendered “month,” comes from a root meaning “new,” while the other principal word for month, <em>yeʹrahh,</em> means “lunation.” In later periods, fire signals were used or messengers were dispatched to advise the people of the new month’s beginning.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In the Bible the individual months are usually designated simply by numbering according to their position in the year, from the first through to the twelfth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:4:19-6:4:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Josh. 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:9:11-4:9:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Num. 9:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:10-14:15:10" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 15:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:6-24:52:6" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Jer. 52:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:38-4:33:38" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Num. 33:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:1-26:8:1" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> Ezek. 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:29-3:16:29" data-bid="9-7" class="b"> Lev. 16:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:12:32-11:12:32" data-bid="9-8" class="b"> 1 Ki. 12:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:9-15:10:9" data-bid="9-9" class="b"> Ezra 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:1-12:25:1" data-bid="9-10" class="b"> 2 Ki. 25:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:3-5:1:3" data-bid="9-11" class="b"> Deut. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:31-24:52:31" data-bid="9-12" class="b"> Jer. 52:31</a>) Only four months are named prior to the exile in Babylon, namely, <em>Abib,</em> the first month (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:4-2:13:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 13:4</a>), <em>Ziv,</em> the second (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:37-11:6:37" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:37</a>), <em>Ethanim,</em> the seventh (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:2-11:8:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:2</a>), and <em>Bul,</em> the eighth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:38-11:6:38" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:38</a>). The meanings of these names are strictly seasonal, thus giving additional proof of a lunisolar year.—See the individual months by name.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In postexilic times the names of the months used in Babylon were employed by the Israelites, and seven of these are mentioned: <em>Nisan,</em> the first month, replacing Abib (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:7-17:3:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>), <em>Sivan,</em> the third month (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:8:9-17:8:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 8:9</a>), <em>Elul,</em> the sixth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:15-16:6:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15</a>), <em>Chislev,</em> the ninth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:1-38:7:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Zech. 7:1</a>), <em>Tebeth,</em> the tenth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:16-17:2:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Esther 2:16</a>), <em>Shebat,</em> the eleventh (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:7-38:1:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Zech. 1:7</a>), and <em>Adar,</em> the twelfth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:15-15:6:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a>).</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The postexilic names of the remaining five months appear in the Jewish Talmud and other works. They are <em>Iyyar,</em> the second month; <em>Tammuz,</em> the fourth; <em>Ab,</em> the fifth; <em>Tishri,</em> the seventh; and the eighth month was called <em>Heshvan.</em> The thirteenth month, which was intercalated periodically, was named <em>Veadar,</em> that is, the additional Adar, or Adar Sheni, the second Adar.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Eventually the length of most of the months was fixed as having a specific number of days. Abib, Sivan, Ab, Ethanim (Tishri) and Shebat regularly had thirty days each; Ziv (Iyyar), Tammuz, Elul and Tebeth regularly had twenty-nine days each. Bul (Heshvan), Chislev and Adar, however, could have either twenty-nine or thirty days. The variations in these latter months served to make necessary adjustments with the lunar calendar, but also were used to prevent certain festivals from occurring on days viewed as “prohibited” by later Jewish religious leaders.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Whereas the sacred year began in the spring with the month Abib (or Nisan) by God’s decree at the time of the exodus (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:2-2:12:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex. 12:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:4-2:13:4" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13:4</a>), the Bible record indicates that prior to this the Jews had counted the year as running from fall to fall. God gave recognition to this arrangement so that, in effect, there was a dual system of a sacred and a secular or agricultural calendar used by his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:16-2:23:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ex. 23:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:22-2:34:22" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 34:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:34-3:23:34" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Lev. 23:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:13-5:16:13" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> Deut. 16:13</a>) In postexilic times, Tishri 1, in the last half of the year, marked the beginning of the secular year, and the Jewish New Year, or Rosh Hashanah (Hebrew, “head of the year”) is still celebrated on that date.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In 1908 the only approximation of an ancient written Hebrew calendar was found at the site of Gezer, and it is believed to be from the tenth century <span id="page280" class="pageNum" data-no="280" data-before-text="280"></span>B.C.E. It is an agricultural calendar and describes agricultural activity beginning with the autumn. In brief, it describes two months each of storage, sowing and spring growth, followed by one month each of pulling flax, barley harvest and a general harvest, then two months of pruning the vines and, finally, one month of summer fruit.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:5-3:26:5" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Lev. 26:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The chart set out following this article shows the months in their relation to both the sacred and secular calendars and also their approximate correspondence to the months of our present calendar.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The frequent references in the Gospel accounts and the book of Acts to the various festival seasons show that the Jewish calendar continued to be observed by the Jews during the time of Jesus and the apostles. These festival seasons serve as a guide to measuring the relative time of the Biblical events of that day.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:2-40:26:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 26:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:1-41:14:1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Mark 14:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:1-42:22:1" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Luke 22:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:13-43:2:13" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> John 2:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:23-43:2:23" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:1-43:5:1" data-bid="24-6" class="b"> 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:4-43:6:4" data-bid="24-7" class="b"> 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:2-43:7:2" data-bid="24-8" class="b"> 7:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:37-43:7:37" data-bid="24-9" class="b"> 37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:22-43:10:22" data-bid="24-10" class="b"> 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:55-43:11:55" data-bid="24-11" class="b"> 11:55;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:1" data-bid="24-12" class="b"> Acts 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:3-44:12:4" data-bid="24-13" class="b"> 12:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:6-44:20:6" data-bid="24-14" class="b"> 20:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:16-44:20:16" data-bid="24-15" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:9-44:27:9" data-bid="24-16" class="b"> 27:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">It should be noted that Christians, under the new covenant, are not governed by any sacred or religious calendar specifying certain holy days or festivals, a point that is clearly stated by the apostle Paul at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:9-48:4:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Galatians 4:9-11 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:16-51:2:17" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Colossians 2:16, 17</a>. The one event that they are required to observe annually is the Lord’s evening meal, at Passover time and so governed by the lunar calendar.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:2-40:26:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 26:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:29" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 26-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:23-46:11:26" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:23-26</a>; see LORD’S EVENING MEAL.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>JULIAN AND GREGORIAN</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In the year 46 B.C.E., the 708th year from the traditional date of the founding of the city of Rome, Julius Caesar issued a decree changing the Roman calendar from a lunar to a solar year. This Julian calendar, based on the calculations of the Greek astronomer Sosigenes, had twelve months of arbitrary length and a regular year of 365 days beginning on January 1. It also brought in the use of leap years by the addition of an extra day every four years, to compensate for the extra fraction of a day in the length of the tropical year, which has a little less than 365 <sup>1</sup>⁄<span class="altsize">4</span> days.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The Julian calendar year was actually a little more than eleven minutes and fourteen seconds longer than the true solar year. Thus, by the sixteenth century a discrepancy of ten full days had accumulated. In 1582 C.E., Pope Gregory XIII introduced a slight revision of the Julian calendar, whereby the leap years every four years were retained but with the exception that only those century years with a number divisible by 400 were to be counted as leap years. By papal bull on March 1, 1582, ten days were to be omitted in that year, so that the day after October 4 became October 15. This Gregorian calendar is now in general use in most parts of the world. It is the basis for the historical dates used throughout this publication.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>OTHER CALENDARS</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In a number of countries today the Muslim people continue to use a religious calendar based solely on the lunar cycles and with no intercalary month to adjust the year to the true solar year. This results in a steady retrogression of all the seasons during a cycle of about every thirty-two and a half years.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">In the western hemisphere an ancient calendar was developed centuries before our Common Era and used by both the Mayan and Aztec Indians of Mexico and Central America. It was an astronomical calendar and, as regards the length of the solar year, was slightly more accurate than the present Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Whereas Christians today customarily use the calendar in effect in their particular land, they are aware that the God of eternity, Jehovah, has his own calendar of events not governed by human systems of reckoning. As his prophet Daniel wrote: “He is changing times and seasons, removing kings and setting up kings, giving wisdom to the wise ones and knowledge to those knowing discernment. He is revealing the deep things and the concealed things, knowing what is in the darkness; and with him the light does dwell.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:21-27:2:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Dan. 2:21, 22</a>) So, in his position as Universal Sovereign he stands far above our spinning Earth, with its day and night, its lunar cycles and its solar year. However, in his Word, the Bible, he does helpfully relate his actions and purposes to such measurements of time, thereby allowing his creatures on earth to learn where they stand in relation to God’s grand calendar of events.—See CHRONOLOGY.</p>

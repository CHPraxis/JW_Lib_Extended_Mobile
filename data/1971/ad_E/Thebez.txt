THEBEZ
(Theʹbez) [possibly, brightness or splendor].
A city having a strong tower. When Abimelech had taken Thebez and was attempting to assault the tower where the populace had sought refuge, a woman pitched an upper millstone upon him from atop the wall. His skull shattered by the blow, Abimelech had his attendant put him to death so that no one could say, “It was a woman that killed him.”—Judg. 9:50-54; 2 Sam. 11:21.
Thebez is usually connected with modern Tubas, about ten miles (c. 16 kilometers) NE of Shechem.

MASKIL
(Masʹkil) [Heb., mas·kilʹ].
This word appears in the superscriptions of thirteen psalms. (32, 42, 44, 45, 52, 53, 54, 55, 74, 78, 88, 89, 142) The term is of uncertain meaning. It appears a number of times in the Hebrew text, and is there translated “prudently,” “with discretion,” “with consideration,” “having insight,” and so forth.—1 Sam. 18:14, 15; Ps. 41:1; 53:2.

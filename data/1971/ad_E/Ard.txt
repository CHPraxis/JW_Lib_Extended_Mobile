ARD
(Ard) [perhaps, humpbacked].
One of the ‘seventy souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt.’ (Gen. 46:21, 27) In the Genesis account he is called a son of Benjamin, but in view of Numbers 26:40 it seems likely that the meaning here is “grandson.” If this is the case, then he is also probably the same as Addar in 1 Chronicles 8:3.

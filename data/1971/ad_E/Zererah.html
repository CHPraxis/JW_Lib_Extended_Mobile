<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Zerʹe·rah).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The flight of the defeated Midianites, as they were pursued by Gideon’s forces, is described as continuing “as far as Beth-shittah, on to Zererah, as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:22-7:7:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 7:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Twenty Hebrew manuscripts here read “Zeredah” rather than Zererah. Since Zeredah and Zarethan are used in a parallel sense at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:4:17-14:4:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 4:17 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:46-11:7:46" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 7:46</a>, some suggest the location of Zererah to be the same as that of Zarethan.—See ZARETHAN.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Such location, however, would seem to be possible only if the expression “on to Zererah” were to be taken in the sense of ‘in the direction of Zererah,’ inasmuch as the location of Zarethan seems to have been considerably S of Abel-meholah. Otherwise, Zererah would necessarily be viewed as lying between Beth-shittah and Abel-meholah; in such case its precise location is unknown.</p>

ARBA
(Arʹba) [four or fourfold].
He is called the “father” or “great man” of the Anakim and appears to have been the founder of Kiriath-arba (city of Arba or fourfold city), later called Hebron. (Josh. 14:15; 15:13; 21:11) Some consider “Anak” as a name applying to the giant race descended from Arba rather than as the personal name of Arba’s son and thus view Arba as the actual progenitor of the Anakim.—See ANAK; ANAKIM.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Goiʹim) [nations].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. The realm of King Tidal, an ally of the Elamite king Chedorlaomer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 14:1-9</a>) No identification of Goiim is known, though places such as Gutium in Kurdistan have been suggested. In view of the meaning of the term and its translation in other texts (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:2-7:4:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 4:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:1-23:9:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isa. 9:1</a>) as a common noun (“nations”) rather than a proper name, some suggest that Goiim was a collection of tribes with varied national backgrounds.—See TIDAL.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. The domain of a Canaanite king defeated by Joshua. He is spoken of as “the king of Goiim in Gilgal.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:7-6:12:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 12:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:23-6:12:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 23</a>) Nothing is known of this Goiim except that Gilgal, possibly its seat or center, is not the well-known Israelite campsite of the same name near the Jordan, but perhaps the modern-day village of Jiljulieh, some twelve miles (19 kilometers) NE of Tel Aviv.—See GILGAL No. 3.</p>

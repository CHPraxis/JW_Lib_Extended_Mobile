OZNI
(Ozʹni) [my hearing, or, my ear].
A son of Gad and founder of the tribal family of Oznites numbered in the second wilderness registration of Israel. (Num. 26:15, 16) Ozni is called Ezbon in the first list of Gad’s sons, some of whose names are written somewhat differently in Numbers.—Gen. 46:16.

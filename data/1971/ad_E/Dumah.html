<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Duʹmah) [silence].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. The sixth in the list of Ishmael’s twelve sons. By the marriage of his sister Mahalath, Dumah became the brother-in-law to his half-cousin Esau. Dumah also became a chieftain and head of a clan or nation, in fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise to Abraham.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:20-1:17:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 17:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:14-1:25:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:9-1:28:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 28:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:30-13:1:30" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Ishmaelite Dumah evidently gave his name to a region in N Arabia about midway between Palestine and S Babylonia. The name continues in that of the oasis Dumat al-Ghandal. Ancient inscriptions from Assyria and Babylon give the name as <em>Adummatu</em> and <em>Adummu</em> and show it to have been conquered by Sennacherib and Esar-haddon of Assyria and later by the Babylonian Nabonidus.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. A city listed among those assigned to the tribe of Judah after the conquest of the land by Joshua. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:52-6:15:52" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 15:52</a>) It was in the mountainous region and is evidently identified with modern ed-Domeh, about ten miles (16 kilometers) SW of Hebron.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">3. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:11-23:21:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:11</a> a pronouncement is made against “Dumah.” However, mention is immediately made of “Seir,” and this may indicate that the message is directed against Edom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:3-1:32:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 32:3</a>) The <em>Septuagint Version</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:11-23:21:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:11</a> says “Idumaea” (Edom) rather than “Dumah.”</p>

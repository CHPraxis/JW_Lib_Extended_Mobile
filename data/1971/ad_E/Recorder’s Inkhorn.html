This recorder’s or secretary’s inkhorn may have been similar to those used at one time in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian ‘scribe kit’ was a long, narrow case made out of wood and having a compartment or slots for reed pens. On the outer face, near the top, it had at least one recess for a small cake of dried ink. The scribe could prepare to write by applying the moistened end of his pen to the ink. Inscriptions show that Syrian scribes used a similar ‘scribal kit’.</p>

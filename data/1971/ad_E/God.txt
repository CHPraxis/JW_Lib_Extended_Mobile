GOD
[Heb., ʼEl, “Mighty One,” “God”; ʼEloʹah, “God”; ʼelo·himʹ (plural), “gods” or “God” with reference to the plurality of excellence; ha-ʼEl, “the [true] God”; Aram., ʼElahʹ, “God”; Gr., The·osʹ, “God”].
Anything that is worshiped can be termed a god, inasmuch as the worshiper attributes to it might greater than his own and venerates it. One can even let his appetite be a god, governing him. (Rom. 16:18; Phil. 3:18, 19) The Bible makes mention of many gods. (Ps. 86:8; 1 Cor. 8:5, 6) The psalmist said that the gods of the nations are valueless gods. (Ps. 96:5) And the apostle Paul points out that the things the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God.—1 Cor. 10:20; see GODS AND GODDESSES.
THE TRUE GOD JEHOVAH
The true God is not a nameless God. His name is Jehovah. (Deut. 6:4; Ps. 83:18) He is God by reason of his creatorship. (Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11) The true God is real (John 7:28), a person (Acts 3:19; Heb. 9:24), and not natural law operating without a living lawgiver, not blind force working through a series of accidents to develop one thing or another. The Encyclopedia Americana (1956 ed.), Volume 12, page 743, comments under the heading “God”: “In the Christian, Mohammedan, and Jewish sense, the Supreme Being, the First Cause, and in a general sense, as considered nowadays throughout the civilized world, a spiritual being, self-existent, eternal and absolutely free and all-powerful, distinct from the matter which he has created in many forms, and which he conserves and controls. There does not seem to have been a period of history where mankind was without belief in a supernatural author and governor of the universe. The most savage nations have some rudimentary ideas of a god or supreme being. Man is a religious as well as a rational animal.”
Proofs of the existence of “the living God”
The fact of the existence of God is proved by the order, power and complexity of creation, macroscopic and microscopic, and through his dealings with his people throughout history. In looking into what might be called the Book of Divine Creation, scientists learn much. One can learn from a book only if intelligent thought and preparation have been put into the book by its author. Professor Albert Einstein acknowledged: “It is enough for me to . . . reflect upon the marvelous structure of the universe, which we can dimly perceive, and to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the INTELLIGENCE MANIFEST IN NATURE.”
In contrast to the lifeless gods of the nations, Jehovah is called “the living God.” (Jer. 10:10; 2 Cor. 6:16) Everywhere there is testimony to his activity and his greatness. “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling.” (Ps. 19:1) Men have no reason or excuse for denying God, because “what may be known about God is manifest among them, for God made it manifest to them. For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”—Rom. 1:18-20.
Jehovah God is described in the Bible as living from time indefinite to time indefinite, forever (Ps. 90:2, 4; Rev. 10:6), and as being the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible, the only true God. (1 Tim. 1:17) There existed no god before him.—Isa. 43:10, 11.
Infinite, but approachable
The true God is infinite and beyond the mind of man fully to fathom. The creature could never hope to become equal to his Creator or understand all the workings of His mind. (Rom. 11:33-36) But He can be found and approached, and He supplies his worshiper with all that is necessary for the worshiper’s welfare and happiness. (Acts 17:26, 27; Ps. 145:16) He is ever at the zenith of his ability and willingness to give good gifts and presents to his creatures, as it is written: “Every good gift and every perfect present is from above, for it comes down from the Father of the celestial lights, and with him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow.” (Jas. 1:17) Jehovah always Acts within his own righteous arrangements, doing all things on a legal basis. (Rom. 3:4, 23-26) For this reason all his creatures can have complete confidence in him, knowing that he always abides by the principles he establishes. He does not change (Mal. 3:6), and there is no “variation” with him in the application of his principles. There is no partiality with him (Deut. 10:17, 18; Rom. 2:11), and it is impossible for him to lie.—Num. 23:16, 19; Titus 1:1, 2; Heb. 6:17, 18.
His attributes
The true God is not omnipresent, for he is spoken of as having a location. (1 Ki. 8:49; John 16:28; Heb. 9:24) His throne is in heaven. (Isa. 66:1) He is all-powerful, being the Almighty God. (Gen. 17:1; Rev. 16:14) “All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him,” and he is “the One telling from the beginning the finale.” (Heb. 4:13; Isa. 46:10, 11; 1 Sam. 2:3) His power and knowledge extend everywhere, reaching every part of the universe.—2 Chron. 16:9; Ps. 139:7-12; Amos 9:2-4.
The true God is spirit, not flesh (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17), though he sometimes likens his attributes of sight, power, and so forth, to human faculties. Thus he speaks figuratively of his “arm” (Ex. 6:6), his “eyes” and “ears” (Ps. 34:15), and points out that, being the Creator of human eyes and ears, he certainly can see and hear.—Ps. 94:9.
Some of God’s primary attributes are love (1 John 4:8), wisdom (Prov. 2:6; Rom. 11:33), justice (Deut. 32:4; Luke 18:7, 8) and power. (Job 37:23; Luke 1:35) He is a God of order and of peace. (1 Cor. 14:33) He is completely holy, clean and pure (Isa. 6:3; Hab. 1:13; Rev. 4:8), happy (1 Tim. 1:11) and merciful. (Ex. 34:6; Luke 6:36) Many other qualities of his personality are described in the Scriptures.
His position
Jehovah is the Supreme Sovereign of the universe, the King eternal. (Ps. 68:20; Dan. 4:25, 35; Acts 4:24; 1 Tim. 1:17) The position of his throne is the ultimate for superiority. (Ezek. 1:4-28; Dan. 7:9-14; Rev. 4:1-8) He is the Majesty (Heb. 1:3; 8:1), the Majestic God, the Majestic One. (1 Sam. 4:8; Isa. 33:21) He is the Source of all life.—Job 33:4; Ps. 36:9; Acts 17:24, 25.
His righteousness and glory
The true God is a righteous God. (Ps. 7:9) He is the glorious God. (Ps. 29:3; Acts 7:2) He enjoys eminence above all (Deut. 33:26), being clothed with eminence and strength (Ps. 93:1; 68:34) and with dignity and splendor. (Ps. 104:1; 1 Chron. 16:27; Job 37:22; Ps. 8:1) “His activity is dignity and splendor themselves.” (Ps. 111:3) There is glory of splendor in his Kingship.—Ps. 145:11, 12.
His purpose
God has a purpose that he will work out and that cannot be thwarted. (Isa. 46:10; 55:8-11) His purpose, as expressed at Ephesians 1:9, 10, is to establish “an administration at the full limit of the appointed times, namely, to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.” (Compare Matthew 6:9, 10.) None existed before him; therefore he has seniority over all. (Isa. 44:6) He, being the Creator, existed before any other gods, and all false gods will be wiped out so that there will be none existing after him. (Isa. 43:10) As the Alpha and the Omega (Rev. 22:13), he brings to successful conclusion that which he begins. (Rev. 1:8; 21:5, 6) He never forgets or forsakes his purposes or covenants, which makes him a God of dependability and loyalty.—Ps. 105:8.
A communicative God
Having great love for his creatures, God provides ample opportunity for them to know him and his purposes. His own voice has been heard on earth on three occasions. (Matt. 3:17; 17:5; John 12:28) He has communicated through angels (Luke 2:9-12; Acts 7:52, 53) and through men to whom he gave directions and revelations, such as Moses and the other prophets, and especially through his Son, Jesus Christ. (Heb. 1:1, 2; Rev. 1:1) His written Word is his communication to his people, enabling them to be completely equipped as his servants and ministers, and directing them on the way to life.—2 Pet. 1:19-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; John 17:3.
Contrasted with the gods of the nations
The true God, the Creator of the glorious heavenly bodies, has glory and brilliance beyond the ability of fleshly sight to endure, for “no man may see [God] and yet live.” (Ex. 33:20) Only the angels, spirit creatures, have vision that can behold his face in a literal sense. (Matt. 18:10; Luke 1:19) Nevertheless, he does not expose men to such an experience. In loving-kindness he enables men to see his fine qualities through his Word, including the revelation of Himself by means of his Son Christ Jesus.—Matt. 11:27; John 1:18; 14:9.
God gives us an idea of the effect of his presence in the book of Revelation. The apostle John had a vision that approximated seeing God, in the sense that it revealed the effect of beholding him on his throne. God was not like a man in appearance, for he has not revealed any figure of his to man, as John himself said later: “No man has seen God at any time.” (John 1:18) Rather, God was shown to be like highly polished gems, precious, glowing, beautiful, that attract the eye and win delighted admiration. He was “in appearance, like a jasper stone and a precious red-colored stone, and round about the throne there [was] a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.” (Rev. 4:3) Thus, he is lovely in appearance and pleasant to look at, causing one to lose oneself in wonderment. About his throne there is further glory and an atmosphere of calmness, serenity. The appearance of a perfect rainbow of emerald indicates that, reminding one of the enjoyable quieting calm that follows a storm.—Compare Genesis 9:12-16.
How different the true God is, therefore, from the gods of the nations, who are often depicted as being grotesque, angry, fierce, implacable, merciless, whimsical as to their favors and disfavors, horrifying and fiendish and ready to torture earthly creatures, human souls, in some kind of “hellfire” or inferno.
“A God exacting exclusive devotion”
“Even though there are those who are called ‘gods,’ whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords,’ there is actually to us one God the Father.” (1 Cor. 8:5, 6) Many of these gods are ‘mighty ones,’ but Jehovah is the Almighty God. He is a God exacting exclusive devotion. (Ex. 20:5) He requires his worshipers to worship him with spirit and truth. (John 4:24) His worshipers should fear him, which means to hate bad and to recognize his sovereignty and supremacy, his almightiness and his righteousness. (Prov. 1:7; 8:13; Jer. 11:20) They should stand in reverent awe of him.—Isa. 8:13; Heb. 12:28, 29.
Among other mighty ones called “gods” in the Bible, is Jesus Christ, who is “the only-begotten god.” But he himself plainly said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (John 1:18; Luke 4:8; Deut. 10:20) The angels are “godlike ones,” but one of them stopped John from worshiping him, saying: “Be careful! Do not do that! . . . Worship God.” (Ps. 8:5; Heb. 2:7; Rev. 19:10) Mighty men among the Hebrews were called “gods” (Ps. 82:1-7); but no man was purposed by God to receive worship. When Cornelius began to do obeisance to Peter, that apostle stopped him with the words, “Rise; I myself am also a man.” (Acts 10:25, 26) Certainly the false gods invented and fashioned by men down through the centuries since the rebellion in Eden are not to be worshiped. The Mosaic law warns strongly against turning from Jehovah to them. (Ex. 20:3-5) Jehovah the true God will not forever tolerate rivalry from false, worthless gods.—Jer. 10:10, 11.
The apostle Paul tells that God is the One who declares persons righteous and that after Christ, as God’s king, brings to nothing all other authority and power, and thereafter hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, God will then become “all things to everyone.” (Rom. 8:33; 1 Cor. 15:23-28) Eventually, all those living will acknowledge God’s sovereignty and will praise his name continually.—Ps. 150; Phil. 2:9-11; Rev. 21:22-27; see EL; ELOHIM; JEHOVAH.

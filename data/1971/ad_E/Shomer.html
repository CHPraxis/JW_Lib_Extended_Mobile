His name is also spelled Shemer.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:32-13:7:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:34-13:7:34" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:40-13:7:40" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 40</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. Jehozabad, a co-assassin of Judah’s King Jehoash, is identified as a son of both Shomer and “Shimrith the Moabitess.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:12:21-12:12:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 12:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:26-14:24:26" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 24:26</a>) Shomer is a masculine word in Hebrew; Shimrith is feminine. Some view Shomer as the father of Jehozabad and Shimrith as his mother. However, Shomer may have been the father of Shimrith. If this is the case, Jehozabad was the grandson of Shomer, the term “son” often meaning descendant.</p>

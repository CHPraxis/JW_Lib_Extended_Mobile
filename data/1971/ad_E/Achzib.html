<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Achʹzib) [deceitful].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of two cities.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1. A city in southern Palestine in the territory of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:44-6:15:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:44</a>) It is understood to be the same as “Chezib” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:5-1:38:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 38:5</a>, <em>AV</em>), the birthplace of Judah’s son Shelah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:33-6:15:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joshua 15:33</a> shows it to be in the hilly country of the Shephelah, and it is considered to correspond with Tell el-Beida to the SW of Adullam. Lachish, Moresheth-gath and Mareshah (mentioned along with Achzib in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:13-33:1:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 1:13-15</a>) are all in that area.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. A Phoenician coastal city in the territory of the tribe of Asher. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:29-6:19:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 19:29</a>) Asher, however, never succeeded in conquering it, nor the more important city of Acco (Acre) to the S, perhaps due to hindering action on the part of the Phoenician fleet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:31-7:1:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judg. 1:31, 32</a>) Sennacherib of Assyria overran it in King Hezekiah’s time and mentions it in his annuals under the name Aksibi. In Greek and Roman times it was called Ekdippa. The modern village of ez-Zib continues at the location of the ancient city, some nine miles (14.5 kilometers) N of Acre at the mouth of the Wadi Qarn.</p>

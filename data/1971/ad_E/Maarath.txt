MAARATH
(Maʹa·rath) [bare, naked place, or, barren field].
A town assigned to the tribe of Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 59) A site near the village of Beit Ummar in the hill country of Judah, about seven miles (c. 11 kilometers) N of Hebron, is considered to be the probable location. Some suggest that Maarath may be a variant name of Maroth.—Mic. 1:9, 12.

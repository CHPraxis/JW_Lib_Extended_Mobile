JUDGE
Men raised up by Jehovah to deliver his people prior to the period of Israel’s human kings were known as judges. (Judg. 2:16) Moses, as mediator of the Law covenant and God-appointed leader, judged Israel for forty years. But the period of judges, as usually viewed, began with Joshua and ran through the judgeship of Samuel, extending 356 years from Moses’ death in 1473 B.C.E. to the beginning of King Saul’s reign, 1117 B.C.E.
The judges were selected and appointed by Jehovah from various tribes of Israel. Joshua was of the tribe of Ephraim and Samuel was a Levite. (Num. 13:8, 16; 1 Sam. 1:1; 1 Chron. 6:16, 33, 34) Between Joshua and Samuel, thirteen judges are named, as follows:
Judge      Tribe          Judge       Tribe
Othniel    Judah          Jair        Manasseh
Ehud       Benjamin       Jephthah    Manasseh
Shamgar      (?)          Ibzan       Zebulun (?)
Barak      Naphtali (?)   Elon        Zebulun
Gideon     Manasseh       Abdon       Ephraim
Tola       Issachar       Samson      Dan
                          Eli         Levi
The exact area over which each of the judges exercised jurisdiction and the dates of their judgeships cannot in every case be determined. Some may have judged contemporaneously in different sections of Israel, and there were periods of oppression intervening.—See CHRONOLOGY; COURT, JUDICIAL; JUDGES, BOOK OF; and judges of Israel under individual names.

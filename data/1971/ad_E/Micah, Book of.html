<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A prophetic book of the Hebrew Scriptures containing Jehovah’s word through Micah concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. (See MICAH No. 7.) It consists of three basic sections, each beginning with the word “Hear.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:2-33:1:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:1-33:3:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:1-33:6:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 6:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Micah’s prophetic words regarding Samaria’s desolation must have been delivered before that city’s destruction in 740 B.C.E., and evidently his oral pronouncements were committed to writing before the close of Hezekiah’s reign.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Deplorable moral conditions prevailed among the people of Israel and Judah in Micah’s time. The leaders oppressed the people, especially the poor. Judges, priests and prophets were out for money. Idolatry, fraud, oppression, injustices and bloodshed abounded. It was precarious to trust even confidential friends and family members.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:7-33:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mic. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:2:1-33:2:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:1-33:3:3" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 3:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:9-33:3:12" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 9-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:12-33:6:12" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 6:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:2-33:7:6" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> 7:2-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book of Micah candidly portrays the wrongs of Israel and Judah. While foretelling desolation for Samaria and Jerusalem on account of their transgressions (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:5-33:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mic. 1:5-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:9-33:3:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:9-12</a>), it also contains promises of the restoration and divine blessings to follow.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:1-33:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mic. 4:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:7-33:5:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:15-33:7:17" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 7:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The authenticity of this book is well established. It harmonizes with the rest of the Scriptures in showing Jehovah to be a merciful and loving God, One pardoning error and passing over transgression. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:18-33:7:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mic. 7:18-20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Psalm 86:5</a>.) From earliest times the Jews accepted this book as authentic. About a century after Micah’s time his words spoken during Hezekiah’s reign about the desolation of Jerusalem were quoted by certain older men of Judah when making a point in defense of Jeremiah the prophet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:26:17-24:26:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 26:17-19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:12-33:3:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Micah 3:12</a>.) Centuries afterward the Jewish chief priests and scribes, on the basis of Micah’s prophecy, confidently stated that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:3-40:2:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 2:3-6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Micah 5:2</a>.) The fulfillment of prophecies respecting Samaria, Jerusalem and the Messiah or Christ stamp this book as being inspired of God. Noteworthy, too, is the fact that Jesus’ words about a man’s enemies being persons of his household parallel <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:6-33:7:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Micah 7:6</a>.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:21-40:10:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 10:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:35-40:10:36" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 35, 36</a>.</p>

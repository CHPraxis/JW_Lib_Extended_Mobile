ZELA(H)
(Zeʹla[h]) [rib, side].
A city in Benjamin. (Josh 18:21, 28) The bones of Saul and Jonathan were buried at Zela. Earlier, Saul’s father Kish had been interred there. (2 Sam. 21:14) Some identify Zela(h) with Khirbet Salah, located between Gibeon and Jerusalem. Some scholars think that in Joshua “Zelah” should be combined with the name that follows, “Ha-eleph”; however, see HA-ELEPH.

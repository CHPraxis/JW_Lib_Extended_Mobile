<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah, the Producer of this marvel, can also control snowfall. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:6-18:37:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 37:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:16-19:147:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 147:16</a>) To serve His purpose, God has stored snow and hail “for the day of fight and war.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:22-18:38:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Each descending snow crystal washes out the atmosphere and carries with it such elements as sulfur and nitrogen, thus contributing to soil fertility while supplying moisture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 55:10, 11</a>) Snow can be a source of clean water for washing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:30-18:9:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 9:30</a>) Though either rare or unknown in certain areas of Palestine, it sometimes falls during January and February in hill country, as at Jerusalem. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:20-10:23:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:22-13:11:22" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 11:22</a>.) During most of the year there is snow in the heights and ravines of the Lebanon range, lofty Mount Hermon being snowcapped nearly all year long. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:18:14-24:18:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 18:14</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:14-19:68:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 68:14</a> refers to snow in Zalmon, possibly Mount Zalmon near Shechem, unless mention of Bashan in verse 15 indicates a site E of the Jordan.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ILLUSTRATIVE USE</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Snow is used in Scriptural similes to help convey the idea of whiteness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:6-2:4:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:10-4:12:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Num. 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:27-12:5:27" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 5:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:9" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Dan. 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:3-40:28:3" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Matt. 28:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:14-66:1:14" data-bid="8-6" class="b"> Rev. 1:14</a>) Sometimes it is associated with purity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:4:7-25:4:7" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Lam. 4:7</a>) For example, David begged God to purify him from sin, washing him that he might become “whiter even than snow.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:7-19:51:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 51:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Job’s three companions, being no source of true comfort to him, were likened to a winter torrent, swollen by melting ice and snow in the mountains but running dry in the heat of summer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:15-18:6:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 6:15-17</a>) Sheol is said to snatch away sinners as drought and heat do snow waters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:24:19-18:24:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 24:19</a>) Just as snow is unnatural and would harm crops in summer, so “glory is not fitting for a stupid one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:1-20:26:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 26:1</a>) However, a faithful envoy, one who would fulfill his commission to the satisfaction of those sending him, is likened to a drink cooled with snow from the mountains and bringing refreshment on a hot day of harvest.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:13-20:25:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 25:13</a>.</p>

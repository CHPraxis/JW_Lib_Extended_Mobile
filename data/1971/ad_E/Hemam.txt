HEMAM
(Heʹmam) [possibly from a Hebrew verb meaning to make a noise, move noisily, confuse, discomfit].
Son of Lotan and descendant of Seir the Horite. (Gen. 36:20, 22) The name is rendered as Homam in 1 Chronicles 1:39 according to the reading of the Masoretic text, but the Septuagint Version gives the name as Hemam.

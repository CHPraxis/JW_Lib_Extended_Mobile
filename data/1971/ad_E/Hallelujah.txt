HALLELUJAH
(Hal·le·luʹjah) [praise Jah, you people].
A transliteration of the Hebrew expression hal·lu-Yahʹ, appearing first at Psalm 104:35. In the New World Translation it is nearly always translated “praise Jah, you people.” With the exception of Psalm 135:3 (“praise Jah,” NW), hal·lu-Yahʹ introduces and/or concludes certain Psalms. (See Psalm 112:1; 115:18; 146:1, 10; 147:1, 20; 148:1, 14; 149:1, 9; 150:1, 6.) This expression stands alongside “Amen” at the close of Book Four of Psalms (Ps. 106:48), and a Greek form of it appears four times at Revelation 19:1-6, where the reference is to the joy experienced over the destruction of Babylon the Great and that associated with Jehovah’s beginning to rule as King.—See JAH.

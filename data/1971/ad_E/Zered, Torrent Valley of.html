<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A torrent valley at which the Israelites camped on their way around the frontier of Moab, at the end of the thirty-eight additional years of wandering from the time of the rebellion at Kadesh-barnea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:12-4:21:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:13-5:2:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 2:13, 14</a>) While some would place this valley at the Wadi es-Sultani in the desert E of Moab, it is generally identified with the Wadi el-Hesa, the southernmost tributary of the Dead Sea. This valley formed the boundary between Moab and Edom, and, over a thirty-five-mile (56.3-kilometer) stretch, it descends some 3,900 feet (c. 1,189 meters), entering the Dead Sea at the SE end. The valley is some three and a quarter to four miles (5.2 to 6.4 kilometers) across at the top. There is evidence there of a series of Edomite fortresses that served to guard the natural approaches to the S of the Wadi el-Hesa.</p>

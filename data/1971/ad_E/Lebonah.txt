LEBONAH
(Le·boʹnah) [frankincense].
A place mentioned as a reference point in connection with the location of Shiloh. (Judg. 21:19) It is generally identified with modern Lubban, some three miles (5 kilometers) W-NW of the suggested site of Shiloh. However, the Bible’s placing of Shiloh “toward the south of Lebonah” may indicate that originally the city was farther E than this suggested site.

HACHILAH
(Hach·iʹlah) [dark].
A hill in the wilderness of Ziph, where David and his men concealed themselves from King Saul. (1 Sam. 23:19; 26:1-3) Today its exact location is unknown. While some would identify Hachilah with Dahr el-Kola (a long ridge about ten miles [16 kilometers] W of En-gedi), this has been questioned on the basis that the Hebrew word for “hill” does not apply to a long ridge.

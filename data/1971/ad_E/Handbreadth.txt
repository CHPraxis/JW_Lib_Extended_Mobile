HANDBREADTH
A linear measure approximately corresponding to the width of the hand at the base of the fingers. The handbreadth is reckoned at about 2.9 inches (c. 7.4 centimeters), with four fingerbreadths equaling a handbreadth and six handbreadths a cubit. (Ex. 25:25; 37:12; 1 Ki. 7:26; 2 Chron. 4:5; Ezek. 40:5, 43; 43:13) According to Psalm 39:5, David said: “You have made my days just a few”; however, “just handbreadths” appears in the Hebrew Masoretic text. (NW, 1958 ed., ftn.) Christ Jesus similarly employed the word “cubit”: “Who of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his life span?”—Matt. 6:27.

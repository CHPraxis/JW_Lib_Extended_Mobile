TITUS
(Tiʹtus).
A Greek Christian who labored with the apostle Paul. At the time the circumcision issue arose at Antioch (49 C.E.) it appears that Titus accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. (Acts 15:1, 2; Gal. 2:1-3) About 55 C.E., Titus ministered unselfishly to the Corinthian congregation, having been sent to Corinth by the apostle Paul to assist in the collection for the needy brothers in Judea and perhaps also to note the reaction of the congregation to Paul’s first letter to them. (2 Cor. 2:13; 8:1-6; 12:17, 18) When Titus thereafter met the apostle in Macedonia, he was able to give a good report about the Corinthian congregation, one that brought comfort and joy to Paul. Titus himself had developed great affection for the Corinthian Christians because of their obedience, and their commendable attitude had proved to be a source of encouragement and joy to him.—2 Cor. 7:6, 7, 13-15.
Since Titus had initiated matters in connection with the contribution, Paul desired that he complete the task and commended Titus to the Corinthian congregation as “a sharer with me and a fellow worker for your interests.” Being sincerely interested in the welfare of the Corinthians, and encouraged by the apostle to do so, Titus willingly departed for Corinth.—2 Cor. 8:6, 16, 17, 23.
After Paul was released from his first imprisonment at Rome, Titus and Timothy apparently worked with him in the ministry. While in Crete (sometime between 61 and 64 C.E.), Paul left Titus there to ‘correct the things that were defective and to make appointments of older men in city after city.’ (Titus 1:4, 5) This was evidently a temporary assignment, for Paul requested that Titus do his utmost to join him at Nicopolis.—Titus 3:12.
Sometime during Paul’s second imprisonment at Rome (64-65 C.E.), Titus, likely at the apostle’s direction or with his approval, left for Dalmatia.—2 Tim. 4:10; see DALMATIA.

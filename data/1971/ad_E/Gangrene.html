<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The death of the tissues in a part of the body, such as a toe or a foot; mortification. In <em>dry gangrene,</em> where the arteries are blocked or occluded (as, for example, in arteriosclerosis), the affected part turns black and dry and loses all feeling. <span id="page622" class="pageNum" data-no="622" data-before-text="622"></span><em>Moist gangrene</em> is a result of veins, rather than arteries, being occluded. The affected part undergoes putrefaction. Wounds, frostbite or other interference with the blood supply can bring about gangrene. The dead material is usually separated from the living tissue by a red line of demarcation and is cast off by a process of inflammation, or it becomes necessary to amputate by surgery. The bacteria associated with gangrene (especially in moist gangrene) can cause blood poisoning and a deadly spread of the infection if the affected part is not removed.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The apostle Paul uses the word figuratively of the teaching of false doctrine and of “empty speeches that violate what is holy.” He stresses the danger that such speech brings to the entire congregation, saying: “For they will advance to more and more ungodliness, and their word will spread like gangrene.” He then cites examples: “Hymenaeus and Philetus are of that number. These very men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:16-55:2:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:16-18</a>) In view of Paul’s earlier symbolism, picturing the congregation as a body with many members—feet, hands, and so forth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:1-46:12:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. chap. 12</a>)—his figurative use of gangrene, with its danger to the human body, gives strong emphasis to the importance of eliminating false doctrine and ungodly speech from the Christian congregation.</p>

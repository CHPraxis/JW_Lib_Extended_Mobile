<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Cloʹpas).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The husband of one of the Marys that stood beside Jesus as he hung on the torture stake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:25-43:19:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 19:25</a>) Presumably he was the husband of “the other Mary,” and father of the apostle James the Less and his brother Joses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:56-40:27:56" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 27:56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:1-40:28:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 28:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:40-41:15:40" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Mark 15:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:16:1-41:16:1" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 16:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:10-42:24:10" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Luke 24:10</a>) It is quite probable and generally recognized that Clopas was the same person that was called Alphaeus (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:3-40:10:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 10:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:18-41:3:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 3:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:15-42:6:15" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Luke 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:13-44:1:13" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Acts 1:13</a>), the difference being explained either as a variation in the pronunciation of the Aramaic root or because the same individual had two names used interchangeably, a practice not uncommon at the time. That Clopas was a brother of Joseph, the foster father of Jesus, is a conjecture based entirely on tradition.</p>

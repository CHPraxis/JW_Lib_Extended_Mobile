<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A weight mentioned only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:3-43:12:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 12:3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:39-43:19:39" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19:39</a>. The Greek term is usually equated with the Roman pound (Latin, <em>libra,</em> from. which the English abbreviation “lb” for pound is drawn). Thus it was a little less than twelve ounces avoirdupois or about 327 grams. Some versions render the Greek word <em>mna</em> as “pound” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:18-42:19:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 19:18</a>, <em>AV, Dy, JB, WY</em>), but it is more appropriately rendered “mina.” (<em>Da, Fn, Ro, NW</em>) Whereas “pound” is used in the Bible just as a weight or measurement, “mina” is a monetary weight indicating a specific value of gold or silver.</p>

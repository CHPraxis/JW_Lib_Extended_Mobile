<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Benjamite family of which King Saul of Israel was a member. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:10:21-9:10:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:21</a>) The <em>Authorized Version</em> uses the name “Matri” (Maʹtri), meaning “rainy.” However, the Hebrew word <em>mat·riʹ</em> here is accompanied by the definite article. Thus the <em>New World Translation</em> appropriately reads “the Matrites,” as do the other modern translations.—<em>AS; AT; RS.</em></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Elʹkosh·ite).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A resident of Elkosh. “Elkoshite” is applied only to the prophet Nahum. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:1-34:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nah. 1:1</a>) Some would place Elkosh in Galilee; however, Nahum may have been in Judah at the time of its composition. (Vs. 15) If so, this would make the suggested identity with Judean site Beit Jibrin, four miles (6.4 kilometers) NE of Lachish, the most likely proposal. The identification, however, remains tentative.</p>

PEREZ-UZZAH
(Peʹrez-uzʹzah) [rupture against Uzzah].
The name given to the threshing floor of Nacon (or, Chidon) after Jehovah struck down Uzzah for handling the Ark irreverently when an attempt was made to move it from Kiriath-jearim to the city of David. (2 Sam. 6:4-10; 1 Chron. 13:6-11) The exact location of Perez-uzzah is unknown.

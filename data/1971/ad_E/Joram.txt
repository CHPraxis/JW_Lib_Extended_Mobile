JORAM
(Joʹram) [shortened form of Jehoram, meaning “Jehovah is high, exalted”].
1. Son of King Toi of Hamath. Joram was sent with costly gifts made of gold, silver and copper, along with his father’s congratulations, to King David when the latter defeated Hadadezer the king of Zobah. David, in turn, accepted and sanctified the gifts to Jehovah. (2 Sam. 8:5, 9-11) In a parallel account Joram’s name is spelled Hadoram.—1 Chron. 18:9-11.
2. A descendant of Levite Eliezer, Moses’ son; he apparently lived when David was king.—1 Chron. 26:24, 25; Ex. 18:2-4.
3. King of Israel for twelve years; son of Ahab. Usually he is identified by the longer form of his name, Jehoram. (2 Ki. 3:1) Only in three chapters do we find the short form in the Masoretic text.—2 Ki. 8:16-29; 9:14-29; 2 Chron. 22:5-7; NW, 1955 ed., ftns.; see JEHORAM No. 2.
4. King of Judah for eight years; son of Jehoshaphat. The Masoretic text has his name at times in the short form. (2 Ki. 8:21, 23, 24; 11:2; 1 Chron. 3:11; NW, 1955 ed., ftns.) The shortened form is also found in the Westcott and Hort Greek Text, but a few translations give assistance in understanding by rendering the full name.—Matt. 1:8, NW, Sawyer, TC, We; see JEHORAM No. 3.

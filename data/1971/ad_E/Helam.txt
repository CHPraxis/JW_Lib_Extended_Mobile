HELAM
(Heʹlam).
The site where David’s army defeated the military forces of Syrian King Hadadezer under his army chief Shobach. (2 Sam. 10:15-19) Some scholars link it with “Alema” mentioned in the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (5:26, JB). It may thus be the same as modern ʽAlma, about thirty-four miles (54.7 kilometers) due E of the Sea of Galilee.

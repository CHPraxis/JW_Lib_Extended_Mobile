<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A decorative clasp made of metal and having a pin or tongue by which it can be fastened to a person’s clothing. In ancient times, brooches were worn by both men and women, as among the Greeks and Romans. The Roman brooch or fibula sometimes consisted of a curved piece of metal with a hook at one end and a pin extending from the other end, in safety-pin fashion. Being not only ornamental but useful, the brooch was often used for such purposes as pinning together two parts of a scarf or cloak. Brooches of antiquity were made of bronze, iron, gold and silver. Their use in early Palestine has been established by archaeological finds, among these being bow-shaped brooches discovered at Tell el-Nasbeh.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Israelites were granted the privilege of contributing toward the construction of the tabernacle, the men and women brought various ornaments including “brooches” or “buckles.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:21-2:35:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 35:21, 22</a>) These brooches were evidently hooked ornaments of some type, for the same Hebrew word used for them (<em>hhahh</em>) is rendered “hook(s)” elsewhere.

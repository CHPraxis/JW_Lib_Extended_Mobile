<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the four cities constituting the “beginning of [Nimrod’s] kingdom” in the land of Shinar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:10-1:10:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:10</a>) Erech is today represented by a cluster of mounds at the site called Warka by the Arabs and known as Uruk to the ancient Akkadians of Mesopotamia. It is situated about a hundred and ten miles (177 kilometers) SE of Babylon on the W bank of the old bed of the Euphrates (the Shattek-Kar), or some four miles (6.4 kilometers) E of the present course of that river. An ancient ziggurat has been uncovered here, along with many mounds and coffins that seem to indicate that Erech was once a burial ground of the Assyrian kings.</p>

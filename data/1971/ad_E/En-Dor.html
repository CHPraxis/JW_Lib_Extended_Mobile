<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[spring of generation].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A plains city located in the territory of Issachar but assigned to Manasseh. The Canaanites there were not entirely dispossessed but came under forced labor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 17:11-13</a>) En-dor is usually identified with the modern site of the same name, about midway between Megiddo and the southern end of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:9-19:83:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 83:9, 10</a>, En-dor is connected with Jehovah’s victory over Sisera. While not mentioned in the battle account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:1-7:4:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges chapters four and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:1-7:5:31" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> five</a>, it evidently lay only a few miles S of Mount Tabor, from which Barak’s army descended. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:6-7:4:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judg. 4:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:12-7:4:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12</a>) It was also in the general region of Taanach and <span id="page518" class="pageNum" data-no="518" data-before-text="518"></span>Megiddo and the torrent valley of Kishon, where Sisera’s forces were miraculously disrupted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:11-6:17:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:19-7:5:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Judg. 5:19</a>) So, some feature of the battle evidently extended as far as En-dor, and the psalmist, well acquainted with the historical and geographical details, could speak of En-dor as the place where many of the fleeing Canaanites were annihilated.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:10-19:83:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 83:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">En-dor is best known as the place where King Saul went to consult a “mistress of spirit mediumship,” shortly before Israel’s defeat at the hands of the Philistines.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:7-9:28:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 28:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:31:1-9:31:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31:1-13</a>.</p>

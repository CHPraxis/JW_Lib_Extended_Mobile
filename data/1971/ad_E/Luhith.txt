LUHITH
(Luʹhith) [possibly, of tablets or planks].
A place mentioned in prophecies of doom against Moab. (Isa. 15:1, 5; Jer. 48:5) Some scholars believe that Luhith was a Moabite city located at the top of an ascent. Identified by Eusebius and Jerome with a place called Loueitha, Luhith has been linked with either modern Khirbet Mendint er Ras, about five miles (8 kilometers) E of the southern end of the Dead Sea, or nearby Khirbet Fas. Another view is that Luhith was not a city but merely the name of the ascent or slope to be used by the fleeing and weeping Moabite refugees.—Compare Numbers 34:4.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(A·hiʹtub) [the (divine) brother is good].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A descendant of Aaron’s son Ithamar; son of Phinehas and grandson of high priest Eli. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:3-9:14:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:3-13:24:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 24:3</a>) Following the death of his father and grandfather on the same day, Ahitub possibly officiated as high priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:17-9:4:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 4:17, 18</a>) His son, high priest Ahimelech, was slain by Saul.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:9-9:22:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:9-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. Son of Amariah, a descendant of Aaron’s son Eleazar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:3-13:6:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 6:3-8</a>) There is no indication that he acted as high priest; this office was in the line of Ithamar at the time. Ahitub’s son Zadok served as a secondary priest, not as high priest, during the reign of David, and then was assigned to replace Abiathar as high priest during the reign of Solomon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:17-10:8:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:16-13:18:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 18:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:8-11:1:8" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:27-11:2:27" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 2:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. Another priest who descended from Ahitub (2) above.

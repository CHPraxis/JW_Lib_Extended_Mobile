<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Suʹphah) [stormwind].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As ordinarily rendered, a region or valley, probably in the vinicity of the Arnon River. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:14-4:21:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 21:14</a>) This Hebrew word has been translated by such terms as “hurricane” (<em>Ro</em>) and “storm” (<em>AS</em> ftn.). However, most modern translations indicate that it was a region or valley, saying that Vaheb was located “by Suphah” (<em>JB</em>) or “in Suphah.”—<em>AT, JP, NW, RS.</em></p>

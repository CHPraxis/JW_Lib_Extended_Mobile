BEELZEBUB
(Be·elʹze·bub) [alternately, Beelzeboul and Beezeboul; possibly meaning, “Lord of the habitation”; or, if a play on the late Hebrew word zeʹvel (dung), “lord of dung.” The name may also be an alteration of Baal-zebub, the Baal worshiped by the Philistines at Ekron.]
“Beelzebub” is a designation applied to Satan the prince or ruler of the demons. The religious leaders blasphemously accused Jesus Christ of expelling demons by means of Beelzebub.—Matt. 10:25; 12:24-29; Mark 3:22-27; Luke 11:15-19.

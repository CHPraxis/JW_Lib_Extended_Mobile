MINT
[he·dyʹo·smon].
A strong-scented herb, sole mention of which is made in Scripture with reference to the scrupulous care exercised by the scribes and Pharisees in giving the tenth of the mint, while disregarding the weightier matters of the Law. (Matt. 23:23; Luke 11:42) Several varieties of mint are found in Palestine and Syria, the horsemint being the more common. Likely the Greek word he·dyʹo·smon was not restricted to a particular variety but embraced the various known kinds of mint.
The stems of mint plants are square, with the leaves growing in twos, one on each side of the stem. The small, white, bluish or pinkish flowers are arranged in clusters, forming either separate whorls or terminal spikes. From ancient times mint has been used in medicine and for flavoring food; this on account of the fragrant oil contained in the plant’s leaves and stems.

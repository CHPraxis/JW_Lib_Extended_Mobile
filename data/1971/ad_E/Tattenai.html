<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The governor of the Persian province “beyond the River” during the reign of Darius I (Hystaspis). When the Jews again started to rebuild the temple in Darius’ second year (520/519 B.C.E.), Tattenai and his colleagues came to Jerusalem to conduct an inquiry. The Jews appealed to Cyrus’ original decree; so Tattenai wrote to Darius asking if such a decree had been issued, as the Jews contended. The answer received confirmed Cyrus’ decree and the validity of the temple work, and warned Tattenai not to interfere, but to render material assistance to the Jews. This Tattenai proceeded to do.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:24-15:6:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 4:24–6:13</a>.</p>

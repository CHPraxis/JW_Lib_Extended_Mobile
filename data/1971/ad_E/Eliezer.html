<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(E·li·eʹzer) [God is helper].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A man of Damascus and the apparent heir of childless Abraham. Abraham referred to him as “a son of my household.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:2-1:15:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 15:2, 3</a>) Archaeological discoveries, such as the tablets from Nuzi, shed light on why Abraham considered Eliezer as his heir. Often childless couples adopted a son who would then care for them in old age and arrange for their burial at death, thereupon inheriting the property. It was stipulated, however, that, in the event a son was born to them after the adoption, the real son would become the principal heir.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Likely Eliezer was the one spoken of as Abraham’s oldest servant and manager of his household, who was sent by Abraham to Nahor’s household in upper Mesopotamia to bring back a wife for Isaac.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. The younger of Moses’ two sons, so named by Moses because God had been his helper in delivering Moses from Pharaoh’s sword.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aʹnath) [answer, i.e., to prayer].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The father of one of Israel’s judges, Shamgar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:31-7:3:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 3:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:5:6-7:5:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5:6</a>) This was also the name of one of the three principal Canaanite goddesses. She is presented as both the sister and spouse of Baal and a symbol of lustful sex and war. There is no evidence, however, to show that the name of Shamgar’s father was drawn from that of the goddess Anath; although the apostasies of Israel during this period could allow for that.—Compare the case of Gideon at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:25-7:6:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judges 6:25-27</a>.</p>

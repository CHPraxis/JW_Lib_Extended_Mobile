<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Leb-kaʹmai) [the heart of those rising up against me].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A note in the margin of the Hebrew Masoretic text holds that this is a cryptographical name for Chaldea or <em>Kas·dimʹ.</em> It appears only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:1-24:51:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:1</a>, in a statement regarding what Jehovah would do to Babylon and the inhabitants of Chaldea. The term is employed there in keeping with a system called athbash, in which the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet (<em>taw</em>) represents the first letter thereof (<em>ʼaʹleph</em>), the second-last letter (<em>shin</em>) represents the second (<em>behth</em>), and so forth. Hence, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:1-24:51:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:1</a> the real name (<em>Kas·dimʹ</em>) is disguised by forming the Hebrew word <em>Lev qa·mayʹ</em> (Leb-kamai). For “Leb-kamai” the <em>Septuagint Version</em> has “the Chaldeans” and the Targums read “the land of the Chaldeans.”</p>

BUZ
[contempt].
1. Son of Abraham’s brother Nahor by his wife Milcah; Rebekah’s uncle. (Gen. 22:20-23) His descendants were presumably Buzites, Elihu’s father being described as such.—Job 32:2, 6; see No. 3 below.
2. A family head and descendant of Jacob’s son Gad.—1 Chron. 5:11, 14.
3. A place in Arabia against which Jeremiah foretells doom. (Jer. 25:17, 23) It was presumably inhabited by the descendants of No. 1 above. Some authorities suggest that Buz may correspond to “Bazu,” which is described in Assyrian inscriptions as “a district which is far away” and “a waterless region” to which a certain queen of Arabia fled.

ROGELIM
(Ro·geʹlim) [(place of) fullers or spies].
A town in Gilead and home of David’s friend Barzillai. (2 Sam. 17:27-29; 19:31, 32) Some geographers tentatively place Rogelim at Tell Barsina, less than sixteen miles (c. 25 kilometers) SE of the Sea of Galilee. Wadi er-Rujeili, near there, possibly preserves the name Rogelim.

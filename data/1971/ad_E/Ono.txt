ONO
(Oʹno) [strong].
A city built either by Benjamite Elpaal or by his “son(s).” (1 Chron. 8:1, 12) After the Babylonian exile Ono was reoccupied by Benjamites. (Ezra 2:1, 33; Neh. 7:6, 37; 11:31, 35) Kefr ʽAna, about seven miles (11 kilometers) E-SE of Joppa, is thought to preserve the city’s ancient name. This location would place Ono just a few miles from the suggested sites of ancient Lod and Hadid. The “valley plain of Ono” (Neh. 6:2) possibly denotes the wide valley in which modern Kefr ‘Ana lies. This “valley plain” has also been associated with the “valley of the craftsmen [geh ha-hhara·shimʹ].” (Neh. 11:35) But some scholars understand the Hebrew geh ha-hhara·shimʹ to designate another location and transliterate it as a proper name, “Ge-harashim.”—JP; compare 1 Chronicles 4:14.

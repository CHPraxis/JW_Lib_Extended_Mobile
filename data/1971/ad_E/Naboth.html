<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Jezreelite vineyard owner and victim of a wicked plot by Queen Jezebel. Naboth’s vineyard in Jezreel was within sight of King Ahab’s palace. Naboth declined Ahab’s offer to buy the vineyard or to exchange it for a better vineyard somewhere else, because Jehovah had prohibited sale in perpetuity of a family inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:1-11:21:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:23-3:25:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Lev. 25:23-28</a>) Ahab’s wife Queen Jezebel, however, schemed to have two witnesses falsely accuse Naboth of blaspheming God and the king. Thereby Naboth and his sons were put to death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:26-12:9:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:26</a>), enabling Ahab to take possession of the vineyard. Because of this murder, Elijah foretold that the dogs not only would eat up Jezebel but would also lick up Ahab’s blood in the same place they licked up Naboth’s blood. Their offspring would similarly be cut off. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:5-11:21:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:5-23</a>) This divine pronouncement was carried out.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:22:34-11:22:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:22:38-11:22:38" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:21-12:9:21" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 9:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:24-12:9:26" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 24-26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:35-12:9:36" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 35, 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:1-12:10:11" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 10:1-11</a>.</p>

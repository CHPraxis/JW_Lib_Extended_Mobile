<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>SYMBOLIC USAGE</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jesus Christ is spoken of as the Head of “the congregation, which is his body.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:22-49:1:23" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Eph. 1:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:18-51:1:18" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Col. 1:18</a>) This Christian body of people has no divisions racially, nationally or otherwise, Jews and people of all nations being represented in it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:28-48:3:28" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Gal. 3:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:16-49:2:16" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:4-49:4:4" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 4:4</a>) All are baptized by holy spirit into Christ and into his death. They are, therefore, all baptized into one body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:13-46:12:13" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:13</a>) Thus all the body follows the head, dying his kind of death and receiving his kind of resurrection.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:3-45:6:5" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Rom. 6:3-5</a>; see BAPTISM.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The apostle Paul uses the functioning of the human body to illustrate the operation of the Christian congregation, likening the members living on earth at any particular time to a body, with Christ as the invisible Head. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:4-45:12:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rom. 12:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:1-46:12:31" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. chap. 12</a>) He emphasizes the importance of the place each member occupies, the interdependency, the mutual love and care and the accomplishment of work. God has set each one in his position in the body and through the various operations of the holy spirit the body performs what is necessary. The Head Jesus Christ, as liaison member, supplies the members of the body the things they need by means of “its joints,” which may have reference to the appointed overseers and ministerial servants, or those with special responsibilities, and through the “ligaments,” which may mean the connective and communicative provisions and directives, so that the “body” is spiritually well fed and each part informed of the movements and spiritual well-being of the rest of the body.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:19-51:2:19" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Col. 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>PROPER USE OF ONE’S BODY</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Christian should appreciate the body God has given him and should love himself to the extent of caring properly for his body so that he may be able to present it in acceptable, sacred <span id="page248" class="pageNum" data-no="248" data-before-text="248"></span>service to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Rom. 12:1</a>) This requires the use of reason and the maintenance of the body with food and other necessities along with physical cleanliness, but other types of care are even more important. These involve spirituality, seeking God’s kingdom and his righteousness, and the practice of moral uprightness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:25" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matt. 6:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:20-51:2:23" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> Col. 2:20-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="44-4" class="b"> 3:5</a>) The apostle counsels: “Bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">One who is a member of the Christian congregation, the body of Christ, and who commits fornication, is taking a member of the Christ away and making it a member of a harlot. Any Christian committing fornication not only is bringing in moral defilement but is also “sinning against his own [fleshly] body.” He is putting himself in peril of being removed from the body of Christ, the temple organization, and is exposing himself to the danger of syphilis and other venereal diseases. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:13-46:6:13" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:15-46:6:20" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 15-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:1-20:7:27" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> Prov. 7:1-27</a>) He may be ‘handed over by the congregation to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:5-46:5:5" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">One who is a member of the body of Christ, as well as other dedicated persons who are associated with these spiritually begotten body members, must also avoid spiritual fornication. The Scriptures call one who has friendship with the world an ‘adulteress.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) Jesus said of his disciples: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) Therefore, Jesus is careful that those who make up the members of his body are clean morally and spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:26-49:5:27" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Eph. 5:26, 27</a>) They are said to have their “bodies bathed with clean water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:22-58:10:22" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Heb. 10:22</a>) As the apostle Paul says, speaking of human husbands: “In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation, because we are members of his body. ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’ This sacred secret is great. Now I am speaking with respect to Christ and the congregation.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:32" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Eph. 5:28-32</a>; see parts of the body under their individual headings.</p>

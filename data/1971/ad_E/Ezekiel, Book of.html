<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This remarkable prophecy bears the name of the prophet who was given this series of prophetic warnings and visions. Ezekiel the son of Buzi, a priest, may have completed writing the book in Babylonia in the year 591 B.C.E. It covers a period of approximately twenty-two years, from 613 to about 591 B.C.E.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:17-26:29:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The book of Ezekiel is distinguished by visions, similes, allegories or parables and especially by performance of symbolic actions, as when Ezekiel was told by God to engrave a sketch of Jerusalem on a brick and then to stage a mock siege against it as a sign to Israel. (4:1-17) Other symbolic actions were the joining of two sticks, representing the two houses of Israel (37:15-23), and Ezekiel’s digging a hole in a wall and going out with his luggage, representing the captivity of Jerusalem. (12:3-13) The illustration of Oholah and Oholibah is one of the vivid allegories of the book. (Chap. 23) Another notable feature of the book of Ezekiel is the meticulous care Ezekiel took to date his prophecies, giving not only the year of King Jehoiachin’s exile but also the month and day of the month.—1:1, 2; 29:1; 30:20; 31:1; 32:1; 40:1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Proof of the book’s authenticity is to be found in the fulfillment of its prophecies. (For examples see TYRE; EDOM, EDOMITES; AMMONITES.) Further attesting to the authenticity of this book is archaeology. The noted American archaeologist W. F. Albright wrote in his book <em>The Bible After Twenty Years of Archaeology</em>: “Archaeological data have . . . demonstrated the substantial originality of the Books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, of Ezra and Nehemiah beyond doubt, they have confirmed the traditional picture of events as well as their order.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The authenticity of the book of Ezekiel is supported by its harmony with the other books of the Bible, although it is not quoted or cited directly by any of the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Allusions to some of its statements and similar expressions are, nevertheless, found profusely. Ezekiel and Jesus speak of the drying up of a moist tree. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:24-26:17:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 17:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:31-42:23:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 23:31</a>) Ezekiel and Jesus both spoke of a judgment of people as sheep and goats. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:17-26:34:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 34:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:32-40:25:33" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 25:32, 33</a>) The book of Revelation uses many illustrations similar to those in Ezekiel.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:28-26:1:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:28</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:3-66:4:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 4:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:10:3-26:10:4" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 10:3, 4</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:8-66:15:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 15:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:12:25-26:12:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 12:25</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:10:6-66:10:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 10:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:10-26:37:10" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 37:10</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:11-66:11:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 11:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is to be noted that among the Chester Beatty Greek Biblical papyri is one codex containing, among other portions of the Bible, Ezekiel, Daniel and Esther. These are all found in one codex, probably consisting originally of one hundred and eighteen leaves. It is a copy written by two scribes, likely in the first half of the third century, indicating the substantial soundness of the book of Ezekiel as it has come down to us.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Since Jeremiah and Ezekiel were contemporaries, their prophecies have many things in common. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:2-26:18:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:2</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:29-24:31:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:24:3-26:24:3" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 24:3</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:13-24:1:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:34:2-26:34:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 34:2</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:1-24:23:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jeremiah 23:1</a>.) Daniel and Ezekiel, also contemporaries, have similarities of expression in their writings. Ezekiel, while bound by cords, prophesied about the kingdom of Judah and designated a year in fulfillment for each day of the prophecy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:4-26:4:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:4-8</a>) Likewise, Daniel spoke of a tree stump banded and a day-for-a-year time feature, a prophecy concerning the kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:23-27:4:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 4:23</a>) Another time prophecy of Daniel was the seventy weeks in connection with the coming of the Messiah the Leader, also using a day to symbolize a year in the fulfillment.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:24-27:9:27" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">For the most part, Ezekiel’s prophecies and visions are arranged chronologically as well as topically. The four verses of chapter 29:17-20 are placed out of their chronological order (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:1-26:29:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 29:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:20-26:30:20" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 30:20</a>), but topically they belong here with the prophecy against Egypt. Up until the tenth month of the ninth year of the first captivity, the central point around which Ezekiel’s prophecies revolved was the complete fall and desolation of Jerusalem, with only brief references to the restoration. Such is the tenor of the first twenty-four chapters. During the siege of Jerusalem, the prophet turned his attention mainly to pronouncing woes upon the pagan nations <span id="page554" class="pageNum" data-no="554" data-before-text="554"></span>foreseen by Jehovah God as rejoicing over the downfall of Jerusalem. After arrival of the news that Jerusalem had fallen, the prophet sounds the glorious note of restoration, which is the predominant theme throughout the remainder of the book.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:20-26:33:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The book of Ezekiel reveals that Babylon’s false religion had been introduced into the precincts of Jehovah’s temple, particularly in the form of worshiping the Babylonian god Tammuz. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:13-26:8:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezek. 8:13, 14</a>) Besides such detestable false worship at Jehovah’s temple itself, the apostate Jews filled the land of Judah with violence. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that in his vision Ezekiel hears the call for Jehovah’s executioners to come with their weapons for smashing and to stand beside the altar in the inner courtyard of the temple. Jehovah then gives them orders to go through the midst of unfaithful Jerusalem and kill off everybody not marked as a worshiper of Jehovah: “Old man, young man and virgin and little child and women you should kill off—to a ruination. But to any man upon whom there is the mark do not go near, and from my sanctuary you should start.” (9:6) Ezekiel reports that Jehovah’s executioners started by killing first the sun-worshiping apostates at the temple porch. The temple was also bloodied by their killing off the seventy elderly men inside who were worshiping the idolatrous carvings on the wall and all those women who were sitting at the gate, weeping for the Babylonish god Tammuz. (8:7–9:8) The vision of Ezekiel was but a preview of what was about to befall Jerusalem when Jehovah made her drink the cup of wine of His rage out of His hand by means of His executional servant, King Nebuchadnezzar (Nebuchadrezzar), and his armies.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:9-24:25:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jer. 25:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:15-24:25:18" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 15-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Ezekiel’s prophecies of restoration must have been of comfort to the exiled Jews. In 593 B.C.E., in the twenty-fifth year of his exile, Ezekiel had his remarkable vision of a new temple of Jehovah, the pattern of which came from Jehovah God himself, and of an adjacent city called Jehovah-shammah, meaning “Jehovah Himself Is There.” (40:1–48:35) In the midst of a land of pagan idolatry it strengthened hope in the repentant Jewish exiles of again worshiping the true God, Jehovah, at his temple.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Ezekiel’s prophecy emphasizes the theme of the Bible, the sanctification of Jehovah’s name by the Kingdom. It points out that while God would permit a long period of vacancy on the throne of David, God had not abandoned his covenant with David for a kingdom. The Kingdom would be given to the one who had the legal right. Ezekiel thereby pointed the Jews, as did Daniel, to the hope of the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:27-26:21:27" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:22-26:37:22" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 37:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:24-26:37:25" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) Jehovah caused Ezekiel to say more than sixty times that people “will have to know that I am Jehovah.” Ezekiel magnifies the memorial name of God by using the expression ʼ<em>Adho·nayʹ Y<sup>e</sup>ho·wih</em>ʹ<em>,</em> “Lord Jehovah,” 215 times.</p>

JESSE
(Jesʹse) [perhaps, Jah exists].
Father of King David of the tribe of Judah; grandson of Ruth and Boaz and a link in the genealogical line from Abraham to Jesus. (Ruth 4:17, 22; Matt. 1:5, 6; Luke 3:31, 32) Jesse fathered eight sons, one of whom apparently died before producing any sons of his own, which may account for the omission of his name from the genealogies of Chronicles. (1 Sam. 16:10, 11; 17:12; 1 Chron. 2:12-15) The two sisters of David, Abigail and Zeruiah, are nowhere called Jesse’s daughters, but one is called “the daughter of Nahash.” (1 Chron. 2:16, 17; 2 Sam. 17:25) It may be that Nahash was the former husband of Jesse’s wife, making her girls half sisters to Jesse’s sons, unless Nahash is another name for Jesse, or even the name of his wife, as some have suggested.
Jesse was a sheep owner living at Bethlehem. After King Saul turned away from true worship, Jehovah sent Samuel to Jesse’s home to anoint one of his sons as king. Jesse brought in the seven older boys, but when Jehovah chose none of these Jesse was obliged to call his youngest son David from pasturing the sheep; this son was Jehovah’s choice.—1 Sam. 16:1-13.
When Saul summoned David to play the soothing harp for him, aged Jesse sent along a generous gift and later granted permission for David to remain some time in attendance at Saul’s court. (1 Sam. 16:17-23; 17:12) Later, when it appears that David was back again tending the sheep, Jesse sent him with some provisions for the three oldest boys, who were in Saul’s army. (1 Sam. 17:13, 15, 17, 18, 20) During the time David was outlawed by Saul, Jesse and his wife were given asylum in Moab.—1 Sam. 22:3, 4.
Often David is called “the son of Jesse,” disparagingly, by persons such as Saul, Doeg, Nabal and Sheba (1 Sam. 20:27, 30, 31; 22:7-9, 13; 25:10; 2 Sam. 20:1; 1 Ki. 12:16; 2 Chron. 10:16), but more respectfully in other instances, for example, by David himself, Ezra, Jehovah God and others.—1 Sam. 16:18; 17:58; 2 Sam. 23:1; 1 Chron. 10:14; 12:18; 29:26; Ps. 72:20; Luke 3:32; Acts 13:22.
The prophetic promise that the “root of Jesse” would ‘stand up as a signal for the peoples’ and would judge in righteousness finds fulfillment in Christ Jesus.—Isa. 11:1-5, 10; Rom. 15:8, 12.

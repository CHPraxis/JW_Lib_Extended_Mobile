Joseph was displeased when Jacob crossed his hands in order to lay his right hand on Ephraim, Joseph’s younger son. But Jacob did this purposely, to give Ephraim the superior blessing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:48:13-1:48:20" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Gen. 48:13-20</a>) To be on the right hand of a ruler was to have the most important position, next to the ruler himself (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:55-44:7:56" data-bid="69-2" class="b"> Acts 7:55, 56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:34-45:8:34" data-bid="69-3" class="b"> Rom. 8:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:22-60:3:22" data-bid="69-4" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:22</a>), or a position in his favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:33-40:25:33" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Matt. 25:33</a>) Jesus is spoken of in the vision of Revelation as having the seven stars (overseers) of the seven congregations in his right hand, that is, having his favor and being under his full control, power and direction.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:16-66:1:16" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Rev. 1:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:20-66:1:20" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:1-66:2:1" data-bid="71-3" class="b"> 2:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">For God to take hold of one’s right hand would strengthen that one. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:23-19:73:23" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ps. 73:23</a>) Usually the right hand of a warrior was his sword-wielding hand, and it was unprotected by the shield in the left hand. Therefore, a friend would stand or fight at his right hand as an upholder and protector. This circumstance is used metaphorically with regard to God’s help and protection to those serving him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:8-19:16:8" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ps. 16:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:109:30-19:109:31" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 109:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:5-19:110:5" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 110:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:121:5-19:121:5" data-bid="73-4" class="b"> 121:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The writer of Ecclesiastes says: “The heart of the wise is at his right hand, but the heart of the stupid at his left hand.” In other words, the wise one is motivated toward a good, favorable path, but the stupid one inclines to a bad course.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:10:2-21:10:2" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Eccl. 10:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Hebrew expressions for “right hand” and “left hand” are also translated “south” and “north,” respectively (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:15-1:14:15" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Gen. 14:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:12-19:89:12" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> Ps. 89:12</a>), since directions were reckoned from the standpoint of a person facing the E.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The <em>“handbreadth”</em> was a unit of measure.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Me-jarʹkon) [waters of Jarkon, or, possibly, waters of pale (or yellowish) green].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some scholars believe that Me-jarkon in the territory of Dan (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:40-6:19:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:40, 41,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:46-6:19:46" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 46</a>) is the Nahr el-ʽAuja (“winding river”) that enters the Mediterranean Sea about four miles (6 kilometers) N of Joppa. Its headwaters, among the largest springs in Palestine, take their rise about nine miles (14 kilometers) inland near the suggested site of Aphek. Initially the waters flow through a swamp of reeds, rushes, willows and grasses. As the river carries away part of the soil its waters become yellowish. This may account for the name “Me-jarkon” (“waters of pale [or yellowish] green”).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another view is that the original Hebrew text, like the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> may have read ‘and on the west [or, on the sea] Jarkon,’ and Tell Qasileh, situated within the limits of Tel Aviv, has been presented as a possible identification for Jarkon.</p>

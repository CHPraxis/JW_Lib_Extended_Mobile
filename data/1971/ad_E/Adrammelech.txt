ADRAMMELECH
(A·dramʹme·lech) [“Adar is king,” or “the lordship of Melech”].
1. A son of Assyrian king Sennacherib. Adrammelech and his brother Sharezer killed their father while he was bowing down at the house of his god Nisroch at Nineveh following the failure of his attack of Jerusalem. They then escaped to the land of Ararat apparently in the location of ancient Armenia in the mountainous region to the W of what is now known as the Caspian Sea. (2 Ki. 19:35-37; Isa. 37:36-38) An inscription of Esar-haddon, another son of Sennacherib, relates that as his father’s successor he engaged and defeated the armies of his father’s murderers at Hanigalbat in that region.
2. A god worshiped by the Sepharvites, one of the subjugated peoples the king of Assyria brought into the territory of Samaria after his taking the Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom into exile. It was to Adrammelech and Anammelech that the Sepharvites sacrificed their sons in the fire.—2 Ki. 17:22-24, 31, 33.
On the basis of the name “Adrammelech,” a number of varying conclusions have been drawn concerning the nature of this deity. Believing the name actually to be “Adad-melekh,” some suggest that he was the Babylonian god of storm and rain, Adad, worshiped in the manner of the Ammonite god Melekh (Molech). (Compare 1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:10; Jeremiah 7:31.) Others regard Adrammelech as a sun-god, interpreting his name to mean “fire-king.”

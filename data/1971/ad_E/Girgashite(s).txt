GIRGASHITE(S)
(Girʹga·shite[s]).
A people descended from Ham through Canaan. (Gen. 10:6, 15, 16; 1 Chron. 1:8, 13, 14) The Girgashites resided W of the Jordan. Although powerful, they and six other Canaanite nations suffered defeat, for Jehovah delivered them into the hands of his people. (Deut. 7:1, 2; Josh. 3:10; 24:11) This fulfilled God’s promise made to Abraham centuries earlier. (Gen. 15:13-21; Neh. 9:7, 8) The names “Girgash” and “Ben-Girgash,” found in the Ugaritic literature, have been cited as indirect confirmation of the Girgashites’ existence.

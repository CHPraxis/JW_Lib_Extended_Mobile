PUR
A foreign (non-Hebrew) word found at Esther 3:7 and 9:24, 26; it means “the Lot” (Heb., goh·ralʹ; see LOT, I). This is the singular form, the plural being “Purim.” (Esther 9:26, 28-32) “Pur” is variously described in lexicons as being a Persian (linked with the Persian pâre, “part, portion”) or Akkadian word. It is the source of the name of the Jewish festival Purim.—See PURIM.

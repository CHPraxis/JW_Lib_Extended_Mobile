<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The sixth letter of the Greek alphabet; from it the English “z” originates. <em>Zeʹta</em> had the diphthongal sound of the English <em>dz,</em> later the sound of <em>z</em>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Its equivalent in Hebrew is <em>zaʹyin.</em> Though <em>zeʹta</em> is the sixth letter in order, numerically it is equal to seven when it has the acute accent (ζ΄), and, 7,000, with the subscript (,ζ). For the number six, the digamma (====) or the accented final form of sigma (ς΄) is used.</p>

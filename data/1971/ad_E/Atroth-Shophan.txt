ATROTH-SHOPHAN
(Atʹroth-shoʹphan) [crowns of Shophan]. 1
A city rebuilt by the tribe of Gad from among those captured from the realms of Kings Sihon and Og. (Num. 32:33, 35) A suggested location is that of Rujm ʽAtarus, about one and a half miles (2.4 kilometers) NE of the site of Ataroth, this identification being based on a presumed relationship with the latter city. Others, however, consider it likely to have been located farther N in the same area as Jazer and Jogbehah, mentioned after Atroth-shophan.

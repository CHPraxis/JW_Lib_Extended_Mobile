BAALATH-BEER
(Baʹal·ath-beʹer) [mistress of a well].
An enclave city of Simeon within the territorial limits of Judah. (Josh. 19:1, 8) Also called “Ramah of the south” (or Negeb), it is evidently referred to simply as Baal at 1 Chronicles 4:33 and may be the same as the “Ramoth of the south” at 1 Samuel 30:27. The references to it would place it S of Beer-sheba, well into the Negeb.

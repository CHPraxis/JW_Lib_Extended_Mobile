<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Agʹa·bus).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Christian prophet who, together with other prophets, came down from Jerusalem to Antioch of Syria during the year of Paul’s stay there. Agabus foretold through the spirit “that a great famine was about to come upon the entire inhabited earth [Gr., <em>oi·kou·meʹnen</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:27-44:11:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 11:27, 28</a>) Concerning the use of the word <em>oi·kou·meʹne</em> in this text, <em>Barnes’ Notes on the New Testament</em> (p. 451) states: “The word here used . . . usually denotes the inhabitable world, the parts of the earth which are cultivated and occupied. It is sometimes limited, however, to denote an <em>entire land</em> or <em>country,</em> in contradistinction from <em>the parts</em> of it; thus, to denote <em>the whole</em> of the land of Palestine in distinction from its parts, or to denote that an event would have reference to <em>all</em> the land, and not be confined to one or more parts, as Galilee, Samaria, etc.”—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:1-42:2:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It appears that the brothers in Antioch understood this prophecy as applying to the land of Palestine, since the next verse (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:29-44:11:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 11:29</a>) states that they determined “to send a relief ministration to the brothers <em>dwelling in Judea.</em>” As the account states the prophecy was fulfilled during the reign of Emperor Claudius I (41-54 C.E.). The Jewish historian Josephus (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book XX, chap. II, par. 5; chap. V, par. 2) refers to this “great famine” and indicates that it lasted for three or more years.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Toward the close of Paul’s last missionary tour (about 56 C.E.), he was met in Caesarea by Agabus, who illustrated a prophecy of Paul’s future arrest in Jerusalem by binding his own hands and feet with Paul’s girdle.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:8-44:21:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 21:8-11</a>.</p>

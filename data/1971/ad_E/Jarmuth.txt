JARMUTH
(Jarʹmuth) [a height].
1. One of five Amorite cities involved in the attempted punitive expedition against the Gibeonites. Its king, Piram, and his allies were defeated by Joshua. Thereafter this city of the Shephelah was assigned to Judah. (Josh. 10:3-5, 23-25; 12:7, 11; 15:20, 33, 35) After the Babylonian exile Judeans again resided at Jarmuth. (Neh. 11:25, 29) Khirbet Yarmuk, some sixteen miles (c. 26 kilometers) SW of Jerusalem, seems to be the ancient site. Situated on a hilltop, it overlooks the coastal plains as far as Gaza by the Mediterranean Sea.
2. A city in Issachar assigned to the Gershonites. (Josh. 21:27-29) It is believed to be the same as Ramoth (1 Chron. 6:73) and Remeth.—Josh. 19:21; see RAMOTH.

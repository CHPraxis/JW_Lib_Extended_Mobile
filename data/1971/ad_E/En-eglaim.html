<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(En-egʹla·im) [spring of two calves].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a symbolic vision given to Ezekiel the salt-laden waters of the Dead Sea were to be “healed” and fishers were to stand on its shores from En-gedi up to En-eglaim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:8-26:47:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:8-10</a>) The name itself indicates a place by a spring. Some identify En-eglaim with ʽAin Hajlah. This site, however, is not on, but about three and a half miles (5.6 kilometers) N of the Dead Sea. For this reason, most scholars today prefer to connect En-eglaim with ʽAin Feshka, near the NW end of the Dead Sea. ʽAin Feshka and, some eighteen miles (29 kilometers) to the S, ʽAin Jidi (which perpetuates the name of En-gedi) constitute the two major oases on the Dead Sea’s western shore.</p>

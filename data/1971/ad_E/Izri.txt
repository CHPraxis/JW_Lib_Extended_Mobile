IZRI
(Izʹri) [perhaps, contraction for “Jehovah has formed”].
The leader of the fourth course of twelve musicians at Jehovah’s sanctuary under David’s reorganization. (1 Chron. 25:7, 8, 11) Without the Hebrew letter yohdh at the beginning, his name is spelled “Zeri” in verse 3, where he is identified as a son of Jeduthun.

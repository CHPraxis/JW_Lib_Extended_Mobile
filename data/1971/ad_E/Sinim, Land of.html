<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Siʹnim),</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A country from which, it was foretold, scattered Israelites would come, to dwell in and rehabilitate their homeland. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:12-23:49:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 49:12</a>) Reference to the N and W in the same verse suggests that Sinim was S or E of Palestine. Instead of “Sinim,” the <em>Septuagint</em> reads “land of the Persians” (Bagster), which could include Elam, called Si-nim in Old Akkadian. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:11-23:11:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:11</a>.) The Targums and the <em>Vulgate,</em> on the other hand, read “[land] to the south.” Certain scholars have suggested identification with the wilderness of Sin or the cities of Syene or Sin (Pelusium?), all generally S of the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:1-2:16:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 16:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:6-26:30:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ezek. 30:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:15-26:30:15" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 15</a>) Some have even suggested distant Sinae (China), but the presence of Israelites there is said to date only from a later time, the third century B.C.E. Hence, there is uncertainty as to Sinim’s location.</p>

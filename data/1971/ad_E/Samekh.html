<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Saʹmekh</em> corresponds generally to the sound of English “s.” This letter represents the sound that the Ephraimites used when endeavoring to pronounce the word “shibboleth,” which begins with the letter <em>shin</em> (ש) rather than with <em>saʹmekh.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:12:6-7:12:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 12:6</a>; see also SIN or SHIN.) In the Hebrew, <em>saʹmekh</em> is the initial letter in each of the eight verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:113-19:119:120" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:113-120</a>.</p>

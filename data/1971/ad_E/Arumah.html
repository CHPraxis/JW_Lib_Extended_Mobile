<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in the territory of Ephraim in which Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, resided and from which he launched his attack on the Shechemites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:41-7:9:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 9:41</a>) It is tentatively identified with El ʽOrmeh, about six miles (9.7 kilometers) SE of Shechem. Some suggest that it is the same as the “Rumah” referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:36-12:23:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:36</a>.—See RUMAH.</p>

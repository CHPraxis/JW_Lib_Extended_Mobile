MATRITES
(Matʹrites).
A Benjamite family of which King Saul of Israel was a member. (1 Sam. 10:21) The Authorized Version uses the name “Matri” (Maʹtri), meaning “rainy.” However, the Hebrew word mat·riʹ here is accompanied by the definite article. Thus the New World Translation appropriately reads “the Matrites,” as do the other modern translations.—AS; AT; RS.

AMPHIPOLIS
(Am·phipʹo·lis) [around the city].
A city of Macedonia, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Aegean Sea and the seaport of Eion. Paul passed through here on his second missionary tour. (Acts 17:1) It was built on a hill surrounded on three sides by the curving river Strymon, which situation doubtless gave name to the city. Amphipolis lay about thirty miles (48.3 kilometers) W-SW of Philippi and, due to its position on the famous Roman highway Via Egnatia and its control of the bridge over the river Strymon, was of considerable importance strategically and commercially. Originally founded as an Athenian colony in the fifth century B.C.E., it later came under the Macedonians. Thereafter Rome took control and made it a free city and capital of the first district of Macedonia. The village of Neochori is now found there.

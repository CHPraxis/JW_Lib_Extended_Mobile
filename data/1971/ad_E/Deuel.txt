DEUEL
(Deuʹel) [knowledge of God].
One whose son Eliasaph served as the chieftain of the tribe of Gad during Israel’s wilderness wanderings. (Num. 1:14; 7:42, 47; 10:20) In the Masoretic text and the Syriac Peshitta Version he is called “Reuel” at Numbers 2:14. This may be due to a scribal error, since the Hebrew letters for “d” and “r” are very similar and the name “Deuel” does, in fact, appear at Numbers 2:14 in the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Latin Vulgate and over a hundred Hebrew manuscripts.

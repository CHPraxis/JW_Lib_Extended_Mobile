<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shiʹhor-libʹnath) [turbid stream of Libnath].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Eusebius and Jerome believed Shihor-libnath originally constituted the name of two sites, Shihor <em>and</em> Labanath. However, it is apparently a river on Asher’s boundary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:24-26</a>) Some geographers connect the Shihor-libnath with the Nahr ez-Zerqa, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea about six miles (9.7 kilometers) S of Dor.</p>

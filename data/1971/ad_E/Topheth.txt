TOPHETH
(Toʹpheth) [perhaps, place of burning].
A place outside Jerusalem. There, for a considerable period, unfaithful Israelites, including Ahaz and Manasseh, engaged in child sacrifice. Finally, King Josiah made it unfit for worship. (2 Ki. 23:16; 2 Chron. 28:3; 33:6; Jer. 7:31-33; 19:3-14; 32:35; see HINNOM, VALLEY OF) Topheth probably occupied a section of the eastern part of the Valley of Hinnom near the Gate of the Potsherds. (Jer. 19:2, 6, 14) At Isaiah 30:33 Topheth is used figuratively as a place of burning with fire, to represent the destruction that was to come upon Assyria.

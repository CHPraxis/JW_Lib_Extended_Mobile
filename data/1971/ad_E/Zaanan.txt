ZAANAN
(Zaʹa·nan) [migrating, departure, or, perhaps, rich in flocks].
A town mentioned by the prophet Micah as among places due to experience the foretold invasion of Judah. (Mic. 1:11) Many scholars consider it to be the same as Zenan at Joshua 15:37. The suggested identification is with ʽAraq el-Kharba, in the Shephelah region of Judah, about four miles (c. 6 kilometers) NW of Lachish.

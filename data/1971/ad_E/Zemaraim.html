<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A Benjamite city mentioned with Bethel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:21-6:18:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 18:21, 22</a>) It is often suggested that it was near or at Ras ez-Zeimara, over three miles (5 kilometers) NE of Bethel. Nevertheless, the exact location of Zemaraim is unknown.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. An eminence in the mountainous region of Ephraim. From this mountain, King Abijah of Judah spoke, pointing out that Jeroboam and the ten tribes of Israel had rejected Jehovah’s kingdom covenant with David. Apparently, Bethel was in the same neighborhood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:4-14:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:19-14:13:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19</a>) Possibly Mount Zemaraim was named for the Benjamite city of Zemaraim, but the mountain’s precise location remains undetermined.</p>

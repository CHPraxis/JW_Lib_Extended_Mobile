<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Chilʹmad) [meaning uncertain].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently a place listed among those trading with Tyre in the sale of fine clothing, dyed materials, carpets and ropes.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:2-26:27:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:23-26:27:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the phrase “Asshur and Chilmad were your traders,” the word “and” is supplied, not appearing in the Hebrew text. Because of this the version of the Jewish Publication Society prefers the rendering: “Asshur was as thine apprentice in traffic,” thereby not translating Chilmad as a proper name. Most translations, however, treat Chilmad as a place-name. Some authorities suggest an identification with Kalwadha, a city near Baghdad. The changing of an “m” for a “w” is common in Assyro-Babylonian.</p>

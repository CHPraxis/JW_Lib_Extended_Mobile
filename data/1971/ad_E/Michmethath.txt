MICHMETHATH
(Mich·meʹthath) [possibly, hiding place].
A site on the boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh. It is often identified with Khirbet Juleijil, less than two miles (3 kilometers) SE of the suggested site of ancient Shechem. This agrees with the Biblical statement that Michmethath was “in front of Shechem.”—Josh. 16:5, 6; 17:7.

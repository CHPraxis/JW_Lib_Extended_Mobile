ZERETH-SHAHAR
(Zeʹreth-shaʹhar) [brightness of the dawn].
A site in Reuben situated “in the mountain of the low plain.” (Josh. 13:15, 19) The exact location of Zereth-shahar is now unknown. However, the name may be reflected in that of Zarat, situated at the hot springs of Callirhoe on the Dead Sea’s E shore.

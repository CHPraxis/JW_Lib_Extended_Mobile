MACHBENAH
(Mach·beʹnah) [knob, lump].
The name appears in a list of Caleb’s descendants through his concubine Maacah, her son Sheva being called the “father of Machbenah and the father of Gibea.” (1 Chron. 2:48, 49) Some commentators, noting that many of the names in this section also occur as names of towns, suggest that Machbenah may be the name of a town founded or ‘fathered’ by Sheva. See, however, ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.

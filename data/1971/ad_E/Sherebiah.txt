SHEREBIAH
(She·re·biʹah) [Jehovah has sent parching heat].
1. A prominent Levite who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E.—Neh. 12:1, 8.
2. A Levite descended from Mahli; “a man of discretion” who was summoned to join Ezra on his journey to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E. (Ezra 8:17, 18) He is probably the same person as the ‘chief of the priests’ mentioned in Ezra 8:24, one of those entrusted with transporting to Jerusalem the valuable things contributed for temple use.—Ezra 8:25-30.
3. A Levite who assisted Ezra with reading and explaining the Law to the people assembled in Jerusalem after the wall was rebuilt in 455 B.C.E. (Neh. 8:2, 7, 8) Later the same month, they again convened and Sherebiah joined in proposing a “trustworthy arrangement,” which the nation ratified, promising to remain faithful to Jehovah. (Neh. 9:1, 4, 5, 38) This Sherebiah may have been the same Levite as No. 2 above, personally attesting to the covenant, or he may have been a representative of some family by that name, perhaps descended from No. 1 above.—Neh. 10:1, 9, 12; 12:24.

MATTHIAS
(Mat·thiʹas) [Greek for Mattathiah, gift of Jehovah].
The disciple selected by lot to replace Judas Iscariot as an apostle. After Jesus’ ascension to heaven, Peter, noting that Psalm 109:8 foretold Judas’ deflection and added, “his office of oversight let someone else take,” proposed to the approximately 120 disciples gathered together that the vacancy of office be filled. Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias were put up for selection and, after prayer, lots were cast, Matthias being chosen. Occurring just a few days prior to the outpouring of holy spirit, this is the last instance reported in the Bible of the lot being resorted to in determining Jehovah’s choice in a matter.—Acts 1:15-26.
According to Peter’s words (verses 21, 22), Matthias had been a follower of Christ throughout Jesus’ three-and-a-half-year ministry, closely associated with the apostles, and was quite likely one of the seventy disciples or evangelists whom Jesus sent out to preach. (Luke 10:1) After his selection, he was “reckoned along with the eleven apostles” by the congregation (Acts 1:26), and when Acts immediately thereafter speaks of “the apostles” or “the twelve,”—Matthias was included.—Acts 2:37, 43; 4:33, 36; 5:12, 29; 6:2, 6; 8:1, 14; 9:27; see PAUL.

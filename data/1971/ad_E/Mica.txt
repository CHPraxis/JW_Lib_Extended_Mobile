MICA
(Miʹca) [probably an abbreviated form of “Micaiah,” meaning “who is like Jah (Jehovah)?”].
The English names “Mica” and “Micah” have resulted from a minor difference in the Hebrew spelling.
1. Son of Mephibosheth (Merib-baal) and grandson of King Saul’s son Jonathan. Mica (also called Micah) was the father of Pithon, Melech, Tarea (Tahrea) and Ahaz.—2 Sam. 9:12; 1 Chron. 8:33-35; 9:39-41.
2. One of the Levites (or the forefather of one) attesting by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s time.—Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 9, 11.
3. A Levite descendant of Asaph and the son of Zichri (also identified as Zabdi and Zaccur). Mica was the father of Mattaniah and is also called Micah and Micaiah.—1 Chron. 9:14, 15; Neh. 11:17, 22; 12:35.

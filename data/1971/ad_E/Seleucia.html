<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A fortified Mediterranean port town serving Syrian Antioch and located about sixteen miles (26 kilometers) SW of that city. The two sites were connected by road; and the navigable Orontes River, which flowed past Antioch, emptied into the Mediterranean Sea a few miles S of Seleucia. Accompanied by Barnabas, Paul sailed from Seleucia at the start of his first missionary journey, in 47 C.E.

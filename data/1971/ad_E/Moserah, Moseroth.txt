MOSERAH, MOSEROTH
(Mo·seʹrah, Mo·seʹroth) [perhaps, band(s) (as a fetter); or, chastisement, possibly alluding to Aaron’s death].
The place where the Israelites were encamped when Aaron died. (Deut. 10:6) It was evidently near Mount Hor (whereon Aaron died), but its exact location is unknown. (Num. 33:38) Some scholars tentatively locate Moserah seventeen miles (27 kilometers) W-SW of Jebel Madurah (Mount Hor?). The plural form of Moserah, “Moseroth,” appears at Numbers 33:30, 31, and apparently refers to an earlier Israelite encampment there.

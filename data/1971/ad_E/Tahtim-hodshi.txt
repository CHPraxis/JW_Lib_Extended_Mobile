TAHTIM-HODSHI
(Tahʹtim-hodʹshi).
A “land” on the route of the census takers sent out by David. (2 Sam. 24:4-6) The exact location of Tahtim-hodshi is not known. However, it is mentioned between Gilead and Dan-jaan, placing it in the northern part of the Promised Land. The Lagardian edition of the Greek Septuagint says “land of the Hittites toward Kadesh,” a similar reading being used by some modern translations.—JB, NE (1970 ed.), RS.

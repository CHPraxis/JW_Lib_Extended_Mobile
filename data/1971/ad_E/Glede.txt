GLEDE
Glede [Heb., day·yahʹ].
The Hebrew name for this bird occurs in the list of unclean birds at Deuteronomy 14:13, but does not appear in the corresponding list at Leviticus 11:14. Five Hebrew manuscripts, and also the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Septuagint Version, omit day·yahʹ at Deuteronomy 14:13. Some scholars believe that it may be a scribal correction originally placed in the margin but which eventually was introduced into the text itself. However, the plural form (dhay·yohthʹ) appears at Isaiah 34:15 as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation.
It is suggested that the Hebrew name of this bird is derived from the verb meaning “to fly swiftly.” The identification of the bird meant is quite uncertain; hence, the English name “glede” is probably as suitable a translation as any, since “glede” in English is a name variously applied to any of several birds of prey, though especially to the common European kite. Most modern authorities relate the Hebrew dhay·yohthʹ to the kite, there being more than one variety of this bird found in Palestine.—See KITE.

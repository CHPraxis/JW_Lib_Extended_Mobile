BERED
(Beʹred) [hail, seed place].
1. A grandson of Ephraim through Shuthelah.—1 Chron. 7:20.
2. A place in southern Palestine mentioned in the account of Hagar’s fleeing from Sarai. (Gen. 16:14) The well of Beer-lahai-roi, at which Hagar stopped, lay in the wilderness between Bered and Kadesh, on the way to Shur. (Gen. 16:7) The wilderness of Shur is a region SW of Philistia and on the way to Egypt, which may indicate that Hagar was heading back to her homeland.—Ex. 15:22.
The present site of Bered is indefinite, although the name may be preserved in that of the Wadi Umm el-Bared.

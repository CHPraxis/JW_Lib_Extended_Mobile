JATTIR
(Jatʹtir) [possibly, preeminence].
A priestly city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Josh. 15:20, 48; 21:9, 10, 14; 1 Chron. 6:54, 57) It was to Jattir that David sent a portion of the spoils of victory taken from Amalekite raiders. Perhaps this was in appreciation for hospitality and friendship accorded to him, a fugitive from King Saul.—1 Sam. 30:17-20, 26, 27, 31.
Jattir is usually identified with Khirbet ʽAttir, about thirteen miles (c. 21 kilometers) SW of Hebron.

ZEPHATH
(Zeʹphath) [perhaps, watchtower].
A royal Canaanite city in the southern part of Judah’s territory, apparently S of Arad, captured by the combined forces of Judah and Simeon. (Judg. 1:16, 17; compare Joshua 15:30; 19:4) The city was renamed “Hormah,” meaning “a devoting [to destruction).” This city, like the other cities of the Canaanites, had been placed ‘under ban’ by Jehovah, and was to be devoted to destruction. (Deut. 7:1-4) The tribes of Judah and Simeon were now applying the terms of that ban on Zephath. Zephath may have been the principal Canaanite city of that district or area.
On the basis of the similarity of the names, various locations have been suggested, such as Tell esh-Sherʽah, Tell es-Seba, and the pass es-Sufa, to the NW, E, and SE of Beer-sheba respectively. An older identification, Sebata or Sebaita, some twenty-two miles (35.4 kilometers) N-NE of Kadesh-barnea, seems to fit the description better.—See DEVOTE; HORMAH.

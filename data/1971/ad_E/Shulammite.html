<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shuʹlam·mite).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The designation for the beautiful country girl who is the principal character of The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:6:13-22:6:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon (6:13</a>). Likely this title portrays her as from the city of Shunem (modern Solem). (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:3-11:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 1:3</a>.) Lending support to this view is the fact that the <em>Septuagint Version</em> calls the girl the “Sunamite.” Also, the ecclesiastical writer Eusebius of the fourth century C.E. referred to Shunem as Shulem.</p>

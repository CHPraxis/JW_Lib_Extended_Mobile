MAHANEH-DAN
(Maʹha·neh-dan) [camp of Dan].
A place once described as lying “between Zorah and Eshtaol” (Judg. 13:25) and another time as being located W of Kiriath-jearim. (Judg. 18:11, 12) Some believe that these are two different sites, since the suggested locations for Eshtaol and Zorah are a number of miles SW of Kiriath-jearim. In any event, the location(s) of Mahaneh-dan is unknown. Its name means “Camp of Dan” and, therefore, perhaps simply denoted a temporary settlement or a campsite and could understandably apply to more than one place.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>bot·nimʹ</em> is generally understood to designate the fruit of the <em>Pistacia vera</em> tree. This deciduous tree thrives in dry areas and seldom reaches a height in excess of thirty feet (9 meters). The nuts measure about one-half to three-fourths of an inch (1.3 to 1.9 centimeters) in length and grow in large clusters. The thin, but hard, light-colored shell of ripe pistachio nuts is covered with a somewhat wrinkly husk. Each nut contains one yellow-green kernel surrounded by thin reddish skin. The kernel has a mild, sweet flavor, and is commonly eaten raw or fried. Sometimes kernels are pressed for oil, and ground kernels are used for confectionery items.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Pistachio nuts were among the “finest products of the land” of Canaan that were brought as a gift by Jacob’s sons to one who was a ruler in Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:11-1:43:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 43:11</a>) Even in modern times large quantities of pistachio nuts have been exported from parts of the Middle East.</p>

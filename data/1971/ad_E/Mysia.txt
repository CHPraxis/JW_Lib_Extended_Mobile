MYSIA
(Mysʹi·a).
A region in the northwestern part of Asia Minor. Its boundaries appear to have fluctuated, but basically Mysia was bounded from W to N by the Aegean Sea, the Hellespont (Dardanelles) and Propontis (Sea of Marmara). Bithynia lay to the E and Lydia to the S. (See ASIA.) While on his second missionary journey, Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy, endeavored to go to Bithynia, but “the spirit of Jesus did not permit them. So they passed Mysia by and came down to Troas.” (Acts 15:40; 16:1-3, 7, 8) Since the seaport of Troas was in Mysia, evidently this means that Paul and his companions, although going through Mysia, omitted it as a field of missionary activity. Other cities of Mysia were Adramyttium (Acts 27:2), Assos (Acts 20:13, 14) and Pergamum.—Rev. 1:11; see TROAS.

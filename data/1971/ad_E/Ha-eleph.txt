HA-ELEPH
(Ha-eʹleph) [the thousand].
A city of Benjamin, the site of which is today unknown. (Josh. 18:21, 28) Some scholars think that Ha-eleph may actually be part of the name of the preceding city, “Zelah.” However, those who would combine “Zelah” with “Ha-eleph” thereby reduce the number of cities to thirteen, and this does not agree with the Bible’s reference to fourteen cities.

RECORDER
A highly responsible officer in the royal court of Israel. The title is translated from a form of the Hebrew word za·kharʹ, “remember.” His duties are not described in the Bible, but it appears that he was the official chronicler of the kingdom, furnishing the king with information on developments in the realm and also reminding him of important matters for his attention, supplying advice thereon.
On occasion the recorder represented the king on important national matters, Joah the son of Asaph being one of the officials of King Hezekiah to go out to speak to the Assyrian Rabshakeh when he threatened Jerusalem. (2 Ki. 18:18, 37) Another recorder, Joah the son of Joahaz, officiated in connection with the repairing of the temple. (2 Chron. 34:8) A recorder is named also in the courts of David and Solomon.—2 Sam. 8:16; 20:24; 1 Ki. 4:3.
The ‘recorder’ or ‘writer’ seen in vision by Ezekiel was a scribe or secretary.—Ezek. 9:3, 4.

GEDEROTH
(Ge·deʹroth) [sheepfolds].
A city in the Shephelah assigned to Judah (Josh. 15:20, 33, 41) and one of the places taken by the Philistines during the reign of King Ahaz (761-745 B.C.E.). (2 Chron. 28:18, 19) Some geographers locate Gederoth at Katrah, about eight and a half miles (13.7 kilometers) NE of Ashdod, though others say this is too far W to be in the Shephelah.

CARMI
(Carʹmi) [vinedresser].
1. A son of Reuben and the brother of Hanoch, Pallu and Hezron; forefather of the Carmites. Carmi, with the rest of Jacob’s household, came to Egypt in 1728 B.C.E.—Gen. 46:9; Ex. 6:14; Num. 26:6; 1 Chron. 5:3.
2. Father of Achan; a descendant of Judah and Tamar through Zerah and Zabdi. (Josh. 7:1, 18) The designation “sons of Judah” at 1 Chronicles 4:1, where Carmi is listed, evidently is to be understood as including later descendants.—Compare 1 Chronicles 2:4-7.

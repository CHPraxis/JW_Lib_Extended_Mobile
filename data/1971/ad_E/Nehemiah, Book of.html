<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A book of the Hebrew Scriptures that primarily relates events occurring shortly before and during Nehemiah’s governorship in Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:14-16:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Neh. 5:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:6-16:13:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13:6, 7</a>) The opening words of this inspired account identify the writer as “Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:1-16:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1</a>), and much of it is written in the first person.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>TIME COVERED AND TIME OF WRITING</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The month of Chislev (November-December) of a certain twentieth year is the reference point with which the historical narrative begins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:1-16:1:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1</a>) As evident from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a>, this twentieth year must be that of Artaxerxes’ reign. Obviously, the twentieth year in this case is not reckoned as starting in Nisan (March-April), for Chislev of the twentieth year could not then precede Nisan (mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a>) of the same twentieth year. So it may be that Nehemiah used his own count of time, reckoning the lunar year as beginning with Tishri (September-October), which month Jews today recognize as the beginning of their civil year. Another possibility is that the Persians, unlike the Babylonians, may have reckoned the reigns of their kings as starting in the fall or on the actual date that the monarch ascended the throne. This could be so even though the Babylonian scribes continued to reckon the years of the Persian king’s reign on their customary basis of a Nisan-to-Nisan count, as their cuneiform tablets show they did.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Reliable historical evidence and the fulfillment of Bible prophecy (see ARTAXERXES No. 3) point to 455 B.C.E. as the year in which Nisan of the twentieth year of Artaxerxes’ reign fell. Accordingly, the Chislev preceding Nisan of that twentieth year would <span id="page1217" class="pageNum" data-no="1217" data-before-text="1217"></span>fall in 456 B.C.E. and the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes’ reign (the last date mentioned in Nehemiah [13:6]) would include part of 443 B.C.E. Therefore, the book of Nehemiah covers a period from Chislev of 456 B.C.E. until sometime after 443 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It was in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes’ reign that Nehemiah left Jerusalem. Upon his return, he found that the Jews were not supporting the priests and Levites, the sabbath law was being violated, many had married foreign women, and the offspring of the mixed marriages did not even know how to speak the language of the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:10-16:13:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Neh. 13:10-27</a>) For conditions to have deteriorated to this point indicates that Nehemiah’s absence entailed a considerable period. But there is no way to determine just how long after 443 B.C.E. Nehemiah completed the book bearing his name.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The book of Nehemiah exalts Jehovah God.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">There is also historical information in this book that is found elsewhere in the Hebrew Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:7-16:9:35" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Neh. 9:7-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:26-16:13:26" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 13:26</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:17-16:13:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:17, 18</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:21-24:17:27" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:21-27</a>.) And contemporary history in the account illustrates other Biblical passages. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:123:0-19:123:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalms 123 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:129:0-19:129:8" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 129</a> find a historical parallel in what was experienced by Nehemiah and the other Jews in connection with their rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:1-16:4:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Neh. 4:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:4:9-16:4:9" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:1-16:6:14" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 6:1-14</a>) Jehovah’s causing Artaxerxes to do his will by granting Nehemiah’s request to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem historically illustrates <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:1-20:21:1" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:1</a>: “A king’s heart is as streams of water in the hand of Jehovah. Everywhere that he delights to, he turns it.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:4-16:2:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Neh. 2:4-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Both <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:1-15:2:67" data-bid="32-1" class="b">the book of Ezra (2:1-67</a>) and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:6-16:7:69" data-bid="33-1" class="b">the book of Nehemiah (7:6-69</a>) list the number of persons from various families or houses who returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel. The accounts harmonize in giving 42,360 as the total number of returned exiles, apart from slaves and singers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:64-15:2:64" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:66-16:7:66" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:66</a>) However, there are differences between the numbers given for each family or house, and in both listings the individual figures yield a total of far less than 42,360. Many scholars would attribute these variations to scribal errors. While this aspect cannot be completely ignored, there are other possible explanations for the differences.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It may be that Ezra and Nehemiah based their listings on different sources. For example, Ezra could have used a document listing those who enrolled to return to their homeland, whereas Nehemiah might have copied from a record listing those who actually did return. Since there were priests who were unable to establish their genealogy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:61-15:2:63" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ezra 2:61-63;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:63-16:7:65" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:63-65</a>), it is not unreasonable to conclude that many of the other Israelites faced the same problem. Consequently, the 42,360 persons could be the combined total of the number from each family plus many others who were unable to establish their ancestry. Later, however, some may have been able to establish their correct genealogy. This could explain how a fluctuation in numbers might still give the same total.</p>

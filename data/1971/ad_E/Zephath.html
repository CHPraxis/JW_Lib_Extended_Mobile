<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Zeʹphath) [perhaps, watchtower].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A royal Canaanite city in the southern part of Judah’s territory, apparently S of Arad, captured by the combined forces of Judah and Simeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:16-7:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 1:16, 17</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:30-6:15:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 15:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:4-6:19:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:4</a>) The city was renamed “Hormah,” meaning “a devoting [to destruction).” <span id="page1689" class="pageNum" data-no="1689" data-before-text="1689"></span>This city, like the other cities of the Canaanites, had been placed ‘under ban’ by Jehovah, and was to be devoted to destruction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:1-5:7:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 7:1-4</a>) The tribes of Judah and Simeon were now applying the terms of that ban on Zephath. Zephath may have been the principal Canaanite city of that district or area.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the basis of the similarity of the names, various locations have been suggested, such as Tell esh-Sherʽah, Tell es-Seba, and the pass es-Sufa, to the NW, E, and SE of Beer-sheba respectively. An older identification, Sebata or Sebaita, some twenty-two miles (35.4 kilometers) N-NE of Kadesh-barnea, seems to fit the description better.—See DEVOTE; HORMAH.</p>

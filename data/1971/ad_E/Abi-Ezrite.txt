ABI-EZRITE
(Aʹbi-ezʹrite).
A descendant of Abi-ezer of the family of Abi-ezer. (Judg. 6:11, 24; 8:32) Numbers 26:30 reads: “Iezerites” (Jeezerites in AV), which is a contraction of Abi-ezrites. This term is applied in the Bible to those descended from Abi-ezer the ‘son of Gilead,’ rather than to the Abi-ezer of David’s time.—See ABI-EZER No. 1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Arʹbel).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “house” (“Beth-arbel,” <em>AT, JB, RS</em>) despoiled at some unspecified time by Shalman. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:14-28:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hos. 10:14</a>) It is usually linked with modern Irbid, located about eighteen miles (29 kilometers) E-SE of the Sea of Galilee, hence in Gilead. Some scholars, however, attempt to connect Biblical Arbel with “Arbela” in Galilee, referred to in the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (9:2, <em>JB</em>).</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the fortified cities with stone flock pens that was built or rebuilt by the Gadites before their crossing the Jordan to assist in the conquest of Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:34-4:32:36" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 32:34-36</a>) At a later period Judge Gideon’s forces passed Jogbehah prior to their surprise attack on the Midianite camp at Karkor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:10-7:8:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 8:10, 11</a>) Modern geographers usually place Jogbehah at Khirbet el-Ajbeihat, situated about 3,470 feet (c. 1,058 meters) above sea level and some six miles (c. 10 kilometers) NW of modern Amman (Rabbah).</p>

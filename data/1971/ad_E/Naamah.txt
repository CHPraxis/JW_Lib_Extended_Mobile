1. Descendant of Cain; sister of Tubal-cain and the daughter of Lamech by Zillah.—Gen. 4:17-19, 22.
2. Ammonite wife of Solomon and mother of Rehoboam.—1 Ki. 14:21; 2 Chron. 12:13.
3. A Judean city in the Shephelah. (Josh. 15:20, 33, 41) Its exact location is uncertain. However, Khirbet Farad, about five miles (8 kilometers) N-NE of the suggested site of Libnah, has been presented as a possible identification. Nearby ʽAraq Naʽaman is believed to preserve the ancient name.

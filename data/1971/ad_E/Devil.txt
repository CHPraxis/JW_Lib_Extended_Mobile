DEVIL
From the Greek di·aʹbo·los, meaning “false accuser, misrepresenter, slanderer,” This descriptive name was given to Satan because he is the chief and foremost slanderer and false accuser of Jehovah’s good word and holy name.—See SATAN.
Down through the centuries the Devil has demonstrated that he is the arch-opposer of both God and man. He disputed with Michael over the body of Moses (Jude 9); showed he has power to ensnare others (1 Tim. 3:7; 2 Tim. 2:26); used people such as the false religious leaders, Judas Iscariot and Bar-Jesus as his children (John 8:44; 13:2; Acts 13:6, 10); oppressed persons beyond the cure of the physicians (Acts 10:38); had righteous ones thrown into prison (Rev. 2:10); and even had the means to cause death. (Heb. 2:14) Christians are, therefore, admonished not to give this Slanderer of God an opening by continuing in a provoked state. (Eph. 4:27) “Keep your senses, be watchful,” Peter warns. “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.”—1 Pet. 5:8.
There are other instances in the original text of the Christian Greek Scriptures where the word di·aʹbo·los occurs, and in such cases, because it does not refer to Satan, the word is properly rendered “slanderer.” For example, in referring to Judas, Jesus said to the twelve, “One of you is a slanderer” (John 6:70); women in the congregation were cautioned not to be slanderous (1 Tim. 3:11; Titus 2:3); that “men will be . . . slanderers” is one of the evidences of the “critical times” that would mark the “last days.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.
Jehovah’s law to the nation of Israel forbade them to slander one another. (Lev. 19:16) The tenor of the entire Bible is against such misuse of the tongue.—2 Sam. 19:27; Ps. 15:3; 101:5; Prov. 11:13; 20:19; 30:10; Jer. 6:28; 9:4.

CABBON
(Cabʹbon) [wrap around, surrond].
One of the cities of Judah in the Shephelah. (Josh. 15:40) The Septuagint Version reads “Chabra” instead of Cabbon at Joshua 15:40, and this has led some to relate the town with Hebra, E of Lachish. On the basis of the Hebrew name, however, others suggest an identification with Qubeibeh, SW of Beit Jibrin.

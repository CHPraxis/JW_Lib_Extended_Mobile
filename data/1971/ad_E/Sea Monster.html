<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This generally translates the Hebrew word <em>tan·ninʹ</em> (<em>tan·nim</em>ʹ at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:3-26:29:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, “sea monster”; 32:2, “marine monster,” <em>NW</em>). This term is rendered “big snake” (<em>NW</em>) when not mentioned in connection with the sea or water (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:34-24:51:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 51:34</a>), or when a reference to snakes is definitely indicated by the context. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:9-2:7:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:12-2:7:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 12</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:2-2:4:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 4:2, 3</a>) Undoubtedly <em>tan·ninʹ</em> includes a variety of large marine animals (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:7-19:148:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps. 148:7</a>), but this term is usually employed in a figurative sense. The destruction of Pharaoh and his hosts appears to be alluded to by the phrase: “You [Jehovah] broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:74:13-19:74:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 74:13</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:9-23:51:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:9</a>, “sea monster” appears in parallel with Rahab (Egypt; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:7-23:30:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:7</a>) and hence may denote Egypt, as is probably also the case at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:1-23:27:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 27:1</a> (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:12-23:27:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 27:12, 13</a>), or the reference is to Pharaoh, as in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:3-26:29:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezekiel 29:3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:2-26:32:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 32:2</a>. Faithful Job asked whether he himself was a “sea monster” that had to have a guard set over him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:7:12-18:7:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 7:12</a>; see LEVIATHAN.</p>

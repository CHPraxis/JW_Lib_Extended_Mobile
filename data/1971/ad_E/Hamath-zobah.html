<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Haʹmath-zoʹbah).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place apparently conquered by King Solomon and thus figuring in his only military engagement alluded to in Scripture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:3-14:8:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 8:3</a>) The exact identity of Hamath-zobah is uncertain. Hamath and Zobah may have been adjoining kingdoms (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:9-13:18:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 18:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:4-14:8:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), whence the compound name “Hamath-zobah.” That two neighboring geographical locations may be joined in this way is illustrated by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:78-13:6:78" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:78</a>. The literal Hebrew of this text reads “the Jordan Jericho” or “the Jordan of Jericho,” and is usually rendered “the Jordan at [by] Jericho.”—<em>NW, RS, AV</em>.</p>

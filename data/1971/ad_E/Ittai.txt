ITTAI
(Itʹtai) [with me is Jehovah].
1. A Gittite warrior, presumably from the Philistine city of Gath, who was very loyal to David. When David and his cortege were fleeing Jerusalem due to Absalom’s rebellion, six hundred Gittites, including Ittai, came along. David tried to dissuade Ittai from leaving the city, but the warrior expressed his great devotion in these terms: “As Jehovah is living and as my lord the king is living, in the place where my lord the king may come to be, whether for death or for life, there is where your servant will come to be!” David then permitted Ittai to continue accompanying him.—2 Sam. 15:18-22.
After numbering his forces, David appointed this non-Israelite Ittai, along with Joab and Abishai, as chiefs, each over one-third of the army.—2 Sam. 18:2, 5, 12.
2. One of David’s mighty men; a Benjamite and the son of Ribai of Gibeah. (2 Sam. 23:29) He is called Ithai at 1 Chronicles 11:31.

Zilpah had been a servant of Leah’s father Laban until Leah and Jacob were married in 1774 B.C.E., when she was given to Leah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:24-1:29:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 29:24</a>) After Leah had four sons, and she thought she <span id="page1692" class="pageNum" data-no="1692" data-before-text="1692"></span>was through childbearing, she gave Zilpah to Jacob as a secondary wife. Zilpah then bore Gad and Asher, who, in turn, had many sons. (30:9-13; 35:26; 37:2; 46:16-18) Zilpah remained with Jacob’s household through their many travels.—32:22; 33:1, 2.</p>

NAHSHON
(Nahʹshon) [serpent].
Wilderness chieftain of the tribe of Judah. Nahshon was the son of Amminadab and among the fifth-listed generation after Judah. (1 Chron. 2:3-10) His sister was Aaron’s wife. (Ex. 6:23) Nahshon formed a link in the line of descent that led to David and Jesus, becoming father to Salmon, who married Rahab, and grandfather of Boaz, who, in turn, married Ruth.—1 Chron. 2:11-15; Ruth 4:20; Matt. 1:4-6, 16; Luke 3:32.
As chieftain of Judah, the leading tribe of Israel, Nahshon assisted Moses with the first wilderness registration of fighting men. He presented Judah’s contributions to the tabernacle service when the altar was inaugurated, and headed Judah’s army of 74,600 that led Israel’s line of march.—Num. 1:2-7; 2:3, 4; 7:2, 11, 12-17; 10:14.

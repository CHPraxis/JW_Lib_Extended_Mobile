URIJAH
(U·riʹjah) [Jehovah is a light; flame of Jehovah].
1. A priest during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah (761-746 B.C.E.). When Ahaz went to Damascus to offer tribute to Tiglath-pileser (III), he sent Urijah the design and pattern of the great altar he saw there, telling him to build one like it and later instructing him to use it instead of Jehovah’s altar. Urijah complied. (2 Ki. 16:8-16) Urijah (Uriah) also witnessed a writing of Isaiah. (Isa. 8:1, 2) Though not so identified, he was presumably high priest, in view of his importance and the absence of any other person so titled at this time.
2. A prophet of Jehovah, son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. During the reign of Jehoiakim, Urijah prophesied against Judah and Jerusalem just as Jeremiah did. However, when Urijah learned that Jehoiakim sought his death, he fled to Egypt, but was brought back and slain, his body being cast into a common graveyard.—Jer. 26:20-23.
3. A priest whose son Meremoth was one of the priests in whose care Ezra entrusted the gold and silver and temple vessels brought to Jerusalem. Urijah later helped to repair Jerusalem’s wall; son of Hakkoz.—Ezra 8:33; Neh. 3:4, 21.

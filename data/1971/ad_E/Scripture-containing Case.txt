SCRIPTURE-CONTAINING CASE
A small case containing four portions of the Law (Ex. 13:1-16; Deut. 6:4-9; 11:13-21) and worn by Jewish men on their forehead and left arm. Concerning the practice of wearing such cases or phylacteries, The Jewish Encyclopedia (1905 ed., Vol. X, p. 21) observes: “The laws governing the wearing of phylacteries were derived by the Rabbis from four Biblical passages (Deut. vi. 8, xi. 18; Ex. xiii. 9, 16). While these passages were interpreted literally by most commentators. . . . the Rabbis held that the general law only was expressed in the Bible, the application and elaboration of it being entirely matters of tradition and inference.”
Christ Jesus censured the scribes and Pharisees for ‘broadening the scripture-containing cases that they wore as safeguards.’ (Matt. 23:5) By enlarging these cases, they apparently wanted to impress others as being very zealous and conscientious about the Law. Jesus’ words indicate that the religious leaders viewed these cases as safeguards or charms. The Greek word phy·la·kteʹri·on, in fact, primarily means an outpost, fortification or safeguard.—See FRONTLET BAND.

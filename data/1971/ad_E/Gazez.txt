GAZEZ
(Gaʹzez) [shearer].
First Chronicles 2:46 says Caleb’s concubine Ephah gave birth to Haran, Moza and Gazez, and then states that Haran “became father to Gazez.” Hence, there may have been two men named Gazez: (1) a son of Caleb, and (2) a grandson of Caleb, as it is not at all unlikely that Caleb’s son Haran named his son Gazez after his brother. But if the phrase, “As for Haran, he became father to Gazez,” is simply a clarification identifying the Gazez mentioned initially as, not Caleb’s son, but his grandson, this would mean there was only one Gazez, namely, the son of Haran and grandson of Caleb.

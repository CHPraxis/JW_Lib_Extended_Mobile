<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aʹgur) [hireling, or collector].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The son of Jakeh and writer of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:1-20:30:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">the thirtieth chapter of the book of Proverbs</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:1-20:30:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 30:1</a>) Nothing further is stated to enable further identification. He probably lived sometime during the period from Solomon’s reign (1037-997 B.C.E.) to Hezekiah’s reign (745-716 B.C.E.).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some rabbinical scholars have considered the name Agur to be allegorical, applying to Solomon. Thus the footnote on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:1-20:30:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:1</a> in the <em>Soncino Books of the Bible</em> (Proverbs) quotes from the Midrash as saying: “He was called <em>Agur</em> because he stored up (<em>agar</em>) knowledge of Torah, and <em>the son of Jakeh</em> because he spewed it out (<em>hikki</em>) in that he ignored the warning against multiplying wives.” Even among the Jewish commentators, however, this view was not unanimous, many holding that the change of style, language and content indicates a different writer.</p>

MARKETPLACE
An open area that served as a center for buying and selling and as a place of public assembly in cities and towns of the ancient Middle East and the Roman world. In Greek and Roman cities, statues and public buildings, including religious edifices, surrounded the open area. It appears that some judicial matters were handled in marketplaces. (Compare Acts 16:19-21.) Also, news, both local and foreign, could be obtained in the marketplace, for it was there that persons congregated and spoke about the latest happenings.—Compare Acts 17:17-21.
In the marketplaces of Palestine children could be found playing games. (Matt. 11:16; Luke 7:32) Unemployed men might be standing around, including those who were willing to be hired for a day. (Compare Matthew 20:3, 4.) The proud scribes and Pharisees wanted to be noticed by the throngs there and to be greeted in accord with their assumed high station. (Matt. 23:2, 6, 7; Mark 12:38; Luke 11:43; 20:46) Upon returning from the market, the tradition-keeping Pharisees and other Jews cleansed themselves by sprinkling before ever eating anything.—Mark 7:3, 4.
While on earth, Christ Jesus healed persons in the marketplaces. (Mark 6:56) And the apostle Paul, at Athens, daily reasoned “in the market place with those who happened to be on hand.”—Acts 17:16, 17; see Appius, MARKET PLACE OF; FORUM.

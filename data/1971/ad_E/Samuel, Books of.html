<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page1439" class="pageNum" data-no="1439" data-before-text="1439"></span><strong>SAMUEL, BOOKS OF</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Two books of the Hebrew Scriptures that apparently were not divided in the original Hebrew canon. Indicative of this is a note in the Masora showing that words in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:1-9:28:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">First Samuel, chapter 28</a> (one of the concluding chapters of First Samuel), were in the middle of the book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><span id="page1440" class="pageNum" data-no="1440" data-before-text="1440"></span><strong>WRITERS AND TIME COVERED</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ancient Jewish tradition credits Samuel with the writership of the first part of the book, and Nathan and Gad with the remaining portion. That these three prophets did write is confirmed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:29-13:29:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>. The book itself reports: “Samuel spoke to the people about the rightful due of the kingship and wrote it in a book and deposited it before Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:10:25-9:10:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:25</a>) However, on the basis of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:27:6-9:27:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 27:6</a>, where there is reference to the “kings of Judah,” numerous scholars place the final compiling of the books of Samuel sometime after the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel came into existence. If the expression “kings of Judah” denotes only Judean kings of the <em>two-tribe kingdom,</em> this would show that the writings of Samuel, Nathan and Gad must have been into final form by someone else. On the other hand, if “kings of Judah” simply means kings from the <em>tribe</em> of Judah, these words could have been recorded by Nathan, since he lived under the rulership of two Judean kings, David and Solomon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:32-11:1:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:32-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:9:29-14:9:29" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 9:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The fact that Hannah and an unnamed “man of God” used the expressions “king” and/or “anointed one” years before a king actually ruled over Israel does not support the argument of some that these passages date from a period later than indicated in the book. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:10-9:2:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:35-9:2:35" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 35</a>) The idea of a future king was by no means foreign to the Hebrews. God’s promise concerning Sarah, the ancestress of the Israelites, was that “kings of peoples” would come from her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:16-1:17:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 17:16</a>) Also, Jacob’s deathbed prophecy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 49:10</a>), the prophetic words of Balaam (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:24:17-4:24:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Num. 24:17</a>) and the Mosaic law (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:14-5:17:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 17:14-18</a>) pointed to the time when the Israelites would have a king.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The historical narrative contained in the two books of Samuel commences with the judgeship of High Priest Eli and concludes with events from David’s reign. It therefore covers a period of approximately 140 years (c. 1180-c. 1040 B.C.E.). As David’s death is not mentioned in the record, the account (possibly with the exception of editorial additions) was probably completed about 1040 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The authenticity of the account contained in the books of Samuel is well established. Christ Jesus himself, when refuting an objection raised by the Pharisees, cited the incident recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:3-9:21:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:3-6</a> about David’s receiving showbread from Ahimelech the priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:1-40:12:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 12:1-4</a>) In the synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia, the apostle Paul quoted from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:14-9:13:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Samuel 13:14</a> as he briefly reviewed events from Israel’s history. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:20-44:13:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 13:20-22</a>) This apostle, in his letter to the Romans, used words from David’s psalm, which passage is found at both <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:50-10:22:50" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:50 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:49-19:18:49" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Psalm 18:49</a>, to prove that Christ’s ministry to the Jews verified God’s promises and gave a basis for non-Jews to “glorify God for his mercy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:8-45:15:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rom. 15:8, 9</a>) Jehovah’s words to David at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:14-10:7:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:14</a> are quoted and applied to Christ Jesus in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:5-58:1:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:5</a>, thus showing that David served as a prophetic type of the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Outstanding, too, is the candor of the record. It exposes the wrongs of the priestly house of Eli (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:12-9:2:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:12-17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:22-9:2:25" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 22-25</a>), the corruption of Samuel’s sons (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:8:1-9:8:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Sam. 8:1-3</a>) and the sins and family difficulties of King David.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:11:2-10:11:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Sam. 11:2-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:1-10:13:22" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13:1-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:13-10:15:14" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 15:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:24:10-10:24:10" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 24:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Another evidence of the authenticity of the account is the fulfillment of prophecies. These relate to Israel’s request for a king (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:14-5:17:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deut. 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:8:5-9:8:5" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 8:5</a>), Jehovah’s rejection of Eli’s house (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:31-9:2:31" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:3:12-9:3:14" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 3:12-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:27-11:2:27" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 2:27</a>) and the continuance of the kingship in David’s line.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:16-10:7:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:17-24:33:17" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Jer. 33:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:25-26:21:27" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Ezek. 21:25-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:1:1" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Matt. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> Luke 1:32, 33</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The record is in complete harmony with the rest of the Scriptures. This is especially noticeable when examining the psalms, many of which are illuminated by what is contained in the books of Samuel. King Saul’s sending messengers to watch David’s house in order to kill him provides the background for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:59:0-19:59:17" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 59</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:19:11-9:19:11" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Sam. 19:11</a>) David’s experiences at Gath, where he disguised his sanity to escape death, are alluded to in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:0-19:34:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalms 34 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:0-19:56:13" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 56</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:10-9:21:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:10-15</a>; evidently the name Abimelech appearing in the <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:0-19:34:0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 34</a> is to be viewed as a title for King Achish.) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:142:0-19:142:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 142</a> may reflect David’s thoughts while hiding from Saul in the cave of Adullam (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:1-9:22:1" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:1</a>) or in the cave in the wilderness of En-gedi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:1-9:24:1" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Sam. 24:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:3-9:24:3" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 3</a>) This is perhaps also the case with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:57:0-19:57:11" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 57</a>. However, a comparison of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:57:6-19:57:6" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 57:6</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:2-9:24:4" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Samuel 24:2-4</a> seems to favor the cave in the wilderness of En-gedi, for there Saul, as it were, fell into the pit he had excavated for David. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:52:0-19:52:9" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 52</a> pertains to Doeg’s informing Saul about David’s dealings with Ahimelech. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:9-9:22:10" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:9, 10</a>) The action of the Ziphites in revealing David’s whereabouts to King Saul furnished the basis for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:54:0-19:54:7" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 54</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:19-9:23:19" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Sam. 23:19</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:63:0-19:63:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 63</a> relates to David’s experiences in the wilderness of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:5-9:22:5" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:14-9:23:15" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 23:14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:26-9:23:26" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 26</a>) The second psalm seems to allude to the attempts made by the Philistines to unseat David as king after his capture of the stronghold of Zion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:17-10:5:25" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:17-25</a>) Trouble with the Edomites during the war with Hadadezer is the setting for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:60:0-19:60:12" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 60</a>. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:3-10:8:3" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:13-10:8:14" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:0-19:51:19" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 51</a> is a prayer of David, beseeching forgiveness for his sin with Bath-sheba.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:5-10:16:8" data-bid="49-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:5-8</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:30:0-19:30:12" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 30</a> may allude to events in connection with David’s erection of an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:0-19:18:50" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 18</a> parallels <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:1-10:22:51" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22</a>, and pertains to Jehovah’s delivering David from Saul and other enemies.</p>

<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="ss"><strong>SECTIONS MISSING IN THE <em>SEPTUAGINT VERSION</em></strong></p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:12-9:17:31" data-bid="53-1" class="b">First Samuel 17:12-31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:55-9:17:55" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 55</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:6-9:18:6" data-bid="54-1" class="b">1Sa 18:6a</a> does not appear in the <em>Septuagint Version</em> as contained in Vatican Manuscript No. 1209. Numerous scholars have, therefore, concluded that the omissions are later additions to the Hebrew text. Arguing against this view, a commentary by C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch notes: “The notion, that the sections in question are interpolations that have crept into the text, cannot be sustained on the mere authority of the Septuagint version; since the arbitrary manner in which the translators of this version made omissions or additions at pleasure is obvious to any one.”—<em>Biblical Commentary on the Books of Samuel,</em> p. 177, ftn.</p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="sb">If it could be definitely established that actual discrepancies exist between the omitted sections and the rest of the book, the authenticity of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:12-9:17:31" data-bid="55-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:12-31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:55-9:17:55" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 55</a>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:6-9:18:6" data-bid="56-1" class="b">1Sa 18:6a</a> would reasonably be in question. A comparison of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:18-9:16:23" data-bid="57-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:18-23 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:55-9:17:58" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 17:55-58</a> reveals what appears to be a contradiction, for in the latter passage Saul is depicted as asking about the identity of his own court musician and armor-bearer, David. However, it should be noted that David’s earlier being described as a “valiant, mighty man and a man of war” could have been based on his courageous acts in single-handedly killing a lion and a bear to rescue his father’s sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:18-9:16:18" data-bid="58-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:34-9:17:36" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 17:34-36</a>) Also, the Scriptures do not state that David actually served in battle as Saul’s armor-bearer before he killed Goliath. Saul’s request to Jesse was: “Let David, please, keep attending upon me, for he has found favor in my eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:22-9:16:22" data-bid="59-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:22</a>) This request does not preclude the possibility that Saul later permitted David to return to Bethlehem so that, when war broke out with the Philistines, David was then shepherding his father’s flock.</p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="sb">Regarding Saul’s question, “Whose son is the boy, Abner?” the aforementioned commentary observes (p. 178 ftn.): “Even if Abner had not troubled himself about the lineage of Saul’s harpist, Saul himself could not well have forgotten that David was a son of the Bethlehemite Jesse. But there was much more implied in Saul’s question. It was not the name of David’s father alone that he wanted to discover, but what kind of man the father of a youth who possessed the courage to accomplish so marvellous a heroic deed really was; and the question was put not merely in order that he might grant him an exemption of his house from taxes as the reward promised for the conquest of Goliath (ver. 25), but also in all probability that he might attach such a man to his court, since he inferred from the courage and bravery of the son the existence of similar qualities in the father. It is true that David merely replied, ‘The son of thy servant Jesse of Bethlehem;’ but it is very evident from the expression in ch. xviii. 1, ‘when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul,’ that Saul conversed with him still further about his family affairs, since the very words imply a lengthened conversation.” (For other instances where “who” involves more than mere knowledge of a person’s name, see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:5:2-2:5:2" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Exodus 5:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:10-9:25:10" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 25:10</a>.)</p>
<p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="sb">So the indications are that there is no sound reason for rejecting <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:12-9:17:31" data-bid="61-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:12-31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:55-9:17:55" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 55</a>–<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:6-9:18:6" data-bid="62-1" class="b">1Sa 18:6a</a> as being no part of the original text.</p>

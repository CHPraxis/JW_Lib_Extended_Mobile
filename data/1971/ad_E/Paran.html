<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Paʹran).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name is of uncertain meaning, possibly from a root defined as “abounding in foliage,” hence “ornamental,” or, more likely, from a root meaning “abounding in caverns or caves.” Paran was the greater part of that vast wilderness region in which the nation of Israel wandered about for some thirty-eight years before entering the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:11-4:10:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 10:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:14-5:2:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 2:14</a>) Having no fixed boundaries, Paran occupied the central and northeastern portion of the Sinai Peninsula. On the E was that part of the Rift Valley known as the Arabah and also the Gulf of Aqabah, on the S the wilderness of Sinai, on the SW the wilderness of Sin, and on the NW and N the wildernesses of Etham and Shur. Toward the Dead Sea to the NE Paran blended with, and perhaps included, the wilderness of Zin.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For the most part Paran was a rough mountainous region of limestone, plateau-like in places, the central section being between 2,000 and 2,500 feet (610 to 762 meters) high. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:2-5:33:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 33:2</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:3-35:3:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Habakkuk 3:3</a>.) It was also included as part of “that great and fear-inspiring wilderness” referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:1-5:1:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:19-5:1:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:15-5:8:15" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 8:15</a>. Except during the brief rainy seasons the gravel face of this rude country is devoid of green vegetation; springs are few and far between. These factors emphasize the complete dependence upon Jehovah to provide food and water miraculously during those many years for the nation of Israel, numbering perhaps 3,000,000 persons.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:1-2:16:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 16:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:4-2:16:4" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:12-2:16:15" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 12-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:35-2:16:35" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:7-5:2:7" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Deut. 2:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:15-5:8:16" data-bid="5-6" class="b"> 8:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Apparently the first reference to this wilderness of Paran was in the days of Lot when Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated a number of cities in the vicinities of the Dead Sea and Edom as far S as El-paran. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:4-1:14:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 14:4-6</a>) Later, after Ishmael was dismissed by his father Abraham, he settled down in the wilderness of Paran and occupied himself mainly with the hunt.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:20-1:21:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 21:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, the principal references to Paran are in connection with the wanderings of the Israelites. After leaving Mount Sinai, Israel camped at Taberah and Kibroth-hattaavah, then at Hazeroth on the southern edge of Paran, before moving N toward Kadesh-barnea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:12-4:10:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Num. 10:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:33-4:10:33" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:3-4:11:3" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 11:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:34-4:11:35" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:16-4:12:16" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 12:16</a>) Not long after entering Paran the twelve spies were sent out to reconnoiter Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:3-4:13:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Num. 13:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:26-4:13:26" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 26</a>) The bad report given by the majority upon returning resulted in Jehovah’s decree that the nation prolong their stay in the wilderness until all the registered ones who had murmured against God had died off. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:31-4:13:33" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Num. 13:31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:20-4:14:34" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14:20-34</a>) During that forty years by far the majority of Israel’s campsites, from Egypt to the Promised Land, were in Paran.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:1-4:33:49" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Num. 33:1-49</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">According to the <em>Septuagint Version</em> as found in the Vatican Manuscript No. 1209, David went into the wilderness of Maon following the death and burial of Samuel. However, the Masoretic text, as well as the Syriac, <em>Vulgate</em> and <em>Septuagint</em> (Alexandrine Manuscript) versions say he went into the wilderness of Paran. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:25:1-9:25:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:1</a>) When David became king and made war on Edom, the young Edomite prince Hadad, together with some of his father’s servants, made his escape to Egypt. On the way down they were joined by certain men of Paran as they passed through that country.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:15-11:11:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:15-18</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After the opening of the “third seal,” as referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:5-66:6:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 6:5, 6</a>, both a <em>khoiʹnix</em> of wheat and three <em>khoiʹni·kes</em> of barley are said to sell for a denarius. Estimates as to the size of the <em>khoiʹnix</em> range from one and a half pints to about one quart. Generally, however, scholars believe it to be slightly more than a liter or a little less than a U.S. dry quart. Since a denarius was a day’s wage in John’s time (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:1-40:20:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 20:1-12</a>), grains selling at such prices would indicate famine conditions.</p>

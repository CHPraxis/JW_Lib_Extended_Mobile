QOHPH
or, as commonly anglicized, qoph [ק]. The nineteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, later used also as a number to denote one hundred.
The English letter “q” is derived from this Hebrew letter. However, in translating Hebrew names where it occurs, qohph is usually represented in English by “c” or “k,” as in “Cainan” and “Kish.” The sound is stronger than that of the letter kaph [כ] and is pronounced farther back in the throat, as a strong English “q” formed at the back of the palate. In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses in Psalm 119:145-152.

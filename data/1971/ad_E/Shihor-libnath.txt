SHIHOR-LIBNATH
(Shiʹhor-libʹnath) [turbid stream of Libnath].
Eusebius and Jerome believed Shihor-libnath originally constituted the name of two sites, Shihor and Labanath. However, it is apparently a river on Asher’s boundary. (Josh. 19:24-26) Some geographers connect the Shihor-libnath with the Nahr ez-Zerqa, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea about six miles (9.7 kilometers) S of Dor.

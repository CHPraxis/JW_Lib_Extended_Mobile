BOZKATH
(Bozʹkath) [elevated, stony ground].
A town in the inheritance of Judah (Josh. 15:39) and home of King Josiah’s maternal grandfather Adaiah. (2 Ki. 22:1) Listed between Eglon and Lachish, it was apparently in the lowlands or Shephelah region. Its identification is uncertain; some would place it at present-day ed-Dawaʼime, about eleven and a half miles (19 kilometers) W of Hebron, and SW of Lachish.

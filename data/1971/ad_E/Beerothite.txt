BEEROTHITE
(Be·erʹoth·ite).
A resident or native of Beeroth. At the time of the Israelites’ entry into Canaan its inhabitants were Hivites. The territory was thereafter assigned to Benjamin, and the Hivite residents became “gatherers of wood and drawers of water.” (Josh. 9:17, 27; 18:21, 25; see BEEROTH.) The assassins of Ish-bosheth, namely, Baanah and Rechab, were “sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamim.” (2 Sam. 4:2, 5, 9) Naharai, one of David’s maighty men, is also listed as a Beerothite.—2 Sam. 23:37; called “the Berothite” at 1 Chronicles 11:39.

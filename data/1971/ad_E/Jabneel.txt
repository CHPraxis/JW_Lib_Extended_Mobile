JABNEEL
(Jabʹ’ne·el) [God causes to be built].
1. A Judean boundary site (Josh. 15:1, 11), probably the same as the Jabneh that King Uzziah (829-777 B.C.E.) wrested from the Philistines. (2 Chron. 26:6) Jabneel is identified with modern Yebna. Situated about four miles (c. 6 kilometers) from the Mediterranean Sea, Yebna stands on an isolated, sandy hill some thirteen miles (c. 21 kilometers) S of Joppa.
2. A boundary site of Naphtali. (Josh. 19:32, 33) Many geographers suggest as a possible identification Khirbet Yamma, less that five miles (8 kilometers) W-SW of the southern end of the Sea of Galilee.

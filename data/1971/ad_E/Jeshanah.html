<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Jeshʹa·nah) [possibly, old].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned along with Mizpah as indicating the location of the stone that Samuel set up and called “Ebenezer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:12-9:7:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 7:12</a>) Jeshanah was one of the cities captured by Judean King Abijah (980-977 B.C.E.) from Jeroboam the king of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:19-14:13:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:19</a>) It is considered to be identical to the Isanas referred to by Josephus as the site of Herod the Great’s victory over General Pappus. (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book XIV, chap. XV, par. 12) The name “Isanas” seems to be preserved in Burj el-Isaneh, a village some five miles (8 kilometers) N-NE of Bethel. This place has therefore been suggested as a possible identification for ancient Jeshanah. Another site, favored by some, is Ain Sinja, about three miles (c. 5 kilometers) SW of Burj el-Isaneh.</p>

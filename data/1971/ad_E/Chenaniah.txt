CHENANIAH
(Chen·a·niʹah) [Jehovah is firm].
1. A Levite contemporaneous with King David. “Chenaniah the chief of the Levites in carrying” was an expert, qualified to instruct others concerning the proper handling of the sacred Ark.—1 Chron. 15:22, 25-27.
2. A Kohathite of the family of Izhar. Chenaniah and his sons had been designated for the “outside business,” evidently consisting of service as judges and officers, of whom there were 6,000 at the time of David’s numbering the Levites. (1 Chron. 26:29; 23:1-4, 12) Since the Kohathites carried the utensils of the sanctuary in Moses’ day, possibly this Chenaniah is the same as No. 1 above.—Num. 4:4, 5, 15.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Jewish religious system. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:13-48:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 1:13, 14</a>) In the first century C.E., Judaism in its various forms was not based exclusively on the Hebrew Scriptures. One of the most prominent divisions of Judaism, that of the Sadducees, rejected the Scriptural teaching of the resurrection and denied that angels existed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:18-41:12:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 12:18-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:8-44:23:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 23:8</a>) Although the Pharisees, who formed yet another important branch of Judaism, sharply disagreed with the Sadducees on this (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:6-44:23:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 23:6-9</a>), they were guilty of making God’s Word invalid because of their many unscriptural traditions.

The Law itself was good and holy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:12-45:7:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 7:12</a>), but the traditions of men served to enslave the Jews. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:8-51:2:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Col. 2:8</a>) It was an <span id="page976" class="pageNum" data-no="976" data-before-text="976"></span>ardent zeal for the ‘traditions of his fathers’ that caused Saul (Paul) to be a vicious persecutor of Christians.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:13-48:1:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 1:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:23-48:1:23" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 23</a>; see PHARISEES; SADDUCEES.</p>

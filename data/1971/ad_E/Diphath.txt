DIPHATH
(Diʹphath).
A descendant of Noah through Japheth and Gomer (1 Chron. 1:4-6, NW, 1955 ed., ftn.), called Riphath in the Latin Vulgate, the Greek Septuagint and in some thirty Hebrew manuscripts, as well as at Genesis 10:3. The spelling “Diphath” found in the Masoretic text at 1 Chronicles 1:6 may have arisen through a copyist’s error, since the Hebrew letters for “R” (====) and “D” (====) look very much alike.

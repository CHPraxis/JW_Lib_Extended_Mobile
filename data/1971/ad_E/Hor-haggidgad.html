<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An Israelite wilderness camping site. As discussed under the heading BENE-JAAKAN, a comparison of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:31-4:33:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 33:31-33</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:6, 7</a> seems to indicate that the Israelites passed through this same region twice, Hor-haggidgad being called “Gudgodah” on the later trip. (See GUDGODAH.) The exact location cannot be determined with certainty. Most scholars, however, tentatively identify Hor-haggidgad (Gudgodah) with a site on the Wadi Ghadaghed, about forty-two miles (68 kilometers) N-NW of the Gulf of Aqabah.</p>

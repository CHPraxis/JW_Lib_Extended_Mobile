JUNIAS
(Juʹni·as).
A recipient of special greetings in Paul’s letter to the Romans (16:7). Andronicus and Junias were his “relatives.” While the Greek word used here can mean “fellow-countryman,” the primary meaning is “blood relative of the same generation.” The two were Paul’s “fellow captives,” possibly having been in prison with him somewhere. Paul calls them both “men of note among the apostles,” perhaps recalling their fine reputation with the apostles. They were ‘in union with Christ longer than Paul himself was,’ indicating early discipleship.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The chief court official, or, more literally, the master of the eunuchs, in Babylon during Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:3-27:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 1:3</a>) The title in time came to designate a high official in the royal court who doubtless headed the corps of eunuchs but who himself may not have been a eunuch. Such official had as one of his duties the training of youths to serve as pages of the monarch.</p>

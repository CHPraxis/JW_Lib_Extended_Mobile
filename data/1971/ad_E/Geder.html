<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in Canaan, whose king was one of thirty-one conquered by Joshua. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:13-6:12:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 12:13</a>) Its location is uncertain. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:7-6:12:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 12:7, 8</a> shows it as being on the W side of the Jordan and its being mentioned next to Debir may place it in the Shephelah region. It may be the same as the Beth-gader at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:51-13:2:51" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>. In David’s time, a man called Baal-hanan the Gederite was in charge of David’s olive groves and sycamore trees in the Shephelah, and it is thought that he may have come from either Geder or Gederah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:28-13:27:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 27:28</a>.</p>

PIRATHON
(Pirʹa·thon), Pirathonite (Pirʹa·thon·ite).
Pirathon was a town of Ephraim “in the mountain of the Amalekite.” Evidently an inhabitant of Pirathon was known as a “Pirathonite,” as were Hillel and, later, Benaiah, one of David’s mighty men. Hillel’s son Judge Abdon was buried there. (Judg. 12:13, 15; 2 Sam. 23:8, 30; 1 Chron. 11:31; 27:14) Farʽata, about six miles (10 kilometers) W-SW of the suggested location for Shechem, has been suggested as a possible identification.

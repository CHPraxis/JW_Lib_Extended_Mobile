<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Aramaic (Syrian) expression that Laban used to designate the heap of stones on which he and Jacob ate a covenant meal. This stone heap called Jegar-sahadutha was to serve as a “witness” that neither of them would pass it to harm the other. Jacob called it by the Hebrew equivalent “Galeed.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:25-1:31:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 31:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:46-1:31:53" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 46-53</a>; see GALEED.</p>

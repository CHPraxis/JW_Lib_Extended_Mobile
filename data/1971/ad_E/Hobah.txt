HOBAH
(Hoʹbah).
A site “north of Damascus” to which Abraham pursued the defeated armies under Chedorlaomer. (Gen. 14:13-17) The Biblical location is associated by certain scholars with Hoba, a spring on the road between Palmyra and Damascus, where at least the ancient name appears to be preserved. Hoba, like other large springs near the desert, may have once had a village standing nearby.

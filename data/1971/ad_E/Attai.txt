1. Grandson of Sheshan, a descendant of Judah through Hezron. Sheshan had daughters only, one of whom he gave in marriage to his Egyptian slave Jarha, who fathered Attai. In turn Attai was the father of Nathan.—1 Chron. 2:25, 34-36.
2. One of the eleven valiant Gadites who crossed the overflowing Jordan to join David’s army in the wilderness.—1 Chron. 12:8, 11-15.
3. Second of the four sons that Rehoboam’s favorite wife Maacah, the granddaughter of Absalom, bore to him. Attai was therefore grandson of Solomon and brother of King Abijah (Abijam).—2 Chron. 11:20, 21.

ARIMATHEA
(Ar·i·ma·theʹa) [Gr. form of Heb. Ra·mahʹ, height].
A “city of the Judeans” in the time of Jesus, and the native city of Joseph, the secret disciple who obtained Jesus’ corpse for burial. (Luke 23:50-53; Matt. 27:57-60; Mark 15:43-46; John 19:38-42) The location of Arimathea is generally considered to be at the site of modern Rentis, about twenty miles (32 kilometers) NW of Jerusalem and about sixteen miles (26 kilometers) E of Joppa (modern Jaffa).

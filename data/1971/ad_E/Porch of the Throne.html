<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An important building that Solomon constructed after the temple was completed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:1-11:7:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:7-11:7:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7</a>) The “porch of judgment” referred to in the text seems to be synonymous with the “Porch of the Throne.” So the “Porch of the Throne” evidently was where Solomon placed his ornate ivory and gold throne and did judging.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:18-11:10:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:18-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The entire description of this building is: “He made the porch of judgment; and they covered it in with cedarwood from the floor to the rafters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:7-11:7:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:7</a>) The Masoretic text actually says, “from floor to floor,” leading some to believe that there was cedar from the floor of this building to the floor of the Porch of Pillars mentioned in the preceding verse. However, the Syriac <em>Peshitta Version</em> reads “from floor to ceiling,” and the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> says “from floor to top.” So, certain translators believe that the cedar was some sort of splendid paneling from the floor of the Porch to its rafters or ceiling. (<em>NW, RS, JB, Ro</em>) Though other architectural details are lacking, this would suggest a building not having open pillars on a side or sides, as may have been the case with the House of the Forest of Lebanon and the Porch of Pillars.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since the Porch of the Throne is listed right after the Porch of Pillars, it is possible that this latter building served as a grand entrance to the Porch of the Throne. A person coming from the S may have had to walk through the Porch of Pillars to enter the porch of judgment.</p>

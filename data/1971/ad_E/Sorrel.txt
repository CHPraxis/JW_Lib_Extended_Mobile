SORREL
Any of a number of plants having a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in their juicy leaves and stems. The radical leaves of common sorrel grow in a cluster. Shaped like an arrow at the base, the somewhat oval leaves measure about four inches (10 centimeters) in length. The flower stalks may attain a height of about two feet (.6 meter) or more. Anciently, the Israelites mixed sorrel with the fodder for their cattle and asses.â€”Isa. 30:24.

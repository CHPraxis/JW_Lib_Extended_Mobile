ISHBI-BENOB
(Ishʹbi-beʹnob) [they abode in Nob].
One of four Rephaim, the giant race of Canaanites; who were prominent during the last wars with Israel in David’s reign. Ishbi-benob carried a copper spear weighing three hundred shekels (c. 71⁄2 pounds; 3.4 kilograms), and was on the verge of killing David, when fast-acting Abishai himself put the giant to death.—2 Sam. 21:15-17, 22.

SPICE
Any of a variety of fragrant plant products, including aloe, balsam, calamus, cassia, cinnamon, frankincense, galbanum, labdanum, myrrh and stacte. Spices were employed in making the holy anointing oil and the incense designated for exclusive sanctuary use. (Ex. 30:23-25, 34-37) They were also used in preparing the dead for burial, myrrh and aloes being specifically mentioned in Jesus’ case. (John 19:39, 40; see also Mark 16:1; Luke 23:56; 24:1.) In connection with the burial of King Asa of Judah there was an extraordinarily great funeral burning, not a cremation, however, but a burning of spices. (2 Chron. 16:14) Anciently spices were added to wines to increase their “headiness.”—Song of Sol. 8:2.
The garden spice or spice plants referred to in The Song of Solomon (5:1, 13; 6:2) may denote fragrant herbs generally, or, as suggested by some scholars, balsam (Balsamodendron opobalsamum). Although condiments such as cummin, mint, dill and salt are mentioned in the Bible, the various original-language words translated “spice” and “spices” are not applied to food seasonings.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It was in the month of Elul that Nehemiah completed the fifty-two-day project of reconstructing Jerusalem’s walls. Thus, the construction must have gotten under way about Ab 4. Nehemiah had obtained permission to return to Jerusalem from Shushan in the spring month of Nisan. The intervening months of Iyyar (Ziv), Sivan and Tammuz allowed for completing the long trip, followed by a three-day rest at Jerusalem before beginning his nighttime survey of the walls.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:11-16:2:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:15-16:6:15" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 6:15</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:9-15:7:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 7:9</a>.</p>

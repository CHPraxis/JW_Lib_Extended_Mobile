<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aʹbi-alʹbon) [father of strength, valiant].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Benjamite and an outstanding warrior listed among thirty-seven of King David’s most valiant fighters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:31-10:23:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:31</a>) He is evidently the Abiel referred to in a parallel passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:32-13:11:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:32</a>. He is called “the Arbathite,” perhaps because of coming from the city of Beth-arabah, which lay near the frontier between Benjamin and Judah above the northern end of the Dead Sea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:6-6:15:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 15:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:18-6:18:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:21-6:18:22" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 21, 22</a>) His fighting valor was in accord with Jacob’s deathbed prophecy concerning the tribe of Benjamin.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:27-1:49:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 49:27</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A transliteration of the Hebrew expression <em>hig·ga·yohnʹ,</em> understood by lexicographers to denote a technical term of musical direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:16-19:9:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 9:16</a>) On the basis of the context in its appearances in the Hebrew text, it has been variously rendered as “soft utterance,” “meditation,” “thoughts,” “melody,” “sweet music,” “resounding music,” “muttering(s)” and “whispering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:14-19:19:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 19:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:92:3-19:92:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 92:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:62-25:3:62" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Lam. 3:62</a>, <em>AT, Mo, NW, Ro, RS, Yg</em>) While many ideas have been advanced as to its precise meaning at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:16-19:9:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 9:16</a>, the most plausible suggestions are that Higgaion in this case signifies either a solemn, deep-toned harp interlude or a solemn pause conducive to meditation.</p>

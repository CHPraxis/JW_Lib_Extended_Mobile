VISIONARY
As used in the Bible, this term denotes a man who had or claimed to have visions from God regarding concealed or future matters. The Hebrew word for “visionary” is hho·zehʹ, from hha·zahʹ, meaning “to gaze.” Hha·zahʹ and its derivatives are employed with reference to seeing visions.—Num. 24:4; Isa. 1:1; 21:2; 22:1; Ezek. 13:7; Dan. 8:1.
Some visionaries were false and were opposed by God. (Isa. 29:10; Mic. 3:7) Others were sent by Jehovah and spoke in his name. (2 Ki. 17:13; 2 Chron. 33:18) The term “visionary” is applied to several men, namely, Heman, Iddo, Hanani, Gad, Asaph, Jeduthun and Amos. (1 Chron. 25:5; 2 Chron. 12:15; 19:2; 29:25, 30; 35:15; Amos 7:12) Some, such as Gad and Iddo, recorded their visions or wrote other accounts. (1 Chron. 29:29; 2 Chron. 9:29; 33:19) Not all of Jehovah’s prophets were visionaries. However, Gad was called both a “prophet” and “David’s visionary,” apparently because at least some of the messages he received from God came by means of visions containing divine instruction or counsel for King David.—2 Sam. 24:11; 1 Chron. 21:9; see SEER.

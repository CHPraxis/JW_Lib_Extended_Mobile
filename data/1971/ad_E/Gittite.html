<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Gitʹtite).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A term often applied to an inhabitant or native of the Philistine city of Gath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:2-6:13:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 13:2, 3</a>) Giant Goliath was a “Gittite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:19-10:21:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 21:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 20:5</a>) Gittites, including Ittai (called “a foreigner” and “an exile” from his home), faithfully stuck with David during his flight at the time of Absalom’s rebellion.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:13-10:15:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:18-10:15:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:2-10:18:2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 18:2</a>; see GATH; ITTAI No. 1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The term “Gittite,” however, is also applied to Obed-edom, in whose home the ark of the covenant temporarily rested. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:10-10:6:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 6:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:13-13:13:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 13:13</a>) Some scholars believe he similarly was from Philistine Gath. It seems more likely, however, that Obed-edom was a Levite, and may have been called a “Gittite” because he came from the Levite city of Gath-rimmon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:20-6:21:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 21:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:23-6:21:24" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>; see OBED-EDOM No. 1.</p>

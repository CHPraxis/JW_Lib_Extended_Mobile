(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:2-11:4:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:2</a>) He is referred to as the son of priest Zadok; he may be the brother of Ahimaaz.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:8-13:6:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 6:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">6. A prophet, son of Oded, who helped arouse Asa in 963 B.C.E. to “search for Jehovah.” As a result, the king removed the “disgusting things” from all the land and brought the people into an oath-bound covenant, so that “anyone that would not search for Jehovah the God of Israel should be put to death.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:15:1-14:15:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:1-15</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:1-14:21:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:1-4</a>) “It seems far-fetched to suppose [as some have] that the name was used twice because the boys were only half brothers or because one had already died in infancy.” (<em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> Vol. 1, p. 325) It is unusual for two brothers to have apparently the same name, but in Hebrew there is a slight difference between the two in spelling and pronunciation, <em>ʽAzar·yahʹ</em> and <em>ʽAzar·yaʹhu.</em></p>

Son of a certain Jehu and father of Helez; of the tribe of Judah, seven generations removed from his Egyptian forefather Jarha.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:3-13:2:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:34-13:2:39" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 34-39</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">12. Son of Obed. One of the five chiefs of hundreds who helped enthrone Jehoash in place of usurper Athaliah, 898 B.C.E.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:23:1-14:23:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:1-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">13. King of Judah for fifty-two years (829-777 B.C.E.). Son of Amaziah and Jecoliah.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">14. A high priest, son of Johanan, descendant of Aaron. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:1-13:6:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chron. 6:1-10</a>) When King Uzziah presumptuously attempted to offer incense in the temple, perhaps it was this Azariah who then ordered <span id="page169" class="pageNum" data-no="169" data-before-text="169"></span>him out, and when he resisted, Jehovah struck the king with leprosy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:16-21</a>) Some three decades after Uzziah died, during the first year of Hezekiah’s reign (745 B.C.E.), Azariah, still serving as high priest, acknowledged Jehovah’s blessing on the king’s reforms.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:9-14:31:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:13-14:31:13" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">15. A prince of Ephraim, son of Jehohanan.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">18. Son of Hilkiah the high priest under Josiah and father of Seraiah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:22:3-12:22:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:13-13:6:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:13, 14</a>); forefather of Ezra the copyist.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:1-15:7:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">19. Son of Hoshaiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:43:2-24:43:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer. 43:2</a>) He is also called Jezaniah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:40:8-24:40:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jer. 40:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:42:1-24:42:1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 42:1</a>) and Jaazaniah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:23-12:25:23" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:23</a>).

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">20. One of the Hebrew youths taken captive to Babylon in 617 B.C.E., whose name was changed to Abednego, meaning “Servant of Nego (or Mercury).” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:3-27:1:7" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Dan. 1:3-7</a>) After a special three-year training course, Azariah and his companions (Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael) were found to be “ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests and the conjurers” of Babylon. (1:5, 14-20) First threatened with death (2:13-18), then promoted to the office of administrator (2:49), Azariah’s supreme test of loyalty to Jehovah came when he was thrown into a superheated furnace for refusing to worship the image set up by Nebuchadnezzar. (3:12-30) Indeed a man of faith, he is alluded to by the apostle Paul as one who “stayed the force of fire.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:34-58:11:34" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 11:34</a>.</p>

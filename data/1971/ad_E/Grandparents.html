<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This term, as well as “grandfather” and “grandmother,” is rarely found in Bible translations. “Grandmother” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:10-11:15:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Kings 15:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:13-11:15:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a> is translated from the same word as “mother” and is appropriately so rendered because Maacah was Asa’s grandmother, not his mother. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:1-11:15:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:8-11:15:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 8</a>) It appears that Maacah continued as the queen mother during Asa’s reign until she was removed for her idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:13-11:15:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:13</a>) Correspondingly, “father” on occasion indicated a grandfather or forefather. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:13-1:28:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 28:13</a>) Grandparents are also identified by such expressions as “the father of your mother” and “mother’s father.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:2-1:28:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 28:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:1-7:9:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Judg. 9:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Children or grandchildren,” the apostle says, should “keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents [Gr., <em>pro·goʹnois</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:4-54:5:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:4</a>) Another form of the same word (<em>pro·goʹnon</em>) is rendered “forefathers” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:3-55:1:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:3</a>. Timothy’s grandmother (Gr., <em>mamʹme</em>) Lois is commended for having ‘faith without hypocrisy,’ and she apparently assisted in the development of Timothy’s faith and spiritual growth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:5-55:1:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 3:14, 15</a>.</p>

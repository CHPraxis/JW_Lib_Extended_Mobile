<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A number of Hebrew and Greek words are appropriately rendered by the English word “scales,” which has various meanings.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>ANIMAL SCALES</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Flattened, rigid plates forming part of the outer body covering of many fishes and reptiles. The Law ruled as ceremonially clean for food “everything that has fins and scales in the waters.” Water animals lacking such could not be eaten; they were “a loathsome thing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:9-3:11:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 11:9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:12-3:11:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:9-5:14:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Deut. 14:9, 10</a>) Thus scales (Heb., <em>qas·qeʹseth</em>) were one of the easily recognizable signs as to whether a certain fish could be eaten. Though there are four types of fish scales, most common are ctenoid scales (with a comblike edge) and cycloid scales (with a rounded border). These are arranged in overlapping rows, forming a thin, light and flexible covering.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The same Hebrew word is used in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:4-26:29:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 29:4</a>, where the Egyptian Pharaoh is symbolically described as what seems to be a crocodile. The entire body of a crocodile is covered with strong plates of horn set in its leathery skin. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:41:15-18:41:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 41:15-17</a> apparently also refers to the scales (<em>AS, NW, MR</em>) of the crocodile, in this case using the Hebrew word that is often translated “shield.”—See CROCODILE.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>SCALES FOR WEIGHING</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A device for weighing objects. The ancients were acquainted with the simple beam scale or balance. It consisted of a horizontal bar or beam pivoted at the center on a peg or cord, and from each end of the beam hung a pan or hook. The object to be weighed was put in one pan (or hung on one hook, as with a small bag of money) and the known weights were put on the other side. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:10-24:32:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 32:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:6-23:46:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa. 46:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:15-1:23:16" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Gen. 23:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:1-26:5:1" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Ezek. 5:1</a>; see MONEY.) During a famine, even food might be measured carefully on a balance. The rider of the black horse described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:5-66:6:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 6:5</a> held a pair of scales “for measuring bread by weight, to personify bad times, when provisions became cruelly expensive.”—<em>The Expositor’s Greek Testament,</em> Vol. V, p. 390.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah commanded honesty and accuracy in using scales (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:35-3:19:36" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 19:35, 36</a>), for a cheating pair of scales was detestable to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:1-20:11:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:11-20:16:11" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:10-26:45:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Ezek. 45:10</a>) Scales could be made inaccurate by having the arms of unequal length, or rendered less sensitive by having the arms relatively short or by making the beam thicker and heavier. At times Israelites used scales fraudulently (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:12:7-28:12:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hos. 12:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:5-30:8:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Amos 8:5</a>), and they multiplied the deception by using inaccurate weights, one set for buying and another for selling.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:23-20:20:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 20:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Weighing scales were spoken of figuratively, as when Job mentioned ‘weighing his adversity on scales.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:2-18:6:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 6:2</a>) The littleness of earthling men was emphasized by saying that they are lighter than an exhalation on the scales (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:9-19:62:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 62:9</a>), and the nations were compared to an insignificant film of dust on the scales from the standpoint of Jehovah, who could, as it were, weigh all the hills in the scales. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:12-23:40:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 40:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:15-23:40:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Scales were sometimes used to represent accurate measurement in judgment.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:6-18:31:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 31:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:27-27:5:27" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Dan. 5:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>SCALES OF ARMOR</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A coat of mail might have attached to it scales (Heb., <em>qas·qeʹseth</em>) consisting of small metal plates that overlapped and provided a relatively flexible <span id="page1456" class="pageNum" data-no="1456" data-before-text="1456"></span>armor plate.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:5-9:17:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:5</a>; see ARMS, ARMOR (Coat of Mail).</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>SCALES ON PAUL’S EYES</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When Paul was cured of the blindness resulting from Jesus’ appearing to him, “what looked like scales” fell from his eyes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:18-44:9:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 9:18</a>) Certain translations (<em>Dy, Da, AV</em>) render this verse in a way that suggests that nothing actually fell from Paul’s eyes, but that the verse is simply using figurative language for his regaining sight. However, numerous modern translations indicate that something really fell from Paul’s eyes.—<em>AT, NW, RS, Sd, We</em>.</p>

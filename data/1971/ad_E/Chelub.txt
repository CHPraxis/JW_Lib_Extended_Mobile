CHELUB
(Cheʹlub) [basket; cage].
1. Descendant of Judah; brother of Shuhah and father of Mehir. (1 Chron. 4:1, 11) The rendering of the name as “Chelub” is based on the Masoretic text and appears in this form in AV, NW (1961 ed.), Ro, AT and other translations. However, he is called “Caleb” in LXX, SYp and Vg, and, therefore, this form is found in NW (1955 ed.) and other translations, such as those by Knox and Lamsa.
2. Father of Ezri, one serving under King David as overseer of those cultivating the fields.—1 Chron. 27:26.

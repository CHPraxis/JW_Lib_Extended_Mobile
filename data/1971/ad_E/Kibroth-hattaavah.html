<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The site of an Israelite wilderness encampment, where the mixed crowd expressed selfish longing for the food of Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:4-4:11:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:16-4:33:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 33:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:9:22-5:9:22" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Deut. 9:22</a>) It is generally identified with Rueis el-Eberij, about eighteen miles (29 kilometers) NE of Jebel Musa, the traditional site of Mount Sinai. There Jehovah miraculously provided a month’s supply of quails for the entire camp. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:19-4:11:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 11:19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:31-4:11:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 31</a>) But the people were so greedy that “the one collecting least gathered ten homers” (62 bushels; 2,220 liters). The record says that while “the meat was yet between their teeth, before it could be chewed, . . . Jehovah began striking at the people with a very great slaughter.” Rather than denoting literal chewing of a mouthful, this may mean before the entire provision of meat could be “exhausted” or “consumed” (<em>AT, RS</em>), because the Hebrew word translated “chewed” basically means “cut off.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:5-29:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joel 1:5</a>.) After this the dead were buried and the place therefore came to be called Kibroth-hattaavah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:32-4:11:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Num. 11:32-35</a>.</p>

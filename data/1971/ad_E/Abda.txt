ABDA
(Abʹda) [servant].
1. The father of Adoniram. (1 Ki. 4:6) His son, Adoniram, was a prince over those conscripted for forced labor during David’s and Solomon’s reigns, and is evidently the Adoram or Hadoram referred to in other texts. (2 Sam. 20:24; 1 Ki. 12:18; 2 Chron 10:18) Hence, Abda probably was a contemporary of King David.
2. A descendant of Jeduthun, of the tribe of Levi. (Neh. 11:17, 18) Abda the Levite is evidently the same as the “Obadiah” mentioned at 1 Chronicles 9:16. He was among the exiles to return to Jerusalem from Babylon.

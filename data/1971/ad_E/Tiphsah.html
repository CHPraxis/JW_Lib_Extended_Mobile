<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Tiphʹsah) [passage, ford].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A place at the extreme N of Solomon’s kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:24-11:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:24</a>) Scholars generally identify it with Dibseh on the Euphrates River, some sixty miles (c. 97 kilometers) E-SE of Aleppo and almost that same distance from the confluence of the Euphrates and Balikh Rivers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A place, apparently in the vicinity of Tirzah, that was struck down by Israel’s King Menahem (c. 791-780 B.C.E.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:16-12:15:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:16</a>) Its exact situation is not known. Khirbet Tafsah, about seven miles (c. 11 kilometers) SW of ancient Shechem, bears a similar name, but appears to be too far from the assumed site of Tirzah to be the location of this Tiphsah.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As has been shown in the article headed CUSH, the term “Cushite” may refer to inhabitants of the land of Cush in Africa or may apply to people of Arabic tribes on the Arabian Peninsula, the latter identification evidently applying to Moses, wife Zipporah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:1-2:18:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 18:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:1-4:12:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Num. 12:1</a>) Zipporah was a Shemite, descended from Abraham through Midian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:1-1:25:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 25:1, 2</a>) The expression at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:16-14:21:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 21:16</a> “by the side of the Ethiopians [Cushites]” as applying to certain Arabs may also mean “under the control of the Ethiopians,” and this might indicate one basis for applying the name “Cushite” to persons not descended from Cush. Several of Cush’s sons are believed to have settled on the Arabian Peninsula. See HAVILAH No. 2; SABTAH.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Basically, however, “Cushite” refers to Africans residing in the region anciently called Ethiopia. In addition to “Zerah the Ethiopian [Heb., Cushite]” and “Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:9-14:14:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:9-12:19:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:9</a>), considered under the heading CUSH, other Cushites mentioned in the Bible are Ebed-melech (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:38:7-24:38:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 38:7-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:39:16-24:39:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 39:16-18</a>) and the Ethiopian eunuch who became a convert to Christianity, and the queen he served, Candace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 8:26, 27</a>) General Joab selected an unnamed Cushite runner rather than an Israelite to deliver the news to David of <span id="page405" class="pageNum" data-no="405" data-before-text="405"></span>his son Absalom’s defeat and death.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:19-10:18:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 18:19-32</a>; see CUSH No. 2.</p>

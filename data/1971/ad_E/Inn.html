<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A place where travelers could find accommodations for themselves and their animals. Perhaps ancient Middle Eastern inns resembled those built there in more recent times. These commonly consist of a walled square with only one entrance. Along the walls on a raised platform there are a series of unfurnished rooms for sheltering travelers and goods, entrance being gained from the inner courtyard. The animals are left in the large court, which often has a centrally situated well. Innkeepers of ancient times furnished a few necessary provisions to travelers and cared for persons left in their charge, receiving compensation for their services.â€”<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:33-42:10:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 10:33-35</a>.</p>

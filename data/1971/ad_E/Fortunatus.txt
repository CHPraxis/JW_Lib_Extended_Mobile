FORTUNATUS
(For·tu·naʹtus) [fortunate].
One of the mature members of the congregation in Corinth who, together with Stephanas and Achaicus, visited Paul at Ephesus. (1 Cor. 16:8, 17, 18) From these men Paul may have learned of the disturbing conditions about which he wrote, and they were possibly the ones who delivered Paul’s first canonical letter to the Corinthians.—1 Cor. 1:11; 5:1; 11:18.

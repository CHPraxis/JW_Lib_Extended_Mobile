<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This expression translates the two words <em>Y<sup>e</sup>ho·wahʹ Tsidh·qeʹnu,</em> found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:6-24:23:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 23:6 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:16-24:33:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 33:16</a>. Other translations are: “The LORD is our vindicator” (<em>AT</em>); “Yahweh-our-integrity” (<em>JB</em>).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:5-24:23:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a> is a Messianic prophecy describing the future king sprouting from David’s line to “execute justice and righteousness in the land.” Since he rules as God’s representative (even as David, and others, sat “upon Jehovah’s throne” as God’s anointed king; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:23-13:29:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>), the prophecy says, “This is his name with which he will be called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.” There is no basis for claiming, as some have, that this means that Jesus, the Messiah, and Jehovah are the same, forming one God. This can be seen from the fact that the similar Messianic prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:14-24:33:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 33:14-16</a> applies the identical expression to Jerusalem, saying: “And this is what she will be called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.” In both cases the expression shows that God’s name, Jehovah, placed both upon his promised king and upon his chosen capital, is a guarantee of their righteousness. Moreover, the justice and righteousness emanating from, or expressed by, these sources are the product of full devotion to Jehovah and his divine will, bringing Jehovah’s blessing and direction.</p>

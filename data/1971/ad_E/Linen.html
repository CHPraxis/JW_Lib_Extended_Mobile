<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The thread or cloth made from flax.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:11-5:22:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 22:11</a>) Other items made from linen included belts (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:13:1-24:13:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 13:1</a>) and sails.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Linen varied in quality, as indicated by Scriptural references to “fine linen” and “fine fabric.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:16:10-26:16:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 16:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:16-26:27:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 27:16</a>) The wealthy, kings and men of high governmental station wore linen of a superior quality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:42-1:41:42" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 41:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:27-13:15:27" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 15:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:8:15-17:8:15" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Esther 8:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:19-42:16:19" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Luke 16:19</a>) Jesus’ corpse was wrapped in clean, fine linen by Joseph, a rich man of Arimathea.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:57-40:27:59" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 27:57-59</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Fine linen yarn spun by Israelite women was used in making the ten tent cloths of the tabernacle, the curtain separating the Holy from the Most Holy, the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle, and that of the gate of the courtyard. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:25-2:35:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 35:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:8-2:36:8" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 36:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:35-2:36:35" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:36:37-2:36:37" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:18-2:38:18" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> 38:18</a>) Fine twisted linen was used in the robes of the priests, the ornamental headgears, the drawers and the sashes, as well as the high priest’s turban, <span id="page1069" class="pageNum" data-no="1069" data-before-text="1069"></span>ephod and breastpiece.

Thus the law prohibiting mixing of two kinds of materials was not violated. Additionally, these were special items designed according to Jehovah’s direct, specific instructions.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:35-2:35:35" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 35:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:23-2:38:23" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 38:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Mer·a·thaʹim) [perhaps, double rebellion; or, on the basis of Vatican Manuscript No. 1209 (<em>LXX</em>) and the <em>Peshitta Version,</em> double bitterness].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A designation applying to Babylon or, possibly, to a particular territory in Babylonia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:21-24:50:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 50:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:23-24:50:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>) It may allude to the region known from inscriptions as <em>mat marrati,</em> considered to be an area near the Persian Gulf between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Possibly Merathaim is a play on the Hebrew verb <em>ma·rahʹ</em> (“to be rebellious”), and, therefore, as a dual form of <em>ma·rahʹ,</em> Merathaim may point to the intensity of Babylon’s rebellion. From the days of its founder Nimrod, Babylon’s course was one of rebellion against Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:8-1:10:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 10:8-10</a>) For this reason it could appropriately bear the name “land of double rebellion.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site in Judah where descendants of Shelah the son of Judah resided. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:21-13:4:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:21, 22</a>) Most authorities consider Cozeba to be the same as Achzib (“Chezib” in some versions) mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:5-1:38:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 38:5 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:44-6:15:44" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Joshua 15:44</a>, and on this basis it is tentatively identified with Tell el-Beida, somewhat less than sixteen miles (25.7 kilometers) SW of Bethlehem between the suggested locations of Adullam and Lachish. The men of Cozeba are apparently included in the expression “they were the potters.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:23-13:4:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:23</a>; see ACHZIB No. 1.</p>

TERTULLUS
(Terʹtul·lus) [from Tertius, third].
A public speaker who presented the Jews’ case against Paul before Governor Felix in Caesarea. Of what Luke recorded, much of Tertullus’ statement personally praises Felix, with only a very brief accusation against Paul, attempting to implicate him with the frequent seditions against Rome. (Acts 24:1-8) Nothing definite is known as to Tertullus’ nationality, whether Jewish or Roman.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shupʹpim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A descendant of Benjamin, perhaps through Bela and Ir(i). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:6-13:7:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:12-13:7:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>) The introduction of Shuppim into the genealogies of Manasseh in verse 15 may indicate some unusual intertribal relationship. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:21-1:46:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 46:21</a> Shuppim is called Muppim, possibly due to the similarity of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet represented in English by <em>sh</em> and <em>m.</em> The name is also spelled Shephupha(m, n), and identifies the individual as founder of a Benjamite tribal family of Shuphamites.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:39-4:26:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 26:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:5-13:8:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 8:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A gatekeeper appointed to the W of the sanctuary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:26:16-13:26:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 26:16</a>) Since the last three characters of his name in Hebrew (<em>Sup·pimʹ</em>) are identical to the last three characters of the previous term (<em>behth ha-ʼasup</em>·<em>pimʹ</em>), scholars suspect it to be a dittograph, that is, an unintentional scribal repetition, therefore not the name of a person, in this verse.—Compare verses 10 and 11.</p>

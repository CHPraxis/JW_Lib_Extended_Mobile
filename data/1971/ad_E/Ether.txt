ETHER
(Eʹther) [riches; fullness; abundance; or perhaps, (place of) prayer].
A city of the Shephelah in the territory of Judah, but allotted to Simeon. (Josh. 15:33, 42; 19:1-9) Today it is generally identified with Khirbet el-ʽAter, about one mile (1.6 kilometers) NW of Beit Jibrin (Eleutheropolis). The account at Joshua 19:7 is nearly parallel with that of 1 Chronicles 4:32 and in this latter text Ether appears to be referred to as Tochen.
Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at Joshua 15:42 being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-ʽAter, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at Joshua 19:7, being situated near Ziklag to the S. While the other towns referred to in Joshua 19:7 are all in the S and many of those at Joshua 15:42 are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Usually a raised outdoor platform, approached by steps, from which seated officials could address the crowds and announce their decisions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:19-40:27:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 27:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:13-43:19:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> John 19:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:21-44:12:21" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Acts 12:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:6-44:25:6" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 25:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:10-44:25:10" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:17-44:25:17" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 17</a>) What is thought by some to have been the judgment seat (called the “Bema”) at Corinth, where Paul appeared before Gallio, was built of white and blue marble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:1-44:18:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 18:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:12-44:18:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:16-44:18:17" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) Alongside it were two waiting rooms with mosaic floors and marble benches.</p>

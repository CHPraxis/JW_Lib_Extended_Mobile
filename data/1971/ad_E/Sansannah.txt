SANSANNAH
(San·sanʹnah) [a palm branch, or a stalk of dates].
A town in the southern portion of the territory of the tribe of Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 31) It is generally identified with Khirbet esh-Shamsaniyat, about ten miles (16 kilometers) N-NE of Beer-sheba. A comparison of Joshua 15:31 with parallel lists of cities at Joshua 19:5 and 1 Chronicles 4:31 indicates that it may be the same as Hazar-susah (or Hazar-susim).—See HAZAR-SUSAH.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(The·ophʹi·lus) [friend of God].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The person to whom Luke addressed both his Gospel and the Acts of Apostles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:3-42:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 1:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:1-44:1:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 1:1</a>) His being called “most excellent” may indicate a high position of some kind, or may simply be an expression of high esteem. Theophilus apparently was a Christian, having been orally taught about Jesus Christ and his ministry. Luke’s written statement served to assure him of the certainty of what he had learned previously by word of mouth.</p>

MATRED
(Maʹtred) [spear, or, perhaps, expulsion].
Mother of Mehetabel, the wife of Edomite King Hadar (Hadad). (Gen. 36:31, 39; 1 Chron. 1:50) At Genesis 36:39 the Syriac Peshitta Version and the Septuagint present Matred as the son of Mezahab, but, according to the Masoretic text, Matred was Mezahab’s daughter.

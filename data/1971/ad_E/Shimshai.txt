SHIMSHAI
(Shimʹshai) [sun child].
A scribe in the administration of Rehum, the chief government official of the Persian province “beyond the River,” which included Jerusalem. Shimshai joined in writing a letter to the Persian ruler Artaxerxes in an effort to stop the Jews from their rebuilding work in Jerusalem. Artaxerxes put through an order to stop the work, which was resumed during the reign of his successor King Darius Hystaspis (Darius I of Persia).—Ezra 4:8-24.

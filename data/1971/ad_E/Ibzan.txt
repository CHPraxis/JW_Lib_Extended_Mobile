IBZAN
(Ibʹzan) [swift].
The one who succeeded Jephthah as judge of Israel. Ibzan was the father of thirty sons and thirty daughters, indicating that he was a polygamist and evidently also a man of some means. He procured thirty daughters as wives for his sons. After judging for seven years Ibzan died and was buried in his native city of Bethlehem, likely the Bethlehem in Zebulun.—Judg. 12:7-10; Josh. 19:10, 14, 15; see BETHLEHEM No. 2.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Helʹkath) [portion, plot of land].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city listed among the boundary sites of the tribe of Asher (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:24, 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:31-6:19:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 31</a>), later assigned to the Gershonites as a Levitical city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:27-6:21:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 21:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:30-6:21:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 30, 31</a>) It appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:75-13:6:75" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:75</a> with the variant spelling of Hukok. Its location is conjectural. Yerka, a few miles E of Acco, was the earlier identification, but Tell el-Harbaj, eleven miles (17.7 kilometers) S of Acco and near the base of the Carmel mountain range, is more generally favored today. <em>The New Bible Dictionary</em> by Douglas considers as “perhaps even better, Tell el-Qasis,” somewhat over five miles (8 kilometers) S-SE of Tell el-Harbaj, lying at the entrance to the Valley of Jezreel. Since the towns of Hali and Beten, mentioned after Helkath in the list at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 19:24-26</a>, are generally considered to have been in the southern part of the Plain of Acco, such identification with Tell el-Qasis would indicate a boundary description beginning in the extreme SE corner of the Plain of Acco, rather than one beginning in the N and running S. Further identification of other towns is needed, however, to determine this.</p>

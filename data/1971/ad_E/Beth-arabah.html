<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-arʹa·bah) [house of the desert plains, or, perhaps, house of the depression].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the six cities within Judah’s territory described as “in the wilderness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:61-6:15:61" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:61</a>) It is used in describing the mutual boundaries of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:6-6:15:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 15:6</a>) Though listed as within the tribal assignment of Judah, it is thereafter spoken of as pertaining to Benjamin, perhaps indicating the site as an enclave city of the Benjamites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:22-6:18:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 18:22</a>) Remaining evidence of the name may be seen in ʽAin el-Gharbah, a spring on the N side of the Wadi el-Qelt about three miles (5 kilometers) SE of Jericho. This location would place it in the desert region at the N end of the Dead Sea.</p>

JOIADA
(Joiʹa·da) [shortened form of Jehoiada, meaning “Jehovah knows”].
1. Son of Paseah who helped repair the Gate of the Old City when Nehemiah had Jerusalem’s wall rebuilt.—Neh. 3:6.
2. Great-grandson of Jeshua and father of Johanan (Jonathan) in the postexilic high-priestly line. (Neh. 12:10, 11, 22) One of Joiada’s sons defiled himself and his priesthood by marrying a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, for which Nehemiah chased him away.—Neh. 13:28, 29.

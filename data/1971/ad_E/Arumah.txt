ARUMAH
(A·ruʹmah) [height].
A town in the territory of Ephraim in which Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, resided and from which he launched his attack on the Shechemites. (Judg. 9:41) It is tentatively identified with El ʽOrmeh, about six miles (9.7 kilometers) SE of Shechem. Some suggest that it is the same as the “Rumah” referred to at 2 Kings 23:36.—See RUMAH.

JOANNA
(Jo·anʹna).
One of several women whom Jesus Christ cured of some infirmity and who then became his followers, ministering to him and his apostles from their own possessions. (Luke 8:1-3) Joanna was apparently with the women present at Jesus’ impalement and, having prepared spices and oil to take to his tomb, they were among the first to find that he had been resurrected. The eleven apostles, however, found their report thereof difficult to believe. (Luke 23:49, 55, 56; 24:1-11) Joanna’s husband Chuza was steward of Herod Antipas.—Luke 8:3.

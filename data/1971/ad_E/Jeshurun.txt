JESHURUN
(Jeshʹu·run) [upright one; probably drawn from ya·sharʹ (to be righteous)].
An honorary title for Israel. In the Septuagint Version “Jeshurun” becomes a term of affection, it being rendered “beloved.” The designation “Jeshurun” should have reminded Israel of its calling as Jehovah’s covenant people and therefore of its obligation to remain upright. (Deut. 33:5, 26; Isa. 44:2) At Deuteronomy 32:15 the name “Jeshurun” is used ironically. Instead of living up to its name “Jeshurun,” Israel became intractable, forsook its Maker and despised its Savior.

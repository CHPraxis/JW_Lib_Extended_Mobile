TOLA
(Toʹla) [the coccus, metonymically, crimson or deep-scarlet color].
1. First-named son of Issachar who accompanied Jacob’s household into Egypt in 1728 B.C.E. (Gen. 46:8, 13) Tola’s sons and some of his grandsons founded populous tribal families in Issachar, collectively known as Tolaites.—Num. 26:23; 1 Chron. 7:1-4.
2. A judge of Israel; the son of Puah. Tola was a descendant of Issachar, but he lived, and was later buried, in the mountainous region of Ephraim. No experiences from his twenty-three-year judgeship are recorded.—Judg. 10:1, 2.

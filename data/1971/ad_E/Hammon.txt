HAMMON
(Hamʹmon) [perhaps, hot spring].
1. A city on the boundary of Asher. (Josh. 19:24-28) It is generally identified with Umm el-ʽAwamid, on the Mediterranean seacoast, about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) S of Tyre.
2. A site in the territory of Naphtali given to the Levites (1 Chron. 6:71, 76); apparently the same as Hammath.—Josh. 19:35; see HAMMATH No. 2.

EUODIA
(Eu·oʹdi·a) [good journey, success].
A woman in the Christian congregation at Philippi who had fought side by side with the apostle Paul and others “in the good news.” Euodia was apparently having some difficulty in resolving a problem that had arisen between her and Syntyche, and Paul admonished these two Christian women “to be of the same mind in the Lord.”—Phil. 4:2, 3.

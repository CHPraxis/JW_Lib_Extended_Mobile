DAʹLETH
[====].
The fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, as a number it denoted four. In sound it corresponds generally to our English “d.”
There is considerable similarity between the letters daʹleth [====] and rehsh [====], allowing for possible scribal errors in copying. This may account for various differences in spelling, such as that of the “Rodanim” at 1 Chronicles 1:7 and the “Dodanim” at Genesis 10:4.
In the Hebrew, this fourth letter is used as the initial letter in the first word of each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:25-32.—See ALPHABET.

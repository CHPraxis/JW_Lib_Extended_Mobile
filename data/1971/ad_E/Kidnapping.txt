KIDNAPPING
Seizing, carrying away and detaining a person against his will through unlawful force, fraud or intimidation. Kidnapping was a crime carrying the penalty of capital punishment under the Mosaic law. If a person were to steal or kidnap a man and sell him, or if the kidnapped individual was found with him, the kidnapper was to be put to death. (Ex. 21:16; Deut. 24:7) Prior to the giving of this law to Israel, Jacob’s son Joseph was sold into slavery and was a victim of kidnapping. (Gen. 37:27, 28, 40:15) God later turned this act into a blessing for Joseph in Egypt and be forgave his brothers for their wicked deed.—Gen. 45:4, 5.
In writing to Timothy, the apostle Paul made the observation that “law is promulgated, not for a righteous man,” but for lawless persons, including kidnappers.—1 Tim. 1:8-11.

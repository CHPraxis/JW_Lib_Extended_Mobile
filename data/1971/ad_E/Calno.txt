CALNO
(Calʹno).
A city listed in Isaiah’s prophecy concerning the boasting of the Assyrians as to their conquests and the futility of trying to withstand their might. (Isa. 10:5, 9-11) Most authorities consider Calno to be an alternate spelling of Calneh. (Amos 6:2) Calno’s mention in connection with Carchemish would harmonize with the identification of Calneh with Kullani of the Assyrian texts, located between Carchemish and Aleppo in northern Syria. Kullani was conquered by Tiglath-pileser III, a contemporary of King Ahaz of Judah.—See CALNEH No. 2.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Jeshʹu·run) [upright one; probably drawn from <em>ya·sharʹ</em> (to be righteous)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An honorary title for Israel. In the <em>Septuagint Version</em> “Jeshurun” becomes a term of affection, it being rendered “beloved.” The designation “Jeshurun” should have reminded Israel of its calling as Jehovah’s covenant people and therefore of its obligation to remain upright. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:5-5:33:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 33:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:26-5:33:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:2-23:44:2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isa. 44:2</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:15-5:32:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> the name “Jeshurun” is used ironically. Instead of living up to its name “Jeshurun,” Israel became intractable, forsook its Maker and despised its Savior.</p>

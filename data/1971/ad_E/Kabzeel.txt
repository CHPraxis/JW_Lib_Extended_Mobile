KABZEEL
(Kabʹze·el) [gathering of God, or, God gathers].
A city in the southern part of Judah. (Josh. 15:21) It is sometimes identified with Khirbet Hora, about ten miles (16 kilometers) NE of Beersheba. The Hebrew text of 2 Samuel 23:20 and 1 Chronicles 11:22 has been variously understood to mean that Kabzeel was (1) the home of the distinguished warrior Benaiah or (2) of one of his ancestors or the place where such a one performed notable deeds, or (3) that it was the scene for Benaiah’s many deeds. (Compare AS; AV; JB; Le; NW; RS.) An alternate form, “Jekabzeel,” appears at Nehemiah 11:25 in a listing of postexilic settlements in Judah.

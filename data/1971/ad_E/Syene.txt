SYENE
(Syeʹne) [possibly, market].
A city apparently situated at the southern extremity of ancient Egypt. (Ezek. 29:10; 30:6) As may be inferred from the possible meaning of Syene, the city may have served as a “market” or “trading post.” It is identified with Aswan, situated on the E bank of the Nile opposite Elephantine and some 430 miles (692 kilometers) S of Cairo.

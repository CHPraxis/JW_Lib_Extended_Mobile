HUKKOK
(Huk πkok) [possibly, hewn in, decreed].
A border city of Naphtali. (Josh. 19:32, 34) Whereas some consider it to be too far N and E, modern Yaquq is usually identified with ancient Hukkok. This site lies some five and a half miles (9 kilometers) W of the northern end of the Sea of Galilee and overlooks the fertile plain of Gennesaret.

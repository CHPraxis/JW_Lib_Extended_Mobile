GELILOTH
(Gel·iʹloth) [circles of stones].
A site listed in connection with the boundary of Benjamin. (Josh. 18:17) Geliloth’s location, described as “in front of the ascent of Adummim,” matches that of Gilgal (Josh. 15:7), for which reason most scholars consider it a variant name for the Gilgal near Jericho.—See ADUMMIN; GILGAL No. 1.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>b<sup>e</sup>rithʹ;</em> Gr., <em>di·a·theʹke</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An agreement between two or more persons to do or refrain from doing some act; a compact; a contract. The Hebrew word <em>b<sup>e</sup>rithʹ</em> appears at least 279 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, more than 80 of which occurrences are in the five books of Moses. It is variously translated “covenant,” “confederacy,” “league” and “arrangement.” That its basic meaning is “covenant,” comparable to our modern legal word “contract,” is seen from cuneiform tablets found in 1927 at Qatna, an ancient non-Israelite city SE of Hamath. “The contents of the two tablets [of fifteen found] are simple. Tablet A contains a list of names . . . Tablet B is a ration list, . . . List A is thus a <em>compact</em> in which the men in question . . . agree to enter someone’s service or to carry out certain obligations. List B, written by the same scribe, then illustrates the nature of the <em>compact;</em> the men were to receive specified rations in return for their services. .  . . the Israelite concept of <em>b<sup>e</sup>rithʹ,</em> ‘covenant,’ was a central theme in Yahwist theology. Here we have the first published extra-biblical occurrence of the word from early times—not later than the first third of the fourteenth century B.C.”—<em>Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research,</em> February 1951, p. 22.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>B<sup>e</sup>rithʹ</em> is taken from a root meaning “to cut,” from the custom of ratifying or confirming a covenant by killing animals, cutting them in two and having the parties to the covenant walk between the parts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:9-1:15:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 15:9-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:17-1:15:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:34:18-24:34:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Jer. 34:18, 19</a>) The root sometimes bears the signification “to eat,” since among Orientals to eat together amounts almost to a covenant of friendship. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:44-1:31:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 31:44-47</a>, where Jacob and Laban piled up stones and ate on them at the time of making a covenant, also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:7-31:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Obadiah 7</a>.)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In some translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures the word <em>di·a·theʹke</em> is variously rendered “covenant,” “will,” “testament” (<em>testamentum,</em> Vg). However, M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopoedia</em> says, under “Covenant”: “There seems, however, to be no necessity for the introduction of a new word [other than ‘covenant’] conveying a new idea. The Sept[uagint] having rendered <em>b<sup>e</sup>rithʹ</em> (which never means <em>will</em> or <em>testament,</em> but always <em>covenant</em> or <em>agreement</em>) by <em>di·a·theʹke</em> consistently throughout the O.T., the N.T. writers, in adopting that word, may naturally be supposed to intend to convey to their readers, most of them familiar with the Greek O.T., the same idea. Moreover, in the majority of cases, the same thing which has been called a ‘covenant’ (<em>b<sup>e</sup>rithʹ</em>) in the O.T. is referred to in the N.T. (e.g. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:14-47:3:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. iii,14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:9-58:7:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Heb. vii, ix;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:19-66:11:19" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Rev. xi,19</a>); while in the same context the same word and thing in the Greek are in the English [in <em>AV</em>] sometimes represented by ‘covenant,’ and sometimes by ‘testament’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:22-58:7:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. vii,22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:8-58:8:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> viii,8-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:15-58:9:15" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> ix,15</a>).”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In more than ten places in the book of Hebrews (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:22-58:7:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 7:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:6-58:8:6" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 8:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:8-58:8:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 8, 9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:4-58:9:4" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 9:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:15-58:9:17" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 15, 16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:20-58:9:20" data-bid="6-6" class="b"> 20</a>) the writer uses the word <em>di·a·theʹke</em> with undeniable reference to a <em>covenant</em> in the old Hebrew sense, even quoting from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> and referring to the “ark of the covenant.” In translating these verses of Jeremiah the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> uses <em>di·a·theʹke</em> for the ancient Hebrew <em>b<sup>e</sup>rithʹ,</em> meaning covenant. <span id="page387" class="pageNum" data-no="387" data-before-text="387"></span>Also, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:20-58:9:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:20</a> quotes from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:6-2:24:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 24:6-8</a>, where a covenant is unmistakably spoken of.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>APPLICATION OF THE WORD</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Covenants always involved two or more parties. They could be <em>unilateral</em> (where the party on one side was solely responsible to carry out the terms) or <em>bilateral</em> (where parties on both sides had terms to carry out). Besides the covenants in which God is a party, the Bible records the making of covenants between man and man, and between tribes, nations or groups of persons.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To break a covenant was a grievous sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:11-26:17:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezek. 17:11-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:31-45:1:32" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:31, 32</a>) The marriage compact is called a covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:2:14-39:2:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mal. 2:14</a>) “Covenant” is a term applied to a sure ordinance, such as that concerning the showbread (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:8-3:24:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Lev. 24:8</a>), or to God’s creation governed by his laws, as the unchangeable succession of day and night (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:33:20-24:33:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 33:20</a>); it is also used figuratively, as in the expression “covenant with Death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:18-23:28:18" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 28:18</a>) Jehovah also speaks of a covenant in connection with the wild beasts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:18-28:2:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hos. 2:18</a>) The expression “owners (masters) of a covenant” has the sense of “confederates,” as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:13-1:14:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 14:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In effect, any promise made by Jehovah is a covenant; it is certain to be carried out; it can be relied on with confidence for its fulfillment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:18-58:6:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 6:18</a>) A covenant is in force as long as the terms of it are operative and obligation to perform rests on one or both parties. The results or the blessings brought about by the covenant may continue, even forever.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>METHODS OF RATIFYING OR CONFIRMING A COVENANT</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">God was often invoked as a witness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:50-1:31:50" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 31:50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:20:8-9:20:8" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 20:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:13-26:17:13" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Ezek. 17:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:17:19-26:17:19" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 19</a>) An oath was sworn.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:31-1:21:31" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 21:31</a>) Jehovah used a rainbow in one instance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:12-1:9:16" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 9:12-16</a>) One method was to kill and divide animals, the covenanting parties passing between the pieces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:9-1:15:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gen. 15:9-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:17-1:15:18" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:34:18-24:34:19" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Jer. 34:18, 19</a>) At times festivities accompanied the making of alliances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:28-1:26:28" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 26:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:30-1:26:30" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 30</a>) A communion meal might be participated in, as in conjunction with the making of the Law covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:5-2:24:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ex. 24:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:11-2:24:11" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 11</a>) The superior party might present to the other some article of his dress or arms. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:3-9:18:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:3, 4</a>) Some pagan nations followed the custom of drinking one another’s blood or blood mixed with wine (in violation of God’s prohibition to all persons, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4</a>, and to Israel under the Law) and the covenanters uttered the strongest curses on the party who should later violate the covenant.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Bible uses the expression “covenant of salt” to denote the permanence and immutability of a covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:19-4:18:19" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 18:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:5-14:13:5" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 13:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:2:13-3:2:13" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Lev. 2:13</a>) Among ancient peoples it was a sign of friendship to eat salt together and denoted enduring fidelity and loyalty; the eating of salt with communion sacrifices symbolized perpetual loyalty.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>WRITTEN INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Ten Commandments were written on stone by “God’s finger” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:18-2:31:18" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ex. 31:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:16-2:32:16" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 32:16</a>); Jeremiah wrote a deed, affixed a seal and took witnesses (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:9-24:32:15" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jer. 32:9-15</a>); clay tablets of ancient peoples have been found, setting forth the terms of contracts. Often these were sealed within clay envelopes.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>THE EDENIC PROMISE</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Jehovah God, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>, stated his purpose prophetically in the garden of Eden in the presence of Adam and Eve and the “serpent,” about 4026 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">As to the identity of those involved in this promise and prophecy: The vision given to the apostle John, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>, informs us that the “serpent” is Satan the Devil. Evidence indicates that the “seed” of the “woman,” long looked for by righteous men, is to be identified with the “seed” of Abraham, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Gal. 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:1:1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Matt. 1:1</a>) The “seed” was to be bruised in the heel by the serpent. Jesus Christ was put to death, a wound that proved not to be permanent, however, for God raised Jesus out of death. But the “seed” is, in turn, to bruise the serpent’s head, defeating him permanently.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Who is the “woman” involved in the covenant? Certainly not Eve, who had become God’s enemy. In order to defeat, “bring to nothing,” the <em>spirit</em> creature Satan the Devil, the “seed” would have to be, not human, but spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:14-58:2:14" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 2:14</a>) Jesus at birth was a human Son of God, but at the time of Jesus’ baptism God acknowledged him as His Son, sending holy spirit down upon him. Jesus here became the <em>spirit-begotten</em> Son of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:13-40:3:17" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:3-43:3:5" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> John 3:3-5</a>) Later, at his resurrection, he was “made alive in the <em>spirit</em>.<em>”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18</a>) Who, then, was his “mother,” not as the human babe Jesus, but as the spiritual Son of God? The apostle Paul says that Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Hagar and Ishmael performed a symbolic drama, in which Isaac represented those who had heavenly hopes, as Paul himself did. Paul then states that their “mother” is “the Jerusalem above.” Jesus Christ calls these his “brothers,” indicating they have the same mother. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:11-58:2:11" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Heb. 2:11</a>) This provides a basis for identifying the “woman” of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> with “the Jerusalem above.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:21-48:4:29" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gal. 4:21-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The terms of the promise imply a lapse of time during which the “serpent” would bring forth a “seed,” and enmity would develop between the two ‘seeds.’ Almost 6,000 years have passed since the statement of the promise. Just prior to Christ’s thousand-year reign the “serpent” will be hurled into the abyss of inactivity, and following the end of the thousand years he will be annihilated forever.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 7-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> Rom. 16:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>COVENANT WITH NOAH</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Jehovah God made a covenant with Noah, who represented his family, with regard to Jehovah’s purpose to destroy the wicked world of that day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:17-1:6:21" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:6-61:3:6" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:6</a>) Noah had begun to have sons after he was 500 years old, in 2470 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:32-1:5:32" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Gen. 5:32</a>) At the time God revealed this purpose to Noah, his sons were grown and married. Noah, on his part, was to build the ark and take in his family, animals and food; Jehovah was to preserve flesh on earth, both of man and animals. Noah’s obediently keeping the terms of the covenant resulted in Jehovah’s preservation of human and animal life. The covenant was completely fulfilled in 2369 B.C.E., after the Flood, when men and animals were again able to live on the ground and to reproduce their kind.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:15-1:8:17" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Gen. 8:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>RAINBOW COVENANT</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The rainbow covenant was made between Jehovah God and all flesh, as represented by Noah and his family, in November 2369 B.C.E., in the mountains of Ararat. Jehovah stated that he would never again destroy all flesh by means of a flood. The rainbow was then given as a sign of the covenant, which endures as long as mankind lives on earth, that is, forever.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:8-1:9:17" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Gen. 9:8-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The covenant with Abraham apparently went into effect when Abram (Abraham) crossed the Euphrates and entered Canaan. The Law covenant was made 430 years later. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:17-48:3:17" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Gal. 3:17</a>) Jehovah had spoken to Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, in Ur of the Chaldeans, telling him to travel to the country that God would show him.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">God revealed the purpose and accomplishments of the Abrahamic covenant, saying that through Abraham the seed of promise would come; this seed would possess the gate of his enemies; Abraham’s seed through Isaac would number many, uncountable to man at that time; Abraham’s name would be made great; the seed would possess the Promised Land; all families of the earth would bless themselves by means of the seed. (See above texts from Genesis.) There was a literal fulfillment of these things, which were typical of the greater fulfillment through Christ.

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The covenant of circumcision was made in 1919 B.C.E., when Abraham was 99 years of age.

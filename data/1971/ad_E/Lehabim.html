Since the Hebrew name is a plural form, many scholars hold that a tribe taking its name from one of Mizraim’s sons is meant. (See, however, MIZRAIM.) The Lehabim are generally identified with the Libyans and at least seem to have constituted one of the tribes inhabiting Libya in ancient times. While identification is difficult, they were probably the same as the <em>Lu·vimʹ</em> mentioned elsewhere in the Hebrew text, as at <span id="page1055" class="pageNum" data-no="1055" data-before-text="1055"></span><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:12:3-14:12:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>, where the <em>American Standard Version</em> reads “Lubim” and other translations read “Libyans.”—<em>Mo; NW; RS</em>.</p>

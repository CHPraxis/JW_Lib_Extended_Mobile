HHEHTH
or, as commonly anglicized, heth [ח]. The eighth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, used also to denote the number eight.
This letter is the harshest of the guttural sounds and is similar to the sound of “ch,” as in the Scottish word loch or the German ach. In the Hebrew, in the eighth section of Psalm 119 (verses 57-64) every verse begins with this letter.—See ALPHABET.
In this work it is transliterated as a double h (hh) to denote strong aspiration.

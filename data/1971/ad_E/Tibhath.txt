TIBHATH
(Tibʹhath) [slaughter].
A city N of Palestine from which David took a great quantity of copper after striking down Hadadezer, king of Zobah, at Hamath, some 140 miles (225 kilometers) N of Dan. (1 Chron. 18:3, 8) In the parallel description of David’s campaign at 2 Samuel 8:8 Tibhath is apparently called Betah. (See BETAH.) Some suggest that Tibhath may have been named for Nahor’s son Tebah. (Gen. 22:24) In harmony with its being part of the Aramaean kingdom of Zobah, the location of Tibhath was probably in the valley lying between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains. Traces of ancient copperworks have been found in Lebanon, in harmony with the Biblical account.

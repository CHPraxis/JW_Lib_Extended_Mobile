LASSHARON
(Las·sharʹon).
A royal Canaanite city whose king was defeated by the Israelites under Joshua. (Josh. 12:7, 8, 18) Lassharon is often linked with the district called Sarona, situated, according to Eusebius, between Mount Tabor and the Sea of Galilee. Perhaps modern Sarona, about six miles (10 kilometers) W of the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, marks the ancient site.

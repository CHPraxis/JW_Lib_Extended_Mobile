EKRON
(Ekʹron) [rooting out].
A leading Philistine city, apparently the northernmost seat of one of their five axis lords. (Josh. 13:3) Its exact position is uncertain, but of the modern locations suggested, namely, ʽAqir, Qatra and Khirbet el-Muqanna, recent excavation at the latter, twelve miles (19.3 kilometers) E-NE of Ashdod, has unearthed the largest city of its period and gives it current preference as the site of Ekron.
Ekron’s history is one of constantly changing domination. Joshua’s conquest did not include Ekron. It was not until later that the Judahites captured it. (Josh. 13:2, 3; Judg. 1:18) In the initial division of the Promised Land Ekron was on the border between Judah and Dan but within the tribe of Judah. (Josh. 15:1, 11, 45, 46; 19:40-43) By the time the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, Ekron was back in their possession. The presence of the Ark caused “a death-dealing confusion” to break out in this city, and it was from Ekron that the Ark was finally sent back to the Jews. (1 Sam. 5:10-12; 6:16, 17) After another period under Israelite control, the Philistines apparently again had Ekron at the time David slew Goliath. (1 Sam. 7:14; 17:52) It was in the early tenth century B.C.E. that Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt claimed to have taken Ekron. Some two centuries later, according to Sennacherib’s Annals, Ekron’s King Padi was loyal to the Assyrians.

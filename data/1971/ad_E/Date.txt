DATE
The fruit of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), a tree common to Palestine. Dates are oval-shaped, fleshy, sweet tasting, and produce one seed.
In the Bible account dates are mentioned only indirectly. For example, the Shulammite maiden describes the dark locks of her shepherd lover’s hair as being like “date clusters” (“bushy,” AV; Heb.: tal·tal·limʹ; “date-panicle,” Koehler and Baumgartner’s Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, 1953 ed., p. 1030). Solomon likens her to a palm tree and her breasts to “date clusters” (“grapes,” AV), and to “fruit stalks of dates” (Heb.: san·sin·nimʹ; see Koehler and Baumgartner’s Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, 1953 ed., p. 662).—Song of Sol. 5:11; 7:7, 8; see PALM TREE.

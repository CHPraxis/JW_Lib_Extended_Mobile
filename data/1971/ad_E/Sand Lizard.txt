SAND LIZARD
There is some uncertainty about the unclean ‘swarming creature’ designated by the Hebrew term hhoʹmet. (Lev. 11:30, 31) The renderings of the Greek Septuagint Version and the Latin Vulgate point to a kind of lizard, and the word has been variously translated “sand lizard” (AS, JP, NW, RS), “chameleon” (AT) and “snail.”—AV; see LIZARD.

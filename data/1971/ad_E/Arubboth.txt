ARUBBOTH
(A·rubʹboth) [the lattices].
A town that served as an administrative center under one of the twelve deputies assigned by King Solomon to provide food for the royal household. The son of Hesed functioned there, having oversight over Socoh and the land of Hepher. (1 Ki 4:7, 10) Arubboth is presently identified with modern ʽArrabeh, situated near Dothan and about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) N of Samaria, hence in the territory of Manasseh. Hepher lies W of it on the Plains of Sharon and Socoh to the SW.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>tin·sheʹmeth</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of this reptile is included among the “swarming creatures” that were “unclean” under the Mosaic law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:29-3:11:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 11:29, 30</a>) The name is considered to have been derived from a root word meaning “to pant” or “to blow.” Koehler-Baumgartner’s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> (p. 1035), by comparison with Arabic, suggests the meaning of “snorter.” While identification is uncertain, the name may apply to the chameleon. The common <em>Chamæleon vulgaris</em> is frequently found in Egypt and Palestine.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The chameleon is a slow-moving, tree-dwelling lizard noted for its color-changing ability, which is due to the expansion and contraction of pigment-bearing cells in the skin, controlled by the nervous system. Color response is primarily determined by temperature and light intensity</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:18-3:11:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:18</a> the same name is applied to the swan as among “unclean” fowl.</p>

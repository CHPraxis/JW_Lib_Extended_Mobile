<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Rhoʹda) [rose].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A member of the Christian congregation in Jerusalem at the time of the apostle Peter’s miraculous release from prison in 44 C.E. Rhoda was a servant girl, presumably in the household of Mark’s mother Mary. At least she was one of those who spent the night there praying for Peter. Answering a knock at the door of the gateway, and recognizing Peter’s voice, Rhoda was so overcome with joy that, instead of letting him in, she ran back inside to tell the others. “You are mad,” they said, but she continued insisting. All the while Peter kept knocking until they finally let him in.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:3-44:12:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 12:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:5-44:12:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:12-44:12:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 12-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The most distant point to which Jephthah pursued the Ammonites in their defeat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:33-7:11:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 11:33</a>) It is generally held to be situated between Heshban and Rabbah or Rabbath-ammon (modern Amman). Eusebius (<em>Onomastica</em> 32.15-16) located it as about six miles (9.7 kilometers) from Rabbath-ammon, but the direction is uncertain. It is generally identified today with Khirbet es-Suq, about five miles (8 kilometers) S and a little W of Rabbath-ammon, though some recommend Na式ur, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) W of Rabbath-ammon as the probable location.</p>

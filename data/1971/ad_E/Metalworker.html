<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One who casts, hammers, carves, engraves or otherwise works with metals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:7-23:41:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 41:7</a>) The first “forger of every sort of tool of copper and iron” in recorded history was Tubal-cain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:22-1:4:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:22</a>) Ancient metalworkers made tools, household items, weapons, armor, musical instruments, ornaments and figurines. Besides fashioning new items, they also did repair work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:24:12-14:24:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 24:12</a>) Many were specialists in working such metals as gold (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:8-16:3:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Neh. 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:31-16:3:32" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31, 32</a>), silver (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:17:4-7:17:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judg. 17:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:24-44:19:24" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 19:24</a>) or copper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:14-55:4:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:14</a>) At times they formed a kind of association or guild. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:31-16:3:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 3:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:24-44:19:28" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Acts 19:24-28</a>) Their trade called for skill in artistic design.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Israelites may have had knowledge of metalworking prior to their entry into Egypt, or possibly acquired it there. By the time of the Exodus they had ability to fashion a molten calf and a copper serpent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:4-2:32:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:9-4:21:9" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Num. 21:9</a>) More impressive, however, was the production of various metal items for the tabernacle service. Bezalel and his assistants were aided by Jehovah’s spirit in their metalworking.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:2-2:31:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 31:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:30-2:35:35" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 35:30-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Later, when oppressed by the Philistines, the Israelites were not allowed to have their own metalworkers. This measure prevented them from making weapons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:19-9:13:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:19-22</a>) Doubtless for similar reasons Nebuchadnezzar took the metalworkers and other craftsmen captive the first time he assaulted Jerusalem.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:14-12:24:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:16-12:24:16" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:24:1-24:24:1" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Jer. 24:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:1-24:29:2" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1, 2</a>.</p>

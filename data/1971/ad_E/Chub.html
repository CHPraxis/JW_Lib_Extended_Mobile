<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An unidentified people included among those allied with Egypt. Chub is listed with Ethiopia, Put, Lud and “the sons of the land of the covenant” (who may refer to Israelites who fled to Egypt after the murder of Gedaliah in 607 B.C.E.), all of whom are destined to “fall by the very sword.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:4-26:30:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 30:4, 5</a>) Some commentators think that Chub refers to Libya, and it is so rendered by some translations.—<em>LXX; RS</em>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A cutting tool with a notched or toothed blade and one or two handles, or sometimes consisting of a blade fixed to a frame. Early saws did not cut in both directions; some were designed to cut when pulled toward the user; others, when pushed away. Egyptian saws were generally made of bronze and usually had teeth that slanted in the direction of the handle. Such a saw would cut when drawn toward the person using it. The blade was either inserted in the handle or fastened to it by means of thongs. Two-handled saws having iron blades were in use among the Assyrians. Hebrew and other carpenters employed the saw to cut wood, and masons used saws capable of cutting stone.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:15-23:10:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 10:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:9-11:7:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 7:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">David put captive Ammonites to work at such tasks as sawing stones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:29-10:12:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:29-31</a>) Their tools included “axes,” or, literally, “stone saws,” according to the Masoretic text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:3-13:20:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>. In some cases it appears that copper-bladed saws with stone teeth were used to cut stone. But apparently an abrasive such as emery powder was sometimes put under the cutting edge of a saw having a copper or a bronze blade so as to facilitate the cutting of stone.</p>

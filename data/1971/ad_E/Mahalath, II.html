<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Maʹha·lath).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Probably a musical term, perhaps one of a technical nature, found in the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:53:0-19:53:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 53 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 88</a>. Some believe that this term may be related to a Hebrew root word meaning “sickness, calamity,” thereby suggesting a gloomy and melancholy tune. This would harmonize with the somewhat somber content of the two songs, particularly that of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:88:0-19:88:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 88</a>.</p>

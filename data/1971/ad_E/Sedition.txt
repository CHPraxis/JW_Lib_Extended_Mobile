SEDITION
[Gr., staʹsis, a standing up or standing off, uprising, such as a popular commotion, an insurrection, sedition, uproar (Mark 15:7; Luke 23:19, 25); or, in a more private sense, dissension, controversy, sometimes embracing the idea of violence (Acts 15:2; 23:7, 10)].
It was a capital offense under Roman law to engage in sedition or to promote or take part in a riot. Thus the city recorder was alerting the riotous mob in Ephesus of their peril when he said: “We are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today’s affair, no single cause existing that will permit us to render a reason for this disorderly mob.” (Acts 19:40) And Tertullus’ accusation before Roman Governor Felix that Paul was “stirring up seditions among all the Jews” was a very serious one. If found guilty, Paul would have been punished with death.—Acts 24:5.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-reʹhob) [place of open space or market].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently the name of a small Aramaean kingdom, perhaps applied primarily to its principal city. In the account of the attack on Laish by six hundred Danites, Laish is described as “in the low plain that belonged to Beth-rehob.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:7-7:18:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 18:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:28-7:18:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Later, in David’s time, the Ammonites hired Syrian mercenaries from Beth-rehob in a vain attempt to defend themselves against the Israelite forces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:6-10:10:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:6</a>) It was also called simply “Rehob” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:8-10:10:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:8</a>) and is, therefore, thought to be the same place mentioned as among the points reached by the twelve Israelite spies in their preliminary investigation of the land of Canaan.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:21-4:13:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Num. 13:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Beth-rehob’s association with the “low plain” in which Laish (later Dan) was situated and the statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:21-4:13:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Numbers 13:21</a>, that Rehob was in the direction of the “entering in of Hamath,” likely point to a location in the southern part of the Biqaʽ valley, which lies between the Lebanon and Anti—Lebanon mountains. The fortress city of Hunin, some six and a half miles (10.5 kilometers) W of Tell el-Qadi (the probable location of Dan), and the city of Banyas, about two and a half miles (4 kilometers) E of Tell el-Qadi, have both been suggested as possible locations of Beth-rehob; however, the evidence for either is insufficient for positive identification.</p>

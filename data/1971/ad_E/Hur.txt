HUR
1. A descendant of Judah; son of Caleb and Ephrath; grandfather of the craftsman Bezalel. Some of Hur’s descendants may have settled in Bethlehem. (Ex. 31:2; 35:30; 38:22; 1 Chron. 2:19, 20, 50, 51, 54; 4:1-4; 2 Chron. 1:5; see ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) Likely the same as No. 2 below.
2. A prominent associate of Moses and Aaron. When, shortly after leaving Egypt, Israel was attacked by the Amalekites, Hur accompanied Moses and Aaron to the top of a hill where he and Aaron supported Moses’ hands until Jehovah gave Israel the victory over the Amalekites. (Ex. 17:8-13) On one occasion not long thereafter, Moses and Joshua went up on Mount Sinai to receive more of the Law, leaving Hur and Aaron in charge of the camp. (Ex. 24:12-14) He is likely the same Hur as the grandfather of the tabernacle craftsman Bezalel (No. 1 above). Josephus wrote that Hur was Miriam’s husband, but the Bible does not say anything about this.—Antiquities of the Jews, Book III, chap. II, par. 4.
3. A king of Midian, one of five dominated by Amorite King Sihon before Israel, moving toward the Promised Land, defeated Sihon. (Josh. 13:15, 16, 21; Num. 21:21-24) Afterward, Hur and his four compatriots apparently allied themselves with Moab’s King Balak in opposition to Israel. (Num. 22:1-7) Later, as directed by Jehovah, the Israelites warred against the Midianites and killed Hur as well as his four allied Midianite kings and the greedy prophet Balaam.—Num. 31:1-8.
4. Father of Solomon’s food deputy in the mountainous region of Ephraim.—1 Ki. 4:7, 8.
5. Father of Rephaiah. Hur’s son Rephaiah helped Nehemiah rebuild Jerusalem’s wall.—Neh. 3:9.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A book of the Christian Greek Scriptures written by the apostle Paul to the congregation in the city of Philippi in the province of Macedonia, a congregation that Paul had established about 50 C.E., in the course of his second missionary tour.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>WHEN AND WHERE WRITTEN</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The letter’s internal evidence indicates it was written during Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome. In it he speaks of “all the praetorian guard” as knowing the reason for his being in bonds, and sends greetings from “those of the household of Caesar.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:13-50:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:22-50:4:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:22</a>) Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome is generally considered to have taken place about 59-61 C.E. Several events occurred between Paul’s arrival in Rome and his decision to write to the Philippians. Epaphroditus had made the trip from Philippi, had worked to assist Paul and had fallen very sick. The Philippians, some 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) distant, had received news of his sickness. Now Epaphroditus had recovered and Paul was sending him back with the letter. So the letter was written about 60 or 61 C.E.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR WRITING</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Philippian congregation had shown great love and regard for Paul. Shortly after his visit to them the congregation had generously sent him material provisions during his three-week stay in nearby Thessalonica. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:15-50:4:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 4:15, 16</a>) Later, when the brothers in Jerusalem entered into a period of intense persecution and were in need of material help, the Christians in Philippi, themselves very poor and undergoing a great test of affliction, had nevertheless demonstrated a readiness to contribute even beyond their ability. Paul so much appreciated their fine attitude that he cited them as an example to the other congregations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:1-47:8:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:1-6</a>) They were also very active and busy in preaching the good news, so apparently had not been so closely in touch with Paul for a time. But now, in his need in prison bonds, they not only sent material gifts so that Paul had an abundance, but also dispatched their personal envoy Epaphroditus, a man valuable to them. This zealous brother courageously gave assistance to Paul, even endangering his own life. Consequently, Paul commends him highly to the congregation.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:25-50:2:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 2:25-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:18-50:4:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Paul expresses confidence that, in harmony with their prayers, he will be released from this imprisonment and will be able to visit them again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:19-50:1:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:24-50:2:24" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:24</a>) He knows that for him to continue to live is to be useful to them, though he looks longingly forward to the time when Christ will receive him home to himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:21-50:1:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 1:21-25</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:3-43:14:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 14:3</a>.) In the meantime, he will send Timothy, who, more than anyone else available, will genuinely have their interests at heart.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:19-50:2:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 2:19-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The letter breathes love. Paul never withheld commendation where due, nor did he shrink back from giving necessary reproof, but in this case encouragement was the thing needed. The congregation had their opponents, “workers of injury,” who wanted to boast in fleshly connections and in circumcision of the flesh, but it appears that the brothers were not seriously affected, or upset. So Paul did not have to present strong argument and reproof as, for example, in his letters to the congregations in Galatia and Corinth. The only hint of correction was his exhortation to unity on the part of Euodia and Syntyche. Throughout the letter he encourages the Philippian congregation to continue in their fine course, seeking greater discernment and getting a sure grip on the word of life and a stronger faith and hope in the prize to come.</p>

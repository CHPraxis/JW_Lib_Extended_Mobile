ELTOLAD
(El·toʹlad) [generation].
A city located in the southern part of the territory of the tribe of Judah, toward the border of Edom (Josh. 15:21, 30), also called Tolad in 1 Chronicles 4:29. It may possibly be identified with modern Khirbet Erka Sakra, located about thirteen miles (21 kilometers) SE of Beer-sheba.
Eltolad was one of the Judean cities allotted to the Simeonites as their inheritance. (Josh. 19:1, 4) As 1 Chronicles 4:24-31 shows, these were the Simeonites’ cities down till David reigned.

COLONNADE OF SOLOMON
According to the writings of Josephus, this colonnade was originally built by Solomon on an artificial embankment on the E side of the temple. The colonnade existing in the first century C.E., however, is ascribed to He rod’s rebuilding work. (Antiquities of the Jews, Book VIII, chap. III, par. 9; Book XX, chap. IX, par. 7; Wars of the Jews, Book I, chap. XXI, par. 1; Book V, chap. V, par. 1) At the festival of dedication in the wintertime of 32 C.E., Jesus was confronted by the Jews in the colonnade of Solomon with the demand that he identify himself as the Christ. (John 10:22-24) After Jesus’ ascension into the heavens, his disciples continued to frequent this area, evidently to preach to the Jews there.—Acts 3:11; 5:12.

METALS
Seventy-eight of the more than a hundred elements known to man are metals. Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and electrum have a recorded history thousands of years old. The first Biblical mention of metals is in Genesis 4:22. In physical properties metals are opaque, fusible, ductile, have a metallic luster and are usually good conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically and physically the metals have certain distinguishing characteristics. For specific information and the Scriptural occurrences, see the above-mentioned metals under their individual names; also the heading REFINE, REFINER.

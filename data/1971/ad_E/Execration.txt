EXECRATION
A severe or even violent denunciation of that which is viewed as detestable and worthy of cursing. In Hebrew the word qa·vavʹ conveys this idea. It literally means “to cut into,” but in a figurative sense means “to malign or speak with cutting words,” and hence “to execrate.” This word appears only in the account of King Balak’s futile efforts to get the prophet Balaam to execrate the nation of Israel and thus present that nation before God as worthy of his curse.—Num. 22:11, 17; 23:11, 13, 25, 27; 24:10.
The word na·qavʹ also appears in this same account, as well as in many other texts. Literally, it means “to pierce” or “perforate” (2 Ki. 18:21; Hab. 3:14), but it is used in a figurative sense to mean “to speak abusively of” or “to execrate.” (Lev. 24:11, 16; Job 3:8; 5:3; Prov. 11:26; 24:24) An imprecation, that is, an invocation of evil from a divine source, is not always stated but may be implied.—See CURSE; MALEDICTION.

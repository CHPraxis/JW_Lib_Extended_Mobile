MISREPHOTH-MAIM
(Misʹre·photh-maʹim) [literally, burning of waters].
A point to which the Israelites pursued the armies of northern Canaanite kings allied with Jabin after having defeated them at the waters of Merom. (Josh. 11:1-5, 8) When the Promised Land was divided into inheritance portions, the area extending from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim remained to be conquered. (Jos. 13:2, 6) Misrephoth-maim is usually associated with the ruins at Khirbet el-Musheirefeh, about twelve miles (19 kilometers) N of Acco (Acre). This location would have provided the citizens of Misrephoth-maim access to the cities in the plain of Acco and also the Huleh Basin. Perhaps Misrephoth-maim (“burning of waters”) got its name from the warm springs situated less than two hundred yards (183 meters) from the site.

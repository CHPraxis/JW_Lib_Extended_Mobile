ZIKLAG
(Zikʹlag).
As originally assigned, this was a Simeonite enclave city in S Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 31; 19:1, 2, 5; 1 Chron. 4:24-30) Later, Ziklag was under Philistine control. Achish, king of Gath, gave it to the fugitive David as a place of residence (and it thereafter became the possession of Judah’s kings). (1 Sam. 27:6) The Amalekites raided and burned the city, taking captives, including David’s wives Ahinoam and Abigail. After defeating the marauders and recovering the captives and things taken, David, from Ziklag, sent some of the spoil of battle to his friends, older men of Judah in various cities. (1 Sam. chap. 30) Many armed mighty men joined David at Ziklag, and there he received news of King Saul’s death. (2 Sam. 1:1, 2; 4:10; 1 Chron. 12:1, 2, 20-22) After the Babylonian exile, some of the sons of Judah settled in this city. (Neh. 11:25, 28) Though its exact site is uncertain, Ziklag is generally identified with Tell el-Khuweilfeh, some five miles (8 kilometers) SW of the suggested site of Debir.

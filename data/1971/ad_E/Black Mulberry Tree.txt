BLACK MULBERRY TREE
[Gr., sy·kaʹmi·nos].
This tree is mentioned but once, in Jesus’ statement to the apostles relative to their faith. (Luke 17:5, 6) The Greek word used was regularly applied to the mulberry tree, and the black mulberry (Morus nigra) is commonly cultivated in Palestine. It is a sturdy tree growing to a height of about twenty feet (6 meters), with large heart-shaped leaves and dark-red or black fruit resembling the blackberry. The white mulberry (Morus alba) is used to feed silkworms, and their culture was evidently introduced into Syria during Roman times and continues there.

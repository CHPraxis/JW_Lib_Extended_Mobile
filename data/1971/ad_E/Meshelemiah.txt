MESHELEMIAH
(Me·shel·e·miʹah) [Jehovah recompenses, or, friendship of Jehovah].
A Kohathite Levite and ancestral head of a division of Korahites. He “had sons and brothers, capable men, eighteen,” who were assigned with him as gatekeepers of the sanctuary during King David’s reorganization of the priestly and Levitical services. (1 Chron. 26:1-3, 9) He is probably identical with the Shelemiah of 1 Chronicles 26:14. His son Zechariah “was the gatekeeper of the entrance of the tent of meeting.”—1 Chron. 9:21.

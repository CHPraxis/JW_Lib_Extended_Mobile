PILLORY
(pilʹlo·ry).
This translates the Hebrew word tsi·noqʹ (Jer. 29:26, NW; Da, ftn.) and seems to designate a device for confining the neck and perhaps also the arms. But the meaning of the Hebrew term is uncertain. Among the other ways it has been rendered are “prison” (Dy), “dungeon” (LXX, Bagster, 36:26), “shackles” (AS) and “collar.”—RS.

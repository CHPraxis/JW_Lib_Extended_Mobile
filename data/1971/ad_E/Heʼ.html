<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The fifth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, representing five when used as a number. The meaning of the name is “window.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In speaking, <em>he</em>ʼ has a guttural sound somewhere between the softer ʼ<em>aʹleph</em> and the harsher <em>hhehth.</em> It thus corresponds generally to the English “h,” and is similar to the sound of “h” in the word “behind.” In the Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each verse of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:33-19:119:40" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:33-40</a>. The letters <em>heʼ</em> [====] and <em>hhehth</em> [====] are very similar in form.</p>

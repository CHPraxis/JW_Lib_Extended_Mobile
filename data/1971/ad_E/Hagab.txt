HAGAB
(Haʹgab) [grasshopper, locust].
Ancestor of a family of Nethinim temple slaves. “The sons of Hagab” are mentioned among those returning with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. from captivity in Babylon. (Ezra 2:1, 2, 43, 46) The name Hagab, however, does not appear in the parallel list at Nehemiah 7:48.

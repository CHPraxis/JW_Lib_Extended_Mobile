ZOHELETH
(Zoʹhe·leth) [gliding, or, serpent].
A stone beside En-rogel; its location is otherwise unknown. Near “the stone of Zoheleth” (or, “the Gliding Stone”) Adonijah did sacrificing and was proclaimed king by many of Israel’s prominent men. However, his presumptuous attempt to succeed David to the throne was foiled.—1 Ki. 1:9, 10, 25, 49, 50.

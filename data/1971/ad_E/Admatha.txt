ADMATHA
(Ad·maʹtha) [Persian name, probably meaning unconquered].
One of the seven princes in the kingdom of Persia and Media who had access to King Ahasuerus. These princes concurred in the judgment against Queen Vashti, and apparently such a committee of seven regularly served the Persian kings as counselors.—Esther 1:14; Ezra 7:14.

MYRA
(Myʹra).
A major city in the province of Lycia. Situated near the coast of SW Asia Minor, Myra occupied a hill over two miles (3 kilometers) inland on the river Andracus. The site is now known as Dembre. Ruins there include rock-hewn tombs and a large theater with well-preserved decorations. The ancient name “Myra” apparently embraced both the city and its excellent harbor Andriaca at the mouth of the navigable river Andracus. Ruined quays still line this river. That Myra was a prominent port city may be inferred from its being the center for the worship of the sailors’ god. Mariners prayed to the deity before commencing long voyages and, upon arriving safely at their destination, paid their vows.
As a prisoner bound for Rome, the apostle Paul arrived at Myra from Caesarea by way of Sidon. There he and his traveling companions had to transfer to a grain ship from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy. (Acts 27:1-6, 38) Myra was due N of Alexandria and therefore may have been on the regular route of ships from that Egyptian city. Or, it may be that contrary winds (Acts 27:4, 7) forced the Alexandrian vessel to change its course and drop anchor at Myra.
At Acts 21:1 some ancient authorities add “and Myra” after “Patara.” (See JB, NE, RS footnotes.) Although this addition would not be out of harmony with the rest of the account, there is insufficient evidence for determining whether the name “Myra” actually appeared in the original manuscript.

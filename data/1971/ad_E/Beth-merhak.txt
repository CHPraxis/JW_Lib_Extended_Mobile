BETH-MERHAK
(Beth-merʹhak) [the far house, or, the most remote house].
When King David withdrew from Jerusalem due to the rebellion of his son Absalom, he stopped at Beth-merhak, perhaps the last house of Jerusalem in the direction of the Mount of Olives before crossing the Kidron valley. (2 Sam. 15:17, 23) It appears that at this point King David passed review of his forces as they were crossing over the valley, thus indicating that David was not engaged in a wild, panicky flight, but, rather, was making an orderly withdrawal from the city in harmony with divinely guided strategy.—2 Sam. 15:18-26.

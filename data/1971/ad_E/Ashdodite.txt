ASHDODITE
An inhabitant of the Philistine city of Ashdod. (Josh. 13:3) Like the other Philistines, they were descendants of Ham through Mizraim and Casluhim, reaching Canaan apparently from the island of Crete.—Gen. 10:6, 13, 14; Amos 9:7; see ASHDOD; PHILISTIA, PHILISTINES.
At Nehemiah 13:24 the term “Ashdodite” is also applied to their language. Whether they were still speaking the ancient Philistine language or a dialect resulting from centuries of foreign domination cannot be determined, in view of the absence of any record of their speech.

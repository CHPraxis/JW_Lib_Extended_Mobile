<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Neʹri) [lamp].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A descendant of King David through Nathan in the royal lineage of Jesus. According to Luke, Shealtiel was “the son of Neri,” <span id="page1221" class="pageNum" data-no="1221" data-before-text="1221"></span>yet Matthew says Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:12-40:1:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:27-42:3:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 3:27</a>) Apparently Shealtiel married Neri’s daughter, thus becoming his son-in-law. It was not uncommon in Hebrew genealogical listings to speak of a son-in-law as a son. Hence, both accounts are correct.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the first century C.E., a chief port SE of Rome. Paul arrived at Puteoli on his way to stand before Caesar in Rome about the year 59 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:13-44:28:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 28:13</a>) With the help of a S wind his ship arrived “on the second day” at Puteoli from Rhegium, a place some two hundred statute miles (322 kilometers) to the S-SE.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Christian brothers of Puteoli entreated Paul and those accompanying him to spend a week with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:14-44:28:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 28:14</a>) This indicates he enjoyed some freedom, though a prisoner. Earlier, while in custody at Caesarea and Sidon, Paul had similarly benefited from limited freedom.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:23-44:24:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 24:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:3-44:27:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 27:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Puteoli is generally identified with modern Pozzuoli, on the bay of the same name, about six miles (10 kilometers) W-SW of Naples. Extensive ruins of an ancient mole still stand. Josephus calls the site by its older name, Dicaearchia, and says a Jewish colony was located there.</p>

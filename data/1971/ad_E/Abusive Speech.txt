ABUSIVE SPEECH
As noted under the heading BLASPHEMY, the original Greek word bla·sphe·miʹa has a broader meaning than the present English word “blasphemy.” The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott shows that bla·sphe·miʹa and the verb bla·sphe·meʹo basically indicate “defamatory, calumnious, abusive language.” In English, only when such speech is directed against God, not against his creatures, is it properly termed “blasphemy.” Concerning this, The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia (Vol. I, p. 291, col. 2, sec. 1, par. 3) says: “Our English translators [that is, primarily those of the AV] have not adhered to the right use of the term. They employ it with the same latitude as the Greek; but it is generally easy to perceive, from the connection and subject of a passage, whether blasphemy, properly so called, be meant, or only defamation.”
Thus, while the Authorized Version uses “blasphemy” and “blasphemed” in Acts 18:6, Colossians 3:8, 1 Timothy 6:1, and Titus 2:5, later translations say “slander,” “abusive talk [or ‘speech’],” “reviled,” “defamed,” “abused,” “speak abusively of,” and similar expressions. (See RS, AT, NW, and others.) The Authorized Version, however, does recognize this distinction elsewhere in the Greek Scriptures.
As the following texts and surrounding verses show, abusive speech was directed against Christ at the time of his impalement by passersby, who said, “Bah! You would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days’ time, save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.” Similar words came from one of the evildoers alongside. (Mark 15:29, 30; Matt 27:39, 40; Luke 23:39) Paul and his fellow Christians were objects of such speech by those who falsely construed their purpose, message and Christian conscience (Acts 18:6; Rom. 3:8; 14:16; 1 Cor. 4:13; 10:30; 1 Pet. 4:4), yet they themselves were to “speak injuriously of no one,” and by their conduct gave no true grounds for their work or message to be spoken of abusively. (Eph. 4:31; Col. 3:8; 1 Tim. 6:1; Titus 2:5; 3:2; compare 2 Peter 2:2.) Even the angels “do not bring . . . an accusation in abusive terms, not doing so out of respect for Jehovah.” (2 Pet. 2:11) But such talk can be expected from those who indulge in loose conduct, those who are proud and mentally diseased over questionings and debates, and those who disregard or disrespect God’s appointments.—1 Tim. 6:4; 2 Pet. 2:10-12; Jude 8-10.
The word ga·dhaphʹ is used in a corresponding way in the Hebrew Scriptures. Basically meaning “to hack” or “to cut,” it is used metaphorically to mean “to cut with reproachful words.” It is found at Numbers 15:30; 2 Kings 19:6, 22; Psalm 44:16; Isaiah 37:6, 23, and Ezekiel 20:27. Two other related words are found at Isaiah 43:28; 51:7; Ezekiel 5:15, and Zephaniah 2:8. In all these cases harsh or coarse speech is indicated, directed against either Jehovah God himself or his people. A study of the context makes clear the nature of such “abusive speech.”—See EXECRATION; MALEDICTION; REVILING.

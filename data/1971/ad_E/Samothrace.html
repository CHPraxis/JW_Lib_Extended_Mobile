<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A mountainous island located in the NE Aegean Sea, having a city of the same name on its N side. Paul’s ship came “with a straight run” to the island of Samothrace from Troas in NW Asia Minor in the spring of 50 C.E. during his second missionary journey. There is, however, no indication that he went ashore. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:11-44:16:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:11</a>) The modern-day island lacks a good harbor, though it offers a number of places for safe anchorage.</p>

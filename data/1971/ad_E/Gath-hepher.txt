GATH-HEPHER
(Gath-heʹpher) [winepress of digging].
A border city of Zebulun (Josh. 19:10, 13) and home of the prophet Jonah. (2 Ki. 14:25) It is usually identified with Khirbet ez-Zurraʽ, about two and a half miles (4 kilometers) N-NE of Nazareth and just S of Meshhed, the traditional site of Jonah’s tomb. Surface explorations at Khirbet ez-Zurraʽ appear to corroborate the Biblical statements that the site was occupied at both time periods in the aforementioned accounts.

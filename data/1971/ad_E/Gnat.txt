GNAT
Any of a variety of small two-winged insects, many of which are bloodsuckers. The Hebrew word kin·nimʹ (or, kin·namʹ), when used with reference to the third plague visited upon Egypt (Ex. 8:16-18; Ps. 105:31), has been variously rendered “gnats” (NW, Ro, RS), “mosquitoes” (AT) and “lice” (AV); “sand flies” and “fleas” have been given as alternate readings. (AS [Ex. 8:16, ftn.]) Although there is uncertainty as to the particular insect or insects designated by the original-language word, the preference has generally been given to the renderings “gnats” and “mosquitoes.”
At Isaiah 51:6 the Hebrew term ken, ordinarily meaning “the right manner, this manner, thus,” is translated “gnat” (NW) and “gnats” (AS, ftn., RS). This is because ken here is evidently the singular form of kin·nimʹ (or, kin·namʹ), since the word preceding it in the text, kemohʹ, by itself means “like” or “in like manner.”
The only other reference to the gnat in Scripture is in Jesus’ denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees for straining out the gnat but gulping down the camel. The Jewish religious leaders were sticklers for little things, filtering their beverages so as not to contract ceremonial defilement by swallowing a gnat. (Lev. 11:21-24) However, their disregarding the weightier matters of the Law was comparable to swallowing a camel, likewise a ceremonially unclean animal.—Lev. 11:4; Matt. 23:23, 24.

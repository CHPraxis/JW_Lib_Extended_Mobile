MARSHMALLOW
The Hebrew term hhal·la·muthʹ, found only at Job 6:6, has been variously rendered “egg” (AS, AV), “purslain” (AT) and, as defined in a recent Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by Koehler and Baumgartner, “marsh mallow” (NW). The marshmallow is a perennial plant that is closely related to the hollyhock. Its woody stems commonly measure from two to four feet (.6 to 1.2 meters) in height. The plant’s large, wide leaves are notched and terminate in a sharp point. Both the stems and the leaves are covered with soft downy hair. The pale-pink five-petal flowers are about one inch (2.5 centimeters) across. In times of famine, the marshmallow’s white carrotlike root has been used for food. The sole Scriptural reference to the “marsh mallow” alludes to its tastelessness.

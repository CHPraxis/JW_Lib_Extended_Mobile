<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Sha·alʹbim) [place of foxes].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city whose Amorite inhabitants were subjected to forced labor by the house of Joseph. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:35-7:1:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 1:35</a>) Later, Shaalbim was included in one of the districts annually providing Solomon’s household with food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:7-11:4:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:7-9</a>) It is generally understood to be the same as Shaalabbin, a border city of Dan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:40-6:19:42" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 19:40-42</a>) There is only the difference of the final consonant in the Hebrew spelling of the two names. Shaalbon may be an alternate name for Shaalbim.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:32-10:23:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:33-13:11:33" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ancient Shaalbim is usually identified with modern Selbit, which appears to preserve the Biblical name. It is situated about sixteen miles (c. 25 kilometers) W-NW of Jerusalem and relatively near the suggested sites of other places mentioned with Shaalbim in the Scriptures.</p>

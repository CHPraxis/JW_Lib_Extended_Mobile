<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site regularly mentioned with Heshbon and located in the pastoral country E of the Jordan. The tribe of Reuben “built” (or rebuilt) the city soon after its conquest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:3-4:32:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 32:3-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:37-4:32:37" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 37</a>) Centuries later when it was under Moab’s control, Isaiah and Jeremiah prophesied that Elealeh was due to “cry out” at that nation’s collapse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:4-23:15:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 15:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:16:9-23:16:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:34-24:48:34" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jer. 48:34</a>) It is usually thought to be located on a hill at el-ʽAl, a little less than two miles (3.2 kilometers) NE of Heshbon.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Benʹe-jaʹa·kan) [sons or children of Jaakan].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A station of the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:31-4:33:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 33:31, 32</a>) Jaakan appears to be the Akan of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:27-1:36:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 36:27 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:42-13:1:42" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 1:42</a> (where the Masoretic text reads “Jaakan”). The account in the book of Numbers states that the Israelites “pulled away from Moseroth and went camping in Bene-jaakan. After that they pulled away from Bene-jaakan and went camping in Hor-haggidgad.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:6</a> reference is made to Beeroth Bene-jaakan in connection with “Moserah” (singular of Moseroth), probably indicating that Beeroth Bene-jaakan (wells of the sons of Jaakan) is the same location as Bene-jaakan. However, the account at Deuteronomy lists the direction of travel of the Israelites in reverse order from the Numbers account, stating that “the sons of Israel pulled away from Beeroth Bene-jaakan for Moserah.” In view of the many years spent in the wilderness it is quite possible that the Israelites passed twice through this region. As <em>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs</em> (Deuteronomy) commentary on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:6</a> suggests: “A probable explanation is that the Israelites, after journeying in a southern direction to the land of Edom, had to turn sharply to the north. . . . They may have had to retrace their steps for a short distance, and revisit some of the places they had passed through, this time in the reverse order.” It is to be noted that the record of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy (10:6</a>) refers to Aaron’s death immediately after referring to the station of Moserah, whereas the Numbers account (33:31-39) describes the Israelites’ travels to Ezion-geber and then NW to Kadesh before dealing with the matter of the death of Aaron. This, together with the long period of years involved, would certainly allow for a measure of backtracking, if such were the case.</p>

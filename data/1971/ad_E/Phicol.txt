PHICOL
(Phiʹcol).
Army chief of Philistine King Abimelech. Phicol accompanied Abimelech when covenants were concluded with both Abraham and Isaac. (Gen. 21:22, 32; 26:26, 31) As these two meetings were more than seventy-five years apart, however, “Phicol” might well be a title or name used for whoever held this office rather than there being one man in the position for so long. For similar reasons his king’s name may also have been a title.

HANNATHON
(Hanʹna·thon).
A boundary city of Zebulun. (Josh. 19:10, 14) Most geographers tentatively identify Hannathon with Tell el-Bedeiwiyeh, a little more than six miles (9.7 kilometers) NW of Nazareth. Others suggest el-Harbaj, at the southern end of the Plain of Acco. Hannathon appears in the records of Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III and also in the Tell el-Amarna tablets.

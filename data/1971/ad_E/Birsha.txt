BIRSHA
(Birʹsha) [ugly, disagreeable in taste].
King of Gomorrah whom Chedorlaomer made his subject together with four other nearby kings. He may be the same “king of Gomorrah,” though unnamed, whose rebellion against Chedorlaomer thirteen years later was crushed, many of his forces having been driven into nearby bitumen pits.—Gen. 14:1-11.

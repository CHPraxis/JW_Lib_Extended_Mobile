AHIMAN
(A·hiʹman) [my brother is a gift (?)].
Because the name appears to be compound, the meaning is obscure.

(Num. 13:22, 28, 33) Many years later he and his brothers were driven out and put to death by Caleb and the conquering Israelites.—Josh. 14:10-15; 15:13, 14; Judg. 1:10.
2. A Levite and one of the trusted gatekeepers of Jerusalem after the return from Babylonish captivity.—1 Chron. 9:17, 18; Neh. 11:19.

FORGIVENESS
The act of pardoning an offender; ceasing to feel resentment toward him because of his offense and giving up all claim to recompense.
According to God’s law given to the nation of Israel, in order for one who had sinned against God or against his fellowman to have his sins forgiven, he first had to rectify the wrong as the Law prescribed and then, in most eases, present a blood offering to Jehovah. (Lev. 5:5–6:7) Hence, the principle stated by Paul: “Yes, nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law, and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.” (Heb. 9:22) Actually, though, the blood of animal sacrifices could not take away sins and give the individual a perfectly clean conscience. (Heb. 10:1-4; 9:9, 13, 14) By contrast, the foretold new covenant made possible true forgiveness, based on Jesus Christ’s ransom sacrifice. (Jer. 31:33, 34; Matt. 26:28; 1 Cor. 11:25; Eph. 1:7) Even while on earth, Jesus demonstrated that he had authority to forgive sins by healing a paralytic.—Matt. 9:2-7.
Jehovah forgives “in a large way,” as indicated by Jesus’ illustrations of the prodigal son and of the king who forgave a slave a debt of ten thousand talents (60,000,000 denarii, or $8,456,400), whereas that slave was unwilling to forgive a fellow slave a debt of but a hundred denarii ($16). (Isa. 55:7; Luke 15:11-32; Matt. 18:23-35) Nevertheless, Jehovah’s forgiveness is not prompted by sentimentality, for he does not leave notorious acts unpunished. (Ps. 99:8) Joshua warned Israel that Jehovah would not forgive apostasy on their part.—Josh. 24:19, 20; compare Isaiah 2:6-9.
God has a required way for seeking and receiving his forgiveness. One must acknowledge his sin, must recognize that it is an offense against God, must confess it unqualifiedly, have a deep heartfelt sorrow for the wrong done and a determination to turn from such a course or practice. (Ps. 32:5; 51:4; 1 John 1:8, 9; 2 Cor. 7:8-11) He must do what he can to right the wrong or damage done. (Matt. 5:23, 24) Then he must pray to God, asking for forgiveness on the basis of Christ’s ransom sacrifice.—Eph. 1:7.
Moreover, forgiving others for personal offenses, regardless of the number of times involved, is a Christian requirement. (Luke 17:3, 4; Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13) God’s forgiveness is not extended toward those who refuse to forgive others. (Matt. 6:14, 15) Even in the case of serious wrongdoing in the Christian congregation, when it becomes necessary to “remove the wicked man,” in due time, if the individual proves that he is truly repentant, he may be accorded forgiveness, and at that time all in the congregation can confirm their love for him. (1 Cor. 5:13; 2 Cor. 2:6-11) On the other hand, Christians are not required to forgive those who practice malicious, willful sin with no repentance. Such become God’s enemies.—Heb. 10:26-31; Ps. 139:21, 22.
It is proper to pray for God’s forgiveness in behalf of others, even an entire congregation. Moses did so respecting the nation of Israel, confessing their national sin and asking forgiveness, and was favorably heard by Jehovah. (Num. 14:19, 20) Also, Solomon, at the dedication of the temple, prayed that Jehovah might forgive his people when they sinned and then turned back from their wrong course. (1 Ki. 8:30, 33-40, 46-52) Ezra acted representatively in confessing publicly the sins of the repatriated Jews. His heartfelt prayer and exhortation had the result that the people took action in order to receive Jehovah’s forgiveness. (Ezra 9:13–10:4, 10-19, 44) James encouraged the spiritually sick one to call for the older men of the congregation to pray over him and, “if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.” (Jas. 5:14-16) However, there is a “sin that does incur death,” sin against the holy spirit, a deliberate practice of sin for which there is no forgiveness. We should not pray for those sinning in this way.—1 John 5:16; Matt. 12:31; Heb. 10:26, 27; see REPENTANCE; SIN, I; SPIRIT.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Reʹhum) [compassion].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. One of those listed at the head of the register of exiles who returned from Babylon to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel and Jeshua. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:1-15:2:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 2:1, 2</a>) His name is spelled Nehum at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:7-16:7:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nehemiah 7:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A priest listed among those who returned with Zerubbabel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:1-16:12:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 12:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:3-16:12:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3</a>) A simple transposition of Hebrew characters would make him the one called Harim in verse 15 and elsewhere.—See HARIM No. 1.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. The “chief government official” of the Persian Empire residing presumably in Samaria who took the lead in writing a letter to King Artaxerxes falsely accusing the Jews concerning their intentions for rebuilding Jerusalem. The imperial reply ordered Rehum and his compatriots to go to Jerusalem and forcibly put a stop to the Jews’ rebuilding work on the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:8-15:4:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 4:8-24</a>) Haggai and Zechariah, however, not long thereafter stirred up the Jews to resume their rebuilding, which was finally sanctioned by the Persian review of Cyrus’ original decree.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:1-15:6:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 5:1–6:13</a>.</p>

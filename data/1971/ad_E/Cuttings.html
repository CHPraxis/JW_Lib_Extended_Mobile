<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The making of cuttings upon the flesh or scratching the arms, hands and face in times of mourning was evidently a common practice among the ancients. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:47:5-24:47:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 47:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:37-24:48:37" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 48:37</a>) This may have been done with a view to pacifying or propitiating the deities believed to preside over the dead. With reference to this practice among the Scythians upon the death of their king, the Greek historian Herodotus writes (Book IV, sec. 71): “They cut off part of their ear, shave off their hair, wound themselves on the arms, lacerate their forehead and nose, and drive arrows through their left hand.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Inflicting lacerations upon the flesh, however, was not limited to mourning rites. In the hope of having their god answer their appeals, the prophets of Baal cut themselves “according to their custom with daggers and with lances, until they caused blood to flow out upon them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:28-11:18:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 18:28</a>) Similar rites were engaged in by other ancient peoples. For example, Herodotus (Book II, sec. 61) mentions that during the festival of Isis the Carians residing in Egypt cut their foreheads with knives.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God’s law specifically forbade the making of cuttings upon the flesh for the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:28-3:19:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 19:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:5-3:21:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:1-5:14:1" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Deut. 14:1</a>) The reason for this was that Israel was a holy people to Jehovah, a special property. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:2-5:14:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 14:2</a>) As such, Israel was to remain free from all idolatrous practices. Then, too, such extreme displays of mourning accompanied by self-inflicted lacerations upon the flesh were most inappropriate for a people who were fully aware of the actual condition as well as the hope of the dead (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:13-27:12:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 12:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:19-58:11:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:13-52:4:13" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>.) Also, the prohibition against self-mutilation would have impressed upon the Israelites proper respect for God’s creation, the human body.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Apparently, though, the Israelites on occasion disregarded God’s law with respect to making cuttings upon their flesh.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:41:5-24:41:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 41:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:1-33:5:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Micah 5:1</a>.</p>

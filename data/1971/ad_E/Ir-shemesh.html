<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town on the boundary of Dan, named between Eshtaol and Shaalabbin in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:41-6:19:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 19:41, 42</a>. It is possibly the same as Beth-shemesh of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:10-6:15:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 15:10</a>, in view of its similarity of name and its location on the boundary of Dan and Judah. If so, then it was later occupied by the tribe of Judah and assigned from that tribe as one of the forty-eight Levite cities.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:16-6:21:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 21:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:59-13:6:59" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:59;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:6-4:35:7" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Num. 35:6, 7</a>; see BETH-SHEMESH No. 1.</p>

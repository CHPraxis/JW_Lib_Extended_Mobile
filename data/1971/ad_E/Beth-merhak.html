<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-merʹhak) [the far house, or, the most remote house].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When King David withdrew from Jerusalem due to the rebellion of his son Absalom, he stopped at Beth-merhak, perhaps the last house of Jerusalem in the direction of the Mount of Olives before crossing the Kidron valley. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:17-10:15:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:23-10:15:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23</a>) It appears that at this point King David passed review of his forces as they were crossing over the valley, thus indicating that David was not engaged in a wild, panicky flight, but, rather, was making an orderly withdrawal from the city in harmony with divinely guided strategy.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:18-10:15:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:18-26</a>.</p>

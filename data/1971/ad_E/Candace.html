<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Can·daʹce) [perhaps, queen].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A queen of Ethiopia whose treasurer became a Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 8:27</a>) Rather than being a specific personal name, “Candace,” like “Pharaoh” and “Caesar,” is considered to be a title. Ancient writers, including Strabo, Pliny the Elder and Eusebius, used this designation in referring to queens of Ethiopia. Pliny the Elder (c. 23-79 C.E.), in his <em>Natural History,</em> writes: “The edifices of the city [Meroe, capital of ancient Ethiopia] were few; a woman reigned there of the name of Candace, which name had been transmitted to these queens for many years.”</p>

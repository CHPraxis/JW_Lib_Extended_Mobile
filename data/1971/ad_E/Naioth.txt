NAIOTH
(Naiʹoth) [perhaps, dwellings].
This is a transliteration of the Hebrew word na·woythʹ and seems to apply to a place where certain prophets resided in the time of Samuel. (1 Sam. 19:18–20:1) It may refer to a certain locality or quarter of the town of Ramah. Textual critic S. R. Driver corroborates this view, observing: “Probably it [na·woythʹ] is the name of some locality in Ramah, the signification of which is lost to us.”—Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel (1913), p. 159.

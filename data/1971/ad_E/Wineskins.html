<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Greek word <em>aʹskos</em> designates a bag or bottle made of a whole animal skin. Jesus Christ said: “Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:17-40:9:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 9:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:22-41:2:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mark 2:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:37-42:5:38" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 5:37, 38</a>) As new wine ferments, it generates carbon dioxide gas that causes the skin bottles when new to expand. Old, inflexible skins burst under the pressure.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:14-40:9:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 9:14-16</a>) For a general discussion of skin bottles and their uses, see BOTTLE.</p>

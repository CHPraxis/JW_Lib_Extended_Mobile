<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Mezuzah (me·zuʹzah) [doorpost].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Anglicized form of the Hebrew word used in the Bible generally to designate a doorjamb or doorpost. <em>M<sup>e</sup>zu·zahʹ</em> and the plural <em>m<sup>e</sup>zu·zohthʹ</em> appear at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:7-2:12:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 12:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:22-2:12:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22, 23</a>, with reference to the sprinkling of the passover victim’s blood on doorposts, and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:6-2:21:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 21:6</a>, regarding a slave who, desiring to remain in his master’s service, was brought up against the door or the “door-post” and had his master pierce his ear through with an awl. References are also made to doorposts of the temple constructed by Solomon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:31-11:6:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:33-11:6:33" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:5-11:7:5" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 7:5</a>) and of the symbolic temple Ezekiel saw in vision.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:41:21-26:41:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 41:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:19-26:45:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 45:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:46:2-26:46:2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 46:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In modern times the Anglicized term “mezuzah” is used to denote a rectangular piece of parchment containing the Hebrew text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:13-5:11:21" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>, generally written in twenty-two lines. The parchment is rolled up and <span id="page1150" class="pageNum" data-no="1150" data-before-text="1150"></span>placed in a wooden, metal or glass case that is affixed in a slanting position on the right-hand doorpost of orthodox Jewish dwellings, the upper part pointing inward and the lower part outward. The Hebrew word <em>Shad·dayʹ</em> (meaning “Almighty”) is written on the back of this parchment and is frequently visible through a glass-covered opening in the container. Sometimes the mezuzah case is artistically decorated. When pious orthodox Jews enter or leave a house they touch the mezuzah with the hand and recite the prayer, “May God keep my going out and my coming in from now on and ever more.”—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:121:8-19:121:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 121:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The use of the mezuzah is based on a literal interpretation of the command at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:9-5:6:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:9 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:20-5:11:20" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11:20</a>.</p>

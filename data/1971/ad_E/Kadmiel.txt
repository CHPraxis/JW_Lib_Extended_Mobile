KADMIEL
(Kadʹmi·el) [God is the ancient One, or, God goes before].
A Levite returning to Jerusalem (with Zerubbabel) accompanied by members of his family. (Ezra 2:1, 2, 40; Neh. 7:6, 7, 43; 12:1, 8, 24) “Kadmiel and his sons” helped supervise the temple reconstruction.—Ezra 3:9.
The time period involved between the return from Babylonian exile (537 B.C.E.) and the confession of the nation’s sins against Jehovah (Neh. 9:4, 5), followed by the attesting by seal of the “trustworthy arrangement” in Nehemiah’s day (455 B.C.E.) (Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 9, 10), does not allow the same Kadmiel to be identified with all these affairs. No doubt a representative of Kadmiel’s house participated in these latter two events.

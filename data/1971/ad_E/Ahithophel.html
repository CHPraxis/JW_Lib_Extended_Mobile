<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A native of Giloh in the hills of Judah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:12-10:15:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12</a>), father of one of David’s mighty men named Eliam, and possibly the grandfather of Bath-sheba. (11:3; 23:34) As David’s personal adviser Ahithophel’s sagacious counsel was esteemed as if it were the direct word of Jehovah. (16:23) Later this <span id="page47" class="pageNum" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>once-close companion treacherously turned traitor and joined David’s son Absalom in a coup against the king. As a ringleader in the rebellion he advised Absalom to violate David’s concubines, and he asked permission to raise an army of 12,000 and immediately hunt down and kill David while in his disorganized and weakened state. (15:31; 16:15, 21; 17:1-4) When Jehovah thwarted this bold scheme by the counsel of Hushai, Ahithophel’s pride was offended. (15:32-34; 17:5-14) He committed suicide and was buried with his forefathers. (17:23) Apart from wartime, this is the only case of suicide mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. His traitorous act is apparently recalled in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:12-19:55:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 55:12-14</a>.</p>

POTIPHERA
(Pot·iʹphe·ra) [he whom Ra gave].
Joseph’s father-in-law, whose daughter Asenath bore Manasseh and Ephraim. (Gen. 41:45, 50; 46:20) Potiphera was the priest, likely of the sun-god Ra, officiating at On, a center of Egyptian sun worship. In the Cairo Museum there is a stele or funeral pillar discovered in 1935, that has on it the name, “Potiphare.”

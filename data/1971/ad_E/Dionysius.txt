DIONYSIUS
(Di·o·nysʹi·us) [belonging to Dionysos (the god of wine)].
An Areopagite, or judge of the Athenian Areopagus, who heard Paul’s defense and became a Christian. (Acts 17:34; see AREOPAGUS.) Dionysius’ being mentioned with Damaris, a woman who also became a believer, provides no real basis for concluding that they were married to each other.

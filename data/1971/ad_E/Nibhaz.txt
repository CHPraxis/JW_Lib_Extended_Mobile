NIBHAZ
(Nibʹhaz).
A deity worshiped by the Avvites, whom the king of Assyria settled in the territory of Samaria following the deportation of the Israelites after the fall of the ten-tribe kingdom. (2 Ki. 17:24-31) Aside from the brief Scriptural reference to Nibhaz, nothing can be said with certainty about the nature or form of this god.

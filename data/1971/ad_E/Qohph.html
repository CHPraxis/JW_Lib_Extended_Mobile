<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">or, as commonly anglicized, qoph [ק]. The nineteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, later used also as a number to denote one hundred.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The English letter “q” is derived from this Hebrew letter. However, in translating Hebrew names where it occurs, <em>qohph</em> is usually represented in English by “c” or “k,” as in “Cainan” and “Kish.” The sound is stronger than that of the letter <em>kaph</em> [כ] and is pronounced farther back in the throat, as a strong English “q” formed at the back of the palate. In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:145-19:119:152" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:145-152</a>.</p>

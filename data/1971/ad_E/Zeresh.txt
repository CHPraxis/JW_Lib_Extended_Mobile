ZERESH
(Zeʹresh) [possibly, gold].
The wife of Haman. Zeresh and Haman’s friends proposed that he erect a stake to a height of fifty cubits (c. 73 feet; 22 meters), on which to hang Mordecai. (Esther 5:10, 14) But when reversals set in, Zeresh, along with Haman’s wise men, said: “If it is from the seed of the Jews that Mordecai is before whom you have started to fall, you will not prevail against him, but you will without fail fall before him.”—Esther 6:13.

BETEN
(Be πten) [belly, or, perhaps, basin].
A city named only at Joshua 19:25; one of the boundary towns of Asher. Its location is not certain, since the sites of several of the other towns mentioned in the list are unknown. However, it is generally identified with Khirbet Abtun, about eleven miles (18 kilometers) S of Acco and eight miles (13 kilometers) SE of Haifa, in the southern end of the Plain of Acco.

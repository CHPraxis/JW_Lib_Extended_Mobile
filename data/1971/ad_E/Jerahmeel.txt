JERAHMEEL
(Je·rahʹme·el) [may God have compassion].
1. The firstborn of Judah’s grandson Hezron. The royal and Messianic lineage passed through Jerahmeel’s brother Ram (apparently the same as Arni). An extensive genealogy is included for Jerahmeel’s descendants, some of whom inhabited the southern part of Judah.—1 Chron. 2:4, 5, 9-15, 25-42; 1 Sam. 27:10; Luke 3:33.
2. Son or descendant of a Merarite Levite named Kish.—1 Chron. 24:26, 29; 23:21.
3. One of the three men sent by King Jehoiakim in his fourth year to seize Jeremiah and Baruch. They returned empty-handed, however, for Jehovah kept his two faithful servants concealed. (Jer. 36:1, 26) Jerahmeel’s being called here “the son of the king” probably denotes simply that he was one of the royal household. Since Jehoiakim’s successor and presumed firstborn Jehoiachin was only ten or eleven years old during his father’s fourth year of rule, other sons of Jehoiakim were likely still younger, too young to be sent on such a mission as Jerahmeel’s.—2 Ki. 23:36; 24:1, 6, 8.

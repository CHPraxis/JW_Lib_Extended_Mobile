<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Methʹeg·amʹmah) [bridle of the mother city].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">King David took Metheg-ammah from the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:1-10:8:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:1</a>) Since no site by that name is known, Metheg-ammah may well be a figurative term designating one of the principal Philistine cities. The parallel passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:1-13:18:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 18:1</a> says “Gath and its dependent towns.” Therefore, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:1-10:8:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:1</a>, David’s taking Metheg-ammah (“the bridle of the mother city,” <em>AS</em>) may mean that David gained the “bridle” or jurisdiction over Gath, the “mother city,” and thereby also control of its daughter-like dependent towns. This thought is conveyed by <em>An American Translation,</em> which reads “the control of the metropolis” instead of “Metheg-ammah.”</p>

SHUPPIM
(Shupʹpim).
1. A descendant of Benjamin, perhaps through Bela and Ir(i). (1 Chron. 7:6, 7, 12) The introduction of Shuppim into the genealogies of Manasseh in verse 15 may indicate some unusual intertribal relationship. In Genesis 46:21 Shuppim is called Muppim, possibly due to the similarity of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet represented in English by sh and m. The name is also spelled Shephupha(m, n), and identifies the individual as founder of a Benjamite tribal family of Shuphamites.—Num. 26:39; 1 Chron. 8:5.
2. A gatekeeper appointed to the W of the sanctuary. (1 Chron. 26:16) Since the last three characters of his name in Hebrew (Sup·pimʹ) are identical to the last three characters of the previous term (behth ha-ʼasup·pimʹ), scholars suspect it to be a dittograph, that is, an unintentional scribal repetition, therefore not the name of a person, in this verse.—Compare verses 10 and 11.

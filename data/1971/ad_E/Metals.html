<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Seventy-eight of the more than a hundred elements known to man are metals. Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and electrum have a recorded history thousands of years old. The first Biblical mention of metals is in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:22-1:4:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 4:22</a>. In physical properties metals are opaque, fusible, ductile, have a metallic luster and are usually good conductors of heat and electricity. Chemically and physically the metals have certain distinguishing characteristics. For specific information and the Scriptural occurrences, see the above-mentioned metals under their individual names; also the heading REFINE, REFINER.</p>

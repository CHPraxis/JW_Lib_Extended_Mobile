NEBUSHAZBAN
(Neb·u·shazʹban) [O Nebo, deliver me!].
The Rabsaris, chief court official, in the forces of Nebuchadnezzar that destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. Nebushazban was one of several princes that directed the release of Jeremiah. (Jer. 39:13, 14) Either Nebushazban is referred to by his title, or else another man was also called Rabsaris in the group that sat down in the Middle Gate after the Babylonians first broke through Jerusalem’s wall.—Jer. 39:2, 3.

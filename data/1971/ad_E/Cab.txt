CAB
A measure that, according to rabbinical sources, was one-eighteenth of an ephah (2Â Ki. 6:25), and hence also one eighteenth of a bath measure. (Ezek. 45:11) If the bath measure is to be viewed as having a capacity of 5.81 gallons (22 liters), as archaeological evidence seems to indicate, then the cab measure would have a capacity of 2.58 pints (2.2 dry pints, 1.22 liters).

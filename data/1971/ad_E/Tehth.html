<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">or, as commonly anglicized, teth [ט]. The ninth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, used also later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, to denote the number nine. The meaning of the name is uncertain.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The sound represented by the letter corresponds to an emphatic English “t,” produced by pressing the tongue strongly against the palate. Its sound differs from that of the letter <em>taw</em> [ת] primarily because of its lack of aspiration after the “t” sound. In the original Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each verse of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:65-19:119:72" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:65-72</a>.</p>

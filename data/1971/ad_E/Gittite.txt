GITTITE
(Gitʹtite).
A term often applied to an inhabitant or native of the Philistine city of Gath. (Josh. 13:2, 3) Giant Goliath was a “Gittite.” (2 Sam. 21:19; 1 Chron. 20:5) Gittites, including Ittai (called “a foreigner” and “an exile” from his home), faithfully stuck with David during his flight at the time of Absalom’s rebellion.—2 Sam. 15:13, 18-22; 18:2; see GATH; ITTAI No. 1.
The term “Gittite,” however, is also applied to Obed-edom, in whose home the ark of the covenant temporarily rested. (2 Sam. 6:10, 11; 1 Chron. 13:13) Some scholars believe he similarly was from Philistine Gath. It seems more likely, however, that Obed-edom was a Levite, and may have been called a “Gittite” because he came from the Levite city of Gath-rimmon.—Josh. 21:20, 23, 24; see OBED-EDOM No. 1.

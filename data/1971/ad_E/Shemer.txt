SHEMER
(Sheʹmer) [guard].
1. A descendant of Asher, perhaps his great-grandson. Four sons of Shemer are named. (1 Chron. 7:30, 34) Shemer is spelled Shomer in verse 32.
2. A Merarite Levite, ancestor of Ethan.—1 Chron. 6:44-47.
3. The owner of the hill of Samaria, possibly a tribe rather than an individual, for “Samaria” means “belonging to the clan Shemer.” Israelite King Omri bought the mountain for two talents of silver (nearly $2,850) and began ruling from there in 945 B.C.E.—1 Ki. 16:23, 24.

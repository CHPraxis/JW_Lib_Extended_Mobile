<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Descendants of Shimei, the son of Gershon and the grandson of Levi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:6:16-2:6:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 6:16, 17</a>) When the first census in the wilderness was taken, the Shimeites and the Libnites (“the families of the Gershonites”) had registered ones totaling 7,500. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:20-4:3:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 3:20b-22</a>) The Shimeites were encamped with the Libnites “behind the tabernacle,” that is, to the W. As Gershonites their Levitical duties included transporting, erecting and maintaining the tabernacle tent and its coverings, as well as the hangings of the courtyard, the screens (both to the entrance of the courtyard and to the tent) and the tent cords.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:23-4:3:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 3:23-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Shimei had four sons, Jahath, Zina, Jeush and Beriah. But since the last two did not have many sons, they joined together to become a “paternal house for one official class.” This is mentioned in the time of David when it appears that the assigned tabernacle service of the Shimeites was divided among these three families.

ZOPHAR
(Zoʹphar)
One of Job’s three “companions”; the Naamathite. The meaning of name is rather indefinite. (Job 2:11) Zophar was the third in turn to speak in the debate with Job. His general line of reasoning followed that of Eliphaz and Bildad; he accused Job of wickedness, telling him to put away his sinful practices. (Job chaps. 11, 20) But after two rounds Zophar desisted; he had spoken his words of denunciation and had nothing to add in the third round. In the end Jehovah commanded that he and his companions offer a great sacrifice, and that Job pray in their behalf.—Job 42:7-9.

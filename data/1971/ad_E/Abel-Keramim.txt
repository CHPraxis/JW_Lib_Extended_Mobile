ABEL-KERAMIM
(A使bel-ker使a路mim) [meadow of vineyards].
The most distant point to which Jephthah pursued the Ammonites in their defeat. (Judg. 11:33) It is generally held to be situated between Heshban and Rabbah or Rabbath-ammon (modern Amman). Eusebius (Onomastica 32.15-16) located it as about six miles (9.7 kilometers) from Rabbath-ammon, but the direction is uncertain. It is generally identified today with Khirbet es-Suq, about five miles (8 kilometers) S and a little W of Rabbath-ammon, though some recommend Na式ur, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) W of Rabbath-ammon as the probable location.

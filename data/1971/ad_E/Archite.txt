ARCHITE
(Arʹchite).
Although the term could refer to a member of an unidentified Canaanite tribe, it appears more likely that it refers to a well-known family or clan located in the area of Ataroth, SW of Bethel. (Josh. 16:2) A town named ʽAin ʽArik to the W of Bethel is suggested by some as the source or the remaining evidence of the name. Hushai, David’s faithful counselor, was an Archite.—1 Chron. 27:33; see HUSHAI.

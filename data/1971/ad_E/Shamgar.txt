SHAMGAR
(Shamʹgar).
A deliverer of Israel between the judgeships of Ehud and Barak. Only one heroic deed of Shamgar is recorded, the slaying of six hundred Philistines with a cattle goad, but he is accredited thereby with ‘saving Israel.’ (Judg. 3:31) According to Josephus, Shamgar died in his first year of judgeship. (Antiquites of the Jews, Book V, chap. IV, par. 3) His being a “son of Anath” may refer to the Naphtalite city of Beth-anath.—Judg. 1:33.

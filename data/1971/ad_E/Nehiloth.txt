NEHILOTH
(Neʹhi·loth).
A transliteration of nehhi·lohthʹ, a Hebrew term of uncertain derivation and meaning, occurring only in the superscription of Psalm 5. Nehiloth appears to be a musical expression and many believe that it refers to a wind instrument, linking it with a Hebrew root related to hha·lilʹ (flute). However, the phrase “for Nehiloth” may designate a melody. The Greek Septuagint Version and the Latin Vulgate render the term “[for] her who inherits.”

HIRAM-ABIV
(Hirʹam-aʹbiv) [Hiram his father].
A term used in reference to the skilled craftsman sent from Tyre to supervise construction of the furnishings of Solomon’s temple. It seems to indicate that Hiram was “father,” not in a literal sense, but in that he was a “master workman.”—2 Chron. 4:16; see HIRAM No. 2.

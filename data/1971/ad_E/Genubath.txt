GENUBATH
(Ge·nuʹbath) [theft].
Son of Edomite prince Hadad. When army chief Joab occupied Moab during the reign of David, Hadad fled to Egypt. There he gained the favor of Pharaoh, whose sister-in-law he was given as a wife. By her, Hadad fathered Genubath, who was raised with the sons of Pharaoh.—1 Ki. 11:14-20.

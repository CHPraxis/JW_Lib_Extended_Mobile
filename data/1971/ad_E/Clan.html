<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A large social group having a common inheritance, and resembling a tribe in magnitude.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In all three instances where the Hebrew word <em>ʼum·mahʹ</em> occurs, it refers to a large group of non-Israelites and is translated “clan” (<em>NW</em>). Descendants of Ishmael’s twelve sons, for example, are described as “clans” early in the history of that ethnic group. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:16-1:25:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 25:16</a>) The same is true of the descendants of Midian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:15-4:25:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 25:15</a>) The term is also found in Hebrew poetry at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:117:1-19:117:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 117:1</a>, where it appears in a parallelism with “nations.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>sheʹvet,</em> which is usually rendered “tribe,” is translated “clan” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:2-4:18:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Numbers 18:2</a> (<em>NW</em>). This is an exceptional instance to show the distinction the Hebrew text makes, for in this verse two different words (<em>mat·tehʹ</em> and <em>sheʹvet</em>) appear, both of which are normally rendered “tribe.”</p>

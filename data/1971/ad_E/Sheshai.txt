SHESHAI
(Sheʹshai) [whitish].
Son of Anak and brother of Ahiman and Talmai. They inhabited Hebron at the time the twelve Israelite spies visited the Promised Land in 1512 B.C.E. (Num. 13:22, 28, 33) When Joshua’s forces were exterminating the Anakim from the land forty-five years later, it was Caleb’s special privilege to drive Sheshai and his brothers out of Hebron.—Josh. 11:21, 22; 14:10-15; 15:13, 14; Judg. 1:10.

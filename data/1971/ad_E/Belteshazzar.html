<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Bel·te·shazʹzar) [protect his life].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Babylonian name given to Daniel after he was taken captive in 617 B.C.E.—not to be confused with Belshazzar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:7-27:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 1:7</a>) The name is in the form of an invocation to Bel and hence was selected, as Nebuchadnezzar said, “according to the name of my god.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:8-27:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:12-27:5:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>) The purpose was evidently to effect Daniel’s naturalization and alienate him from the worship of Jehovah. However, the Babylonians continued to speak of him also by his name Daniel.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:18-27:4:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Dan. 4:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:12-27:5:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 5:12, 13</a>; see DANIEL No. 2.</p>

AMASA
(A·maʹsa) [burden, burden bearer].
1. Son of David’s sister Abigail and Jether (Ithra), and cousin of Absalom and Joab. (2 Sam. 17:25; 1 Chron. 2:16, 17) Jether is called an Israelite in Samuel and an Ishmaelite in Chronicles, perhaps because he lived in Ishmaelite territory. Some contend that Amasa is a shortened form of Amasai, one of those who joined David’s army at Ziklag, but such an identification is uncertain.—1 Chron. 12:18.
Years later, when Amasa threw his lot in with Absalom’s rebellion against David he was put over Absalom’s army in place of Joab. (2 Sam. 17:25) The rebellion was suppressed, David’s son Absalom was killed by Joab, and Amasa was offered the place of Joab as David’s army chief, for as David said, he is “my bone and my flesh.”—2 Sam. 18:9-15; 19:13.
Again rebellion broke out, this time Sheba wanted no share in David. (2 Sam. 20:1, 2) Amasa was given three days to assemble an army. When he did not come at the fixed time, Abishai was told to take David’s servants and pursue after the rebels. Abishai’s brother Joab and his men were with them in the pursuit of Sheba. Finally, when the latecomer Amasa met them, Joab, pretending to give an affectionate kiss, grabbed Amasa by the beard with one hand and with his sword in the other ripped his abdomen open. (2 Sam. 20:4-12) This may have been just recompense for Amasa’s siding with Absalom, but certainly not at the hand from which it came. David therefore commanded Solomon that Amasa should be avenged through the death of Joab.—1 Ki. 2:5, 32.
2. Son of Hadlai. Following victory over Judah, when Iaraelite warriors were bringing their brothers back as servants, Amasa was one of four headmen of Ephraim who heeded the plea of the prophet Oded to return the captives. He also assisted those of Judah with supplies and transportation needed for their repatriation.—2 Chron. 28:8-15.

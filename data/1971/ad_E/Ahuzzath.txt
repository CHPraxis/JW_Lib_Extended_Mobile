AHUZZATH
(A·huzʹzath) [possession; seized].
The “confidential friend” who accompanied Abimelech, Philistine king of Gerar, on a visit to Isaac at Beer-sheba. (Gen. 26:23, 26) This is the first reference to “confidential friend,” the trusted inner circle position of one consulted for advice or authorized as spokesman. (See FRIEND OF THE KING.) The ʽathʼ ending (Ahuzzath) is characteristic of Philistine names.

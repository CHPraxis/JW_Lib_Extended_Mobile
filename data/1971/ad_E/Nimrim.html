<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In prophecies directed against Moab, both Isaiah and Jeremiah refer to the “waters of Nimrim.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:5-23:15:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 15:5-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:34-24:48:35" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 48:34, 35</a>) On the basis of the fertility of the surrounding region, some identify the waters of Nimrim with the Wadi Nimrim, whose waters flow into the Jordan N of the Dead Sea. (See BETH-NIMRAH.) The order in which places are named in the prophecies, however, seems to indicate a location in the S of Moab. Thus many authorities prefer identification with the Wadi en-Numeirah, which flows down into the Dead Sea about eight and a half miles (14 kilometers) from its southern end. The prophecies foretell that these waters will become “sheer” or “mere desolations,” either in a figurative sense due to the desolating of the land or perhaps due to a damming up of their streams by enemy forces.</p>

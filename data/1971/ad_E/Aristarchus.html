<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ar·is·tarʹchus) [best ruler].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of Paul’s close associates, a traveling companion and fellow prisoner, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:4-44:20:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 20:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:2-44:27:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 27:2</a>) He is introduced in the account of Paul’s third missionary journey; at the height of the Ephesian riot Aristarchus and Gaius were forcibly dragged into the theater. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:29-44:19:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:29</a>) He could have been the “brother” who assisted Paul with the contribution for the Judeans that was collected in Macedonia and Greece.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:18-47:8:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:18-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Aristarchus accompanied Paul on the voyage to Rome, but how he secured passage is uncertain, perhaps as a slave for Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:2-44:27:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 27:2</a>) While in Rome he further assisted and encouraged Paul and for a time shared his prison bonds. Greetings from Aristarchus are conveyed in Paul’s letters to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:10-51:4:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">the Colossians (4:10</a>) and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:23-57:1:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philemon (23, 24</a>).</p>

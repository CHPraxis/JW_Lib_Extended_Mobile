<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Uzʹzen-sheʹe·rah) [ear (point) of Sheerah].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city that Sheerah, an Ephraimite woman, built. In what sense she ‘built’ is not stated; perhaps this was in the sense of her contributing in some major way to the progress and development of this and other places listed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:22-13:7:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:22-24</a>) Uzzen-sheerah’s location is not definitely known. However, some geographers identify it with Beit Sira, less than three miles (c. 5 kilometers) W-SW of the suggested site of Lower Beth-horon and about thirteen miles (c. 21 kilometers) NW of Jerusalem.</p>

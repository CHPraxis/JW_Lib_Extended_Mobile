<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aeʹnon) [springs, (natural) fountains].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place having “great quantity of water” available, where John the Baptist did baptizing following the Passover of 30 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:23-43:3:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:23</a>) It was near the apparently better known place named Salim. The exact locations of these places are uncertain; however Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea in the third and fourth centuries C.E., indicates a location in the Jordan valley about eight miles (13 kilometers) S of Bethshan (Scythopolis). In this area is Tell Ridgha, also called Tell Sheikh Selim, and nearby are several springs that might fit the description of the place called Aenon.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Commenting on John’s selection of this place, <em>Harper’s Bible Dictionary</em> (1952), on page eight, says: “The abundance of water suggests that the candidates for baptism may have been here immersed, as they were at the Jordan.”</p>

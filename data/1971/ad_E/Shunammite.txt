SHUNAMMITE
(Shuʹnam·mite).
An inhabitant of Shunem. Abishag, the nurse of David in his old age, is called a “Shunammite.”—1 Ki. 1:3, 4, 15; 2:17, 21, 22; see ABISHAG.
A prominent woman of Shunem who showed hospitality to the prophet Elisha, regularly offering him food and lodging, is left unnamed. For her kindness, she was rewarded with a son. When, several years later, the boy died, the Shunammite woman rode some twenty miles (c. 32 kilometers), and upon finding Elisha at Mount Carmel, she expressed her bitter grief, saying: “Did I ask for a son through my lord? Did I not say, ‘You must not lead me to a false hope’?” Returning with her, the prophet prayed to Jehovah and the boy was restored to life.—2 Ki. 4:8-37.
Upon Elisha’s warning her of a coming famine, the Shunammite woman, apparently now a widow, together with her household, took up living among the Philistines for seven years. At the end of this time she returned, only to find her property confiscated. When the king learned of her past dealings with Elisha, all her belongings were returned.—2 Ki. 8:1-6.

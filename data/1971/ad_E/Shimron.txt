SHIMRON
(Shimʹron) [watching, guard].
1. A son of Issachar. (Gen. 46:13; 1 Chron. 7:1) He was among “Israel’s sons who came into Egypt.” His descendants, the Shimronites, formed one of the families of Issachar.—Gen. 46:8; Num. 26:23, 24.
2. A town whose king joined the confederation of northern Canaanites that Joshua defeated at the waters of Merom. (Josh. 11:1, 5, 8; 12:20; see SHIMRON-MERON.) Shimron was included in the tribal allotment of Zebulun. (Josh. 19:10, 15) The most commonly suggested location of ancient Shimron is Tell Semuniya, a short distance W of Nazareth, a site, however, rejected by a few.

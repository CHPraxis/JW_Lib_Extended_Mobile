UZZIELITES
(Uz·ziʹel·ites).
Levitical descendants of Kohath’s fourth son Uzziel. (Num. 3:19, 27) They camped to the S of the tabernacle, and one of the Uzzielites, El(i)zaphan, was chieftain of all the Kohathites. (Num. 3:29, 30) One hundred and twelve Uzzielites under Amminadab accompanied the ark of the covenant when David had it brought to Jerusalem. (1 Chron. 15:3, 4, 10) Uzzielites were further involved in David’s organization of temple service.—1 Chron. 23:6, 20; 24:24; 26:23, 24.

METHEG-AMMAH
(Methʹeg·amʹmah) [bridle of the mother city].
King David took Metheg-ammah from the Philistines. (2 Sam. 8:1) Since no site by that name is known, Metheg-ammah may well be a figurative term designating one of the principal Philistine cities. The parallel passage at 1 Chronicles 18:1 says “Gath and its dependent towns.” Therefore, at 2 Samuel 8:1, David’s taking Metheg-ammah (“the bridle of the mother city,” AS) may mean that David gained the “bridle” or jurisdiction over Gath, the “mother city,” and thereby also control of its daughter-like dependent towns. This thought is conveyed by An American Translation, which reads “the control of the metropolis” instead of “Metheg-ammah.”

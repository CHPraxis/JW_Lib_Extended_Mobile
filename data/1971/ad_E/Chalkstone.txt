CHALKSTONE
Outcroppings of this very soft, easily powdered rock are found in various parts of Palestine. Because it is worthless as a building stone, and can be so readily crumbled and pulverized, the prophet Isaiah used it in an effective simile to show what must be done to the idolatrous altars of Israel if forgiveness was to be attained.â€”Isa. 27:9.

ARBEL
(Arʹbel).
A “house” (“Beth-arbel,” AT, JB, RS) despoiled at some unspecified time by Shalman. (Hos. 10:14) It is usually linked with modern Irbid, located about eighteen miles (29 kilometers) E-SE of the Sea of Galilee, hence in Gilead. Some scholars, however, attempt to connect Biblical Arbel with “Arbela” in Galilee, referred to in the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (9:2, JB).

NERGAL-SHAREZER
(Nerʹgal-sha·reʹzer) [‘Nergal, protect the king’].
1. A Babylonian prince of Nebuchadnezzar’s time.—Jer. 39:3.
2. Another important prince in Nebuchadnezzar’s forces at the overthrow of Jerusalem, distinguished from No. 1 above by the added title Rabmag. It was this Rabmag who assisted in the release of Jeremiah from prison.—Jer. 39:3, 13, 14.
Because this name and title bear such a striking resemblance to that found on Babylonian bricks, legal contracts and inscriptions (Nergal-shar-uzur, Rabemga), some authorities think this prince was Neriglissar (Greek form), believed to be the successor of King Evil-merodach (Amel-Marduk).

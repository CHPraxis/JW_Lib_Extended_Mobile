<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Eb·en·eʹzer) [the stone of help].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A site near which Israel was twice defeated by the Philistines, resulting not only in the death of thirty-four thousand Israelites, including Hophni and Phinehas, but also in enemy capture of the ark of the covenant. News of this latter event precipitated the death of Eli the priest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:1-9:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 4:1-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:17-9:4:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:5:1-9:5:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 5:1</a>) Bible geographers tentatively place Ebenezer at Majdel Yaba, some two and a half miles (4 kilometers) SE of the suggested site of Ephraimite Aphek (where the Philistines were encamped), and eleven miles (17.7 kilometers) E of modern Tel Aviv.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. The name given to a stone erected by Samuel more than twenty years after the events mentioned in the preceding texts, likely to commemorate Israel’s victory over the Philistines by God’s help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:2-9:7:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 7:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:7:12-9:7:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Although its exact location is today unknown, it was apparently a number of miles SE of No. 1 above, “between Mizpah and Jeshanah.”</p>

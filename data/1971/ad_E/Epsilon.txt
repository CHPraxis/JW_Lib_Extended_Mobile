EPSILON
[Ε, ε] (epʹsi·lon).
The fifth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the koi·neʹ Greek there were two sounds for the vowel “e”; and eʹpsi·lon had the short sound of “e,” as in the English “met.”—See ETA.
Eʹpsi·lon, as to its numerical value, represents five when it has the acute accent (εʹ), and 5,000 when it has the subscript (====ε).—See ALPHABET.

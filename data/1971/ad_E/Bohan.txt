BOHAN
(Boʹhan) [thumb, stumpy].
1. A descendant of Reuben after whom a boundary stone for the territory of Judah was named.—Josh. 15:6; 18:17.
2. “The stone of Bohan” served as a boundary marker for the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. (Josh. 15:6; 18:17) It lay near the NW corner of the Salt Sea and evidently toward the foot of the plateau-like Low Plain of Achor.—See ACHOR.

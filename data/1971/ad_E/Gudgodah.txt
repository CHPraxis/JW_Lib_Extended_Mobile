GUDGODAH
(Gudʹgo·dah) [cleft, division].
A wilderness encampment of the Israelites; probably the same as Hor-haggidgad. (Deut. 10:6, 7; compare Numbers 33:33.) Many geographers, believing the name “Gudgodah” to be preserved in Wadi Ghadaghed, suggest that this place may have been located on Wadi Ghadaghed, about forty-two miles (68 kilometers) N-NW of the Gulf of Aqabah. But this has been questioned, since the Hebrew consonants of Gudgodah do not actually correspond with those of Ghadaghed. Concerning the order in which the Israelite camping sites are listed in Numbers and Deuteronomy, see BENE-JAAKAN.

SEPHARVITES
(Seʹphar·vites).
People of the city of Sepharvaim. After 740 B.C.E., at least some of the inhabitants of Sepharvaim were taken by the Assyrians as colonists to Samaria. The Sepharvites brought with them their false religion, which included the sacrificing of their sons to the gods Adrammelech and Anammelech.—2 Ki. 17:24, 31-33; 18:34; Isa. 36:19.

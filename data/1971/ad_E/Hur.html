<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">1. A descendant of Judah; son of Caleb and Ephrath; grandfather of the craftsman Bezalel. Some of Hur’s descendants may have settled in Bethlehem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:2-2:31:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 31:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:30-2:35:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 35:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:22-2:38:22" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 38:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:19-13:2:20" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:50-13:2:51" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 50, 51,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:54-13:2:54" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 54;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:1-13:4:4" data-bid="1-7" class="b"> 4:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:1:5-14:1:5" data-bid="1-8" class="b"> 2 Chron. 1:5</a>; see ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) Likely the same as No. 2 below.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">2. A prominent associate of Moses and Aaron. When, shortly after leaving Egypt, Israel was attacked by the Amalekites, Hur accompanied Moses and Aaron to the top of a hill where he and Aaron supported Moses’ hands until Jehovah gave Israel the victory over the Amalekites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:8-2:17:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 17:8-13</a>) On one occasion not long thereafter, Moses and Joshua went up on Mount Sinai to receive more of the Law, leaving Hur and Aaron in charge of the camp. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:12-2:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 24:12-14</a>) He is likely the same Hur as the grandfather of the tabernacle craftsman Bezalel (No. 1 above). Josephus wrote that Hur was Miriam’s husband, but the Bible does not say anything about this.—<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book III, chap. II, par. 4.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">3. A king of Midian, one of five dominated by Amorite King Sihon before Israel, moving toward the Promised Land, defeated Sihon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:15-6:13:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Josh. 13:15, 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:21-6:13:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:21-4:21:24" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Num. 21:21-24</a>) Afterward, Hur and his four compatriots apparently allied themselves with Moab’s King Balak in opposition to Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:1-4:22:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Num. 22:1-7</a>) Later, as directed by Jehovah, the Israelites warred against the Midianites and killed Hur as well as his four allied Midianite kings and the greedy prophet Balaam.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:1-4:31:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 31:1-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">4. Father of Solomon’s food deputy in the mountainous region of Ephraim.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:7-11:4:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">5. Father of Rephaiah. Hur’s son Rephaiah helped Nehemiah rebuild Jerusalem’s wall.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:9-16:3:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 3:9</a>.</p>

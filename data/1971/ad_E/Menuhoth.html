<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">According to the Masoretic text, apparently a Judean family descended through Shobal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:4-13:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:52-13:2:52" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 52</a>) But some scholars prefer emending the Hebrew text to read “the Manahathites,” as in verse 54. (<em>JB, Mo</em>) And a Jewish commentary on <em>Chronicles (Soncino Books of the Bible,</em> p. 15) gives the alternate reading “who supervised half of the resting-places” and notes: “Shobal was in charge of half the caravan stations in the land of Judah.”</p>

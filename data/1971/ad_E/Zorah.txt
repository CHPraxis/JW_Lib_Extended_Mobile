ZORAH
(Zoʹrah).
A city in the Shephelah allotted to the tribe of Judah. (Josh. 15:20, 33) Situated on the boundary between Dan and Judah, it was inhabited by people of Dan. (Josh. 19:41, 48; Judg. 18:2, 8, 11) The Danite Samson was born at Zorah and was buried nearby. (Judg. 13:2, 24, 25; 16:31) The city was fortified by King Rehoboam, perhaps because of its strategic location some fourteen miles (22.5 kilometers) W of Jerusalem. (2 Chron. 11, 5. 10) Zorah was repopulated by some sons of Judah who returned from Babylonian exile. (Neh. 11:25, 29) It is identified with present-day Sarʽa, on the N side of what is suggested to be the valley of Sorek.

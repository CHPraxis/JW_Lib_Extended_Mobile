<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A fortified Judean city in the Shephelah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:20-6:15:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:33-6:15:33" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:44-6:15:44" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:7-9:23:7" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1 Sam. 23:7</a>) Keilah was perhaps ‘founded’ or, at one time, ‘governed’ by some Calebite(s). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:15-13:4:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:19-13:4:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19</a>; compare ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) It is commonly identified with Khirbet Qila, situated on a hill about nine miles (15 kilometers) NW of Hebron. As in the region of ancient Keilah, today grain is cultivated in the vicinity of Khirbet Qila.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:1-9:23:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Samuel 23:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The city was reoccupied after the Babylonian exile.

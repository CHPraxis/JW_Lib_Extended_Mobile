GITTAIM
(Gitʹta·im) [two winepresses].
The site to which (for unstated reasons) the Beerothites fled. (2 Sam. 4:1-3) Benjamites settled Gittaim after the exile. (Neh. 11:31, 33) The exact location is unknown; some suggest an identification with a place called Gamteti in the Tell el-Amarna letters, likely in the vicinity of modern Ramleh.—See BEEROTH.

ANAK
(Aʹnak) [long-necked].
The name applied to the progenitor of a tribe of unusually tall men and probably to the tribe itself, since at Numbers 13:22 and 28 the article is used with the name in Hebrew. While it seems to be the personal name of the son of “Arba . . . the father of Anak” (Josh. 15:13), it may be, instead, a descriptive name that first applied to Arba himself (as the original “longneck”) and thereafter to his progeny. (Compare Joshua 15:14 with 14:15, where Arba is called “the great man among the Anakim.”)—See ANAKIM.

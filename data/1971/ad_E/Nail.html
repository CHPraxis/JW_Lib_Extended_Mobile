<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In Bible times nails were used for all the common purposes, being driven into or through materials such as wood to fasten pieces together, to hang articles on a wall, or for some decorative purpose.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:7-23:41:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 41:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:3-24:10:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Ancient nails were quite similar to the larger modern ones, although some kinds had four-sided shanks and a longer taper to the point than those in use today. Apparently, earliest nails were made of bronze, though larger nails of later times were made of iron. David prepared “iron in great quantity for nails for the doors of the gates” of the prospective temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:3-13:22:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 22:3</a>) Ornamental nails have been discovered that were made of bronze overlaid with gold foil, and these are said to date back to about 1300-1200 B.C.E. Concerning nails used in the construction of Solomon’s temple it is said: “The weight for the nails was fifty gold shekels.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:3:8-14:3:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 3:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Iron spikes five to seven inches (12.7 to 17.8 centimeters) in length have been found in the vicinity of Jerusalem; these are reportedly of the first, second, or third centuries C.E. Such spikes may be similar to the nails employed by the Roman soldiers to impale Jesus Christ. Thomas did not believe that Christ was resurrected until after he saw the “print of the nails” in Jesus’ flesh.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:24-43:20:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 20:24-29</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus’ death on the torture stake resulted in the termination of the Mosaic Law covenant. Referring to its cancellation, Paul pointed out that God took the Law out of the way “by nailing it to the torture stake.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:13-51:2:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 2:13, 14</a>) Solomon likened “those indulging in collections of sentences” to “nails driven in,” possibly because they and their good words from Jehovah have a stabilizing and supporting effect upon a hearer.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:11-21:12:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:11</a>.</p>

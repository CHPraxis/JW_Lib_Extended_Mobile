ARVADITE
(Arʹvad·ite).
A member of the family descended from Ham through Canaan and that evidently inhabited Arvad, an island just off the N Phoenician coast. (Gen. 10:6, 15, 18; 1 Chron. 1:16) The only other mention of them is Ezekiel’s reference to Arvadites as being skilled sailors and valiant soldiers for Tyre.—Ezek. 27:8, 11.

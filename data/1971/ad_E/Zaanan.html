<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town mentioned by the prophet Micah as among places due to experience the foretold invasion of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:11-33:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 1:11</a>) Many scholars consider it to be the same as Zenan at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:37-6:15:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 15:37</a>. The suggested identification is with ʽAraq el-Kharba, in the Shephelah region of Judah, about four miles (c. 6 kilometers) NW of Lachish.</p>

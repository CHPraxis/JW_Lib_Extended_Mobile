ANATH
(Aʹnath) [answer, i.e., to prayer].
The father of one of Israel’s judges, Shamgar. (Judg. 3:31; 5:6) This was also the name of one of the three principal Canaanite goddesses. She is presented as both the sister and spouse of Baal and a symbol of lustful sex and war. There is no evidence, however, to show that the name of Shamgar’s father was drawn from that of the goddess Anath; although the apostasies of Israel during this period could allow for that.—Compare the case of Gideon at Judges 6:25-27.

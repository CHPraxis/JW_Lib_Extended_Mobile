REHSH
or, as commonly anglicized, resh [ך]. The twentieth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, later used also, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, as a number to denote two hundred.
Rehsh is the origin of our English letter “r” through the Greek hro. Due to the similarity in form between rehsh [ך] and daʹleth [ד], the two were sometimes confused by copyists.
In the Hebrew, this letter appears as the initial letter in each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:153-160.

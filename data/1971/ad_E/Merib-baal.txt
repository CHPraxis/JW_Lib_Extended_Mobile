MERIB-BAAL
(Merʹib-baʹal) [contender against Baal, or, Baal contends].
Grandson of King Saul, son of Jonathan and the father of Micah. (1 Chron. 8:33, 34) This is apparently another name for Mephibosheth. Others had two names, such as Eshbaal, also called Ish-bosheth.—Compare 2 Samuel 2:8 with 1 Chronicles 8:33.
The name Merib-baal is found in two somewhat different Hebrew forms (Merivʹ baʹʽal and Meri-vaʹʽal) at 1 Chronicles 9:40. The first form is also used at 1 Chronicles 8:34 and means “contender against Baal,” which compares favorably with the possible meanings of Mephibosheth, that is, “one who scatters or disperses shame,” or “idol breaker.” Further indicating similar identity is the fact that Mephibosheth had a boy named Mica and Merib-baal had a son named Micah. (Compare 2 Samuel 9:12 with 1 Chronicles 9:40.) The forms “Mica” and “Micah” are due merely to a slight variation in the Hebrew spelling of these names.

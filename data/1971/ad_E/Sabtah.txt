SABTAH
(Sabʹtah).
A son of Cush and brother of Nimrod; progenitor of one of the seventy post-Flood families. (Gen. 10:7, 8, 32; 1 Chron. 1:9, 10) Sabtah’s descendants apparently settled in southern Arabia, perhaps in one of the places later bearing a name similar to his. Sabota, the ancient capital of Hadhramaut, has been suggested, and Ptolemy mentions a town called Saptha near the Persian Gulf, but any connection of these places with Sabtah remains uncertain.

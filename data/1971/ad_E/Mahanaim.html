<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ma·ha·naʹim) [two camps].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site E of the Jordan where Jacob, after parting from Laban, encountered a company of angels. Jacob then called the place “Mahanaim.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:1-1:32:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 32:1, 2</a>) The meaning of the name (“two camps”) may allude to Jacob’s company as having become two camps, or to the camp of angels and the camp of Jacob. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:7-1:32:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 32:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:10-1:32:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Apparently sometime later a city was built on the site. In the fifteenth century B.C.E. this city was first assigned to the Gadites and then to the Levite Merarites.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:24-6:13:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 13:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:26-6:13:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:34-6:21:34" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 21:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:38-6:21:38" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While David ruled from Hebron, Mahanaim served as the capital for the rival kingdom of Saul’s son and successor Ish-bosheth. This suggests that it was fortified and occupied a strategic position. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:8-10:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 2:8-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:29-10:2:29" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 29</a>) Evidently in this city Ish-bosheth was assassinated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:4:5-10:4:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 4:5-7</a>) Later, when David fled to Gilead from his rebellious son Absalom, he was kindly received at Mahanaim. He remained there at the request of his supporters and did not share in the battle that completely defeated Absalom’s attempt to seize the throne. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:17:24-10:18:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:24–18:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:32-10:19:32" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 19:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:8-11:2:8" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 2:8</a>) During the reign of David’s son Solomon, Mahanaim was under the jurisdiction of the deputy Ahinadab.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:7-11:4:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:14-11:4:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:6:13-22:6:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 6:13</a> “the dance of two camps” may also be rendered “the dance of Mahanaim” (<em>AS</em>) or “Mahanaim dance.” (<em>AT</em>) Perhaps the reference is to dancing associated with a certain festival that was held at Mahanaim.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:21:19-7:21:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judges 21:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:21:21-7:21:21" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The exact location of Mahanaim is uncertain. Khirbet Mahneh, about twelve miles (19 kilometers) N of the Jabbok and almost the same distance E of the Jordan, appears to preserve the Biblical name. But some feel that this site does not fit the Scriptural references to Mahanaim. They prefer Tell el-Hajjaj, about two miles (3 kilometers) S of the Jabbok and somewhat over nine miles (15 kilometers) from its confluence with the Jordan.</p>

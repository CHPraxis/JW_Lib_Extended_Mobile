CHILION
(Chilʹi·on) [frailty].
A son of Naomi and Elimelech and the brother of Mahlon the husband of Ruth. In Moab, where the family had moved from Bethlehem, in Judah, to escape a famine that occurred in the time of the judges, Chilion, after the death of his father, married the Moabitess Orpah. Both he and his brother died childless in Moab.—Ruth 1:1-5; 4:9, 10.

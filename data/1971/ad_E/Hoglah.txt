HOGLAH
(Hogʹlah) [partridge].
The third listed of Zelophehad’s five daughters. Since her father had no sons, his inheritance was divided among the five daughters with the stipulation that they marry inside their own tribe of Manasseh, in order “that their inheritance might continue together with the tribe of the family of their father” and not “circulate from one tribe to another.”—Num. 36:1-12; 26:33; 27:1-11; Josh. 17:3, 4.

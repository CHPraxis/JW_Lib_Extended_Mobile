RESINOUS TREE
[Heb., goʹpher].
This tree from the wood of which the ark was constructed by Noah cannot be identified with any degree of certainty. (Gen. 6:14) The Authorized Version simply transliterates the Hebrew name. On the basis of the similarity between the Hebrew name and the Hebrew term for “tar” (“pitch,” AV; Heb., koʹpher) some have related it to the resinous trees of the pine family, particularly to the cypress, which is a very durable tree, extremely resistant to decay.—See CYPRESS.

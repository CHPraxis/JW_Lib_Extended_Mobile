JESHIMON
(Je·shiʹmon) [a waste, a desert].
1. A bare wilderness area seemingly at the NE end of the Dead Sea, in which area Beth-jeshimoth was perhaps located. Apparently Pisgah and Peor overlooked Jeshimon.—Num. 21:20; 23:28; Josh. 12:1-3.
2. A region near Ziph, situated N of the wilderness of Maon. It would appear that Jeshimon included part of the wilderness of Judah and lay a few miles SE of Hebron. In this area of naked, chalky hills David and his men hid from King Saul.—1 Sam. 23:19, 24; 26:1, 3; see JUDAH, WILDERNESS OF.

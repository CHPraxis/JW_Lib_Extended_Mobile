MUTH-LABBEN
(Muth-labʹben) [Heb., ʽal·muthʹ lab·benʹ, possibly meaning “concerning the death of the son”]. An expression included in the superscription of one of David’s psalms. (Psalm 9) Some commentators suggest that it indicated to the musical director the name or perhaps the opening words of a familiar song that furnished the melody to be used in singing this psalm. One possibility of the word’s meaning is advanced by the Targum, wherein the superscription of Psalm 9 reads: “On the death of the man who came forth from between the camps,” alluding to a champion. The apparent reference here is to Goliath, the Philistine champion whom David defeated in battle between the Israelite and Philistine encampments.—1 Sam. 17:45-51.

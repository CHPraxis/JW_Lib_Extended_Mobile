<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Oph πni).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city of Benjamin (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:21-6:18:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 18:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:24-6:18:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24</a>), commonly linked with the Gophna mentioned by Josephus (<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book III, chap. III, par. 5) and considered to be modern Jifna. This site is about three miles (5 kilometers) N-NW of Bethel and therefore seemingly N of Benjamite territory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:11-6:18:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 18:11-13</a>) For the identification to be correct, it must be assumed either that Ophni was a Benjamite enclave city in Ephraim or that the Benjamite boundary extended northward near Bethel to include this suggested site of Ophni.</p>

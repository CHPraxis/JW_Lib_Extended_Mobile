<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The hybrid offspring of a he-ass and a mare. The mule’s body resembles that of the horse, but its short, thick head, long ears, short mane, small feet and its tail terminated by a tuft of long hairs are characteristic of the ass. The mule combines some of the finer qualities of both parents: the endurance, hardiness and surefootedness of the ass, and the strength, vigor and courage of the horse. The animal is less prone to disease than the horse, displays greater patience when bearing heavy burdens and enjoys a much longer life-span. The hinny, the offspring of a stallion and a she-ass, is smaller than the mule and lacks its strength and beauty. Both sexes of the mule, with rare exceptions, are sterile.</p>

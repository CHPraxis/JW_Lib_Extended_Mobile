<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(To·biʹah) [Jehovah is good).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. Forefather of some returned exiles who were unable to establish their Israelite genealogy.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:1-15:2:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:59-15:2:60" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 59, 60;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:61-16:7:62" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:61, 62</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. An opponent of Nehemiah. Tobiah was “the servant,” likely some official under the Persian king. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:19-16:2:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 2:19</a>) Both he and his son Jehohanan married Jewish women, and Tobiah was also related to High Priest Eliashib. This put Tobiah in a position of advantage for undermining Nehemiah’s authority, in that many Jews looked up to and spoke highly of Tobiah.—6:17-19; 13:4; compare 3:4; 7:6, 7, 10.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, Tobiah and his associates were displeased with Israel’s brightening prospect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:9-16:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 2:9, 10</a>) At first they merely derided and mocked the Jews (2:19; 4:3), but when the wall rebuilding made progress, they became angrier. However, various conspiracies—to kill off the Jews (4:7-9, 11, 14, 15), and an attempt to get Nehemiah to violate the sanctity of the temple (6:1, 10-13)—all failed. Even after the walls were completed, Tobiah through correspondence with his sympathizers in Jerusalem, attempted to intimidate Nehemiah. (6:16-19) Properly, therefore, Nehemiah asked Jehovah to remember the many wicked deeds of Tobiah and his confederates. (6:14) On his second arrival from Babylon, when <span id="page1607" class="pageNum" data-no="1607" data-before-text="1607"></span>Nehemiah found a dining room in the temple court reserved for Tobiah he promptly threw Tobiah’s things out.—13:4-9.</p>

JANOAH
(Ja·noʹah) [rest, quiet].
1. A boundary location of Ephraim usually identified with Khirbet Yanun, some ten miles (c. 16 kilometers) SE of Samaria.—Josh. 16:5-7.
2. A city in the ten-tribe kingdom taken by Tiglath-pileser during Pekah’s reign (c. 778-758 B.C.E.). Its inhabitants were deported to Assyria. (2 Ki. 15:29) The exact location of Janoah is uncertain. Some identify it with Yanuh, several miles E of Tyre. But geographers who consider this location to be too far W of the other cities listed at 2 Kings 15:29 favor Tell en-Naʽmeh, about six miles (c. 10 kilometers) N of the Huleh Basin.

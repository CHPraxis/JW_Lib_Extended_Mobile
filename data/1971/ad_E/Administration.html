<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The concept and exercise of administration is evident throughout the Bible record. From the start of human history God authorized perfect man to care for the earth and have in subjection its creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28</a>) After man’s rebellion a patriarchal system of administering family affairs, property and the enforcement of standards of conduct developed and became prominent, particularly from the Flood forward.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The administration of Israel’s national affairs by Moses according to the divine will during the forty-year wilderness trek provides a brilliant example of administration, including the delegation of authority to reliable subordinates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:19-2:18:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 18:19-26</a>) Within the priesthood the prime responsibility for administration rested on the high priest (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:5-4:3:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 3:5-10</a>); however, others were given the responsibility of the oversight and supervision of certain departments of service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:25-4:3:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Num. 3:25, 26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:30-4:3:32" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30-32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:3:36-4:3:37" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 36, 37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:16-4:4:16" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 4:16</a>) Following Israel’s entry into the Promised Land judges acted as administrators of the nation, with divine backing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:16-7:2:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judg. 2:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:18-7:2:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:1-8:1:1" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ruth 1:1</a>) With the establishment of the kingdom in Israel a more complete system of administration developed. Under King David the administrative structure was quite detailed, with officials directly under the king and with divisional administrators serving throughout the country. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:26:29-13:26:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 26:29-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:1-13:27:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 27:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:16-13:27:22" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 16-22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:25-13:27:34" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 25-34</a>) The priesthood was also thoroughly organized during David’s reign, with supervisors for the tabernacle work, officers and judges, gatekeepers, singers and musicians, and the setting up of twenty-four priestly divisions for handling the service at the tabernacle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:23:1-13:23:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Chron. 23:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:1-13:24:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 24:1-19</a>) Solomon’s administration was even more extensive and provides an outstanding example of capable administration in the construction of the temple.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:1-11:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Ki 4:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:26-11:4:27" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:5:13-11:5:18" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 5:13-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Other nations also developed complex systems of administration, as indicated by the classes of officials called up by King Nebuchadnezzar at the time of inaugurating his golden image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:2-27:3:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 3:2, 3</a>) Daniel himself was made “ruler” [from <em>sh<sup>e</sup>letʹ</em> Aramaic, related to the word “sultan”] over the jurisdictional district of Babylon and under him civil administration (<em>ʽavi·dhahʹ</em>) was given to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:48-27:2:49" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dan. 2:48, 49</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Greek Scriptures proper use of the delegated authority and responsibility resting upon those charged with overseeing the application and execution of God’s expressed will among his people is often discussed; and this is often done by references to stewardship and oversight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:2-42:16:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 16:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:17-46:9:17" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:2-49:3:2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Eph. 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:25-51:1:25" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Col. 1:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:7-56:1:7" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> Titus 1:7</a>) While responsibility to God is shown to be of paramount importance (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:109:8-19:109:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 109:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:20-44:1:20" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 1:20</a>), the interests of those who serve under such administration are also stressed.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:10</a>; see STEWARD.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For all the legislative, judicial and executive details that the Mosaic law code produced for the nation of Israel, the end result was an administration (<em>di·a·ko·niʹa</em>) of condemnation for those under it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:7-47:3:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:7-9</a>) Nevertheless, it foreshadowed the benefits of the new covenant of surpassing glory.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:6-47:3:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:11-47:3:11" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In his undeserved kindness God has purposed to have “an administration [Gr., <em>oi·ko·no·miʹa,</em> from which our English word “economy” is derived] at the full limit of the appointed times, namely, to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:10-49:1:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eph. 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:9-49:3:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3:9, 10</a>; see GOVERNMENT; KINGDOM.</p>

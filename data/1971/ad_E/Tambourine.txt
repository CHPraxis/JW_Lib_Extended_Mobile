TAMBOURINE
[Heb., toph].
A percussion instrument used since patriarchal times. The Hebrew word has also been translated as “timbrel,” “tambour” and “tabret.” (Gen. 31:27, Kx, Da, AS) All these renderings essentially are descriptive of the same instrument—a small hand drum of animal skin or parchment stretched on one or both sides of a wooden or metal frame, likely about ten inches (25.4 centimeters) in diameter. In view of its festive use, some models may have had pieces of metal, perhaps jingles, attached to the sides and could have been played like a modern tambourine. Other types probably had more the appearance and use of a tom-tom, being beaten with both hands.
Although the tambourine is not mentioned in connection with temple worship, it was used by both men and women in praising Jehovah and on other joyful occasions such as feasts and weddings. (1 Sam. 10:5; 2 Sam. 6:5; Ps. 150:4; Isa. 5:12) Women especially would accompany themselves with tambourines in singing and dancing. (Ex. 15:20; Judg. 11:34; 1 Sam. 18:6) The tambourine is also associated with the prospective gladness of Israel when the time of her restoration would arrive.—Jer. 31:4.

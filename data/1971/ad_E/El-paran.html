<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(El-paʹran) [big tree of Paran].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently the southernmost point reached by Chedorlaomer and his allies in their invasion of Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:5-1:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 14:5, 6</a>) Its description as “at the wilderness” or, “on the border of the wilderness” (<em>RS</em>), appears to place it on the eastern edge of the “wilderness of Paran.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:21-1:21:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 21:21</a>) Some scholars consider El-paran to be an ancient name for Elath.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">By means of Moses, Jehovah promised the nation of Israel that he would bring them into a land of wheat, barley, vines, figs, pomegranates, olives and honey. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:7-5:8:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 8:7-9</a>) Prior to this the spies who went into the land had returned with grapes, figs and pomegranates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:2-4:13:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 13:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:23-4:13:23" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23</a>) The Israelites had known the pomegranate in Egypt, as their complaint at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:5-4:20:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 20:5</a> indicates. The sleeveless coat of High Priest Aaron’s garments had on its hem a series of pomegranates made of blue thread, reddish-purple wool and scarlet material twisted together and alternating with golden bells. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:33-2:28:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 28:33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:24-2:39:26" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 39:24-26</a>) Later, when the temple was constructed, the capitals of the two copper pillars on the porch of the house were decorated with chains of pomegranate figures.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:18-11:7:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:20-11:7:20" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:42-11:7:42" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:25:17-12:25:17" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 25:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:3:16-14:3:16" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:4:13-14:4:13" data-bid="5-6" class="b"> 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:22-24:52:23" data-bid="5-7" class="b"> Jer. 52:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The pomegranate (<em>Punica granatum</em>) grows throughout the East as a small tree or shrub, seldom passing fifteen feet (4.6 meters) in height. The spreading branches are numerous and bear dark-green lancehead-shaped leaves, and blossoms with coral-red to scarlet flowers. The ripe fruit is of a maroon color, apple-shaped with a rosette or crown extending around the bottom. Within the hard rind it is crowded with small capsules full of juice and each containing a small pink or red seed. The juice makes a refreshing drink (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:8:2-22:8:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 8:2</a>), a syrup called grenadine is produced from the seeds, and the blossoms are used in the preparation of an astringent medicine used as a remedy for dysentery. The Shulammite maiden’s veiled temples were compared to a “segment of pomegranate” and her skin to a “paradise of pomegranates.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:3-22:4:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 4:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:13-22:4:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:6:7-22:6:7" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 6:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The pomegranate was extensively cultivated in Bible times, and the place-names of Rimmon, En-rimmon and Gath-rimmon doubtless derive from the abundance of these trees in their area. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:32-6:15:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 15:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:45-6:19:45" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 19:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:29-16:11:29" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Neh. 11:29</a>) The pomegranate tree was much prized and thus is often associated with other important fruit producers such as the vine and the fig tree.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:7:12-22:7:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 7:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:12-29:1:12" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Joel 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:19-37:2:19" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Hag. 2:19</a>.</p>

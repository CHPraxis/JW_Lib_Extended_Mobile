SILVER
Since silver is seldom found in the native state, the base ore has to be smelted and purified to separate the silver from the gangue, dross and scummy foreign matter, and to free it from other metals such as lead. (Ps. 12:6; Prov. 27:21; Ezek. 22:20-22; Mal. 3:3) Silver was treasured by all nations of the past. (2 Sam. 8:10, 11; 2 Chron. 9:14) Under Solomon’s rule, not only silver, but also gold, became so abundant in Jerusalem that silver was counted “as nothing at all,” “like the stones.” (1 Ki. 10:21, 27; 2 Chron. 9:20; compare Daniel 2:32.) Once every three years ships brought cargoes of silver from Tarshish (apparently Spain, which is still a producer of silver).—1 Ki. 10:22; 2 Chron. 9:21; Jer. 10:9; Ezek. 27:12.
Refined silver had two principal uses: (1) As a measure of wealth and a medium of exchange. Abraham, using this medium of exchange, bought a family burial plot. (Gen. 13:2; 23:15-18) Payment was made by weight, since coinage was not devised until centuries later. (2) Objects of beauty and ornamentation were fashioned of this metal from the days of the patriarchs. (Gen. 24:53; 44:2; Ex. 11:2; 12:35) Silver was employed for Israel’s two trumpets (Num. 10:2), in the construction of the tabernacle (Ex. 26:19, 21, 25, 32; 27:10, 11, 17), and in Solomon’s temple. (1 Chron. 28:15-17) It was also used in making implements of idolatry. (Ex. 20:23; Hos. 13:2; Hab. 2:19; Acts 19:24) In contrast with the transient value of silver, and to be more highly estimated, are the wisdom, discipline and understanding that come from Jehovah. (Prov. 3:13, 14; 8:10, 19; 16:16) Also, the Scriptures use silver in a number of symbolic senses.—Eccl. 12:6; Isa. 60:17; Dan. 2:32; 1 Cor. 3:12.

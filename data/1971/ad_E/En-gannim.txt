En-gannim
(En-ganʹnim) [fountain of gardens, or garden spring].
1. A Judean city in the Shephelah or lowlands mentioned in the same group as Adullam at Joshua 15:33-35. Its site is possibly at modern ʽAin Fatir, E of Beit el-Jemal and about one mile (1.6 kilometers) NW of Zanoah. There two fountains are to be found, one in the city and one in the valley. Umm Jina, which lies SW of Beth-shemesh has been suggested by some as the site, but it is less probable, as no fountain is found there.
2. A city located in the tribe of Issachar’s inheritance. (Josh. 19:17, 21) It may be the city that Josephus called Ginaea. Today it is identified with Jenin, a village on the S edge of the valley plain of Megiddo, or Esdraelon, lying ten miles (16 kilometers) SE of Megiddo and five miles (8 kilometers) NE of Dothan, on the main road from Jerusalem to Nazareth. Jenin is surrounded by orchards and gardens and has a spring, which characteristics would harmonize with the meaning of the name En-gannim.
En-gannim, with its pasture ground, was allotted to the sons of Gershon as a Levitical city. (Josh. 21:27-29) In 1 Chronicles 6:73 it is evidently called Anem.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site “north of Damascus” to which Abraham pursued the defeated armies under Chedorlaomer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:13-1:14:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 14:13-17</a>) The Biblical location is associated by certain scholars with Hoba, a spring on the road between Palmyra and Damascus, where at least the ancient name appears to be preserved. Hoba, like other large springs near the desert, may have once had a village standing nearby.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-tapʹpu·ah) [house or place of apples].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the hill country near Hebron and part of Judah’s territorial inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:20-6:15:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:48-6:15:48" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 48,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:53-6:15:53" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 53</a>) Some suggest it received its name from the Judean named Tappuah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:42-13:2:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:42, 43</a>); however, it is also possible that Beth-tappuah (place of apples) was named from the apples that likely once grew there in abundance. It is identified today with modern Taffuh, four miles (6 kilometers) W-NW of Hebron, on a hill even today fruitful with olive trees and vineyards.—For information regarding TAPPUAH in the Shephelah of Judah and TAPPUAH and EN-TAPPUAH on the boundary of Ephraim and Manasseh, see those subjects.</p>

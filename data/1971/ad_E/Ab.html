<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The postexilic name of the fifth lunar month of the Jewish sacred calendar, but the eleventh of the secular calendar. It corresponds to part of July and part of August. The meaning of the name “Ab” is uncertain. In the Bible it is mentioned, not directly by name, but only as the “fifth month.” The name does appear, however, in the Jewish Talmud and their postexilic writings.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Ab was a month of summer heat, a time when the olives ripened on the trees in the lowlands of Palestine.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It was on the first day of Ab that Aaron died on Mount Hor.

According to Josephus (<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book VI, chap. IV, pars. 5 and 8), Herod’s temple was burned by the Romans on the tenth day of the fifth month (70 C.E.), and Josephus makes note of the precise correspondency of this date with the burning of the first temple on the same day by the Babylonians.</p>

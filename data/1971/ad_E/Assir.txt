ASSIR
(Asʹsir) [prisoner, captive].
1. A Levite born in Egypt who was one of the sons of Korah.—Ex. 6:24; 1 Chron. 6:22.
2. 1 Chronicles 6:23, 37 appears to indicate a second Assir as a son or descendant of Ebiasaph.
The Authorized Version uses the name Assir at 1 Chronicles 3:17; however, many modern translations (AS, AT, Mo, NW, Ro, RS) view the Hebrew word here, not as a proper name, but, rather, as a common adjective descriptive of Jeconiah (or, Jehoiachin) as a captive or prisoner in Babylon. (2 Ki. 24:12-15; 25:27-30) The New World Translation fittingly reads: “And the sons of Jeconiah as prisoner [ʼas·sirʹ] were Shealtiel . . .”

JOTBATHAH
(Jotʹba·thah) [possibly, pleasantness or goodness].
A well-watered wilderness encampment of the Israelites. (Num. 33:33, 34; Deut. 10:7) Its exact location cannot be determined. However, ʽAin Tabah, located in a swampy depression about twenty-four miles (c. 39 kilometers) N of Ezion-geber, has been suggested as a possible identification.

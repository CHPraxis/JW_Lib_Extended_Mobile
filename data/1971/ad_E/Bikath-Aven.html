<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Bikʹath-aʹven) [valley of idolatry or wickedness].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place or valley plain associated with Damascus and Beth-eden in Jehovah’s prophecy through Amos foretelling the exile of the people of Syria. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:5-30:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 1:5</a>) In the absence of any record of a Syrian city or town by that name, many authorities connect Bikath-aven with el-Biqaʽ, the valley between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon. This valley has a history of idolatrous Baal worship so that the meaning of the name Bikath-aven would aptly describe it. The predicted ‘cutting-off’ of the inhabitants of Bikath-aven evidently came about as a result of Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III’s conquest of Syria.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:9-12:16:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 16:9, 10</a>.</p>

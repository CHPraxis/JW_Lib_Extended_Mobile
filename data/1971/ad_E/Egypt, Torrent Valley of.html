<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A long wadi (or ravine) marking the God-ordained southwestern boundary of the Promised Land, that is, the “land of Canaan.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:2-4:34:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 34:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:5-4:34:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:65-11:8:65" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:65;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:12-23:27:12" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Isa. 27:12</a>) While this torrent valley was not actually in Egypt, that nation’s domain apparently extended, at least in certain periods, up to that point. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:7-12:24:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:7</a>) The abbreviated expression “the torrent valley,” used in defining the borders of the land of Israel in Ezekiel’s <span id="page500" class="pageNum" data-no="500" data-before-text="500"></span>vision, apparently refers to this same ravine.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:19-26:47:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:28-26:48:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 48:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The torrent valley of Egypt is usually identified with Wadi el-ʽArish, which starts about 135 miles (217.2 kilometers) inland on the Sinai Peninsula, near Jebel et-Tih. It runs N until meeting the Mediterranean Sea at the town of el-ʽArish (Rhinocolura), ninety miles (144.8 kilometers) E of Port Said. In the summer it is nothing more than a dry bed. During the rainy season, however, when numerous tributaries pour into it, the Wadi el-ʽArish becomes a swollen torrent that tears at its banks, uprooting and sweeping even trees down in its turbulent course. This might allow for its identification as “the <em>river</em> of Egypt” in the boundary listing of the Promised Land at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 15:18</a>. See, however, SHIHOR.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shoʹa).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A people or an area named along with Pekod and Koa as providing military forces that Jehovah would bring against unfaithful Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:4-26:23:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 23:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:22-26:23:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22, 23</a>) Though uncertain, “Shoa” perhaps designates the ancient <em>Sutu</em> (or <em>Su</em>), a people mentioned in inscriptions along with the <em>Kutu</em> (Koa?) as fighting the Assyrians. The Tell el-Amarna tablets indicate that the <em>Sutu</em> lived as nomads in the Syrian desert E of Palestine. Later they apparently settled E of the Tigris River.</p>

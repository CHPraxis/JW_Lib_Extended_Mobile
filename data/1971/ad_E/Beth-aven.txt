BETH-AVEN
(Beth-aʹven) [house of nothingness or idolatry].
1. A town in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, close by the ancient city of Ai. (Josh. 7:2; 18:11, 12) It was in the wilderness, located E of Bethel and W of Michmash, and became involved in an outstanding battle when Saul and Jonathan routed the Philistines from this latter city.—1 Sam. 13:5; 14:23.
2. In lamenting the idolatrous conditions to which Israel had turned in his time, the prophet Hosea mentions Beth-aven together with Gibeah and Ramah, other prominent cities of Benjamin. (Hos. 4:15; 5:8; 10:5, 8) However, it appears that the prophet does not refer to the original town of Beth-aven, but, rather, applies the name in a derogatory sense to the city of Bethel, which at one time had been a ‘house of God’ but had now become a ‘house of idolatry’ due to the calf worship instituted there.—1 Ki. 12:28-30.

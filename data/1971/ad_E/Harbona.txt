HARBONA
(Har·boʹna) [donkey driver].
One of Ahasuerus’ seven court officials sent to convey to Queen Vashti the king’s word for her to appear before him. Then, at the time that Haman’s scheme to exterminate the Jews was exposed, Harbona’s mentioning the fifty-cubit stake Haman had made for Mordecai prompted Ahasuerus to order that Haman himself be hanged on it.—Esther 1:10-12; 7:9, 10.

LAISHAH
(Laʹi·shah) [lion].
A town in the territory of Benjamin identified by F.-M. Abel (Géographie de la Palestine, Vol. II, p. 368) with modern el-ʽIsawiyeh, about one mile (1.6 kilometers) NE of Jerusalem. Isaiah’s prophetic foreview of the rampaging Assyrian, as he advances village by village, calls on Laishah to “pay attention” to the coming attack.—Isa. 10:30.

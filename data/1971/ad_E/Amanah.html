<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This name appears in the Hebrew at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:8-22:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> in connection with Lebanon and Mount Hermon. Most translations simply transliterate the Hebrew word; however, lexicographers Koehler and Baumgartner understand it to refer to the Anti-Lebanon range while Brown, Driver and Briggs apply it to that portion of the Anti-Lebanons in which the Nahr Barada has its source.—See ANTI-LEBANON.</p>

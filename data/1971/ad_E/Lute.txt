LUTE
The Hebrew word sha·lishʹ seems to be related to a root signifying “three.” Hence, the plural form sha·li·shimʹ at 1 Samuel 18:6 has been variously translated as “instruments of three strings” (Ro), “three-stringed instruments” (Yg) and, as favored by some modern lexicons, “lutes.” (NW) The context of this verse suggests a comparatively light musical instrument, for it was played by Israelite women as they sang and danced in celebration of the victories of King Saul and of David.—1 Sam. 18:6, 7.

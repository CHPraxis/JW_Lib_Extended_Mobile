MILE
[Gr., miʹli·on].
A measure of distance. (Matt. 5:41) In the Scriptures the measure in question is probably the Roman mile (5,000 Roman feet; 4,860 English feet; 1,481 meters). At Luke 24:13; John 6:19; 11:18 the word miʹli·on does not appear in the Greek text, but the distance figures are given in terms of stadia (1 Roman stadium = 1/8 Roman mile or 625 Roman feet; 607 English feet, 185 meters). In the New World Translation the stadia figures at Luke 24:13; John 6:19; 11:18 have been converted to Roman miles. For example, “sixty stadia” is given as “seven and a half miles” (about 7 English miles or 11 kilometers).—Luke 24:13.

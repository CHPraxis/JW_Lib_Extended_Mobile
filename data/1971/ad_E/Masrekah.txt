MASREKAH
(Mas·reʹkah) [possibly, vineyard].
Apparently the home of Samlah, an Edomite king. (Gen. 36:31, 36; 1 Chron. 1:43, 47) The name “Masrekah” may be preserved in the mountain that the Arabs call Jebel el-Mushraq, located about thirty-two miles (51 kilometers) SW of Maʽan. Eusebius placed Masrekah farther N, nearer the Dead Sea.

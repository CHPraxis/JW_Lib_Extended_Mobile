JUSTUS
(Jusʹtus) [just].
1. The surname of Joseph Barsabbas. Justus and Matthias were the two candidates suggested as possible replacements for Judas Iscariot as an apostle. The lot fell to Matthias. Even though Justus was not chosen, his being considered for the office shows he was a mature disciple of Jesus Christ.—Acts 1:23-26.
2. A Corinthian believer whose home adjoined the synagogue. Due to Jewish opposition, Paul “transferred” to the house of Titius Justus, that is, he continued his preaching there; his residence remained with Aquila and Priscilla.—Acts 18:1-7.
3. A Jewish fellow worker of the apostle Paul. Justus, also called Jesus, was one of those who strengthened Paul during his first imprisonment in Rome, and sent along his greetings to the Colossians.—Col. 4:10, 11.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Nisʹroch).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A deity worshiped by Sennacherib the king of Assyria. It was in the temple of Nisroch that Adrammelech and Sharezer murdered their father Sennacherib. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:36-12:19:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:36, 37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:38-23:37:38" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:38</a>) Certain identification of Nisroch with a known Assyrian deity is not possible. A number of authorities suggest identifying Nisroch with the fire-god Nusku, who, it was thought, assisted in bringing defeat to the enemy in warfare and served as messenger of the gods as well as a dispenser of justice.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ishʹtob) [man of Tob (good)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the small kingdoms that provided fighting men for the sons of Ammon to use against David. The forces from “Ishtob” and their allies were defeated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:1-10:10:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel chapter 10</a>, <em>AT, AV, NW, Yg</em>) Most translators and geographers consider that Ishtob should be rendered “men of Tob,” referring to “the land of Tob” where Jephthah resided. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:3-7:11:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 11:3-11</a>; see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:6-10:10:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 10:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:8-10:10:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>, <em>AS, JB, JP, RS</em>.) However, the reading “Ishtob” has the support of certain ancient versions. (Compare Bagster’s <em>LX</em>X [translated from Greek]; <em>La</em> [from Syriac]; and <em>Dy</em> [from Latin].) The location of an ancient Ishtob is not now known.—See TOB.</p>

ARCHIPPUS
(Ar·chipʹpus) [master of the horse].
In his letter to the Colossian Christians Paul exhorts Archippus to faithfulness in the ministry, and in his letter to Philemon affectionately refers to him as a “fellow soldier.” (Col. 4:17; Philem. 2) Both letters, written near the end of Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome (c. 60-61 C.E.), indicate that Archippus was then living in or near Colossae in Asia Minor.

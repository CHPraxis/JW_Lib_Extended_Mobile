ISAIAH, BOOK OF
The book of Isaiah outstandingly magnifies Jehovah as “the Holy One of Israel,” applying this expression to him a total of twenty-five times. Also, it points with unmistakable clarity to the Messiah or Anointed One of Jehovah through whom deliverance would come to the people of God.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Isaiah 1:1 informs us that Isaiah visioned these things in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. This was a period of severe international tension and one in which false religious attitudes had a profound effect on the people of Judah. Near the beginning of Isaiah’s career King Uzziah died a leper because of his presumptuousness in taking over priestly duties. (2 Chron. 26:16, 19-21) During the reign of his son Jotham it is reported that, while the king did what was right, “the people were yet acting ruinously.”—2 Chron. 27:2; 2 Ki. 15:34.
Next Came King Ahaz, who for sixteen years set a bad example for the nation, carrying on Baal worship with its rites of human sacrifice. There was “great unfaithfulness toward Jehovah.” (2 Chron. 28:1-4, 19) It was at this time that the allied kings of Syria and Israel besieged Jerusalem so that Ahaz, ignoring the counsel of Isaiah the prophet, sent to Tiglath-pileser III, the king of Assyria, for military assistance. (2 Ki. 16:5-8; Isa. 7:1-12) By this Ahaz ‘made flesh his arm, his heart turning away from Jehovah.’ (Jer. 17:5) Assyria agreed to an alliance, but, of course, was interested mainly in expanding its own power. The Assyrian army captured Damascus of Syria and apparently took into exile the inhabitants of the trans-Jordanic territory of religiously apostate Israel.—1 Chron. 5:26.
Later, when Samaria failed to pay tribute, it too was besieged and its inhabitants were deported. (2 Ki. 16:9; 17:4-6; 18:9-12) This ended the ten-tribe kingdom and left Judah surrounded on all sides by Gentile nations. Later Assyrian rulers kept up military operations in the W, assaulting cities of Judah and of surrounding nations. Sennacherib even demanded the capitulation of Jerusalem itself. But under the kingship of Hezekiah the situation there had changed. Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah, and Jehovah proved to be with him.—2 Ki. 18:5-7; Isa. chaps. 36, 37.
Uzziah, during whose rule Isaiah entered upon his prophetic service, began to reign in 829 B.C.E. and Hezekiah concluded his reign by 716 B.C.E. However, the years of Isaiah’s service as prophet were likely shorter than that. Isaiah, chapter 6, verse 1, refers to “the year that King Uzziah died” (777 B.C.E.) as the time when Isaiah received the commission from Jehovah that is recorded in that chapter; though it may be that he had recorded the preceding information before that. Then in chapter 36, verse 1, reference is made to “the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah” (732/731 B.C.E.). How long it was after that until Isaiah had completed his writing we do not know, though it could well have been shortly thereafter.
There are also a few other references that help to date the contents of specific portions of the book of Isaiah. For example, chapter 7, verse 1, says that Pekah the king of Israel came against Jerusalem to war in the days of King Ahaz. Although Ahaz ruled from about 762 to about 746 B.C.E., Pekah’s kingship ended by about 758 B.C.E.; so the incident must have occurred before that year. Further, Isaiah 14:28 dates a pronouncement concerning Philistia “in the year that King Ahaz died,” which would be about 746 B.C.E. These references assist in fixing the events in the book of Isaiah in the stream of time.
UNITY OF WRITERSHIP
In modern times certain Bible critics have contended that the book of Isaiah was not all written by Isaiah. Some claim that chapters 40 through 66 were written by an unidentified person who lived about the time of the end of the Jews’ Babylonian captivity. Other critics pare off additional portions of the book, theorizing that someone other than Isaiah must have written them. But the Bible itself does not agree with these contentions.
Inspired writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures credited both the material now designated chapters 1-39 and that numbered chapters 40-66 to “Isaiah the prophet.” They never intimated that there were two persons who bore this name or that the name of the writer of part of the book was unknown. (For examples, compare Matthew 3:3 and 4:14-16 with Isaiah 40:3 and 9:1, 2; also John 12:38-41 with Isaiah 53:1 and 6:1, 10.) In addition to this, there are numerous other places where the Christian Greek Scripture writers specifically credit material quoted from the latter part of the book of Isaiah, not to an unidentified writer, but to “Isaiah the prophet.” (Compare Matthew 12:17-21 with Isaiah 42:1-4; Romans 10:16 with Isaiah 53:1.) Jesus Christ himself, when he read from “the scroll of the prophet Isaiah” at the synagogue in Nazareth, was reading from Isaiah 61:1, 2.—Luke 4:17-19.
Furthermore, the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah (believed to date from the first or second century B.C.E.) contains evidence that the copyist who penned it knew nothing of any supposed division in the prophecy at the close of chapter 39. He began the fortieth chapter on the last line of the column of writing that contains chapter 39.
The entire book of Isaiah has been passed down through the centuries as a single work, not as two or more. The continuity from chapter 39 to chapter 40 is evident in what is recorded at Isaiah 39:6, 7, which is an obvious transition to what follows, paving the way for the prophecies of the period of Babylonian judgment.
Those who would credit the book to more than one writer do not feel that it was possible for Isaiah to have foretold nearly two centuries in advance that a ruler named Cyrus would liberate the captive Jews; consequently they speculate that this was written at a later time, at least after Cyrus began his conquests. (Isa. 44:28; 45:1) But they fail to grasp the import of this entire portion of the book, because the material specifically deals with foreknowledge, with the ability of God to tell in advance what would happen to his people. This prophecy recorded nearly two hundred years in advance the name of one not yet born who would conquer Babylon and liberate the Jews. Its fulfillment would definitely prove that it was of divine origin. It was not Isaiah’s estimate of the future, but, as he himself wrote, “this is what Jehovah has said.” (Isa. 45:1) Ascribing the writing of this portion of Isaiah to a writer in Cyrus’ time would still not solve the problem for the critics. Why not? Because this portion of the book also foretold in detail events in the earthly life and ministry of the Messiah, Jesus Christ—things even farther in the future. The fulfillment of these prophecies seals the prophecy of Isaiah as divinely inspired and not a collection of the works of impostors.
Those who deny that Isaiah wrote chapters 40 through 66 usually, for like reasons, deny that he wrote chapter 13, concerning the fall of Babylon. Yet chapter 13 is introduced with the words: “The pronouncement against Babylon that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw in vision.” Obviously, this is the same “Isaiah the son of Amoz” whose name appears in the opening verse of chapter 1.
INTERRELATION WITH OTHER PORTIONS OF THE BIBLE
The writings of Isaiah are extensively interwoven with many other parts of the Bible. A century or more after Isaiah’s time Jeremiah wrote the record found in the books of Kings, and it is interesting to observe that what is recorded at 2 Kings 18:13 to 20:19 is essentially the same as that found in Isaiah chapters 36 to 39. Not only do other prophets cover matters similar to those considered by Isaiah, but there are numerous specific references made to the writings of Isaiah themselves by other Bible writers.
Among the most outstanding and most frequently quoted prophecies from the book of Isaiah are those foretelling details concerning the Messiah. Many of these are specifically quoted and applied by the inspired writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Isaiah 7:14, for example, prophesied his birth from a maiden, a virgin girl. (Matt. 1:23) It was foretold that he would be born in the family line of David the son of Jesse (Isa. 9:7; 11:1, 10; Luke 1:32, 33; Rom. 15:8, 12); that someone would call out in the wilderness, preparing the way before this representative of Jehovah. (Isa. 40:3; Mark 1:1-4) His commission was recorded at Isaiah 61:1, 2 (Luke 4:17-21), and it was foretold that as a result of his ministry people in Galilee would see a great light. (Isa. 9:1, 2; Matt. 4:13-16) It was prophesied that he would carry our sicknesses (Isa. 53:4; Matt. 8:16, 17); that he would not be believed in (Isa. 53:1; John 12:37, 38); that he would not wrangle in the streets (Isa. 42:1-4; Matt. 12:14-21); that he would be rejected, a stone of stumbling, but would become the chief cornerstone (Isa. 8:14, 15; 28:16; 1 Pet. 2:6-8); that he would be silent before his accusers, though struck and condemned (Isa. 50:6; 53:7, 8; John 19:3, 9; Mark 14:53-65; 15:1-15); that he would be numbered with transgressors (Isa. 53:12; Matt. 26:55, 56; 27:38); that he would die a sacrificial death to carry away sins and open the way for many to a righteous standing with God (Isa. 53:5, 8, 11, 12; Rom. 4:25), and would be buried with the rich. (Isa. 53:9; Matt. 27:57-60; John 19:38-42) It is of interest to observe that Jesus Christ and his apostles quoted most frequently from Isaiah to make clear the identification of the Messiah.
This is by no means the full extent to which other inspired Bible writers quoted from the prophecy of Isaiah, but it highlights some of the prophecies for which Isaiah is most widely noted. These prophecies, along with all the rest of the book, magnify Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, as the One who provides this salvation for his people through his anointed Son.
SYNOPSIS OF THE BOOK
The very first verse of the book of Isaiah identifies its contents as “the vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz that he visioned concerning Judah and Jerusalem.” So, although the book contains prophetic utterances concerning many nations, they are not to be viewed as a collection of disconnected pronouncements concerning these nations. Rather, these are a series of prophecies that had a direct effect on Judah and Jerusalem.
The first six chapters highlight Judah’s guilt before Jehovah and Isaiah’s commission from Jehovah to preach. Chapters 7-12 tell of threatened enemy invasions and promise of lasting relief through the Prince of Peace, the heir of the throne of David. Chapters 13-23 focus attention on the nations surrounding Judah and tell of divine pronouncements of desolations upon them. Chapters 24-35 forecast the salvation to come from Jehovah. Chapters 36-39 relate the deliverance Jehovah actually provides for his faithful people from Assyrian invaders. Chapters 40-66 tell of the release from Babylonian captivity of Jewish exiles and the restoration of Zion.

DODO
(Doʹdo) [his beloved].
1. An ancestor, probably the grandfather, of Judge Tola of the tribe of Issachar.—Judg. 10:1.
2. A descendant of Benjamin through Ahohi. Dodo’s son Eleazar was one of David’s three mighty men. (2 Sam. 23:9; 1 Chron. 11:12) Dodai (an alternate form of Dodo) served, perhaps in a representative sense through his son Eleazar, as chief of the army division of the second month.—1 Chron. 27:4.
3. A resident of Bethlehem whose son Elhanan was one of David’s mighty men.—2 Sam. 23:24; 1 Chron. 11:26.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Eʹther) [riches; fullness; abundance; or perhaps, (place of) prayer].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city of the Shephelah in the territory of Judah, but allotted to Simeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:33-6:15:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:42-6:15:42" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:1-6:19:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 19:1-9</a>) Today it is generally identified with Khirbet el-ʽAter, about one mile (1.6 kilometers) NW of Beit Jibrin (Eleutheropolis). The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:7-6:19:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 19:7</a> is nearly parallel with that of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:32-13:4:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 4:32</a> and in this latter text Ether appears to be referred to as Tochen.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some reference works consider that there were two Ethers, that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:42-6:15:42" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 15:42</a> being located between Libnah and Mareshah (at Khirbet el-ʽAter, above mentioned), and the other, referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:7-6:19:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 19:7</a>, being situated near Ziklag to the S. While the other towns referred to in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:7-6:19:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Joshua 19:7</a> are all in the S and many of those at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:42-6:15:42" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 15:42</a> are more to the N, it may be noted, nevertheless, that in both texts the town of Ashan is mentioned, so that any clear division becomes difficult.</p>

MADON
(Maʹdon [contention, strife].
A royal Canaanite city that leagued itself with Hazor against the Israelites and was subsequently defeated. (Josh. 11:1-12; 12:19) Madon is usually identified with Qarn Hattin, about five and a half miles (9 kilometers) NW of Tiberias. Khirbet Madin, about half a mile (.8 kilometer) to the S, seems to preserve the ancient name “Madon.” However, some geographers question the identification.

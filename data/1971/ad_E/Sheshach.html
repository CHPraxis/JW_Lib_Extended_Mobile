<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Probably a symbolic name for Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:26-24:25:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 25:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:41-24:51:41" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 51:41</a>) One suggestion is that “Sheshach” means “copper-gated,” and this would fit Babylon. Still another view is that “Sheshach” stood for <em>SiskuKI</em> of an old Babylonian royal register. <em>Sisku</em> or <em>Siska</em> may have been a district of ancient Babylon. Jewish tradition, however, has it that Sheshach is a cipher for the Hebrew name Babel (or, Babylon), by the device known as “athbash.” According to this cryptographical system, the true name is disguised by replacing the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet (<em>taw</em>) with the first (<em>ʼaʹleph</em>), and the second-last letter (<em>shin</em>) with the second (<em>behth</em>), and so on. Consequently, in “Babel” each <em>behth</em> (b) would be changed to <em>shin</em> (sh), and the <em>laʹmedh</em> (l) to <em>kaph</em> (kh), thus becoming <em>She·shakhʹ.</em> The name “Sheshach” may also imply humiliation, for which Babylon was due.</p>

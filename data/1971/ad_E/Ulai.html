<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Uʹlai).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “watercourse” flowing through or near Shushan (Susa) in Elam. Along the Ulai, Daniel received the vision of the ram and the he-goat. It cannot be determined whether the prophet actually went there from Babylon or was transported to that location in a visionary way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:1-27:8:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 8:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:6-27:8:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:16-27:8:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 16</a>) Conjectures about the Ulai vary considerably, and identification is difficult because rivers in the vicinity seem to have changed course somewhat through the centuries. One view is that the Ulai is the Kerkha River. According to another, it was an artificial canal to the N or NE of Shushan connecting the Kerkha and Abdizful Rivers.</p>

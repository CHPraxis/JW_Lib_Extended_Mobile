IR-NAHASH
(Ir-naʹhash) [city of Nahash (serpent)].
Seemingly a place ‘fathered’ or ‘founded’ by the Judean Tehinnah. (1 Chron. 4:1, 12; for a comparable example, see ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) The exact location of Ir-nahash is uncertain. Some geographers favor as a possible identification Deir Nahhas, about twelve miles (19 kilometers) NW of Hebron.

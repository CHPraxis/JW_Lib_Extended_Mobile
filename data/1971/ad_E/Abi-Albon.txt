ABI-ALBON
(Aʹbi-alʹbon) [father of strength, valiant].
A Benjamite and an outstanding warrior listed among thirty-seven of King David’s most valiant fighters. (2 Sam. 23:31) He is evidently the Abiel referred to in a parallel passage at 1 Chronicles 11:32. He is called “the Arbathite,” perhaps because of coming from the city of Beth-arabah, which lay near the frontier between Benjamin and Judah above the northern end of the Dead Sea. (Josh. 15:6; 18:18, 21, 22) His fighting valor was in accord with Jacob’s deathbed prophecy concerning the tribe of Benjamin.—Gen. 49:27.

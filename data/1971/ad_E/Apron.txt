APRON
The Greek word si·mi·kinʹthi·on denotes a thing girded around half the body, a half-girding and a narrow covering. (Acts 19:12) It seems to have been tied around the waist to cover part of the body for a distance below the waist. It may have been worn to protect other garments, perhaps by tradesmen such as fishermen, potters, water carriers, grocers, bakers, carpenters, craftsmen, and so forth. The ephod of the priests was considerably different, being an apronlike garment that hung from the shoulders, having front and back sections.—Ex. 28:6-8; see HIGH PRIEST.

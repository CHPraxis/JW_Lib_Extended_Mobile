BAASHA
(Baʹa·sha) [bold; offensive].
Third king of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel; son of Ahijah of the tribe of Issachar and of insignificant background. He usurped the throne by killing his predecessor Nadab, after which he struck down the entire house of Jeroboam, as had been prophesied. (1 Ki. 15:27-30; 14:10) Baasha, however, continued Jeroboam’s calf worship, and for this his own house also was promised extermination. (1 Ki. 16:1-4) When he waged war against Judah, Asa induced the king of Syria to harass Baasha from the N. The fortified city of Ramah, which Bassha was building, Asa then razed. (1 Ki. 15:16-22; 2 Chron. 16:1-6) After having ruled twenty-four years (975-952 B.C.E.), Baasha died and was buried in his capital, Tirzah. His son Elah succeeded him, but in two years Zimri rebelled and wiped out Baasha’s house, fulfilling Jehovah’s decree.—1 Ki. 16:6-13.

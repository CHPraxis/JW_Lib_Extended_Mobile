JOKMEAM
(Jokʹme·am) [let the people arise].
1. An Ephraimite city given to the Kohathites. (1 Chron. 6:66, 68) At Joshua 21:22 Jokmeam is evidently called “Kibzaim,” perhaps another or earlier name for the same site. Its location is today unknown.
2. A region bordering on the territory under the jurisdiction of Ahilud’s son Baana, one of Solomon’s twelve deputies. (1 Ki. 4:12) It is apparently the same as Jokneam.—See JOKNEAM.

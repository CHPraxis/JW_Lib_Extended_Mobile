MANAHATH
(Manʹa·hath) [possibly, resting-place, settlement].
1. A descendant of Seir through Shobal.—Gen. 36:20, 23; 1 Chron. 1:38, 40.
2. A site to which certain “sons of Ehud” inhabiting Geba were exiled at an unspecified time. (1 Chron. 8:6) Geographers commonly suggest as a possible identification modern Malha, over two miles (3 kilometers) SW of Jerusalem.

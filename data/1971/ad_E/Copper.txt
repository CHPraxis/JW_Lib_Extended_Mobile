COPPER
(Brass, Bronze).
A soft metal easily beaten and shaped into many forms. There is no evidence that the ancients had a secret method for hardening pure copper by tempering, but they knew how to harden the cutting edge of tools simply by cold hammering. When alloyed with other metals hardness is greatly increased. One such alloy is bronze, copper containing tin (ancient findings having from 2 to 18 percent tin). Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. (1 Cor. 13:1) In the Authorized Version the words “brass” and “steel” are usually mistranslations for “copper” or “bronze.”
Copper in the free state was not plentiful; metal-bearing ores consisting of oxides, carbonates or sulfides had to be smelted to release the metallic copper. Copper mines have been located in the Wadi Arabah, that arid part of the Rift Valley that extends S from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqabah at the eastern head of the Red Sea. (Job 28:2-4) Solomon exploited the copper deposits near Succoth in Palestine proper, which deposits Moses anticipated in describing the Promised Land. (Deut. 8:9) There large castings were made in clay molds. (1 Ki. 7:14-46; 2 Chron. 4:1-18) Copper was found in abundance on Cyprus. The Bible also speaks of Javan, Tubal and Meshech as sources of copper.—Ezek. 27:13.
Copper and its alloys had many varied and practical uses. It being one of the oldest metals known, Tubal-cain prior to the Noachian flood forged tools out of copper. (Gen. 4:22) Household and sanctuary utensils included pots, basins, pans, shovels and forks. (Ex. 38:3; Lev. 6:28; Jer. 52:18) Copper was used for doors, gates, pillars and musical instruments (2 Ki. 25:13; 1 Chron. 15:19; Ps. 107:16; Isa. 45:2); armor, shields, weapons and fetters. (1 Sam. 17:5, 6, 38; 2 Sam. 22:35; 2 Ki. 25:7; 2 Chron. 12:10) The metal was also used in the making of idols. (Rev. 9:20) Copper coins were in circulation in Jesus’ day. (Matt. 10:9) The Scriptures also speak of copper in a figurative or symbolic sense.—Lev. 26:19; Job 6:12; Isa. 48:4; 60:17; Jer. 1:18; Ezek. 1:7; Dan. 2:32; Rev. 1:15; 2:18.

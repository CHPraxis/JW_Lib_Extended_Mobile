HORONITE
(Horʹo·nite).
A designation applied to Sanballat, one of the men opposing the work of Nehemiah. (Neh. 2:10, 19) Some scholars think that Sanballat may have been from the Moabite city of Horonaim (Isa. 15:5; Jer. 48:3) and, in support of this, call attention to his being mentioned with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arabian. But the view generally favored is that “Horonite” probably means a native or inhabitant of Beth-horon. Both Upper and Lower Beth-horon were located in territory originally assigned to Ephraim.—Josh. 16:1, 3, 5.

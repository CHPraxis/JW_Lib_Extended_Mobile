KANAH
(Kaʹnah) [reed].
1. A torrent valley that served as a boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh. (Josh. 16:8; 17:9) Today it is usually linked with the Wadi Qanah. This small stream rises in the hill country a few miles SW of Nablus (thought to be ancient Shechem) and, as the Wadi Ishkar, flows in a southwesterly direction and then joins the Yarkon River, which empties into the Mediterranean Sea N of Tel Aviv. However, some scholars believe that in Joshua’s day the lower course of the Wadi Qanah perhaps flowed directly into the Mediterranean at a point about eight miles (13 kilometers) farther N.
2. A boundary city of Asher. (Josh. 19:24, 28) It is generally identified with modern Qana, about seven and a half miles (12 kilometers) SE of Tyre.

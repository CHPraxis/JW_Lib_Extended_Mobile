TIBERIAS
(Ti·beʹri·as).
1. A city built by Herod Antipas about 21 C.E. and named after Tiberius Caesar, emperor of the Roman Empire at the time. It was situated about fifteen air miles (24 kilometers) NE of Nazareth, on a comparatively narrow strip along the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, 680 feet (207 meters) below the level of the Mediterranean. Tiberias was some eleven miles (18 kilometers) around the sea from Capernaum and six miles (10 kilometers) above where the Jordan leaves that body of water. Here Herod as the tetrarch made his residence. Nearby, to the S of the city, were famous warm springs. The city is mentioned only once in the Scriptures.—John 6:23.
2. The Sea of Galilee was sometimes called Tiberias, after the city by that name located on its western shore.—John 6:1; 21:1.

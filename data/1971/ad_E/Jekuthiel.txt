JEKUTHIEL
(Je·kuʹthi·el) [perhaps, may God nourish].
A descendant of Judah and “father of Zanoah.” (1 Chron. 4:1, 18) Zanoah is the name of a city rather than a person in its other occurrence (Josh. 15:56, 57), so Jekuthiel as its ‘father’ was likely the father of those who settled there, or was himself its founder or chief settler.—See ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.

AMNON
(Amʹnon) [faithful].
1. David’s firstborn son by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, born at Hebron. (2 Sam. 3:2; 1 Chron. 3:1) Amnon developed a passionate desire for lovely Tamar, Absalom’s sister, to the point of lovesickness. Following the advice of his cousin Jehonadab, Amnon feigned illness and induced King David to send Tamar to Amnon’s private quarters to prepare “bread of consolation” in his presence. He then used the opportunity forcibly to violate his half sister, despite her pleading and reasoning with him. His case illustrates how extremely selfish erotic love can be, for, having satisfied his desire, Amnon then had Tamar put out into the street as someone repugnant to him, someone whose very presence doubtless made him feel unclean.—2 Sam. 13:1-19.
Tamar’s full brother, Absalom, nursed a hatred of Amnon for this act and two years later at a sheepshearing festival Absalom had his servants murder Amnon when he was “in a merry mood with wine.” (2 Sam. 13:20-29) Since Amnon, as David’s eldest son, was heir apparent to the throne, his death may also have been viewed as desirable by Absalom to better thereby his possibilities of gaining the kingship. With this event the prophecy made by Nathan following David’s own misconduct with the wife of Uriah began to undergo fulfillment.—2 Sam. 12:10; see ABSALOM.
2. The first in the list of four sons of Shimon, of the tribe of Judah.—1 Chron. 4:1, 20.

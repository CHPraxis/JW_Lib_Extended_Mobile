MECHERATHITE
(Me·cheʹrath·ite) [dweller in Mecherah].
A term pertaining to a person or place named Mecherah, to which Hepher, one of David’s mighty men, was linked either by descent or former residence. (1 Chron. 11:26, 36) Some scholars suggest that “Mecherathite” may be a variation of “Maacathite,” as at 2 Samuel 23:34.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">or, as commonly anglicized, yodh [י]. The tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, later also used, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, to represent the number ten.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Yohdh</em> is equivalent to the English “y,” at the beginning of a syllable. Otherwise, it usually corresponds to the English letter “i.” It is the smallest of the Hebrew letters. The name of the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet, <em>i·oʹta,</em> evidently is akin to the Hebrew <em>yohdh.</em> Since the law of Moses was originally written and subsequently preserved in Hebrew, it is likely that Jesus was referring back to the Hebrew <em>yohdh</em> when he said that “the smallest letter [Gr., <em>i·oʹta</em>]” would not pass away without its due fulfillment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:18-40:5:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:18</a>) This letter occurs as the initial letter in the Tetragrammaton or sacred name Jehovah (reading from right to left: יהוה)and as such was carried over into the earliest copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em>. A papyrus fragment of the third century C.E. (P. Oxyrhynchus vii. 1007) containing a portion of the <em>Septuagint</em> translation of Genesis abbreviates the Tetragrammaton by having its first letter doubled, a doubled <em>yohdh.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Due to the similarity between the letters <em>yohdh</em> (י) and <em>waw</em> (ו), they were sometimes confused by copyists. In the Hebrew, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:73-19:119:80" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:73-80</a> each verse begins with the letter <em>yohdh.</em></p>

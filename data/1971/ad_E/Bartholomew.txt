BARTHOLOMEW
(Bar·tholʹo·mew) [son of Tolmai].
One of Jesus’ twelve apostles, generally thought to be Nathanael. A comparison of the Gospel accounts shows that Matthew and Luke link Bartholomew and Philip together in the same way that John associates the name Nathanael with Philip. (Matt. 10:3; Luke 6:14; John 1:45, 46) For details on this apostle’s activity, see NATHANAEL.

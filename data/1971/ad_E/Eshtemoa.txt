ESHTEMOA
(Esh·te·moʹa), Eshtemoh [obedience].
1. Son of Ishbah, or, possibly, a Judean town many of whose inhabitants descended from Ishbah.—1 Chron. 4:17.
2. A Maacathite and descendant of Hodiah.—1 Chron. 4:19.
3. A town in the mountainous region of Judah, also called Eshtemoh. Though originally assigned to Judah it was thereafter allotted, along with its pasture grounds, to the Levites. (Josh. 15:50; 21:14; 1 Chron. 6:57) It corresponds with the modern village of es-Semuʽa, situated about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) S of Hebron. Perhaps the same as No. 1.
Eshtemoa was one of the places frequented by David as a fugitive, and, after his victory over the marauding Amalekites, he sent a gift from the spoils to friends there.—1 Sam. 30:26-28.

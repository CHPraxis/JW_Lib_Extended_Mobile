AHLAB
(Ahʹlab) [fat, fruitful].
Identified with modern Khirbet el-Mahalib, about four miles (6.4 kilometers) NE of Tyre, this Canaanite town was located in Asher’s territory. (Judg. 1:31) The tribe, however, failed to drive out the Canaanites, who subsequently continued to inhabit the city. Assyrian inscriptions show it was captured by Sennacherib in his third campaign.

KAIWAN
(Kaiʹwan) [literally, Ki·yunʹ (according to the Masoretic text), this because of being intentionally vowel-pointed to correspond with the Hebrew word shiq·qutsʹ (disgusting thing); same as Rephan].
Apparently a star god, as indicated by the fact that the name “Kaiwan” is put in a parallelism with the “star of your god.” (Amos 5:26) Evidently the Akkadian star kaimanu or kaiwanu is meant, since this occurs in Akkadidan inscriptions as the name of Saturn (a star god). In the Septuagint Version “Kaiwan” is rendered Hrai·phanʹ, presumably the Egyptian designation for Saturn, and in Stephen’s quotation, at Acts 7:43, Hrom·phaʹ appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text.—See ASTROLOGERS.

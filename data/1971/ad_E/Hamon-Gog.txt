HAMON-GOG
(Haʹmon-Gog) [Gogʼs crowd].
The English derivation of the Hebrew name of a valley, evidently symbolic, described as “the valley of those passing through on the east of the [Dead] sea.” In this valley, Gog and all his forces are buried after their destruction by Jehovah.—Ezek. 39:11, 15, NW, 1960 ed., ftns.; see GOG No. 2.

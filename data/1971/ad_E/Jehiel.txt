JEHIEL
(Je·hiʹel) [may God live].
1. A Levite in the second division of musicians that accompanied the ark of the covenant from Obed-edom’s house to Jerusalem. (1 Chron. 15:17, 18, 20, 25, 28) Afterward, Jehiel and others were appointed to play outside the tent in which the Ark rested.—1 Chron. 16:1, 4-6.
2. A Levite descendant of Gershon through Ladan; a “headman.” (1 Chron. 23:6-8) Toward the close of David’s reign, Jehiel(i) and his sons (or the paternal house called by his name) took care of the treasury belonging to Jehovah’s house of worship.—1 Chron. 26:21, 22; 29:8.
3. Caretaker, perhaps an instructor, of David’s sons; a son or descendant of Hachmoni.—1 Chron. 27:32.
4. A son of King Jehoshaphat. Jehiel and his brothers had received gifts of riches and cities from their father, but the kingship was to go to their eldest brother Jehoram. However, after Jehoshaphat died, all these brothers were slain by Jehoram.—2 Chron. 21:1-4, 12, 13.
5. A Levite who helped to dispose of the unclean objects that King Hezekiah had removed from the temple; descendant of Heman. (2 Chron. 29:12, 14-19) Probably the same as No. 6 below.
6. A Levite commissioner appointed to help care for the bounteous contributions that the people brought to the temple during Hezekiah’s reign. (2 Chron. 31:12, 13) Probably the same as No. 5 above.
7. One of three “leaders of the house of the true God” who made generous contributions of animal victims for King Josiah’s great Passover celebration.—2 Chron. 35:8.
8. A member of the paternal house of Joab whose son Obadiah returned with Ezra to Jerusalem.—Ezra 8:1, 9.
9. One whose son acknowledged to Ezra the great error of the people in taking foreign wives; descendant of Elam. (Ezra 10:2) The Jehiel at Ezra 10:26, included in the list of those who sent away their foreign wives and sons (Ezra 10:44), is possibly the same person, or at least another descendant of Elam.
10. One of the priests who had taken foreign wives but sent them away.—Ezra 10:21, 44.

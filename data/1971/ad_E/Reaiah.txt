REAIAH
(Re·aʹiah) [Jehovah has seen].
1. A son of Shobal and descendant of Judah. (1 Chron. 4:1, 2) It may be that Haroeh at 1 Chronicles 2:52 is the same person. The spelling in Hebrew is quite similar.
2. A Reubenite, presumably an ancestor of persons taken into exile by Tiglath-pileser.—1 Chron. 5:5, 6.
3. Forefather of some of the Nethinim who returned to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.—Ezra 2:1, 43, 47; Neh. 7:6, 46, 50.

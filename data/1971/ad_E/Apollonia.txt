APOLLONIA
(Ap·ol·loʹni·a) [pertaining to Apollo, place of Apollo].
A city of Macedonia, named after the Greek sun-god Apollo, as were a number of other cities in the Mediterranean area. It was situated in the district of Mygdonia about thirty miles (48 kilometers) from Amphipolis and thirty-eight miles (61 kilometers) from Thessalonica, or about one day’s travel from each. It lay on the great Roman highway Via Egnatia, S of Lake Bolbe, but does not receive prominence in history. Paul and Silas passed through it on Paul’s second missionary tour, most likely in the spring or early summer of the year 50 C.E.—Acts 17:1.

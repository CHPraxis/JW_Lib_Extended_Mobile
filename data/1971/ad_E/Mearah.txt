MEARAH
(Me·arʹah) [a cave].
A Sidonian city or district that remained to be conquered after Israel’s campaign under Joshua’s leadership ended. (Josh. 13:2, 4) Two locations have been suggested as possible identifications. One is the village of Mogheiriyeh, about six miles (10 kilometers) NE of Sidon. The other is Mughar Jezzin (Arabic for “Caves of Jezzin”), a district of caves atop the Lebanon range and E of Sidon.

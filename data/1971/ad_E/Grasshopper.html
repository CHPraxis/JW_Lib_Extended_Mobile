<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This translates the word <em>hha·gavʹ,</em> but there is uncertainty as to the insect or insects designated by this Hebrew term. It is considered to be derived from a root meaning “to hide, to cover over.” Hence, <em>hha·gavʹ</em> may denote a variety of flying locust whose vast swarms virtually hide the sun and cover the ground. Or, since the fully developed, winged stage of locust (Heb., <em>ʼar·behʹ</em>) is mentioned along with the <em>hha·gavʹ</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:22-3:11:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:22</a> (as being clean for food), <em>hha·gavʹ</em> may refer to a leaper rather than a flier.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The English designation “grasshopper” is applied to any of numerous leaping insects of the families <em>Acridiidae</em> (including the migratory locusts and the grasshoppers having short feelers) and <em>Locustidae</em> (including the grasshoppers with long feelers).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Aside from its being listed as an insect clean for food and the allusion to its destructiveness to vegetation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:7:13-14:7:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 7:13</a>), the grasshopper appears in an illustrative setting in Scripture. The unfaithful Israelite spies reported that in size they were as grasshoppers in comparison with the inhabitants of Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:33-4:13:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 13:33</a>) Men are as grasshoppers from Jehovah’s standpoint and in view of his greatness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) In portraying the difficulties of old age, the congregator employed the figure of a grasshopper dragging itself along, perhaps thereby depicting the aged person as bent and stiff in figure, arms thrust somewhat backward.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:5-21:12:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:5</a>; see LOCUST.</p>

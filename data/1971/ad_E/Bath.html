<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A liquid measure amounting to a tenth of a homer and corresponding to the dry-measure ephah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:10-26:45:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 45:10, 11</a>) On the basis of jar fragments bearing the designation “bath” in ancient Hebrew characters, it has been estimated that the bath measure equaled 5.81 gallons (22 liters). This approximate capacity of the bath would better fit the Bible’s description of the “molten sea” than that of the much larger bath (10.3 gallons, c. 40 liters) derived from Josephus’ writings.—See MOLTEN SEA.</p>

HIN
A liquid measure (Ex. 30:24; Num. 28:14; Ezek. 45:24; 46:5, 7, 11); also used with reference to the container for measuring a hin. (Lev. 19:36) According to the Jewish historian Josephus, a hin equaled two Athenian choas; a bath equaled seventy-two sextarii. (Antiquities of the Jews, Book III, chap. VIII, par. 3; Book VIII, chap. II, par. 9) Since other sources indicate that two Athenian choas amounted to twelve sextarii, the hin may be reckoned at one-sixth of a bath measure (c. 23.24 quarts; 22 liters) or about 3.87 quarts (3.67 liters). The Scriptures also mention fractions of a hin: a half (c. 1.9 quarts; c. 1.8 liters) (Num. 15:9, 10), a third (c. 1.3 quarts; c. 1.2 liters) (Num. 15:6, 7; Ezek. 46:14), a fourth (c. 1.9 pints; c. .9 liter) (Ex. 29:40; Lev. 23:13; Num. 15:4, 5; 28:5, 7) and a sixth (c. 1.3 pints; c. .6 liter), this last being the daily water ration allowed Ezekiel when depicting the severe condition to come upon Jerusalem under siege.â€”Ezek. 4:11.

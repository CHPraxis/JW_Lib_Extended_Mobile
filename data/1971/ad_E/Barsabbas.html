<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Barʹsab·bas).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The meaning of the name is uncertain: <em>Bar,</em> “son of”, <em>sab·bas</em>ʹ<em>,</em> variously interpreted as “oath,” “conversion,” “captivity,” “quiet,” “rest”; hence the suggestion, “born (son) on the sabbath.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It may have been a family name, or just an added name given to two individuals: <em>Joseph,</em> surnamed Justus, who was the rejected candidate for the apostleship vacated by Judas Iscariot; and <em>Judas,</em> who accompanied Paul, Barnabas and Silas from Jerusalem to Antioch in 49 C.E. There is no evidence that the two men were brothers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:23-44:1:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:22-44:15:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15:22</a>; see JOSEPH; JUDAS.</p>

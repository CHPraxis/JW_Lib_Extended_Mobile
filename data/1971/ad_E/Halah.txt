HALAH
(Haʹlah).
A place to which Assyrian monarchs transported Israelite captives. (2 Ki. 17:6; 18:11; 1 Chron. 5:26) Certain scholars believe that Obadiah 20 perhaps should read “exiles in Halah” rather than “exiles of this [army (JB), force (Ro, Yg), host (AS, AV), rampart (NW)] .” Whereas various identifications have been suggested, Halah’s exact location remains unknown. Some associate it with the Hallahu mentioned in Akkadian texts.

ZETA
[Ζ, ζ].
The sixth letter of the Greek alphabet; from it the English “z” originates. Zeʹta had the diphthongal sound of the English dz, later the sound of z.
Its equivalent in Hebrew is zaʹyin. Though zeʹta is the sixth letter in order, numerically it is equal to seven when it has the acute accent (ζ΄), and, 7,000, with the subscript (,ζ). For the number six, the digamma (====) or the accented final form of sigma (ς΄) is used.

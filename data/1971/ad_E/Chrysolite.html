<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(chrysʹo·lite).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A transparent or translucent, yellow or green semiprecious stone composed of silicates of magnesium and iron. It generally occurs in volcanic rocks (also, in dolomite and some types of limestone) in solid, crystalline or granular form. “Chrysolite” is from the Greek word <em>khry·soʹli·thos</em> meaning “gold stone,” and it seems that at least some ancients applied this name to various yellow colored gems. Fine-quality chrysolite crystals are found in Egypt.</p>

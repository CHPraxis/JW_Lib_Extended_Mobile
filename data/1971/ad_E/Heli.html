<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(He’li) [Gr. form of Eli, meaning Jah is high, ascent or high-placed].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently the father of Mary and maternal grandfather of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:23-42:3:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 3:23</a>) Joseph’s being called “the son of Heli” is understood to mean that he was the son-in-law of Heli. While not listing her, Luke evidently traces the natural descent of Jesus’ mother Mary from David.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:31-42:3:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 3:31</a>; see GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST.</p>

JEREMIAH, BOOK OF
Jeremiah was commissioned as prophet in the thirteenth year of King Josiah (647 B.C.E.) to warn the southern kingdom, Judah, of her impending destruction. This was less than a century after the prophet Isaiah’s activity and the fall of Israel, the northern kingdom, to the Assyrians.
WHEN WRITTEN
For the most part, the book of Jeremiah was not written at the time he declared the prophecies. Rather, Jeremiah evidently did not put any of his proclamations into writing until he was commanded by Jehovah, in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim (625 B.C.E.), to dictate all the words given him by Jehovah to date. This included, not only words spoken about Judah in Josiah’s time, but also proclamations of judgment on all the nations. (Jer. 36:1, 2) The resulting scroll was burned by Jehoiakim when Jehudi read it to him. But Jeremiah was ordered to write it over, which he did through his secretary Baruch, with many additional words.—Jer. 36:21-23, 28, 32.
The remainder of the book was evidently added later, including the introduction, which mentions the eleventh year of Zedekiah (Jer. 1:3), and other prophecies that Jeremiah wrote down at the time he was to deliver them (Jer. 30:2; 51:60) and the letter to the exiles in Babylon. (Jer. 29:1) Additionally, the proclamations uttered during the reign of Zedekiah, and the accounts of the events, after Jerusalem’s fall, down to about 580 B.C.E., were added later. It may be that, although the scroll written by Baruch was the basis for a large part of the book, Jeremiah afterward edited and arranged it when adding later sections.
ARRANGEMENT
The book is not arranged chronologically, but, rather, according to subject matter. Dating is presented where necessary, but the majority of the prophecies are applicable to the nation of Judah throughout the general period of the reigns of Josiah, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. God repeatedly told Jeremiah that the nation was incorrigibly wicked, beyond reform. Yet those with right hearts were given full opportunity to reform and find deliverance. As to being prophetic for our day, the arrangement does not affect the understanding and application of Jeremiah’s writings.
AUTHENTICITY
The authenticity of Jeremiah is generally accepted. Only a few critics have challenged it on the basis of the differences in the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Septuagint Version as found in the Alexandrine Manuscript. There are more variations between the Hebrew and the Greek texts of the book of Jeremiah than in any other book of the Hebrew Scriptures. The Septuagint Version is said to be shorter than the Hebrew text by about 2,700 words, or one-eighth of the book. The majority of scholars agree that the Greek translation of this book is defective, but that does not lessen the reliability of the Hebrew text. It has been suggested that the translator may have had a Hebrew manuscript of a different “family,” a special recension, but critical study reveals that this apparently was not the case.
The fulfillment of the prophecies recorded by Jeremiah, together with their content, strongly testifies to the book’s authenticity. Among the numerous prophecies of Jeremiah, some of which he personally saw fulfilled, are the following:
The captivity of Zedekiah and destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (Jer. 20:3-6; 21:3-10; 39:6-9)
The dethronement and death in captivity of King Shallum (Jehoahaz) (Jer. 22:11, 12; 2 Ki. 23:30-34; 2 Chron. 36:1-4)
The taking captive of King Coniah (Jehoiachin) to Babylon (Jer. 22:24-27; 2 Ki. 24:15, 16)
The death, within one year, of the false prophet Hananiah (Jer. 28:16, 17)
Some of the Rechabites, and Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, surviving Jerusalem’s destruction (Jer. 35:19; 39:15-18)
Among further fulfillments of Jeremiah’s prophecies are:
Egypt invaded, conquered by Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 43:8-13; 46:13-26)
The return of the Jews and rebuilding of the temple and the city after seventy years’ desolation (Jer. 24:1-7; 25:11, 12; 29:10; 30:11, 18, 19; compare 2 Chronicles 36:20, 21; Ezra 1:1; Daniel 9:2.)
Ammon laid waste (Jer. 49:2)
Edom cut off as a nation (Jer. 49:17, 18) (With the death of the Herods, Edom became extinct as a nation.)
Babylon to become a permanent desolation (Jer. 25:12-14; 50:35, 38-40)
The Christian Greek Scriptures indicate that Jeremiah’s prophecies have a larger, spiritual fulfillment. Among these are the following:
A new covenant made with the house of Israel and the house of Judah (Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-13)
David’s house not to lack a man on the throne of the kingdom forever (Jer. 33:17-21; Luke 1:32, 33)
Fall of Babylon the Great an enlargement and symbolic application of Jeremiah’s words against ancient Babylon, as the following comparisons show:

50:38                 16:12
50:39, 40; 51:37      18:2  
51:8                  18:8-10, 15, 19
51:9, 49, 56          18:5
51:12                 17:16, 17
51:13                 17:1, 15
51:48                 18:20 
51:55                 18:22, 23
51:63, 64            18:21
PRINCIPLES AND QUALITIES OF GOD
Besides the above fulfillments, the book sets forth many principles and furnishes many illustrations revealing God’s qualities and his dealings with his people. The book stresses that formalism is of no value in God’s eyes, but that he desires worship and obedience from the heart. The inhabitants of Judah are told not to trust in the temple and its surrounding buildings, and are admonished: “Get yourselves circumcised to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your hearts.” (Jer. 4:4; 7:3-7; 9:25, 26) Jehovah’s great loving-kindness and mercy are exemplified in delivering a remnant of his people and in finally restoring them to Jerusalem, as prophesied by Jeremiah. God’s appreciation and consideration for those showing kindness to his servants and his being the Rewarder of those who seek him and show obedience are highlighted in his care for the Rechabites and for Ebed-melech and Baruch.—Jer. 35:18, 19; 39:16-18; 45:1-5.
Jehovah is brilliantly portrayed as the Creator of all things, the King to time indefinite, the only true God. He is the only one to be feared, the Corrector and Director of those calling on his name, and the one under whose denunciation no nation can hold up. He is the great Potter, in whose hand individuals and nations are as clay pottery, to work with or destroy as he pleases.—Jer. chaps. 10; 18:1-10; Rom. 9:19-24.
The book of Jeremiah reveals that God expects the people bearing his name to be a glory and a praise to him and that he considers them close to him. (Jer. 13:11) Those who prophesy falsely in his name, saying “Peace” to those with whom God is not at peace, have to account to God for their words, and they will stumble and fall. (Jer. 6:13-15; 8:10-12; 23:16-20) Those standing before the people as priests and prophets have great responsibility before God, for, as he told those in Judah: “I did not send the prophets, yet they themselves ran. I did not speak to them, yet they themselves prophesied. But if they had stood in my intimate group, then they would have made my people hear my own words, and they would have caused them to turn back from their bad way and from the badness of their dealings.”—Jer. 23:21, 22.
As in other books of the Bible, God’s holy nation is considered to be in relationship to him as a wife, and unfaithfulness to him is “prostitution.” (Jer. 3:1-3, 6-10; compare James 4:4.) Jehovah’s own loyalty to his covenants, however, is unbreakable.—Jer. 31:37; 33:20-22, 25, 26.
Many are the fine principles and illustrations in the book, upon which the other Bible writers have drawn for reference. And many other pictorial and prophetic patterns are found that have application and that have application and vital meaning to the modern-day Christian and his ministry.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This translates the Hebrew word <em>ma·ʽatsadhʹ,</em> which denotes a tool used for shaping wood, and even iron. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:3-24:10:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 10:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:12-23:44:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 44:12</a>) The root from which this Hebrew term is considered to be drawn has been linked with words in related languages meaning “reap,” “cut off.” Consequently Koehler (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> p. 550) defines <em>ma·ʽatsadhʹ</em> as “billhook.” The modern billhook consists of a handle and a blade with a hook-shaped point. However, others understand <em>ma·ʽatsadhʹ</em> to designate a kind of ax, since this is its meaning in late Hebrew, and suggest that it may refer to an adz.</p>

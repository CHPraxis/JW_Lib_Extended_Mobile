<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Zarʹe·phath) [perhaps, smelting-place].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Phoenician town ‘belonging to’ or apparently dependent upon Sidon in Elijah’s day. At Zarephath the prophet was shown hospitality by a poor widow, whose flour and oil were miraculously sustained during a great famine and whose son he, in God’s power, subsequently raised from death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:8-11:17:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:8-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:25-42:4:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 4:25, 26</a>) It later marked an extremity of former Canaanite territory foretold to become the possession of Israelite exiles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:20-31:1:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Obad. 20</a>) The name is preserved in that of Sarafand, though the ancient site may have been a short distance away on the Mediterranean shore some eight miles (13 kilometers) SW of Sidon.</p>

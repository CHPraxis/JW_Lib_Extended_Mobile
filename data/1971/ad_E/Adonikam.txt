ADONIKAM
(Ad·o·niʹkam) [the lord is risen].
A founder of one of the paternal houses of Israel. More than 600 members of this family returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the exile at Babylon. (Ezra 2:13; Neh. 7:18) An additional sixty-three members of this paternal house accompanied Ezra to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E. (Ezra 8:13) When the representatives of the paternal houses attested to the “trustworthy arrangement” or resolution drawn up in Nehemiah’s day, this family was apparently listed by the name Adonijah.—Neh. 9:38; 10:16.

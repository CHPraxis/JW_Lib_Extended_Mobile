SILOAM
(Si·loʹam) [sent forth].
A pool in Jerusalem where Jesus Christ had a blind man wash in order to receive sight. (John 9:6, 7, 11) Little is known about this pool as it then existed, though its general location apparently is marked by the present Birket Silwan, just SW of the city of David. Likely this is also the approximate site of King Hezekiah’s “pool” or reservoir adjoining the conduit he constructed to carry the waters of Gihon.—2 Ki. 20:20; 2 Chron. 32:30.
For the Siloam inscription, see pages 110, 763.
In the days of Jesus’ earthly ministry, evidently it was common knowledge that the “tower in Siloam” had collapsed, killing eighteen persons. It has been suggested that this tower was situated on the Ophel ridge, but its actual location in Jerusalem is unknown.—Luke 13:4.

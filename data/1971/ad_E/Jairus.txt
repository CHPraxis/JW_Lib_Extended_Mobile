JAIRUS
(Jaʹi·rus) [Greek form of Jair: he will enlighten or awaken].
A presiding officer of the synagogue (probably in Capernaum) whose only daughter Jesus resurrected.—Matt. 9:18; Mark 5:22; Luke 8:41, 42.
When, in late 31 or early 32 C.E., Jairus’ twelve-year-old daughter became so ill that she was expected to die, her father sought out Jesus, fell at his feet and implored him to come and cure her before it was too late. While leading Jesus to his home, Jairus surely must have been greatly encouraged by witnessing Jesus heal a woman subject for twelve years to a flow of blood. But how disheartening to receive word from messengers that his own little daughter had already died! Nonetheless, Jesus urged Jairus not to fear, but to exercise faith. Passing amidst the noisy mourners who scorned and ridiculed Jesus’ remark that the child was only sleeping, Jairus, his wife and three apostles accompanied Jesus inside, where Jesus restored the girl to life. As might be expected, Jairus and his wife were “beside themselves with great ecstasy.”—Mark 5:21-43; Matt. 9:18-26; Luke 8:41-56.

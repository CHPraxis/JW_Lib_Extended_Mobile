<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>koʹahh,</em> power; <em>g<sup>e</sup>vu·rahʹ,</em> mightiness; <em>ʽoz,</em> strength; Gr., <em>dyʹna·mis,</em> power, powerful works, ability (from this term come the English words dynamo, dynamite, dynamic)] .</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Power means the ability to perform acts, the capacity to accomplish things, to do work. At the close of the sixth creative “day” God began “resting from all his work that [he had] created for the purpose of making.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:2-1:2:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 2:2, 3</a>) He rested from <em>these creative</em> works, but his power has since not become dormant or remained quiescent. Over 4,000 years after the completion of earthly creation his Son stated: “My Father has kept working until how, and I keep working.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:17-43:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:17</a>) Not only as regards the spirit realm has Jehovah been active; the Bible record pulsates with his expressions of power and his mighty acts toward humankind. Though at times he has “kept quiet . . . exercising self-control,” whenever his due time came to act he has taken vigorous action with “full might.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:13-23:42:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 42:13, 14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:80:2-19:80:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 80:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:15-23:63:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 63:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Work” indicates purposeful activity. Jehovah’s acts are not isolated, unrelated or erratic expressions of energy but coordinated, purposeful acts with a definite end in view. Although his power sustains the universe and the living creatures in it (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:25-19:136:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 136:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:2-19:148:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 148:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Matt. 5:45</a>), Jehovah is not like an impersonal power plant; his acts prove he is a personal and purposeful God. He is also a historical God, as he has perceptively intervened in human affairs at definite dates of history, at specified places, and with regard to particular persons or peoples. As the “living and true God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:1:9-52:1:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:3:10-6:3:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Josh. 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:10-24:10:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Jer. 10:10</a>), he has shown himself aware of all that is taking place in universal time and space, reacting according to what has occurred as well as taking the initiative in furthering his purpose.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In every case, his varied expressions of power have been in harmony with his righteousness (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:98:1-19:98:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 98:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:2-19:111:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 111:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:7-19:111:7" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:16-23:5:16" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Isa. 5:16</a>); they all bring enlightenment to his creatures. They show on the one hand that fear of him “is fitting,” for he is a God “exacting exclusive devotion” and a “consuming fire” against those practicing wickedness, making it a “fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:6-24:10:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 10:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ex. 20:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:26-58:10:31" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:26-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:29" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 12:28, 29</a>) He is not to be trifled with.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:29-2:8:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 8:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">On the other hand, his use of power is even more wonderfully manifest in rewarding righteous-hearted persons sincerely seeking him, strengthening them to do assigned tasks and needful work (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:5-19:84:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 84:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isa. 40:29-31</a>), to endure under stress (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:1-19:46:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 46:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:4-23:25:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isa. 25:4</a>), providing for and sustaining them (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:14-19:145:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 145:14-16</a>), protecting, saving and liberating them in times of danger and aggression.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>POWER MANIFEST IN CREATION</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Humans see evidence of power in all physical creation, in the immense and countless stellar bodies (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:31-18:38:33" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>), as well as all earthly things. The very soil has power (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:12-1:4:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 4:12</a>), producing food that gives strength (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:28:22-9:28:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Sam. 28:22</a>), and power is seen in all living things, plants, animals and man. In modern times the tremendous power potential in even the minute atomic elements forming all matter has also become well known. Scientists sometimes call matter “organized energy.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Throughout the Scriptures God’s power and “dynamic energy” as the Maker of heaven and earth are repeatedly highlighted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:25-23:40:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 40:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:12-24:10:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:17-24:32:17" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 32:17</a>) The very term for “God” in Hebrew (<em>‘El</em>) is believed to have the root meaning of “mighty” or “powerful.” (Compare the use of the term at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:29-1:31:29" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Genesis 31:29</a> in the expression the “power [<em>ʼel</em>] of my hand.”)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>NEED ARISES FOR SPECIAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF POWER</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The first man knew Jehovah God as his Creator, his only Parent and Life-giver. God endowed man with a measure of power, intellectual and physical, and gave him work to perform. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2:15</a>) Such exercise <span id="page1325" class="pageNum" data-no="1325" data-before-text="1325"></span>of power must harmonize with his Creator’s will and hence be governed by other qualities divinely granted, such as wisdom, justice and love.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The rebellion in Eden presented a challenge to God’s Sovereignty. Primarily a moral issue, it nevertheless has caused God to exercise his power in special ways. (See JEHOVAH [The supreme issue a moral one].) The rebellion was instigated by a spirit son of God who thereby became God’s opposer or resister (Heb., <em>sa·tan</em>ʹ). Jehovah reacted to the situation, judging the rebels. His expulsion of the human pair from Eden and his stationing loyal spirit creatures at the garden’s entrance was a demonstration of divine power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:19-1:3:19" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:24" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 22-24</a>) Jehovah’s word proved to be, not impotent, weak or wavering, but full of power, irresistible as to fulfillment. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:29-24:23:29" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jeremiah 23:29</a>.) As the Sovereign God, he proved ready and able to back up his word with the full weight of his authority.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Fixing his purpose, Jehovah has consistently worked toward its realization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:8-49:1:11" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Eph. 1:8-11</a>) In his due time he would end all earthly rebellion, cause the original spirit rebel and those allied with him to be crushed as one crushes the head of a serpent. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a>.) While allowing his spirit adversary to continue for a time and to endeavor to prove successful his challenge, Jehovah would not abdicate his Sovereign position. Exercising rightful authority, he would reward or punish when and as he saw fit, judging men according to their deeds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:17-24:32:19" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Jer. 32:17-19</a>) Additionally, he would use his power to attest the credentials of those whom he designated his representatives on earth. By revealing his power he would put the seal of genuineness on messages they delivered.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This has been a divine kindness. Thereby Jehovah has given men proof that he, and no other, is the true God; he has given proof of his worthiness to receive the fear, respect, trust, praise and love of his intelligent creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:24-19:31:24" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 31:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:16-19:86:17" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 86:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:13" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Isa. 41:10-13</a>) Over the centuries, Jehovah has repeatedly reassured his servants that his power has not waned, his “hand” has not ‘grown short,’ nor his “ear” become too heavy to hear. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:23-4:11:23" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 11:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:28-23:40:28" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Isa. 40:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:2-23:50:2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 50:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:1" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 59:1</a>) More importantly, these expressions of power have contributed toward the sanctifying and vindicating of Jehovah’s own Name. His use of power exalts him, it does not debase him, does not sully his reputation; rather, by it he makes a “beautiful name” for himself.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:22-18:36:23" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 36:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:23-18:37:24" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 37:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:12-23:63:14" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Isa. 63:12-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>PRIOR TO AND AT THE GLOBAL FLOOD</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In the pre-Flood period, men had ample evidence of God’s power. They knew the way back into Eden was impassable, blocked by powerful spirit creatures. God showed he was alive to what was going on, approving Abel’s sacrifice, expressing judgment upon his murderous brother Cain, yet warning men against executing Cain.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Gen. 3:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:2-1:4:15" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 4:2-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Some 1,400 years later the earth became filled with wickedness and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:12" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) God expressed displeasure at this situation. After sounding a warning through his servant Noah, he forcefully demonstrated by means of a global Flood that he would not allow wicked men to ruin the earth. He did not use his power to force them to worship him but, through Noah’s work as a “preacher of righteousness” gave them opportunity to change. At the same time he showed his ability to liberate righteous-hearted persons from evil circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:4-61:2:5" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:9-61:2:9" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Even as his judgment came upon the wicked suddenly, and his destruction of them did not ‘slumber,’ but wiped them out within a forty-day period, so he would act in similar ways in the future.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:3-61:2:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:17-1:7:23" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Gen. 7:17-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:39" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> Matt. 24:37-39</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>THE CHALLENGE OF FALSE GODS IN THE POST-FLOOD PERIOD</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Both the Scriptures and ancient secular records reveal men’s deviation from worship of the true God in the post-Flood period. There is strong evidence pointing to a major role in this on the part of Nimrod, who “displayed himself [as] a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah,” and evidence pointing to Babel (Babylon) as the major site where false worship developed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:8-1:10:12" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Gen. 10:8-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:4" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 11:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:9-1:11:9" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 9</a>; see BABEL; BABYLON; GODS AND GODDESSES.) The tower project proposed at Babel was a demonstration of human power and ability, independent of God, unauthorized by him. It was to bring reputation and fame to its builders, not to God. And, as God foresaw, this was but the beginning. It would lead to a series of ambitious power projects taking men farther and farther in a course of defiance of the true God and his purpose for the planet and the human race. Again, God stepped in, throwing the project into confusion by acting upon human powers of speech, causing the peoples to disperse throughout the globe.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:5-1:11:9" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Gen. 11:5-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>“Nature gods” contrasted with the true God</em></strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Ancient documents from Babylon and from points of mankind’s migration show that the worship of “nature gods” (such as the Babylonian sun-god Shamash, the Egyptian rain and thunder god Thoth, and the Canaanite fertility god Baal) became very prominent in those early times. The “nature gods” were associated in men’s minds with periodic or cyclic manifestations of power, such as the daily beaming forth of the sun’s rays, the seasonal results of solstices and equinoxes (producing summer and winter, spring and fall), the winds and storms, the falling of rain and its effect on earth’s fertility in seedtime and harvest, and similar evidences of power. These forces are impersonal. So men had to fill in the blank, providing personality for their gods by their own imagination. The personalities they conjured up for their gods were generally capricious, lacking any definite purpose, morally debased, unworthy of worship and service.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Yet the visible heavens and earth give clear proof of a superior Source of power that produced all these forces in an interrelated, coordinated arrangement, one giving undeniable evidence of intelligent purpose. To that Source the acclamation goes: “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) Jehovah is not a God governed by or limited to celestial or earthly cycles. Nor are his expressions of power capricious, erratic or inconsistent. In each case they reveal something about his personality, his standards, his purpose. The <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by G. Kittel, in treating the view of God contained in the Hebrew Scriptures, thus observes that “the important and predominant feature is not force or power but the will which this power must execute and therefore serve. This is everywhere the decisive feature.”—Vol. II, p. 291.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The worship of such “nature gods” by the Israelites was apostasy, a suppression of truth in favor of a lie, an unreasoning course of worshiping the creation rather than the One who created, as the apostle states at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:18-45:1:25" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 1:18-25</a>. Though invisible, Jehovah God had made his qualities manifest among men, for as Paul says, these are “clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong><em>How God’s control of natural forces could be distinctive</em></strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">To prove himself the true God, Jehovah might reasonably be expected to demonstrate his control over the created forces, doing so in a way that his own Name would be distinctly connected therewith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:5-19:135:6" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps. 135:5, 6</a>) Since the sun, moon, planets and stars follow their regular courses, since the earthly atmospheric conditions (producing wind, rain and other effects) obey the laws governing them, since locusts swarm and birds migrate, these and many other normal <span id="page1326" class="pageNum" data-no="1326" data-before-text="1326"></span>functions would not suffice to sanctify God’s name in the face of opposition and false worship.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Nevertheless, Jehovah God could cause the natural creation and elements to testify to his Godship by using them to fulfill specific purposes beyond their ordinary function, often at a specifically designated time. Even when the events in themselves were not unique, such as a drought, a rainstorm or similar weather condition, their coming in fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy made them distinctive. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:1-11:17:1" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:1-11:18:2" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 18:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:41-11:18:45" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 41-45</a>.) But, in most cases, the events were extraordinary in themselves, either because of their magnitude or intensity (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:24-2:9:24" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ex. 9:24</a>), or because of their occurring in an unusual, even unheard of, way or at an abnormal time.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:10-2:34:10" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ex. 34:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:16-9:12:18" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 12:16-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Similarly with regard to humans themselves. The birth of a child was ordinary. But the birth of a child to a woman who had been sterile all her life and who had passed the age of childbirth (as in the case of Sarah) was extraordinary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:10-1:18:11" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Gen. 18:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:1-1:21:2" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 21:1, 2</a>) It gave evidence of God’s intervention. Death, too, was a common occurrence. But when the death came at a predicted time or in a preannounced way with the causative factor otherwise unknown, this too was extraordinary, pointing to divine action.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:18-23:8:18" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Isa. 8:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:13-58:2:13" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:13</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:10-42:2:14" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Luke 2:10-14</a>.) In Jesus, God’s powerful workings during thousands of years now found fulfillment, came to fruition. Rightly the apostle could speak of Jesus as “the power of God and the wisdom of God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:24-46:1:24" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">Jesus proved to be the long-awaited Messiah, Jehovah’s Anointed One, foretold to manifest the ‘spirit of mightiness.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:1-23:11:5" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Isa. 11:1-5</a>) As such, it could be expected that he would have powerful testimony to support that fact.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:37" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Luke 1:35-37</a>) This birth was not simply a spectacular display of divine power but served very definite purposes. It provided a perfect human, ‘a second Adam,’ one who could sanctify his Father’s name, erase the reproach the first human son had brought on that name, thereby giving the lie to Satan’s challenge; moreover, the perfect Jesus would provide a legal basis for ransoming obedient mankind from the grip of Kings Sin and Death.

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">What Jesus did gave proof of God’s interest in mankind, evidence of what God would eventually do for all loving righteousness. Jesus’ powerful works were largely related to mankind’s problems, first and most basic among which is that of sin, with all its damaging effects. Sickness and death are concomitants of sin, and Jesus’ ability to heal sickness of all kinds (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:14-40:8:15" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Matt. 8:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:19-42:6:19" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> Luke 6:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:11-42:17:14" data-bid="108-3" class="b"> 17:11-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:43-42:8:48" data-bid="108-4" class="b"> 8:43-48</a>) and even to resurrect the dead (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:23-40:9:25" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Matt. 9:23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:14-42:7:15" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> Luke 7:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:39-43:11:44" data-bid="109-3" class="b"> John 11:39-44</a>) gave proof that he was God’s appointed means for freeing mankind from sin and its penalty. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:5-41:2:12" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Mark 2:5-12</a>.) Far superior to the manna Israel ate in the wilderness, Jesus was the “true bread from heaven,” “the bread of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:31-43:6:35" data-bid="111-1" class="b">John 6:31-35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:48-43:6:51" data-bid="111-2" class="b"> 48-51</a>) He brought, not literal water from a rock, but “living water,” the ‘water of life.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:37-43:7:38" data-bid="112-1" class="b">John 7:37, 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="112-2" class="b"> Rev. 22:17</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:13-43:4:14" data-bid="113-1" class="b">John 4:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">His powerful works were also “portents” of other blessings due to come by his kingly rule. Whereas Elisha had fed one hundred men with only twenty loaves and some grain, Jesus fed thousands with far less.

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">More importantly, these things were all related to spiritual matters. As Jesus brought spiritual sight, speech and health to the spiritually blind, dumb and ailing, he also brought and assured the enjoyment of spiritual food and drink in abundance and guaranteed the productiveness of his disciples’ ministry. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:10-42:5:11" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Luke 5:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:35-43:6:36" data-bid="119-2" class="b"> John 6:35, 36</a>.)

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:25-43:6:27" data-bid="120-1" class="b">John 6:25-27</a>.) The Kingdom and God’s righteousness, not food and drink, were to be sought first. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Matt. 6:31-33</a>) Jesus set the example in this by his refusal to change stones into bread for himself.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:3" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Matt. 4:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">Though Jesus laid principal stress on the truths he proclaimed, he nevertheless showed the relative importance of his powerful works, regularly calling attention to them as authenticating his commission and message.

Jesus refused to engage in purposeless theatrics as suggested by Satan.

This, too, was for a “beneficial purpose,” for they were soon to extend the preaching work beyond Israel, telling Jehovah’s wonderful works among the nations.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:4-46:12:11" data-bid="156-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:4-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:3-19:96:3" data-bid="156-2" class="b"> Ps. 96:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:7-19:96:7" data-bid="156-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sb">Jehovah God did other powerful things for them as well, opening up ‘doors’ of opportunity for them to preach in certain territories, protecting them against those who would shut down their ministerial work, directing their activity, doing so in ways generally unobserved by the public.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:17-44:5:20" data-bid="157-1" class="b">Acts 5:17-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:29" data-bid="157-2" class="b"> 8:26-29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:39-44:8:40" data-bid="157-3" class="b"> 39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:8" data-bid="157-4" class="b"> 9:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:19-44:10:22" data-bid="157-5" class="b"> 10:19-22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:44-44:10:48" data-bid="157-6" class="b"> 44-48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:6-44:12:11" data-bid="157-7" class="b"> 12:6-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:2-44:13:2" data-bid="157-8" class="b"> 13:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:6-44:16:10" data-bid="157-9" class="b"> 16:6-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:25-44:16:33" data-bid="157-10" class="b"> 25-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:9-44:18:10" data-bid="157-11" class="b"> 18:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:8-46:16:9" data-bid="157-12" class="b"> 1 Cor. 16:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sb">The miraculous abilities granted by the spirit to the apostles, and passed on by them to others were foretold to last only during the ‘infancy’ of the Christian congregation, thereafter ending. (See GIFTS FROM GOD [Gifts of the Spirit].) The <em>Biblical Theological and Ecclesiastical Encyclopaedia</em> by M’Clintock and Strong (Vol. VI, p. 320) says that it is “an uncontested statement that during the first hundred years after the death of the apostles we hear little or nothing of the working of miracles by the early Christians.” Nevertheless, Jesus and his apostles warned of future deceptive powerful works that would be done by apostates and also by political organizations, enemies of God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="158-1" class="b">Matt. 7:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:23-40:24:25" data-bid="158-2" class="b"> 24:23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:9-53:2:10" data-bid="158-3" class="b"> 2 Thess. 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:11-66:13:13" data-bid="158-4" class="b"> Rev. 13:11-13</a>; see BEASTS, SYMBOLIC.</p>

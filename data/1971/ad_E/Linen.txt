LINEN
The thread or cloth made from flax. (Ex. 25:4; Judg. 15:14) Among the Hebrews most garments were either woolen or linen. (Lev. 13:47; Prov. 31:13, 22; Hos. 2:5, 9) A mixture of the two materials was prohibited by the Law, evidently meaning that two kinds were not to be woven together, one in the warp and the other in the woof. (Deut. 22:11) Other items made from linen included belts (Jer. 13:1) and sails. (Ezek. 27:7) The Israelites, although evidently manufacturing their own linen, imported some linen from Egypt.—Prov. 7:16; see CLOTH.
Linen varied in quality, as indicated by Scriptural references to “fine linen” and “fine fabric.” (Ezek. 16:10; 27:16) The wealthy, kings and men of high governmental station wore linen of a superior quality. (Gen. 41:42; 1 Chron. 15:27; Esther 8:15; Luke 16:19) Jesus’ corpse was wrapped in clean, fine linen by Joseph, a rich man of Arimathea.—Matt. 27:57-59.
Fine linen yarn spun by Israelite women was used in making the ten tent cloths of the tabernacle, the curtain separating the Holy from the Most Holy, the screen for the entrance of the tabernacle, and that of the gate of the courtyard. (Ex. 35:25; 36:8, 35, 37; 38:18) Fine twisted linen was used in the robes of the priests, the ornamental headgears, the drawers and the sashes, as well as the high priest’s turban, ephod and breastpiece. (Ex. 39:2, 3, 5, 8, 27-29) In the case of these curtains and garments for use in the sanctuary, it seems that linen was the basic cloth used and that the colored materials of wool and gold were embroidered on for decorative effect. Thus the law prohibiting mixing of two kinds of materials was not violated. Additionally, these were special items designed according to Jehovah’s direct, specific instructions.—Ex. 35:35; 38:23.
FIGURATIVE USE
Babylon the Great is depicted as being arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, representing luxury. (Rev. 18:16) But in the case of the bride of Christ the fine linen of her apparel is clearly said to represent the “righteous acts of the holy ones.” Likewise the heavenly armies are shown clothed in white, clean, fine linen, indicative of their carrying on war in righteousness.—Rev. 19:8, 11, 14; see also Daniel 10:5; Revelation 15:6; FLAX.

JEHOZABAD
(Je·hozʹa·bad) [Jehovah has bestowed].
1. The second of Obed-edom’s eight sons included among the sanctuary gatekeepers.—1 Chron. 26:1, 4, 5, 13, 15.
2. A Benjamite officer over 180,000 in King Jehoshaphat’s army.—2 Chron. 17:17, 18.
3. An accomplice in the slaying of King Jehoash of Judah. Jehozabad and Jozacar, servants of Jehoash, put the king to death on account of his murdering Jehoiada’s son Zechariah.

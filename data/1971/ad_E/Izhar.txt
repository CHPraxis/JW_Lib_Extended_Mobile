IZHAR
(Izʹhar).
Two names, spelled quite similarly in Hebrew, are transliterated the same way into English but are of different meaning.
1. Yits·harʹ [from a root meaning shine]. The second listed of Kohath’s four sons; therefore a grandson of Levi. (Ex. 6:16, 18; Num. 3:17, 19; 1 Chron. 6:2, 18) One of Izhar’s three sons, Korah, was executed in the wilderness for rebellion.—Ex. 6:21; Num. 16:1, 32.
Izhar founded the Levitical family of Izharites. (Num. 3:27) Under King David, some of the Izharites, whose headman was Shelomith, were appointed singers, officers and judges, while others performed regular Levitical duties.—1 Chron. 6:31-38; 23:12, 18; 24:20-22; 26:23, 29.
2. Yitsʹhhar [possibly, reddish gray]. A descendant of Judah; a son of Ashhur and Helah. (1 Chron. 4:1, 5, 7) In the margin of the Masoretic text and in the Septuagint the name is spelled Zohar.

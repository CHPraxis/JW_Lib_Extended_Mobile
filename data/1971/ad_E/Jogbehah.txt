JOGBEHAH
(Jogʹbe·hah) [perhaps, height].
One of the fortified cities with stone flock pens that was built or rebuilt by the Gadites before their crossing the Jordan to assist in the conquest of Canaan. (Num. 32:34-36) At a later period Judge Gideon’s forces passed Jogbehah prior to their surprise attack on the Midianite camp at Karkor. (Judg. 8:10, 11) Modern geographers usually place Jogbehah at Khirbet el-Ajbeihat, situated about 3,470 feet (c. 1,058 meters) above sea level and some six miles (c. 10 kilometers) NW of modern Amman (Rabbah).

TOE
The Hebrew and Aramaic words used in the Bible for finger refer also, at times, to the toe. (2 Sam. 21:20; 1 Chron. 20:6; Dan. 2:41, 42) In other places the Hebrew word for “thumb” is used also for “toe.”—Ex. 29:20; Lev. 8:23, 24; 14:14, 17, 25, 28.
The toes, being important for balance and direction to the body in walking, are referred to in the Scriptures with literal and figurative significance. A custom occasionally practiced to incapacitate for battle a captured enemy was to cut off his thumbs and big toes.—Judg. 1:6, 7.
At the installation of the priesthood in Israel, Moses took some blood of the ram of the installation and put it on the right ear, the right thumb and the right big toe of Aaron and each of his sons. (Lev. 8:23, 24) The blood of the sacrifice on the prominent member of the right (best) foot would mean that they must point their course and walk unswervingly with the best of their ability in the sacrificial duties of the priesthood. Jesus Christ the great High Priest fulfilled this prophetic type when on earth (Matt. 16:21-23), and his underpriests, his spirit-begotten brothers, must follow his steps closely.—Heb. 7:26; 1 Pet. 2:5, 8; Rev. 20:6.

AZGAD
(Azʹgad) [Gad is mighty].
The head of a paternal house, some of whose members returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. (Ezra 2:12; Neh. 7:17), and some with Ezra in 468 B.C.E. (Ezra 8:12) It was probably one of his descendants who attested to the “trustworthy arrangement” negotiated by Nehemiah.—Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 14, 15.

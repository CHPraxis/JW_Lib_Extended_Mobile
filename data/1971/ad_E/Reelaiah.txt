REELAIAH
(Re·el·aiʹah) [perhaps, Jehovah has shaken].
One whose name occurs with those of such prominent men as Zerubbabel and Jeshua at the beginning of the list of those returning from Babylon to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E. (Ezra 2:1, 2) The name is spelled Raamiah (meaning, perhaps, Jehovah has thundered) at Nehemiah 7:7.

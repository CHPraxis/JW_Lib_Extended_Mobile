<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Be·riʹah).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The meaning of this name is obscure. If derived from Hebrew, it would mean “evil” or “calamity,” and that would explain why Ephraim so named his son. (See No. 2 below.) Some authorities, however, think it is of Arabic origin and means “prominent” or “excellent,” and that the name of Ephraim’s son was a play upon words due to similarity with the Hebrew.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1. The fourth-listed son of Asher who, perhaps with his own two sons Heber and Malchiel, came to Egypt with Jacob’s household in 1728 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:8-1:46:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 46:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:17-1:46:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17</a>) He and his two sons are listed as ancestral family heads, his descendants being Beriites.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:44-4:26:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 26:44, 45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 7:30, 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. A son of Ephraim, born after men of Gath had killed his older brothers. Ephraim “called his name Beriah, because it was with calamity that she [Beriah’s mother] happened to be in his house.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:20-13:7:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:20-23</a>; see first paragraph above.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">3. One of the five sons of Elpaal and one of the Benjamite family heads who chased away the inhabitants of Gath.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:12-13:8:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 8:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">4. The last-named son of Shimei, a Levite descendant of Gershon. Beriah and his brother Jeush “did not have many sons; so they became a paternal house for one official class.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:23:6-13:23:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 23:6-11</a>.</p>

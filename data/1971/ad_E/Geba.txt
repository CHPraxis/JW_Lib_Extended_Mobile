GEBA
(Geʹba) [hill].
A city of Benjamin given to the Kohathites; one of the thirteen priestly cities. (Josh. 18:21, 24; 21:17, 19; 1 Chron. 6:54, 60) Geba apparently was situated by the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah, whence the expression “from Geba as far as Beer-sheba.” (2 Ki. 23:8) The ancient city is usually identified with the modern village of Jeba, about six miles (10 kilometers) N-NE of Jerusalem. A steep valley separates this site from the suggested location of ancient Michmash. In the valley there are two hills with steep rocky sides. These perhaps correspond to the ‘toothlike crags’ Bozez and Seneh, one “facing Michmash,” the other “facing Geba.”—1 Sam. 14:4, 5.
Geba was one of the cities that figured in King Saul’s campaign against the Philistines. Evidently at the direction of his father Saul, Jonathan struck down the Philistine “garrison” (“prefect,” Mo) at Geba (“Gibeah,” Vg). (1 Sam. 13:3, 4; see GIBEAH No. 2.) In retaliation, the Philistines assembled a mighty force at Michmash, whereupon many Israelites fearfully went into hiding, some even fleeing across the Jordan. (1 Sam. 13:5-7) Later, Jonathan, accompanied by his armor-bearer, made his way from Geba to the Philistine outpost, undoubtedly stationed at the edge of the “ravine pass of Michmash.” On his hands and feet, Jonathan ascended the steep passage to the outpost and, with the cooperation of his armor-bearer, struck down about twenty Philistines.—1 Sam. 14:6-14; compare 1 Samuel 13:16, 23.
Years later Asa fortified Geba with stones and timbers of Ramah. (1 Ki. 15:22; 2 Chron. 16:6) At a time not specified in the Bible certain inhabitants of Geba were taken into exile at Manahath. (1 Chron. 8:6) On its way toward Jerusalem, the Assyrian army under Sennacherib apparently passed through Geba. (Isa. 10:24, 28-32) Among the Jews coming back from Babylonian exile were “sons of Geba”; the city itself was also reoccupied after the return. (Ezra 2:1, 26; Neh. 7:6, 30; 11:31; 12:29) Alluding to the exaltation of rebuilt Jerusalem, the prophet Zechariah spoke of the hilly and mountainous land that lies between Geba and Rimmon as becoming low like the Arabah.—Zech. 14:10.

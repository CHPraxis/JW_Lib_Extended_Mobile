HAZAR-ENAN
(Haʹzar-eʹnan), Hazar-enon (Haʹzar-eʹnon).
A site on the northern boundary of “the land of Canaan.” (Num. 34:2, 7-10) Ezekiel referred to Hazar-enon (Hazar-enan), along with Damascus and Hamath, in his forevision of the territory of Israel. (Ezek. 47:13, 17; 48:1) A positive identification of the site cannot be made at this time. However, most authorities tentatively locate it at Kiryatein, about seventy miles (112.6 kilometers) E-NE of Damascus on the road to Palmyra.

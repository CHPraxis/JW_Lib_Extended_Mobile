DAGGER MEN
This expression translates the Greek form of the Latin word sicarii, derived from sica, meaning a short, curved dagger. As a proper name “dagger men” refers to the fanatical political Jewish faction existing in the first century C.E. that engaged in organized political killings. When the Jews rioted against Paul at Jerusalem during his last visit there, the military commander Claudius Lysias suspected the apostle of being the Egyptian who had previously stirred up sedition and led the four thousand “dagger men” into the wilderness.—Acts 21:30-38; 23:26, 27.
According to the Jewish historian Josephus, especially during the festivals, the “dagger men” or Sicarii, with daggers concealed under their garments, mingled among the crowds at Jerusalem and stabbed their enemies in broad daylight and then, to avoid suspicion, joined those expressing indignation about the killings. Josephus further indicates that the Sicarii took a leading part in the revolt against Rome. In 66 C.E., a band of Sicarii, under the command of Eleazar ben Jair, seized and massacred the Roman garrison at Masada. This band of fanatical patriots continued their defiance of Rome until 73 C.E., in which year the defenses of Masada were breached. The Romans, however, did not have to make an assault on the fortress itself. In order to avoid being captured, the Sicarii had carried out a systematic suicidal massacre of 960 men, women and children. Only two women and five children, who had hidden in a cave, survived.

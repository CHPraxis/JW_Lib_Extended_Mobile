<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place near “Ephraim” (perhaps the city of Ephrain(m) mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:19-14:13:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:54-43:11:54" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 11:54</a>) that served as the site of Absalom’s sheepshearing festival in which he maneuvered the death of his brother Amnon.

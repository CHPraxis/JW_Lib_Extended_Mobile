OPHNI
(Oph πni).
A city of Benjamin (Josh. 18:21, 24), commonly linked with the Gophna mentioned by Josephus (Wars of the Jews, Book III, chap. III, par. 5) and considered to be modern Jifna. This site is about three miles (5 kilometers) N-NW of Bethel and therefore seemingly N of Benjamite territory. (Josh. 18:11-13) For the identification to be correct, it must be assumed either that Ophni was a Benjamite enclave city in Ephraim or that the Benjamite boundary extended northward near Bethel to include this suggested site of Ophni.

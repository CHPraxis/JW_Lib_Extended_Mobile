<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The words <em>ta·ʽavʹ</em> and <em>toh·ʽe·vahʹ</em> (derived from <em>ta·ʽav</em>ʹ) occur some 140 times in the Hebrew Scriptures. <em>Ta·ʽavʹ</em> is a Hebrew root word meaning “to loathe” or, in a moral sense, “to detest.” Its usage in the Bible indicates strong aversion to or rejection of things or persons on the basis of their violating certain principles or not meeting <span id="page444" class="pageNum" data-no="444" data-before-text="444"></span>definite standards held by the one so viewing them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thus at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:32-1:43:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 43:32</a> we read that it was a “detestable thing” (“abomination,” <em>AV;</em> “abhorrent,” <em>AT; “horreur”</em> [abhorrence], <em>JB</em>) for Egyptians to eat with Hebrews, and at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:34-1:46:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 46:34</a> that “every herder of sheep is a detestable thing [“abomination,” <em>AV;</em> “abhorrent,” <em>AT</em>] to Egypt.” According to Rawlinson (<em>Egypt and Babylon,</em> p. 124), this aversion was based on the Egyptian contempt for foreigners in general and for herdsmen in particular. Again, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:25-2:8:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 8:25-27</a>, we find Moses, fully aware of the Egyptians’ adoration of certain animals (and particularly of the cow) as sacred, insisting that Pharaoh allow the Israelites to withdraw into the wilderness to make their sacrifices because these would be “a thing detestable to the Egyptians.” Such Egyptian standards, of course, were not divinely set or approved by Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God’s own declared standards, principles and requirements are shown to be the proper basis for detestation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:1-3:18:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lev. 18:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:7-5:23:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Deut. 23:7</a>) Thus, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:14:1-19:14:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1</a> says: “The senseless one has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’ They have acted ruinously, they have acted detestably [a form of <em>ta·ʽavʹ</em>] in their dealing. There is no one doing good.” Examination of the texts using the Hebrew words <em>ta·ʽavʹ</em> and <em>toh·ʽe·vahʹ,</em> therefore, gives insight into God’s mind on matters. It also shows why there is a marked contrast or open conflict between the position or mental attitude of those who follow God’s Word and those ignoring or rejecting it in preference to their own standards or those of others.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:27-20:29:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 29:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>AMONG THE CANAANITES</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Before Israel’s entry into Canaan, Jehovah made plain to them the practices and customs of the peoples of Canaan that were detestable to him, and these they were to detest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:26-3:18:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 18:26-30</a>) Outstanding was their practice of idolatry. God said: “The graven images of their gods you should burn in the fire. You must not desire the silver and the gold upon them, nor indeed take it for yourself, for fear you may be ensnared by it<em>;</em> for it is a thing detestable [<em>thoh·ʽavathʹ</em>] to Jehovah your God. And you must not bring a detestable thing [<em>thoh·ʽe·vahʹ</em>] into your house and actually become a thing devoted to destruction like it. You should thoroughly loathe it and absolutely detest [<em>tha·ʽevʹ t<sup>e</sup>tha·ʽavenʹnu</em>] it, because it is something devoted to destruction.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:25-5:7:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 7:25, 26</a>) Any Israelite guilty of making images for religious worship was to be accursed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:15-5:27:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 27:15</a>) Regardless of the craftsmanship they reflected, such images were to be morally repugnant to God’s people.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:7:20-26:7:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezek. 7:20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:18-23:44:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:18-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Other practices of the Canaanites to be detested by Israel were: spiritism, with its seances and casting of spells, fortune-telling (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:9-5:18:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 18:9-12</a>), offering children up in fire to their gods (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:31-5:12:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:32:35-24:32:35" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Jer. 32:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:16:3-12:16:3" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 16:3</a>), incest, sodomy, and cohabitation with animals (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:6-3:18:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lev. 18:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:22-3:18:30" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 22-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:13-3:20:13" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 20:13</a>). Doubtless the morally repugnant practice of sodomy was the reason for the severity of the rule declaring the wearing of apparel of the opposite sex to be “detestable.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:5-5:22:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 22:5</a>) The Canaanites also practiced “sacred” prostitution by male and female temple prostitutes, but Jehovah prohibited the bringing of “the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog” into his house, “because they are something detestable.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:17-5:23:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deut. 23:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:24-11:14:24" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 14:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">On the basis of these and other “abominable” or “detestable” practices, Jehovah God ordered Israel to devote the Canaanites to destruction so that no contamination by false religion would result. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:20:17-5:20:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deut. 20:17, 18</a>) Any Israelite practicing the same things or advocating such apostasy was to receive precisely the same penalty.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:12-5:13:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 13:12-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:2-5:17:7" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 17:2-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:9:1-15:9:1" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Ezra 9:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:9:11-15:9:14" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 11-14</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Dan-jaʹan) [possibly, Dan played a pipe; or simply, Dan of Jaan].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned only once, on the route followed by Joab when taking the census ordered by David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:24:1-10:24:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 24:1-6</a>) The description seems to place its location in the extreme N of Israel, since it is stated that they went “on to Dan-jaan and went around to Sidon.” The fact that Beer-sheba is mentioned in the following verse (vs. 7) calls to mind the common expression “from Beer-sheba to Dan,” used by David in instructing Joab about the census. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:2-13:21:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 21:2</a>) Dan-jaan may therefore refer to the city of Dan or possibly a suburb of that northern city.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:18:28-7:18:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 18:28, 29</a>, where Dan and Sidon are also mentioned jointly; see also DAN No. 3.</p>

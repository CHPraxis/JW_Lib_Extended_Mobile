<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beʹzek) [lightning, or, perhaps, scattering, sowing].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. The site at which Judah and Simeon defeated 10,000 Canaanite and Perizzite troops under Adoni-bezek. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:3-7:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 1:3-7</a>) Some identify this Bezek with that of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:11:8-9:11:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 11:8</a> (No. 2, below) though such a view requires the assumption that Adoni-bezek came S to join other Canaanite forces but was met by Judah and Simeon, was chased N to Bezek and was defeated there. The context, however, seems to indicate a place in the general area of Jerusalem, whereas the Bezek of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:11:8-9:11:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Samuel 11:8</a> is in an extreme northern location in relation to Jerusalem and the territory occupied by Judah and Simeon. In view of these circumstances, Bezek, the city of Adoni-bezek, is tentatively located in the Shephelah region at the site of Khirbet Bezka, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) NE of Gezer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. The location where Saul assembled the sons of Israel and Judah to fight against the Ammonites who were camped against Jabesh in Gilead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:11:8-9:11:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 11:8-11</a>) The fact that this place was no more than a night’s march from Jabesh substantiates the view that it was located at the modern site of Khirbet Ibzik, thirteen miles (20.9 kilometers) NE of Shechem. A mountain W of Khirbet Ibzik rises 2,337 feet (713 meters) above sea level and may have provided a suitable place for Saul to reconnoiter his forces.</p>

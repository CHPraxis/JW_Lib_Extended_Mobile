<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city apparently situated at the southern extremity of ancient Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:10-26:29:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 29:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:6-26:30:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30:6</a>) As may be inferred from the possible meaning of Syene, the city may have served as a “market” or “trading post.” It is identified with Aswan, situated on the E bank of the Nile opposite Elephantine and some 430 miles (692 kilometers) S of Cairo.</p>

AHIJAH
(A·hiʹjah) (AHIAH, AV, in 2, 3, 6 below) [brother of Yah(u)].
1. The fifth-named son of Jerahmeel, of the tribe of Judah.—1 Chron. 2:25.
2. A family head in the tribe of Benjamin. (1 Chron. 8:6, 7) Some think he is the same as Ahoah in verse 4.
3. Son of Ahitub and great-grandson of Eli. He served as high priest in Shiloh when Saul was king. (1 Sam. 14:3, 18) Some suggest that he was either a brother of Ahimelech, or, by substituting “melech” for “jah” in his name, was Ahimelech.—1 Sam. 22:9.
4. One of the mighty men in David’s army, a Pelonite.—1 Chron. 11:36.
5. A Levite appointed over the treasures of Jehovah’s house in David’s reign.—1 Chron. 26:20.
6. Son of Shisha. He and his brother Elihoreph were Solomon’s princely secretaries.—1 Ki. 4:2, 3.
7. A prophet of Jehovah residing in Shiloh who foretold how Solomon’s kingdom would be split. Ripping a new garment into twelve parts, Ahijah gave ten pieces to Jeroboam promising that, if Jeroboam proved faithful, Jehovah would build him “a lasting house.” (1 Ki. 11:29-39; 12:15; 2 Chron. 10:15) After years of wicked rule Jeroboam sent his wife to inquire of Ahijah concerning the welfare of his sick son. The prophet, now old and blind, foretold that the boy would soon die and that Jehovah would “make a clean sweep behind the house of Jeroboam, just as one clears away the dung.” (1 Ki. 14:2-18; 15:29) “The prophecy of Ahijah,” one of the written records including Solomon’s affairs, survived to the time of Ezra’s compilation of Chronicles.—2 Chron. 9:29.
8. Father of Baasha, who conspired against Nadab and made himself king of Israel; of the tribe of Issachar.—1 Ki. 15:27, 33; 2 Ki. 9:9.
9. One of the forty-four heads of the people whose descendants, if not himself, joined in sealing Nehemiah’s “trustworthy arrangement” to walk in Jehovah’s laws.—Neh. 10:26; 9:38.

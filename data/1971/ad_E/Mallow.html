<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This translates the Hebrew word <em>ʼo·rohthʹ</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:39-12:4:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 4:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:19-23:26:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 26:19</a>), considered to be the plural of <em>ʼoh·rahʹ,</em> “light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:8:16-17:8:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 8:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:12-19:139:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps. 139:12</a>) According to Koehler and Baumgartner’s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, ʼo·rothʹ</em> denotes the dwarf mallow (<em>Malva rotundifolia</em>). This identification is based on the fact that this plant is very sensitive to light, hence perhaps the Hebrew designation <em>ʼo·rohthʹ</em>, “light-[herb].” Also, its fruit is edible, thus harmonizing with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:39-12:4:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 4:39</a>. The dwarf mallow is a creeping plant having nearly round, somewhat lobed, saw-edged leaves with long leafstalks. Its flowers are only about a half inch (c. 1.3 centimeters) across and vary in color from pale blue to white. The flat and circular mucilaginous fruits are commonly called “cheeses.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A person in bondage, exile, confinement or under restraint, especially one seized and carried off as a result of war. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:1-4:21:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 21:1</a>) In ancient times the spoils of war often included, besides captured livestock, the populace of conquered cities and territories. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:21-13:5:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 5:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:14-14:14:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 14:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:4:10-30:4:10" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Amos 4:10</a>) On one occasion the ark of the covenant was carried off as booty, with dire consequences to its Philistine captors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:11-9:5:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 4:11–5:12</a>) References to captives date back to patriarchal times; the first mentioned in the Bible is Lot, who was rescued from the forces of Chedorlaomer by Abraham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:14-1:14:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 14:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:26-1:31:26" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:25-1:34:29" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 34:25-29</a>) In a sense, Job, although no war casualty, was in a “captive condition” until Jehovah rescued him from his misery.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:10-18:42:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Israelites moved in to possess the Promised Land, certain cities, including their populations, <span id="page296" class="pageNum" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>were entirely devoted to destruction, as, for example, Jericho, the firstfruits of the conquest. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:17-6:6:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 6:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:21-6:6:21" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 21</a>) When capturing other cities not devoted to destruction, the Israelites, unlike the pagan nations, were not allowed to rape the women. If they desired a captive woman for a wife, certain requirements had to be met first.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:5:11-25:5:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lam. 5:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:9-4:31:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Num. 31:9-19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:26-4:31:27" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 26, 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:10-5:21:14" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Deut. 21:10-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, when enemy nations came up against the Israelites, Jehovah sometimes allowed his people to be carried off captive when they had been unfaithful to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:16-14:21:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:5-14:28:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 28:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:17-14:28:17" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:29:9-14:29:9" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 29:9</a>) The most notable examples of this were in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.E., when thousands of Israelites were exiled as captives by the Assyrian and Babylonian World Powers. (See CAPTIVITY.) Ahijah and Jeremiah foretold this coming national disaster. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:15-11:14:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:15:2-24:15:2" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Jer. 15:2</a>) Moses too had warned that their sons and daughters would “go off into captivity” as a penalty for disobedience to Jehovah, adding that, if they repented, such captives would in time return.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The treatment of captives varied a great deal, depending on many circumstances. Sometimes they were permitted to remain in their own land on condition that they pay tribute and not rebel against their new master. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 14:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:5-10:8:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:1-12:17:4" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 17:1-4</a>) A conquered monarch was sometimes permitted to continue reigning as a vassal king, or he might be replaced.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:13-30:1:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Amos 1:13</a>) The sadistic Assyrians, particularly noted for their extreme cruelty, are depicted in monuments as tying captives down and then skinning them alive.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Captives were often led away to forced labor (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:29-10:12:31" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:3-13:20:3" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 20:3</a>), taken into slavery, or sold as chattel.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Release and return of the Jewish captives was the happy theme of many prophecies.

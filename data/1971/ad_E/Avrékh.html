<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The term of honor and dignity called out before the chariot of Joseph after Pharaoh made him second in the kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:43-1:41:43" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 41:43</a>) If of Hebrew origin, as the ancient translator Aquilla conjectured and as supported by the <em>Vulgate,</em> then it could mean “bow the knee,” and is so translated in many versions. (<em>AS, AV, Da, Dy, ER, Ro, RS</em>) However, this view is rejected by many in favor of similar words in other languages. For example, some think it may be a Babylonian or Assyrian title of a high official, meaning “seer” or “grand vizier.” Some turn to the Coptic and say it means “bow the head”; others observe that the Arabs say something similar in commanding their camels to kneel down. The Syriac <em>Peshitta</em> reads: “Father and Ruler!” Other investigators believe that it is strictly Egyptian. Origen, a native of Egypt, and Jerome think it means “a native Egyptian,” and because of the disregard Egyptians had for foreigners, they reason that it was a public proclamation of naturalization. A similar expression, appearing in a papyrus finding, means ‘your command is our desire,’ that is, ‘we are at your service.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The exact meaning of this expression has therefore not yet been determined, hence it is left untranslated in <em>NW, JP, JB</em> and other versions. This non-Hebrew custom of making public acclamation before an honored one as he rode through town also finds an example in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:6:11-17:6:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 6:11</a>, when Mordecai was publicly honored at the command of Persian King Ahasuerus.</p>

KARKOR
(Karʹkor).
The campsite E of the Jordan from which the remaining forces of Midianite Kings Zebah and Zalmunna were routed by Judge Gideon’s surprise military maneuver. (Judg. 8:10, 11) Karkor’s exact location is today unknown. Some geographers, however, tentatively identify it with Qarqar, located over a hundred miles (161 kilometers) E of the Dead Sea. Whether Gideon’s tired foot soldiers traveled that distance in pursuit of the enemy may be subject to doubt.—Compare Judges 8:4, 5.

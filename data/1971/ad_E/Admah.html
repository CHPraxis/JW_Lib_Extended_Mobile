<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the five cities in the region of the “Low Plain of Siddim” inhabited by Canaanites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:19-1:10:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14:1-3</a>) This low plain or vale was evidently at the southern end of the Salt Sea, below the Lisan or “tongue” that extends out into the sea. Along with the neighboring cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Zeboiim and Bela (Zoar), Admah and its king, Shinab, suffered defeat at the time of the invasion by four eastern kings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:8-1:14:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 14:8-11</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:29:23-5:29:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> shows that Admah was later destroyed along with Sodom, Gomorrah and Zeboiim when Jehovah caused a rain of fire and sulphur to descend upon the entire basin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:25-1:19:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 19:25</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:11:8-28:11:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hosea 11:8</a> it is referred to, along with Zeboiim, as a warning example.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is probable that the original sites of Admah and the other “cities of the District” now lie submerged beneath the waters of the Salt Sea.</p>

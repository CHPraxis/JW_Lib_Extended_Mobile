<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-shitʹtah) [house of the acacia].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town mentioned in describing the line of flight followed by the Midianites after their rout in the low plain of Jezreel by Judge Gideon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:22-7:7:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 7:22</a>) <span id="page227" class="pageNum" data-no="227" data-before-text="227"></span>Since the Midianites were heading for the region of the Jordan, Beth-shittah must be located somewhere to the E or SE of the hill of Moreh and the well of Harod, in which vicinity the battle took place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:1-7:7:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 7</a>:l) Shattah, about three miles (5 kilometers) E of modern ʽEn-Harod, is suggested by some as the likely location and one giving evidence of the original name. Others consider it too near to the scene of the battle and recommend a location more to the SE, though offering no definite identification.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Zoʹphim) [Heb., <em>tsoh·phimʹ;</em> watchers].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A field on the top of Pisgah where Balaam built seven altars, where sacrifices were offered and where the prophet took up one of his proverbial utterances regarding Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:14-4:23:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 23:14-24</a>) The name Zophim seems to be preserved at Tela ʽat es-Safa near the suggested location of Pisgah, E of the N end of the Dead Sea. Other scholars, however, translate the word <em>tsoh·phimʹ</em> rather than considering it a proper name, using such expressions as “the field of the watchmen.”—<em>Le;</em> compare <em>JB, NE</em> (1970 ed.).</p>

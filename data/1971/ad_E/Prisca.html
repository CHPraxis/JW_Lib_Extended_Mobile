<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Prisʹca) [old woman]; <strong>Priscilla</strong> (Pris·cilʹla) [little old woman].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The shorter form of the name is found in Paul’s writings, the longer form in Luke’s. Such a variation was common in Roman names.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Priscilla was the wife of Aquila, with whom she is always mentioned. The two showed fine Christian works and hospitality, not only to individuals, but also by having congregation meetings in their home in both Rome and Ephesus.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Because of Emperor Claudius’ decree, Aquila and his wife left Rome and went to Corinth in 50 C.E. Not long after their arrival Paul joined them in tent-making. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:2-44:18:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 18:2, 3</a>) They traveled on with Paul to Ephesus, remained there for a time, and were instrumental in ‘expounding the way of God more correctly’ to the eloquent Apollos. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:18-44:18:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 18:18, 19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:24-44:18:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:19-46:16:19" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 16:19</a>) Returning to Rome for a time (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:3-45:16:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 16:3-5</a>), they later traveled back to Ephesus.

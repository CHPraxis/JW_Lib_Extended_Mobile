<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A semiprecious gemstone, a hard variety of agate; the term also applies to a banded form of chalcedony. The onyx has white layers alternating with black, brown, red, gray or green. The pale color produced by the combination of the red layers showing through the translucent white layers of this stone evidently reminded the Greeks of the fingernail, which in Greek is <em>oʹnyx.</em> From early times, onyx has been prized for ornaments, rings and beads. The varicolored layers made it especially popular for cameo work.</p>

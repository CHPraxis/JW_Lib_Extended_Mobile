JADON
(Jaʹdon) [perhaps, Jah judges; or, frail one].
A Meronothite who helped Nehemiah rebuild Jerusalem’s wall in 455 B.C.E. Jadon was apparently from the vicinity of Mizpah.—Neh. 3:7.
Josephus calls the unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 13 “Jadon.”—Antiquities of the Jews, Book VIII, chap. VIII, par. 5; chap. IX, par. 1.

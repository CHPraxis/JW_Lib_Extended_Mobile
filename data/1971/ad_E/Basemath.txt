BASEMATH
(Basʹe·math) [fragrant].
1. A wife of Esau. She was a daughter of Elon the Hittite, therefore either the same person as Adah or her sister. Basemath was “a source of bitterness” to Isaac and Rebekah.—Gen. 26:34, 35; 27:46; 28:8; 36:2.
2. Another wife of Esau, possibly the same as Mahalath. She was a daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, sister of Nebaioth, and therefore Esau’s first cousin. Esau took her as wife after seeing his father’s great displeasure over his Canaanite wives. She bore his son Reuel.—Gen. 28:8, 9; 36:3, 4, 10.
3. A daughter of Solomon and wife of Ahimaaz, one of Solomon’s food deputies.—1 Ki. 4:7, 15.

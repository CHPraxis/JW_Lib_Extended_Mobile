<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(A·biʹud) [probably from the Hebrew <em>ʼAvi·hudhʹ,</em> meaning “the father of renown” or “the father is majesty”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greekized or Anglicized form of the Hebrew name Abihud. A descendant of Zerubbabel and an ancestor of Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:13-40:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 1:13</a>) The term “father” as used by Matthew may have the meaning of “forefather.” Some authorities suggest that he may be the same as “Joda” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:26-42:3:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 3:26</a>. However, it is not necessary to relate these persons as being the same individual, since the genealogical lines given by Matthew and Luke are only parallel, not identical, while those at 1 Chronicles are independent. Abiud’s son, Eliakim, is also included in the line of descent of the Messiah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:13-40:1:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 1:13</a>.</p>

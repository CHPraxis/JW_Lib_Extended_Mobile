MALCHAM
(Malʹcham) [their king].
Thought to be the same as the Ammonite god Milcom or Molech. (Also called “Malcam,” at 1 Chronicles 20:1, 2.) Malcham is mentioned at Jeremiah 49:1, 3 in connection with the sons of Ammon, and the name in the Masoretic text differs from Milcom, “the disgusting thing of the Ammonites,” only in the vowel-pointing of the Hebrew. (1 Ki. 11:5) Contrary to the instruction given at Joshua 23:7, the Jews began making sworn oaths by Malcham. (Zeph. 1:5) It must be determined from context when the Hebrew should be rendered as the name of the god and when as “their king.”—Amos 1:15; see MOLECH.

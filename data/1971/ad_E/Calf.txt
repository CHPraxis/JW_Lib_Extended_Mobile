CALF
The Hebrew word ʽeʹghel, generally rendered “calf” in various Bible translations, denotes a male young neat, a young bull. Calves were offered in sacrifice (Lev. 9:2, 3), and on special occasions or under special circumstances the fattened calf was slaughtered and prepared for the table (Gen. 18:7, 8; 1 Sam. 28:24; Luke 15:23) In Scripture repeated mention is also made of the calf in connection with idolatrous calf worship.—Ex. 32:4, 8, 19, 20; 1 Ki. 12:28, 32; 2 Chron. 11:15; Neh. 9:18; Hos. 8:5, 6; 13:2; see CALF WORSHIP.
‘Cutting the calf in two and passing between its parts’ alludes to an ancient mode of entering into a solemn obligation or covenant. (Compare Genesis 15:9-21.) Doubtless Jeremiah used this expression to stress the sacredness of the covenant into which the Jews had entered before God, and by the terms of which they were obligated to liberate fellow Israelites whom they had enslaved.—Jer. 34:17-19.
The calf is also spoken of illustratively in the Scriptures. For instance, unfaithful Israel was corrected like an inexperienced ‘calf that had not been trained’ to the yoke. (Jer. 31:18) Egypt’s mercenary soldiers are likened to fattened calves that would prove to be unable to resist the Babylonians and would take to flight. (Jer. 46:21, 26) At the time the wicked and presumptuous ones are reduced to dust, the fearers of God’s name are shown going forth and pawing the ground like fattened calves released from the stall.—Mal. 4:1, 2; see BULL; COW.

HOHAM
(Hoʹham).
King of Hebron; one of the five kings who went up to war against Gibeon because it had made peace with Joshua and the Israelites. These five kings were defeated when Joshua came to the aid of the Gibeonites. After being put to death, they were hung upon stakes until the evening and were thereafter thrown into a cave.—Josh. 10:1-27.

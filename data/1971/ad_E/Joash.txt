JOASH
(Jo·ash).
In Hebrew this name is spelled two ways, though in English only as “Joash.” The first and more common, Yoh·ʼashʹ, is a shortened form of Jehoash, meaning “Jehovah is strong” or “Jehovah has bestowed”; the second, Yoh·ʽashʹ, means “Jehovah has come to help, or, aid.”—Numbers 1 and 5 listed below are the latter spelling.
1. A Benjamite in the family line of Becher.—1 Chron. 7:6, 8.
2. A descendant of Judah through his third-named son Shelah.—1 Chron. 2:3; 4:21, 22.
3. The father of Judge Gideon; an Abi-ezrite of the tribe of Manasseh. (Judg. 6:11, 15; 7:14; 8:13, 32) Joash was evidently a man of considerable means and influence in the community, possessing an altar dedicated to Baal, also a “sacred pole,” and having a household of servants. When his son Gideon secretly tore down this altar and sacred pole, and in their place built an altar to Jehovah upon which he sacrificed a seven-year-old bull, the citizens of the place demanded that Joash hand over his son to be put to death. Joash’s answer: “If [Baal] is God, let him make a legal defense for himself.” And with that Joash began calling his son Jerubbaal.—Judg. 6:25-32; 8:29.
4. One of the mighty men of the tribe of Benjamin that joined David’s forces at Ziklag when the latter was outlawed by Saul; son or descendant of Shemaah.—1 Chron. 12:1-3.
5. A chief appointed by King David to oversee the oil supplies.—1 Chron. 27:28, 31.
6. Son of King Ahab and one of those into whose custody the faithful prophet Micaiah was committed for imprisonment.—1 Ki. 22:26, 27; 2 Chron. 18:25, 26.
7. Shortened form of Jehoash, king of Judah and son of Ahaziah. (2 Ki. 11:2, 3, 21) Joash as an alternate spelling for Jehoash occurs many times in the Masoretic Hebrew text, as pointed out in footnotes of the New World Translation, 1955 edition.—2 Ki. 12:19, 20; 1 Chron. 3:11; 2 Chron. 24:1, 2; see JEHOASH No. 1.
8. Shortened form of Jehoash, king of Israel, son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu. (2 Ki. 14:1, 8, 9) This alternate spelling (Joash) often occurs in the Masoretic text.—2 Ki. 13:9, 12, 13; 2 Chron. 25:17, 18, 21; NW, 1955 ed., ftns.; Hos. 1:1; Amos 1:1; see JEHOASH No. 2.

ELIZUR
(E·liʹzur) [God is a rock].
Son of Shedeur of the tribe of Reuben; one of the twelve chieftains who assisted Moses and Aaron in numbering the sons of Israel. (Num. 1:1-3, 5, 17; 2:10; 10:18) In addition to sharing in the group presentation made by the chieftains after the setting up of the tabernacle, Elizur represented his tribe individually as its chieftain in presenting an offering on the fourth day for the inauguration of the altar.—Num. 7:1, 2, 10, 30-35.

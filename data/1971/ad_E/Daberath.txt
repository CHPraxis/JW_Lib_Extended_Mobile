DABERATH
(Dabʹe·rath).
A ‘city’ mentioned in the boundary list of Zebulun (Josh. 19:10, 12) but considered as belonging to the neighboring tribe of Issachar when later apportioned with its pasture grounds to Levites of the family of Gershon. (Josh. 21:27, 28; 1 Chron. 6:71, 72) Daberath is not included in the list of sites assigned to Issachar, but many authorities think it is likely represented by Rabbith at Joshua 19:20, a view that finds support in some editions of the Greek Septuagint.—See RABBITH.
Daberath is identified by Biblical geographers today with ruins near the village of Deburiyeh on the western edge of Mount Tabor.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A hard, durable, usually green-colored ornamental stone used for jewelry and carvings. It occurs as two distinct minerals, “nephrite” and “jadeite.” Nephrite (true jade) is the most common variety. It varies in density from translucent to opaque and is found in colors such as dark green, black, gray, yellow and white. Jadeite is more valuable than nephrite due to its more attractive coloring and rarity. Jade is particularly suitable for carving and engraving because of its composition.</p>

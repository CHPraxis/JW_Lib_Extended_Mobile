PIRAM
(Piʹram) [probably wild ass].
The Amorite king of Jarmuth at the time Israel entered the Promised Land. Piram joined with four other Amorite kings in a conspiracy against the Gibeonites, who had made peace with Joshua. In the battle that followed, Piram and the other kings took refuge in a cave at Makkedah, which the Israelites sealed up until the fighting was over. Piram and the others were then slain, hung on stakes until evening and entombed in the same cave.—Josh. 10:1-27.

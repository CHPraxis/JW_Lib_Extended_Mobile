ADJUTANT
[Heb., sha·lishʹ, third man, referring to the third warrior in a war chariot].
The word sha·lishʹ has been translated in various Bible versions as “captain,” “chariot-leader,” “lord,” “warrior,” “adjutant.”
Some monumental inscriptions illustrating “Hittite” and Assyrian war chariots show three men: one, the driver; another, the fighter with the sword, lance or bow, and a third, the carrier of the shield. Though no monuments have been found showing Egyptian three-manned chariots, the term is used at Exodus 14:7 with respect to Pharaoh’s charioteers. The third chariot warrior, usually the one carrying the shield, was an assistant commander in the war chariot, an adjutant. The English word “adjutant” literally means “one that helps: assistant.”
After mentioning that none of the sons of Israel were constituted slaves by Solomon, 1 Kings 9:22 states: “For they were the warriors and his servants and his princes and his adjutants and chiefs of his charioteers and of his horsemen.” C. F. Keil, in Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament, states that the term sha·li·shimʹ (plural), used in this passage, could be understood as “royal adjutants, captains over the royal war-chariots and cavalry.”
In the days of King Jehoram of Israel, the Syrians put Samaria under siege, which in time caused famine conditions within the city. When Elisha prophesied that there would be plenty of food, Jehoram’s special adjutant ridiculed the prophecy. As Elisha had foretold, the adjutant saw the fulfilment of the prophecy but did not get to eat any of the food, being trampled to death in the gateway.—2 Ki. 7:2, 16-20.
At Jehu’s command, his runners and adjutants, likely including Bidkar, struck down the Baal worshipers. (2 Ki. 9:25; 10:25) Pekah, another adjutant referred to in the Scriptures, assassinated Pekahiah the king of Israel and succeeded him to the throne.—2 Ki. 15:25; see Ezekiel 23:15, NW, ftn., 1960 ed.

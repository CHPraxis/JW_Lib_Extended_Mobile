<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Athʹa·rim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Israelites are reported to have traveled “by the way of Atharim” when journeying to the Promised Land from Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Hor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:1-4:21:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 21:1</a>) They were thereupon attacked by the king of Arad in the Negeb region. Atharim may refer to a place or to a particular route, but as yet the location is unknown. In the itinerary of the nation’s travel through the wilderness compiled by Moses at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:1-4:33:56" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers chapter 33</a>, Atharim does not appear as one of the stopping places. Lexicographers Brown, Driver and Briggs (<em>Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> p. 87) relate Atharim to an Arabic word meaning footprint or track and suggest that Atharim may refer to a caravan route. One such trade route passed near Kadesh-barnea and then turned north, passing through Beer-sheba, not far from the proposed site of Arad.</p>

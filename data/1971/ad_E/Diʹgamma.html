<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A letter appearing in the ancient Greek alphabet but which went out of general use at an early period. It was retained, however, as a numeral denoting the number 6. The name <em>diʹgam·ma</em> given the letter is due to its resemblance to two capital <em>gamʹma</em> letters on top of each other (====). Some suggest that it corresponded to the Hebrew <em>waw</em> (====) and had the sound of “v” or “w.” In the Greek manuscript that John wrote, the number 666 as found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:18-66:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 13:18</a> may have been represented by the three Greek letters: <em>Khi</em> (==== =six hundred), <em>Xi</em> (==== =sixty) and <em>Diʹgam·ma</em> (==== = six).</p>

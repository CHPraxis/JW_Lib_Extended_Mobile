KOHATH
(Koʹhath) [assembly].
The second named of the three sons of Levi (Gen. 46:11; Ex. 6:16; 1 Chron. 6:1) and father of Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. (Ex. 6:18; Num. 3:19; 1 Chron. 6:2) He was the progenitor of the Kohathites, one of the three main divisions of the Levites. (Num. 3:17, 27) He was likely born in the land of Canaan, and is listed among the sixty-six souls who “came to Jacob into Egypt.” (Gen. 46:8, 11, 26; see, however, BENJAMIN No. 1.) Kohath’s descendants included Moses, Aaron, Miriam (Ex. 6:18, 20; Num. 26:58, 59) and rebellious Korah. (Num. 16:1-3) Kohath lived 133 years.—Ex. 6:18.

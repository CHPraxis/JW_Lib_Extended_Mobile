CHERITH, TORRENT VALLEY OF
(Cheʹrith) [perhaps, cut].
A site where Elijah concealed himself and was fed by ravens after announcing a coming drought to Israel’s King Ahab.—1 Ki. 17:1-7.
Some geographers, on the basis of the expression “east [Hebrew, ʽal penehʹ] of the Jordan” (17:3, AT, JB, NW, RS), have tentatively identified Cherith with the Wadi el-Yabis in Gilead, a stream flowing into the Jordan about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) SE of Beth-shean. Others, however, hold the view that this same Hebrew expression may also be rendered “on the front of” or “before the Jordan” (Yg, AS), implying that Cherith could have been situated on either side of the Jordan River. Additionally, they consider it unlikely that the torrent valley of Cherith would be identified with a location so near Elijah’s Gilead home (17:1), for such a hiding place would obviously be investigated by Ahab’s forces in their search for the prophet. (18:10) In view of these factors, the location remains unidentifiable.

KHI
or, as commonly anglicized, chi [Χ, χ]. The twenty-second letter of the Greek alphabet, having a sound similar to the ch in the Scottish loch, German ich, or kh in the English word elkhorn. Numerically, when accented it denotes 600 (χ’) and, with the subscript (,χ), 600,000.
The letter khi (χ) is the first letter in the word “Christ” in the Greek. It is, therefore, often employed as a symbol for the name Christ, as in the word “Xmas.”
In this work the Greek khi is transliterated as kh.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A yellow nonmetallic element occurring free or combined with other elements in sulfide and sulfate compounds. Its melting point is unusually low, 235° F. (113° C.). It readily burns with a yellowish flame and with a distinctive suffocating odor.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first historical reference to sulfur tells how destruction rained down on the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah in the form of fire and sulfur. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:24-1:19:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 19:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:29-42:17:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 17:29</a>) On the basis of geological evidence some suggest that this catastrophic execution from Jehovah was possibly in the form of a volcanic eruption in the southern region of the Dead Sea, accounting for the prevalence of sulfur in that area today.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ever since the fiery judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah in 1919 B.C.E., the highly flammable nature of sulfur has been referred to in the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:33-23:30:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 30:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:9-23:34:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 34:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:17-66:9:18" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Rev. 9:17, 18</a>) It is a symbol of total desolation.

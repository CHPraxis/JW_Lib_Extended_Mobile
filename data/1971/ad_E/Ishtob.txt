ISHTOB
(Ishʹtob) [man of Tob (good)].
One of the small kingdoms that provided fighting men for the sons of Ammon to use against David. The forces from “Ishtob” and their allies were defeated. (2 Samuel chapter 10, AT, AV, NW, Yg) Most translators and geographers consider that Ishtob should be rendered “men of Tob,” referring to “the land of Tob” where Jephthah resided. (Judg. 11:3-11; see 2 Samuel 10:6, 8, AS, JB, JP, RS.) However, the reading “Ishtob” has the support of certain ancient versions. (Compare Bagster’s LXX [translated from Greek]; La [from Syriac]; and Dy [from Latin].) The location of an ancient Ishtob is not now known.—See TOB.

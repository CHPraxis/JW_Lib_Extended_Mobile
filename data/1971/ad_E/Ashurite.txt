ASHURITE
(Ashʹur·ite).
A people subject to the kingship of Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son. At 2 Samuel 2:9 they are listed between Gilead and Jezreel. The Vulgate and Syriac versions here read “Geshurites,” while the Targums say “Asherites.” (Compare Judges 1:32.) The name Asshurim is used at Genesis 25:3, but there refers to Arabic descendants of Abraham through Dedan. The identification of the “Ashurites” is therefore conjectural.

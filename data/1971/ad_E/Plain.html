<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Relatively level land, in contrast to hilly or mountainous country. The Hebrew Scriptures are quite explicit in their use of different words to identify or describe various types of land.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew term <em>ʽara·vahʹ</em> is used both as a name for a specific area and a word descriptive of a certain type of land. (See ARABAH.) When used without the definite article, <em>ʽara·vahʹ</em> indicates a desert plain or steppe, such as those of Moab and Jericho. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:1-4:22:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 22:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:1-4:35:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 35:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:10-6:5:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Josh. 5:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:32-6:13:32" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 13:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:8-24:52:8" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> Jer. 52:8</a>) Though there might be rivers to provide some water for the area, <em>ʽara·vahʹ</em> generally emphasizes that the plain is an arid one. Thus it would be quite a reversal for the fertile, watered plain of Sharon to become like the desert plain (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:9-23:33:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 33:9</a>), or for torrents of water to come to the desert plain.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 35:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:6-23:35:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:3-23:51:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 51:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The word <em>biq·ʽahʹ</em> indicated a wide plain bounded by mountains. It comes from a root meaning “to cleave, to rend, to divide,” and can be accurately rendered “valley plain.” Even today the broad valley plain between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains is known as <em>el-Biqaʽ.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:17-6:11:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Josh. 11:17</a>) Often in the Scriptures <em>biq·ʽahʹ</em> or “valley plain” is set in contrast to mountains or hills (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:7-5:8:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 8:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:11-5:11:11" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 11:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:8-19:104:8" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 104:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:18-23:41:18" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Isa. 41:18</a>) or to rugged or rough ground. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:4-23:40:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 40:4</a>) The related Aramaic word appearing at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:1-27:3:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 3:1</a> is frequently translated just “plain,” referring to the place where Nebuchadnezzar erected the gold image.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A long low plain was designated in Hebrew <em>ʽeʹmeq.</em> The word signifies “a long broad sweep between parallel ranges of hills of less extent than the preceding term [<em>biq·ʽah</em>ʹ], . . . [<em>ʽeʹmeq</em>] having the idea of lowness and breadth rather than precipitateness or confinement.” (M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopaedia,</em> Vol. X, p. 703) The Hebrew word is applied to many different localities, such as “the low plain of Achor,” “the low plain of Aijalon” and “the low plain of Rephaim.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:26-6:7:26" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:12-6:10:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:15-13:11:15" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Baʹmoth-baʹal) [high places of Baal].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in Moab to which Balak, the king of Moab, conducted the prophet Balaam so that he might see the camp of Israel and call down a curse upon it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:41-4:22:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 22:41</a>) Balak’s selection of this location for the enacting of the curse and the accompanying sacrifices may indicate that it was a center for Baal worship, evidently situated in an elevated place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:1-4:23:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 23:1-9</a>) Thereafter, Bamoth-baal and other towns “on the tableland” were assigned to the tribe of Reuben as an inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:15-6:13:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 13:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:17-6:13:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 17</a>) In the latter part of the tenth century B.C.E. King Mesha of Moab states that he rebuilt “Beth-bamoth, for it had been destroyed.” (Line 27 of the Moabite Stone) It seems likely that Bamoth, Bamoth-baal and Beth-bamoth were all names of the same place.—Compare Baal-meon, Beon, Beth-baal-meon in the article on BAAL-MEON.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The description given in the Bible account indicates a place on the plateau region toward the NE corner of the Dead Sea. While the identification is only tentative, a suggested location is that of Khirbet el-Quweiqiyeh, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) E of the Dead Sea, near the probable location of Mount Nebo.</p>

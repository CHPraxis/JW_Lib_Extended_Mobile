<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[כ; final, ך].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The eleventh letter of the Hebrew alphabet; later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, used also as a number to denote twenty. It is one of five Hebrew letters that have a different form when used as the final letter of a word. In Hebrew, <em>kaph</em> means “palm of hand.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From the letter <em>kaph</em> the Greek letter <em>kapʹpa</em> is derived, and, in turn, the Latin and English “k” is derived from <em>kapʹpa.</em> In sound <em>kaph</em> corresponds to <em>kh</em> when not having the point (dagesh lene) in it; but with this point in it (כּ), it becomes hard like our English “k.” In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:81-19:119:88" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:81-88</a>. The letters <em>kaph</em> [כ] and <em>behth</em> [ב] are similar in appearance.</p>

ADDAR
(Adʹdar) [amplitude, or wide, open place].
1. A son of Bela, a Benjamite.—1 Chron. 8:1, 3.
2. A southern border town of Judah located near Kadesh-barnea. (Josh. 15:3) In Joshua’s account it is listed as lying between Hezron and Karka, but at Numbers 34:4 it appears that the name “Hezron” (meaning “enclosure”) is combined with Addar to form Hazar-addar, since the accounts are parallel. The book Biblical Archaeology (by G. Ernest Wright, p. 71) suggests as a possible location that of ʽAin el-Qudeirat, where a perennial spring waters a small but fertile valley. It lies about five miles (8 kilometers) from ʽAin Qedeis, the possible location of Kadesh-barnea.

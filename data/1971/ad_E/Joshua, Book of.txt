JOSHUA, BOOK OF
This Bible book provides a vital link in the history of the Israelites by showing how God’s promises to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were fulfilled. Probably covering a period of more than twenty years (1473-c. 1450 B.C.E.), it tells of the conquest of Canaan, followed by the distribution of the land to the Israelites, and concludes with Joshua’s discourses encouraging faithfulness to Jehovah.
The fact that the book contains ancient names for cities (Josh. 14:15; 15:15) and detailed instructions and then relates how these were carried out indicates that it is a contemporary record. (For examples see Joshua 1:11-18; 2:14-22; 3:2–4:24; 6:22, 23.) In fact, the writer identifies himself as living at the same time as Rahab of Jericho and therefore as an eyewitness.—Josh. 6:25.
AUTHENTICITY
In the estimation of some, however, the book of Joshua is not true history. This view is primarily based on the assumption that, since the miracles mentioned in the book are foreign to recent human experience, they could not have happened. It therefore calls into question God’s ability to perform miracles, if not also his existence, as well as the writer’s integrity. For the writer to have embellished his account with fiction while presenting himself as an eyewitness would have made him guilty of deliberate deceit. Surely it is illogical to conclude that a book that honors God as the Fulfiller of his word (Josh. 21:43-45), encourages faithfulness to him (Josh. 23:6-16; 24:14, 15, 19, 20, 23) and openly acknowledges Israel’s failures was produced by a false witness.—Josh. 7:1-5; 18:3.
No one can deny that the Israelite nation came into existence and occupied the land described in the book of Joshua. Likewise, there is no valid basis for challenging the truthfulness of that book’s account concerning the way in which the Israelites gained possession of Canaan. Neither the psalmists (Ps. 44:1-3; 78:54, 55; 105:42-45; 135:10-12; 136:17-22), Nehemiah (9:22-25), the first Christian martyr Stephen (Acts 7:45), the disciple James (Jas. 2:25) nor the learned apostle Paul (Acts 13:19; Heb. 4:8; 11:30, 31) doubted its authenticity. And 1 Kings 16:34 records the fulfillment of Joshua’s prophetic curse uttered about five hundred years earlier at the time of Jericho’s destruction.—Josh. 6:26.
WRITER
Some scholars, although acknowledging the book to have been written in or near the time of Joshua, reject the traditional Jewish view that Joshua himself wrote it. Their main objection is that some of the events recorded in the book of Joshua also appear in the book of Judges, which commences with the words, “And after the death of Joshua.” (Judg. 1:1) Nevertheless, this opening statement is not necessarily a time indicator for all the events found in the Judges account. The book is not arranged in strict chronological order, for it mentions an event that definitely is placed before Joshua’s death. (Judg. 2:6-9) Therefore, some things, such as the capture of Hebron by Caleb (Josh. 15:13, 14; Judg. 1:9, 10), Debir by Othniel (Josh. 15:15-19; Judg. 1:11-15) and Leshem or Laish (Dan) by the Danites (Josh. 19:47, 48; Judg. 18:27-29) could likewise have taken place before Joshua’s death. Even the action of the Danites in setting up an idolatrous image at Laish could reasonably fit Joshua’s time. (Judg. 18:30, 31) In his concluding exhortation, Joshua told the Israelites: “Remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.” (Josh. 24:14) Had idolatry not existed, this statement would have had little meaning.
Logically, then, with the exception of the concluding portion that reports his death, the book may be attributed to Joshua. As Moses had recorded the happenings of his lifetime, so it would have been fitting for Joshua to do likewise. The book itself reports: “Then Joshua wrote these words in the book of God’s law.”—Josh. 24:26.
NOT CONTRADICTORY
Some have felt that the book is contradictory in making it appear that the land was completely subdued by Joshua while at the same time reporting that much of it remained to be taken. (Compare Joshua 11:16, 17, 23; 13:1.) But such seeming discrepancies are easily resolved when one bears in mind that there were two distinct aspects in the conquest. First, national warfare under Joshua’s leadership broke the power of the Canaanites. Next, individual and tribal action was required to take full possession of the land. (Josh. 17:14-18; 18:3) Probably while Israel was warring elsewhere, the Canaanites reestablished themselves in cities such as Debir and Hebron so that these had to be retaken by individual or tribal effort.—Compare Joshua 11:21-23 with Joshua 14:6, 12; 15:13-17.

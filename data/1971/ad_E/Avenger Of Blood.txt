AVENGER OF BLOOD
The Hebrew word go·ʼelʹ (which has been applied to a blood avenger) is a participle of ga·ʼalʹ, meaning “to recover, reclaim, repurchase or redeem.” In Hebrew law the term originally applied to the nearest male relative, who was under obligation to avenge the blood of one who had been killed. (Num. 35:19) In time go·ʼelʹ was expanded in meaning to include a “kinsman with the right to repurchase (or redeem).”—Lev. 25:48, 49; see REPURCHASE, REPURCHASER.
The avenging of blood is based on the mandate regarding the sanctity of blood and human life stated to Noah wherein Jehovah said: “Your blood of your souls shall I ask back. . . . from the hand of each one who is his brother, shall I ask back the soul of man. Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image he made man.” (Gen. 9:5, 6) A deliberate murderer was to be put to death by the “avenger of blood,” and no ransom was to be accepted for such a murderer. (Num. 35:19-21, 31) David was displeased when Joab and Abishai killed Abner on the pretext of avenging the blood of their brother Asahel, for as a matter of fact, Abner in battle killed Asahel in self-defense and only after due warning; hence no avenging of blood was required.—2 Sam. 2:22, 23; 3:27-30.
Jehovah will see to it that the innocent blood of all his faithful servants is avenged in due time.—Deut. 32:43; Rev. 6:9-11.
Jehovah’s just laws made a clear distinction between willful and accidental killing. For the latter, cities of refuge were lovingly provided for the protection of accidental manslayers from avengers of blood. (Num. 35:6-29; Deut. 19:2-13; Josh. 20:2-9) Also, legal courts were established to hear cases involving questions of bloodguilt.—Deut. 17:8, 9; 2 Chron. 19:10.

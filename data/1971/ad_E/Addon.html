<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently an unidentified location in Babylonia, from which some returning to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E., at the end of the seventy-year desolation of Judah, were unable to establish their genealogy from the public records. As a consequence, they were disqualified from serving in the priesthood. Other authorities think Addon was an individual who was unable to prove his ancestry.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:59-15:2:62" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 2:59-62;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:61-16:7:64" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:61-64</a>.</p>

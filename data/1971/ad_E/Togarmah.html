<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A son of Gomer the son of Japheth, hence a great-grandson of Noah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:1-1:10:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:4-13:1:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:4-6</a>) The name apparently came to apply as well to the region occupied by his descendants. In Ezekiel’s dirge concerning Tyre, Togarmah is mentioned as the source of “horses and steeds and mules,” for which Tyre traded certain goods. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:2-26:27:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:14-26:27:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>) The same prophet lists Togarmah among Gog of Magog’s allies and gives its situation as among the peoples of “the remotest parts of the north.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:6-26:38:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many commentators connect Togarmah with the Armenians. The Armenians themselves traditionally claim to be descended from “Haik, son of <em>Thorgom.”</em> Ancient Greek writers speak of the Armenians as famed for their horses and mules.</p>

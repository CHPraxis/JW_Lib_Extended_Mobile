<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A dispute (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:8-5:17:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 17:8</a>), controversy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:31-24:25:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 25:31</a>) or case at law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:20-24:11:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 11:20</a>) The Scriptures counsel against becoming involved in quarrels or disputes without cause, labeling this as an act engaged in by someone stupid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:30-20:3:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 3:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:6-20:18:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 18:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:3-20:20:3" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 20:3</a>) Says the proverb: “As one grabbing hold of the ears of a dog is anyone passing by that is becoming furious at the quarrel that is not his.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:17-20:26:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 26:17</a>) Since the ‘squeezing out of anger’ results in quarreling (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:33-20:30:33" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 30:33</a>), slowness to anger has the opposite effect.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:18-20:15:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 15:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Quarreling destroys a peaceful atmosphere (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:1-20:17:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 17:1</a>) and may cause even the meekest of persons to lose self-control. For example, Israel’s quarreling about there being no water at Kadesh prompted Moses and Aaron to act rashly, thereby losing the privilege of entering the Promised Land. Israel’s unjustified quarreling with Jehovah’s representatives actually constituted a quarrel with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:2-4:20:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Num. 20:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:10-4:20:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:14-4:27:14" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 27:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:32-19:106:32" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Ps. 106:32</a>) Those who become similarly involved in quarreling or violent controversies with God’s servants are in a very serious position, one that can lead to death.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:8-23:41:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:11-23:41:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:17-23:54:17" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 54:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Due to the detrimental effect of quarreling, the proverb counsels: “Before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:14-20:17:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 17:14</a>) Abram (Abraham) set a good example in this regard. Concerned that there be no disputes between his herdsmen and those of his nephew Lot, Abram suggested that they separate. Unselfishly he gave Lot the opportunity to choose the area where he would pasture his animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:7-1:13:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 13:7-11</a>) On the other hand, unfaithful Israelites in the time of Isaiah did not act like their forefather Abraham. Of them, it is said: “For quarreling and struggle you would fast.” They fasted, only to engage in more quarreling afterward.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:58:4-23:58:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 58:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Mosaic law covered cases of quarreling resulting in bodily injury. It prescribed paying compensation to the injured party for time lost from work.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:18-2:21:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 21:18, 19</a>.</p>

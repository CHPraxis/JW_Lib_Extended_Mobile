HEPHER
(Heʹpher) [waterpit].
1. A son of Gilead and great-grandson of Manasseh; ancestor of the Hepherites. (Num. 26:29, 30, 32; 27:1) Hepher was the father of Zelophehad, known for having no sons but five daughters whose case set a legal precedent in handling hereditary possessions when there was no male offspring.—Num. 26:33; 27:1-11; Josh. 17:2, 3.
2. A descendant of Judah; son of Ashhur by his wife Naarah.—1 Chron. 4:1, 5, 6.
3. A Mecherathite; one of David’s outstanding warriors.—1 Chron. 11:26, 36.
4. Apparently both a city and a district W of the Jordan. The king of the Canaanite city of Hepher was among those defeated by Joshua. (Josh. 12:7, 8, 17) In the time of Solomon, the district of Hepher, as well as Socoh, were under the jurisdiction of an appointed deputy. (1 Ki. 4:7, 10) The exact location of ancient Hepher is not definitely known. A commonly suggested identification is Tell Ibshar, about twenty-three miles (37 kilometers) N-NE of Tel Aviv.

CHESALON
(Chesʹa·lon) [possibly, back].
A city mentioned with Mount Jearim and serving to mark part of the N boundary of Judah. (Josh. 15:10) It is today commonly identified with Kesla, located about eleven miles (17.7 kilometers) W of Jerusalem, and its situation on a mountain ridge or “back” may help explain its Biblical name.

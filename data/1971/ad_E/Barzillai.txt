BARZILLAI
(Bar·zilʹlai) [man of iron].
1. A Meholathite whose son Adriel married Saul’s daughter Merab.—1 Sam. 18:19; 2 Sam. 21:8.
2. A wealthy Gileadite, “a very great man,” of the town of Rogelim. Barzillai was one of three who assisted David and his army with supplies of food and bedding during Absalom’s rebellion. (2 Sam. 17:27-29) When David returned to Jerusalem, Barzillai escorted the party to the Jordan, but due to his age (“I am eighty years old today”), he declined David’s offer to become part of the royal court, sending Chimham in his place. In saying farewell, David kissed and blessed him. (2 Sam. 19:31-40) Shortly before dying, David remembered Barzillai and requested Solomon to show kindness toward his sons, and that they “be among those eating at your table.”—1 Ki. 2:7.
3. A priest who married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite (most likely No. 2 above) and adopted his father-in-law’s name. His descendants, on return from Babylonian exile, were unable to find their registration in the genealogical records, and so were disqualified from the priesthood.—Ezra 2:61, 62; Neh. 7:63, 64.

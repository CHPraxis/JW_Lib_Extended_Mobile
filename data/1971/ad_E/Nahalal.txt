NAHALAL
(Na·halʹal) [perhaps, drinking place for flocks].
A city in Zebulun assigned to the Merarite Levites. (Josh. 19:10, 14, 15; 21:34, 35) It was also called Nahalol. Rather than driving out the Canaanites inhabiting this city as divinely instructed, the Zebulunites subjected them to forced labor. (Judg. 1:30; 2:2) It has been suggested that the site of Nahalal was perhaps at Tell el-Beida, about three miles (5 kilometers) to the SW of Maʽlul.

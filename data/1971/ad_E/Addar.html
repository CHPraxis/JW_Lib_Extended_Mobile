<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A southern border town of Judah located near Kadesh-barnea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:3-6:15:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 15:3</a>) In Joshua’s account it is listed as lying between Hezron and Karka, but at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:4-4:34:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 34:4</a> it appears that the name “Hezron” (meaning “enclosure”) is combined with Addar to form Hazar-addar, since the accounts are parallel. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> (by G. Ernest Wright, p. 71) suggests as a possible location that of ʽAin el-Qudeirat, where a perennial spring waters a small but fertile valley. It lies about five miles (8 kilometers) from ʽAin Qedeis, the possible location of Kadesh-barnea.</p>

ZEBOIIM
(Ze·boiʹim) [gazelles].
A site named in connection with the boundary of Canaanite territory. (Gen. 10:19) Zeboiim was one of the five city-states of the District that rebelled after twelve years of domination by Chedorlaomer. Its King Shemeber joined forces with the rulers of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Bela (Zoar), and apparently was vanquished with them in the Low Plain of Siddim by Chedorlaomer and his three confederates. This defeat resulted in the capture of Lot and Abraham’s subsequent victory over the Mesopotamian invaders. (Gen. 14:1-16) Later, Zeboiim was one of the wicked cities of the District destroyed by Jehovah along with Sodom and Gomorrah. (Gen. 19:24, 25; Deut. 29:22, 23; Hos. 11:8) Its exact site is unknown, but generally it is thought to have been located in the area now covered by the shallow waters at the S end of the Dead Sea.

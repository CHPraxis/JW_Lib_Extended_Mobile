<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Jaʹir) [Heb., <em>Ya·ʼirʹ,</em> he enlightens, one giving light].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A descendant of Judah through his grandson Hezron. Hezron married out of his tribe to a woman of Manasseh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:21-13:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:21, 22</a>) Jair is reckoned as a descendant of Manasseh rather than Judah, likely because of his exploits in the territory of Manasseh, having captured a number of tent cities and naming them after himself, which name they kept for many generations.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:41-4:32:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 32:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:14-5:3:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Deut. 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:30-6:13:30" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Josh. 13:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:13-11:4:13" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 4:13</a>; see HAVVOTH-JAIR.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. The seventh judge of Israel. Since he was a Gileadite of high standing and each of his thirty sons is connected with one of the above-mentioned tent cities of Jair, he was likely a descendant of No. 1 above. Jair judged Israel for twenty-two years, after which he died and was buried in Kamon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:10:3-7:10:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 10:3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. Father of Mordecai; tribe of Benjamin.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:5-17:2:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 2:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">4. [Heb., <em>Ya·ʽurʹ</em> or <em>Ya·ʽirʹ,</em> he arouses]. Father of the Elhanan who slew Goliath’s brother Lahmi. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:5-13:20:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 20:5</a>) The corresponding passage at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:19-10:21:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Samuel 21:19</a> evidently contains a copyist’s error.—See LAHMI.</p>

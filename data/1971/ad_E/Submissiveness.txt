SUBMISSIVENESS
The original-language words that convey the thought of submission are often used with reference to subordination or subjection to superiors, to law or to a particular arrangement of things. Included are the subjection of Jesus Christ to his Father (1 Cor. 15:27, 28), the Christian congregation to Jesus (Eph. 5:24) and to God (Heb. 12:9; Jas. 4:7), individual Christians to those taking the lead in the congregation (1 Cor. 16:15, 16; Heb. 13:17; 1 Pet. 5:5), Christian women to the arrangement in the congregation regarding teaching (1 Tim. 2:11), slaves to their owners (Titus 2:9; 1 Pet. 2:18), wives to their husbands (Eph. 5:22; Col. 3:18; Titus 2:5; 1 Pet. 3:1, 5), children to their parents (1 Tim. 3:4; compare Luke 2:51; Ephesians 6:1), and the ruled to the rulers or the superior authorities.—Rom. 13:1, 5; Titus 3:1; 1 Pet. 2:13; see HEADSHIP; OBEDIENCE; SUPERIOR AUTHORITIES.
The submissiveness or subjection that a Christian displays toward humans involves conscience and is governed by his relationship to God. Therefore, when submissiveness would lead to compromise or a violation of divine law, God rather than men must be obeyed. (Acts 5:29) Thus, Paul and Barnabas “did not yield by way of submission” to the false brothers who, contrary to God’s revealed purpose, advocated circumcision and adherence to the Mosaic law as requirements for gaining salvation.—Gal. 2:3-5; compare Acts 15:1, 24-29.
At 2 Corinthians 9:13 contributions made in behalf of needy fellow Christians are shown to be an evidence of an individual’s submissiveness to the good news, it being a Christian obligation to assist needy fellow believers.—Jas. 1:26, 27; 2:14-17.

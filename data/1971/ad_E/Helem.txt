HELEM
(Heʹlem).
Two names translated “Helem” in English are slightly different in Hebrew, giving them different meanings.
1. [Heb., Heʹlem, a stroke]. A descendant of Asher whose family is listed in the genealogy of the tribe. (1 Chron. 7:35, 40) He is likely the same as Hotham of verse 32.
2. [Heb., Hheʹlem, strength]. Also called Heldai, he was one who contributed gold and silver for High Priest Joshua’s crown after the remnant’s return from Babylon.—Zech. 6:10, 11, 14; see HELDAI No. 2.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in Benjamin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:21-6:18:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh 18:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:28-6:18:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) The bones of Saul and Jonathan were buried at Zela. Earlier, Saul’s father Kish had been interred there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:14-10:21:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 21:14</a>) Some identify Zela(h) with Khirbet Salah, located between Gibeon and Jerusalem. Some scholars think that in Joshua “Zelah” should be combined with the name that follows, “Ha-eleph”; however, see HA-ELEPH.</p>

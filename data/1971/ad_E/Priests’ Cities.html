<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">These were cities in the Promised Land that were set aside as places of residence for the Aaronic priests and their families. Of the forty-eight cities given to the tribe of Levi by Israel’s other tribes, thirteen particularly belonged to the Kohathite priests of Aaron’s family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:1-6:21:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 21:1-42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:54-13:6:81" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:54-81</a>) The tribes of Judah and Simeon gave them nine cities and four were given by the tribe of Benjamin. Thus, “all the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities and their pasture grounds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:4-6:21:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 21:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:9-6:21:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9-19</a>) These cities were Hebron (a city of refuge), Libnah, Jattir, Eshtemoa, Holon (apparently Hilen), Debir, Ain (Ashan), Juttah, Beth-shemesh, Gibeon, Geba, Anathoth and Almon (Alemeth), all except Juttah and Gibeon again being named at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:54-13:6:60" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:54-60</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">David sent word to priests in their various cities to gather together when he was about to bring the ark of Jehovah to Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:1-13:13:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 13:1-5</a>) And specific reference is made to the appointment of men to distribute contributed portions to their priestly brothers residing in priests’ cities during King Hezekiah’s reign.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:11-14:31:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:11-19</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the twin sons of Judah by his daughter-in-law Tamar. At birth, Perez’ brother Zerah started to emerge first, but withdrew and Perez came out first, producing a perineal rupture of Tamar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:24-1:38:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 38:24-30</a>) Perez retained priority over his brother and is always listed ahead of him, and his house became the more famous of the two. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:12-8:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ruth 4:12</a>) Perez and his own two sons, Hezron and Hamul, are listed among those of Jacob’s lineage coming into Egypt, where all three became heads of individual families in Judah.

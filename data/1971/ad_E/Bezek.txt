BEZEK
(Beʹzek) [lightning, or, perhaps, scattering, sowing].
1. The site at which Judah and Simeon defeated 10,000 Canaanite and Perizzite troops under Adoni-bezek. (Judg. 1:3-7) Some identify this Bezek with that of 1 Samuel 11:8 (No. 2, below) though such a view requires the assumption that Adoni-bezek came S to join other Canaanite forces but was met by Judah and Simeon, was chased N to Bezek and was defeated there. The context, however, seems to indicate a place in the general area of Jerusalem, whereas the Bezek of 1 Samuel 11:8 is in an extreme northern location in relation to Jerusalem and the territory occupied by Judah and Simeon. In view of these circumstances, Bezek, the city of Adoni-bezek, is tentatively located in the Shephelah region at the site of Khirbet Bezka, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) NE of Gezer.
2. The location where Saul assembled the sons of Israel and Judah to fight against the Ammonites who were camped against Jabesh in Gilead. (1 Sam. 11:8-11) The fact that this place was no more than a night’s march from Jabesh substantiates the view that it was located at the modern site of Khirbet Ibzik, thirteen miles (20.9 kilometers) NE of Shechem. A mountain W of Khirbet Ibzik rises 2,337 feet (713 meters) above sea level and may have provided a suitable place for Saul to reconnoiter his forces.

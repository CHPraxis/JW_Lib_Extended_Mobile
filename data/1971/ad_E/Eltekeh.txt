ELTEKEH
(Elʹte·keh) (Elteke).
A city of Dan (Josh. 19:44) given, with its pasture ground, to the Kohathite, Levites. (Josh. 21:20, 23) On the “Taylor Prism” Assyrian King Sennacherib (a contemporary of Hezekiah, 745-716 B.C.E.) boasts that he “besieged, captured, and sacked Eltekeh [Assyrian Altaqu]” after defeating Egyptian and Ethiopian forces “upon the plain of Eltekeh.”
Most authorities formerly placed Eltekeh at Khirbet el-Muqanna, about twenty-five miles (40.2 kilometers) W of Jerusalem. However, as a result of recent excavations, that site has since been connected with Biblical Ekron. Thus, while no certain identification is now possible, some tentatively locate Eltekeh at el-Mughar, a few miles NW of the above suggested site of Ekron.

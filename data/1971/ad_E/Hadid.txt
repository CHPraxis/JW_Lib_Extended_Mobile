HADID
(Haʹdid) [sharp].
An ancestral city of certain Benjamites returning from Babylonian exile (Ezra 2:1, 2, 33; Neh. 7:6, 7, 37; 11:31, 34), commonly identified with el-Haditheh, about three miles (5 kilometers) E-NE of Lod (Lydda). It is generally thought that Hadid is probably the same as the “Huditi” mentioned in the Karnak List of Thutmose III, and the “Adida” in the apocryphal book of First Maccabees (12:38; 13:13, RS, Catholic Edition), there described as being situated in the Shephelah and overlooking the coastal plain.

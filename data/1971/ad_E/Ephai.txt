EPHAI
(Eʹphai) [gloomy].
A Netophathite (Jer. 40:8) of the tribe of Judah (1 Chron. 2:50-54) whose sons were among the chiefs of the military forces who were not taken into Babylonian exile in 607 B.C.E. Ephai’s sons and other chiefs of the military forces and their men came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and he, in turn, swore to them that it would go well with them. (Jer. 40:7-9) Apparently Ishmael murdered the sons of Ephai when he killed Gedaliah.—Jer. 41:3.

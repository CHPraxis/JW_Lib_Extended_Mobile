OMER
(oʹmer).
A dry measure amounting to one-tenth of an ephah. (Ex. 16:16, 18, 22, 32, 33, 36) The ephah measure is calculated at .62 bushel (22 liters) on the basis of archaeological evidence concerning the capacity of the corresponding liquid-measure bath. (Compare Ezekiel 45:10, 11.) An omer measure would therefore equal two dry quarts (2.2 liters).
A comparison of the Hebrew text of Exodus 29:40 and Numbers 28:5 reveals that a ‘tenth part’ means a tenth of an ephah, or an omer. This provides a basis for rendering the Hebrew ‘tenth part’ as “tenth of an ephah.”—Num. 15:4, AT, JP, NW, Ro.

GILOH
(Giʹloh).
A city in the mountainous region of Judah (Josh. 15:48, 51) and the home of the traitor “Ahithophel the Gilonite.” (2 Sam. 15:12; 23:34) Though its exact location is unknown, some geographers tentatively identify Giloh with Khirbet Jala, somewhat less than seven miles (11.3 kilometers) N-NW of Hebron.

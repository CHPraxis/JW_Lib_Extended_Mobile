GEDOR
(Geʹdor) [warlike, wall, fortress, walled enclosure].
1. The son of Jeiel of the town of Gibeon. A member of the tribe of Benjamin, he was a great-uncle of King Saul.—1 Chron. 8:29-31; 9:35-39.
2. A son of Penuel of the tribe of Judah.—1 Chron. 4:4.
3. A son of Jered also of the tribe of Judah.—1 Chron. 4:18
4. A town in the mountainous region of Judah. (Josh. 15:48, 58) It is identified with Khirbet Gedur about seven miles (11.3 kilometers) N of Hebron. It may also be referred to at 1 Chronicles 4:18. The mention, in the same verse, of Soco and Zanoah, both of which appear elsewhere as names of towns, is thought by some to indicate that Gedor is likely also a town of which Jered was the founder or “father”; see, however, ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.
5. A town that apparently belonged to the tribe of Simeon. (1 Chron. 4:24, 39) The Septuagint Version here reads Geʹra·ra.
6. A place in Benjamin. (1 Chron. 12:1, 2, 7) The suggested location is Khirbet el-Gudeira, about ten miles (1.6 kilometers) NW of Jerusalem.

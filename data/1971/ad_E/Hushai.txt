HUSHAI
(Huʹshai) [hasty].
A loyal Archite friend of King David who helped thwart Absalom’s rebellion. (1 Chron. 27:33) Hushai, with his robe ripped and dirt on his head, met the fleeing king on the Mount of Olives. He followed David’s suggestion that he go back into the city, feign loyalty to Absalom, endeavor to frustrate Ahithophel’s counsel, and keep David informed through the priests Zadok and Abiathar. (2 Sam. 15:30, 32-37) At first Absalom was suspicious, but Hushai succeeded in winning his confidence. (2 Sam. 16:16-19) When Absalom called for Hushai’s opinion concerning the best military strategy, Hushai spoke contrary to Ahithophel and recommended a course that would in fact allow David time to get organized. Hushai presented his idea in a way that made it appear better to Absalom and his associates than Ahithophel’s advice to attack immediately. Hushai then informed the priests of what happened. (2 Sam. 17:1-16) Hushai’s counsel frustrated that of Ahithophel, just as David had petitioned God, and thus ‘Jehovah brought calamity upon Absalom.’—2 Sam. 15:31; 17:14; see FRIEND (COMPANION) OF THE KING.

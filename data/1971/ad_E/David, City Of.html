<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The name given to the “stronghold of Zion” after its capture from the Jebusites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:6-10:5:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:6-9</a>) This section is understood to be the spur or ridge that runs S from Mount Moriah. It thus lay S of the site of the temple later built by Solomon. Today this narrow southern plateau is considerably lower than Mount Moriah. Josephus claimed that the Maccabees (or Hasmonaeans) removed the crest of the hill in the second century B.C.E. so that it would not appear to rival the height of the temple area. So, it is possible that in ancient times its height may have been more comparable, though still beneath the height of the temple site.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This site was very suitable for a “stronghold,” since it was protected by deep valleys on three sides, on the W the Tyropean valley, and on the E the Kidron valley, which joins the Valley of Hinnom at the southern end of the spur. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:7-13:11:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 11:7</a>) The city required major protection only from the N, and here the ridge became even narrower, making an attack extremely difficult. The northern boundary of this “city of David” has not yet been definitely established, though some authorities recommend as likely the above-mentioned narrow place. Over the centuries debris has filled in the valleys to a great extent, making the strategic location and strength of this site less notable. The total area of the ancient city of David is estimated to have been no more than eight or ten acres (3.2 or 4 hectares).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Kidron valley near the foot of the eastern flank of the spur on which the stronghold sat, there is a spring called Gihon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:33-11:1:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:33</a>) Archaeological excavations indicate that from ancient times a tunnel or shaft was cut through the rock, making access to the spring possible without leaving the city walls. It is suggested that it was by climbing up this shaft that Joab and his men were able to penetrate the stronghold and take it.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:8-10:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:5-13:11:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The name “city of David” resulted from David’s making his royal residence there, after ruling for seven and a half years in Hebron. Here, with contributions from Hiram of Tyre, David’s “house of cedars” was built. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:5-10:5:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:9-10:5:9" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:11-10:5:11" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:2-10:7:2" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 7:2</a>) David had the ark of the covenant brought from the house of Obed-edom up to the city of David, his wife, Michal, being able to see the procession approach from a window of David’s house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:10-10:6:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Sam. 6:10-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:1-13:15:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:29-13:15:29" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 29</a>) Upon his death, the king was buried in the city, a custom followed with many other monarchs of the Davidic line.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:10-11:2:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>FROM SOLOMON’S REIGN ONWARD</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Solomon transferred the Ark to the newly constructed temple on the more spacious plateau to the N of the city of David. The expression that they ‘brought up the ark out of the city of David’ shows that the temple area lay on higher ground, Mount Moriah being higher than the southern spur. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:1-11:8:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:1</a>) After his marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter, Solomon had placed her in the city of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:1-11:3:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki 3:1</a>) But, upon the completion of a new residence closer to the temple area, he removed her from the city of David because it was viewed as holy, the <span id="page428" class="pageNum" data-no="428" data-before-text="428"></span>Ark having been stationed there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:24-11:9:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:11-14:8:11" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 8:11</a>) Solomon did further building work in the city of David, and Hezekiah did repair work there in preparation for Assyrian Sennacherib’s attack. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:27-11:11:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:5-14:32:5" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:5</a>) Hezekiah also diverted the waters of the Gihon spring, bringing them over to the W side of the city of David, evidently by means of the rock-cut tunnel that has been discovered connecting that spring with the Pool of Siloam on the SW slope of the spur. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:30-14:32:30" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30</a>) His son and successor, Manasseh, built an outer wall along the eastern slope facing the Kidron valley.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:33:14-14:33:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">From the above texts it is evident that, although Jerusalem’s area expanded in course of time, the city of David remained a distinct sector. This held true even after the return from Babylonian exile, certain features of the city being mentioned in connection with the work crews doing repairing of the city walls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:15-16:3:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 3:15, 16</a>) The “Stairway of the City of David” apparently led down from the southern extremity of the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:12:37-16:12:37" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37</a>) Excavations here have revealed portions of such a stairway, and a flight of steps roughly cut in the rock still lead down from the hill at this point.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures the term “David’s city” is applied to Bethlehem, the birthplace of David and of Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:4-42:2:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 2:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:11-42:2:11" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:42-43:7:42" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> John 7:42</a>; see JERUSALEM; OPHEL.</p>

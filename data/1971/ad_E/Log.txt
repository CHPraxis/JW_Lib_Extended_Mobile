LOG
[Heb., logh; hollow, basin].
The smallest liquid measure mentioned in the Bible. One log measure of oil was part of the prescribed offering by a cleansed leper. (Lev. 14:2, 10, 12, 15, 21, 24) Talmudic evidence indicates the log to be one-twelfth of a hin (or, .014 bath). If the bath is correctly estimated at 5.81 gallons (22 liters) on the basis of archaeological findings, this would give the log measure a capacity of about two-thirds of a liquid pint (.3 liter).

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city inhabited by Amorites and apparently located in the vicinity of the Low Plain of Siddim. King Chedorlaomer and his allies defeated the Amorites dwelling in Hazazon-tamar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:5-1:14:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 14:5-8</a>) Centuries later the combined forces of Moab, Ammon and the mountainous region of Seir came against Judah by way of “Hazazon-tamar, that is to say, En-gedi.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:2-14:20:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:10-14:20:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) Many scholars believe that the Genesis reference points to a location some distance S of En-gedi and therefore regard the words “that is to say, En-gedi,” as a late addition. The name “Hazazon-tamar,” however, appears to be preserved in the Wadi Hasasa about seven miles (11 kilometers) NW of the suggested site of En-gedi. Also, the meaning of Hazazon-tamar would fit the En-gedi region, described by Josephus as a place where “the best kind of palm trees” thrive. (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book IX, chap. I, par. 2) So if the Genesis passage refers to a more southerly location, possibly there were two places called Hazazon-tamar: the one linked with En-gedi; the other perhaps the site SW of the Dead Sea that is called simply Tamar.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:19-26:47:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:28-26:48:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 48:28</a>.</p>

BELTESHAZZAR
(Bel·te·shazʹzar) [protect his life].
The Babylonian name given to Daniel after he was taken captive in 617 B.C.E.—not to be confused with Belshazzar. (Dan. 1:7) The name is in the form of an invocation to Bel and hence was selected, as Nebuchadnezzar said, “according to the name of my god.” (Dan. 4:8; 5:12) The purpose was evidently to effect Daniel’s naturalization and alienate him from the worship of Jehovah. However, the Babylonians continued to speak of him also by his name Daniel.—Dan. 4:18, 19; 5:12, 13; see DANIEL No. 2.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Jaʹbez) [he gives pain (or sorrow); apparently from Hebrew <em>ʽa·tsavʹ</em> (to pain or distress)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A descendant of Judah named Jabez by his mother because of her pain in giving birth to him. Jabez proved himself to be more honorable than his brothers and, in answer to his prayer, experienced Jehovah’s blessing and protection.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:1-13:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:9-13:4:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. Apparently a Judean site, perhaps founded by No. 1 above. Jabez was the home of three families of scribes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:55-13:2:55" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:55</a>) Its exact location is today unknown.</p>

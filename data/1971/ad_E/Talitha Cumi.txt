TALITHA CUMI
(Talʹi·tha cuʹmi) [Maiden, I say to you, Get up!].
The Semitic expression used by Jesus Christ at the time he resurrected Jairus’ daughter. (Mark 5:41) The transliterations of this expression vary in Greek manuscripts. While it is often referred to as Aramaic, at least the latter part of the phrase (“cuʹmi”) could be either Hebrew or Aramaic, according to W. E. Vine (Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, Vol. IV, p. 109). Lexicographer Gesenius derives “talʹi·tha” from the Hebrew word for “young lamb” (ta·lehʹ).

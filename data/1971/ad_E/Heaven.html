<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew <em>sha·maʹyim</em> (always in the plural) seems to have the basic sense of that which is “high” or “lofty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:11-19:103:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 103:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:3-20:25:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Prov. 25:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:9-23:55:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isa. 55:9</a>) The etymology of the Greek word is uncertain.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This atmospheric region corresponds generally to the “expanse [Heb., <em>ra·qiʹaʽ</em>]” formed during the second creative period, described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:6-1:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:6-8</a>.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When the expanse of atmosphere was formed, earth’s surface waters were separated from other waters above the expanse. This explains the expression used with regard to the global flood of Noah’s day, that “all the springs of the vast watery deep were broken open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:11-1:7:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 7:11</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:27-20:8:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:27, 28</a>.) At the Flood, the “vast watery deep” of the waters suspended above the expanse apparently descended as if by certain channels, as well as in rainfall. When this vast reservoir had emptied itself, such “flood gates of the heavens” were, in effect, “stopped up.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:2-1:8:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 8:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>Outer space</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The physical “heavens” extend through earth’s atmosphere and beyond to the regions of outer space with their stellar bodies, “all the army of the heavens”—sun, moon, stars and constellations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:19-5:4:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:10-23:13:10" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:40-46:15:41" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:40, 41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:12-58:11:12" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Heb. 11:12</a>) The first verse of the Bible describes the creation of such starry heavens prior to the development of earth for human habitation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) These heavens show forth God’s glory, even as does the expanse of atmosphere, being the work of God’s “fingers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:3-19:8:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:6" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19:1-6</a>) The divinely appointed “statutes of the heavens” control all such celestial bodies.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>“Midheaven” and the “extremities of the heavens”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The expression “midheaven” applies to the region within earth’s expanse of atmosphere where birds, such as the eagle, fly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:13-66:8:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 14:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:17-66:19:17" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 19:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:11-5:4:11" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> Deut. 4:11</a> [Heb., “heart of the heavens”]) Somewhat similar is the expression “between the earth and the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:16-13:21:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Chron. 21:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:9-10:18:9" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 18:9</a>) The advance of Babylon’s attackers from “the extremity of the heavens” evidently means their coming to her from the distant horizon (where earth and sky appear to meet and the sun appears to rise and set). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:5-23:13:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 13:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:4-19:19:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 19:4-6</a>.) Similarly “from the four extremities of the heavens” apparently refers to four points of the compass, thus indicating a coverage of the four quarters of the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:36-24:49:36" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer. 49:36</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:8-27:8:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 8:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:4-27:11:4" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:31-40:24:31" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Matthew 24:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:27-41:13:27" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Mark 13:27</a>.) As the heavens surround the earth on all sides, Jehovah’s vision of everything “under the whole heavens” embraces all the globe.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:28:24-18:28:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 28:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>The cloudy skies</em></strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Another term, the Hebrew <em>shaʹhhaq,</em> is also used to refer to the “skies” or their clouds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:26-5:33:26" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deut. 33:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:20-20:3:20" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:8-23:45:8" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Isa. 45:8</a>) This word has the root meaning of something beaten fine or pulverized, as the “film of dust” (<em>shaʹhhaq</em>) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:15-23:40:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:15</a>. There is a definite appropriateness in this meaning, inasmuch as clouds form when warm air, rising from the earth, becomes cooled to what is known as the “dewpoint,” and the water vapor in it condenses into minute particles sometimes called “water dust.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:27-18:36:28" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 36:27, 28</a>.) Adding to the appropriateness, the visual effect of the blue dome of the sky is caused by the diffusion of sun rays by gas molecules and other particles (including dust) composing the atmosphere. By God’s formation of such atmosphere, he has, in effect, ‘beaten out the skies hard like a molten mirror,’ giving a definite limit or clear demarcation to the atmospheric blue vault above man.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:18-18:37:18" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 37:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong><em>“Heavens of the heavens”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The expression “heavens of the heavens” is considered as referring to the highest heavens, which, since the heavens extend out from the earth in all directions, would embrace the complete extent of the physical heavens, however vast.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:14-5:10:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deut. 10:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:6-16:9:6" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Solomon, the constructor of the temple at Jerusalem, stated that the “heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens” cannot contain God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:27-11:8:27" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:27</a>) As the Creator of the heavens, Jehovah’s position is far above them all and “his name alone is unreachably high. <span id="page732" class="pageNum" data-no="732" data-before-text="732"></span>His dignity is above earth and heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:13-19:148:13" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 148:13</a>) Jehovah measures the physical heavens as easily as a man would measure an object by spreading his fingers so that the object lies between the tips of the thumb and little finger. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:12-23:40:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 40:12</a>) Solomon’s statement does not mean that God has no specific place of residence. Nor does it mean that he is omnipresent in the sense of being literally everywhere and in everything. This can be seen from the fact that Solomon also spoke of Jehovah as hearing “from the heavens, your established place of dwelling,” that is, the heavens of the spirit realm.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:30-11:8:30" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:39-11:8:39" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 39</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Thus, in the physical sense, the term “heavens” covers a wide range. While it may refer to the farthest reaches of universal space, it may also refer to something that is simply high or lofty to a degree beyond the ordinary. Thus, those aboard storm-tossed ships are said to “go up to the heavens, . . . down to the bottoms.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:107:26-19:107:26" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 107:26</a>) So, too, the builders of the Tower of Babel intended to put up a structure with its “top in the heavens,” a “skyscraper,” as it were. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:4-1:11:4" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Gen. 11:4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:53-24:51:53" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:53</a>.) And the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:9:2-30:9:2" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Amos 9:2</a> speaks of men as ‘going up to the heavens’ in a vain effort to elude Jehovah’s judgments, evidently meaning that they would try to find escape in the high mountainous regions.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>SPIRITUAL HEAVENS</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The same original-language words used for the physical heavens are also applied to the spiritual heavens. As has been seen, Jehovah God does not reside in the physical heavens, being a Spirit. However, since he is the “High and Lofty One” who resides in the “height” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:57:15-23:57:15" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isa. 57:15</a>), the basic sense of that which is “lifted up” or “lofty” expressed in the Hebrew-language word makes it appropriate to describe God’s “lofty abode of holiness and beauty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:15-23:63:15" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Isa. 63:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:13-19:33:14" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Ps. 33:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:3-19:115:3" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 115:3</a>) As the Maker of the physical heavens (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:19-1:14:19" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Gen. 14:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:6-19:33:6" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Ps. 33:6</a>), Jehovah is also their Owner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:15-19:115:16" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps. 115:15, 16</a>) Whatever is his pleasure to do in them, he does, including miraculous acts.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:6-19:135:6" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps. 135:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In many texts, therefore, the “heavens” stand for God himself and his sovereign position. His throne is in the heavens, that is, in the spirit realm over which he also rules.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:22:19-11:22:19" data-bid="60-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:20-19:103:21" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Psalm 103:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:10-27:7:10" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Daniel 7:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:13-42:2:13" data-bid="61-3" class="b"> Luke 2:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:14-66:19:14" data-bid="61-4" class="b"> Revelation 19:14</a>.) So, too, the “heavens” are personified as representing this angelic organization, the “congregation of the holy ones.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:5-19:89:7" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Ps. 89:5-7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:7-42:15:7" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Luke 15:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:10-42:15:10" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="63-3" class="b"> Revelation 12:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>REPRESENTING RULERSHIP</strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">We have seen that the heavens can refer to Jehovah God in his sovereign position. Thus, when Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar that the experience the Babylonian emperor was due to have would make him “know that the <em>heavens</em> are ruling,” it meant the same as knowing “that the <em>Most High</em> is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:25-27:4:26" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Dan. 4:25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">However, aside from its reference to the Supreme Sovereign, the term “heavens” can also refer to other ruling powers that are exalted or lifted up above their subject peoples. The very dynasty of Babylonian kings that Nebuchadnezzar represented is described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:12-23:14:12" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Isaiah 14:12</a> as being starlike, a “shining one, son of the dawn.” By the conquest of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., that Babylonian dynasty lifted its throne “above the stars of God,” these “stars” evidently referring to the Davidic line of Judean kings (even as the Heir to the Davidic throne, Christ Jesus, is called the “bright morning star” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:16-66:22:16" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Revelation 22:16</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:24:17-4:24:17" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Numbers 24:17</a>.) By its overthrow of the divinely authorized Davidic throne, the Babylonian dynasty, in effect, exalted itself heaven-high. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:13-23:14:14" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Isa. 14:13, 14</a>) This lofty grandeur and far-reaching dominion were also represented in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream by a symbolic tree with its height ‘reaching the heavens.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:20-27:4:22" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Dan. 4:20-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong><em>New heavens and new earth</em></strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The connection of the “heavens” with ruling power aids in understanding the meaning of the expression “new heavens and a new earth” found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:22-23:66:22" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 66:22</a> and quoted by the apostle Peter at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="71-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>. Observing such relationship, M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> (Vol. IV, pp. 122-127) comments: “In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Isa. LXV, 17</a>, a new heaven and a new earth signify a new government, new kingdom, new people. . . .”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Even as the “earth” can refer to a society of people (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:1-19:96:1" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ps. 96:1</a>; see EARTH), so, too, “heavens” can symbolize the superior ruling power or government over such “earth.” The prophecy presenting the promise of “new heavens and a new earth,” given through Isaiah, was one dealing initially with the restoration of Israel from Babylonian exile. Upon the Israelites’ return to their homeland, they entered into a new order of things. Over them there was the governorship of Zerubbabel (a descendant of David), aided by High Priest Joshua, at the city of Jerusalem. Through these individuals, the “heavens,” or the heavenly Sovereign Jehovah God, directed and supervised the subject people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:1-37:1:1" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Hag. 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:14-37:1:14" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Thereby, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:18-23:65:18" data-bid="75-1" class="b">verse 18 of Isaiah chapter 65</a> foretold, Jerusalem became “a cause for joyfulness and her people a cause for exultation.” As foretold in a similar restoration prophecy, Jehovah thereby ‘planted the heavens and laid the foundation of the earth.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:11-23:51:11" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Isa. 51:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:16-23:51:16" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Peter’s quotation, however, shows that a future fulfillment was to be anticipated, on the basis of God’s promise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="77-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>) Since God’s promise in this case relates to the second presence of Christ Jesus, as shown at verse 4, the “new heavens and a new earth” must relate to God’s Messianic kingdom and its rule over obedient subjects. By his resurrection <span id="page733" class="pageNum" data-no="733" data-before-text="733"></span>and ascension to God’s right hand, Christ Jesus became “higher than the heavens” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Heb. 7:26</a>) in that he was thereby placed “far above every government and authority and power and lordship . . . not only in this system of things, but also in that to come.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:19-49:1:21" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Eph. 1:19-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Christian followers of Jesus, as “partakers of the heavenly calling” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:1-58:3:1" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Heb. 3:1</a>), are assigned by God as “heirs” in union with Christ and his “administration” that is “to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:8-49:1:11" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Eph. 1:8-11</a>) This inheritance is “reserved in the heavens” for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:5-51:1:5" data-bid="82-2" class="b"> Col. 1:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="83-1" class="b">John 14:2, 3</a>.) They are “enrolled” and have their “citizenship” in the heavens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:20-58:12:23" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Heb. 12:20-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:20-50:3:20" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> Phil. 3:20</a>) They form the “New Jerusalem” seen in John’s vision as “coming down out of heaven from God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:10" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:24-49:5:27" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:24-27</a>.) Since this vision is initially stated to be of “a new heaven and a new earth” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1</a>), it follows that both are represented in what is thereafter described. Hence the “new heaven” must correspond to Christ together with his “bride,” the “New Jerusalem,” and the “new earth” is seen in the ‘peoples of mankind’ who are their subjects and who receive the blessings of their rule, as depicted in verses 3 and 4.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Passing away of the former heaven and the former earth</em></strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">John’s vision refers to the passing away of the “former heaven and the former earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:11-66:20:11" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> compare 20:11</a>.) In the Christian Greek Scriptures the superior ruling power over human society that is destined to pass away is shown to be Satanic and demonic. Earthly governments and their peoples are shown to be subject to such Satanic rule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:9" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> John 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:3-47:4:4" data-bid="89-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="89-4" class="b"> Rev. 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:14" data-bid="89-5" class="b"> 16:13, 14</a>) The apostle Paul referred to the “wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places,” with their governments, authorities and world rulers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) This identification of the “former heaven” with the rule over earth by Satan and his demons harmonizes with the fact that, shortly before the statement concerning the ‘former heaven having passed away,’ John had seen a vision of the complete defeat of Satan’s forces and the casting of Satan Into the “abyss.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:19-66:20:3" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Rev. 19:19–20:3</a>) The earthly subjects of Satan’s rule are destroyed prior to his abyssing, as shown at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:17-66:19:18" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Revelation 19:17, 18</a>. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="93-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.) The description of a fiery destruction of heaven and earth at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:7-61:3:12" data-bid="94-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7-12</a> corresponds to the visions in Revelation.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>ABASEMENT OF THAT WHICH IS EXALTED</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Because the heavens represent that which is elevated, the abasement of those things that are exalted is at times represented by the overthrow or the ‘rocking’ or ‘agitating’ of the heavens. Jehovah is said to have “thrown down from heaven to earth the beauty of Israel” at the time of its desolation. That beauty included its kingdom and princely rulers and their power, and such beauty was devoured as by fire. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:2:1-25:2:3" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Lam. 2:1-3</a>) But Israel’s conqueror, Babylon, later experienced an agitation of her own “heaven” and a rocking of her “earth” when the Medes and Persians overthrew Babylon and her heavenly gods proved false and unable to save her from the loss of her dominion over the land.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:1-23:13:1" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Isa. 13:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:10-23:13:13" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 10-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Similarly, it was prophesied that the heaven-high position of Edom would not save her from destruction and Jehovah’s sword of judgment would be drenched in her heights or “heavens,” with no help for her from any heavenly or exalted source. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:4-23:34:7" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isa. 34:4-7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:1-31:1:4" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Obadiah 1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/31:1:8-31:1:8" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 8</a>.) Those making great boasts, wickedly speaking in an elevated style as if to “put their mouth in the very heavens,” are certain to fall to ruin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:8-19:73:9" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Ps. 73:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:18-19:73:18" data-bid="99-2" class="b"> 18</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:5-66:13:6" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Revelation 13:5, 6</a>.) The city of Capernaum had reason to feel highly favored due to the attention it received by Jesus and his ministry. However, since it failed to respond to his powerful works, Jesus asked, “Will you perhaps be exalted to heaven?” and foretold instead, “Down to Hades you will come.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:23-40:11:23" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 11:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong>DARKENING OF THE HEAVENS</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The darkening of the heavens or of the stellar bodies is often used to represent the removal of prosperous, favorable conditions, and their being replaced by foreboding, gloomy prospects and conditions, like a dark day when clouds blot out all light. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:2-23:50:3" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Isaiah 50:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:10-23:50:10" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 10</a>.) This use of the physical heavens in connection with the mental outlook of humans is somewhat similar to the old Arabic expression, “his heaven has fallen to the earth,” meaning that one’s superiority or prosperity is greatly diminished. Also similar is the modem German expression, <em>“Aus allen Himmeln fallen”</em> (literally, to fall out of all heavens), conveying the idea of bitter disappointment and utter disillusionment.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Upon Judah such a day of darkness came in fulfillment of Jehovah’s judgment through his prophet Joel, and reached its culmination in Judah’s desolation by Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:1-29:2:2" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Joel 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:10-29:2:10" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:30-29:2:31" data-bid="103-3" class="b"> 30, 31</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:23-24:4:23" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Jeremiah 4:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:28-24:4:28" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> 28</a>.) Any hope of help from a heavenly source seemed dried up, and, as foretold at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:65-5:28:67" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:65-67</a>, they came into “dread night and day,” with no relief or hope by sunlit morning or by moonlit evening. Yet, by the same prophet, Joel, Jehovah warned enemies of Judah that they would experience the same situation when he executed judgment upon them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:3:12-29:3:16" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Joel 3:12-16</a>) Ezekiel and Isaiah used this same figurative picture in foretelling God’s judgment on Egypt and Babylon respectively.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:7-26:32:8" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Ezek. 32:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:12-26:32:12" data-bid="107-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:1-23:13:1" data-bid="107-3" class="b"> Isa. 13:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:13:10-23:13:11" data-bid="107-4" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">The apostle Peter quoted Joel’s prophecy on the day of Pentecost when urging a crowd of listeners to “get saved from this crooked generation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:1" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Acts 2:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:16-44:2:21" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> 16-21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:40-44:2:40" data-bid="108-3" class="b"> 40</a>) The unheeding ones of that generation saw a time of grave darkness when the Romans besieged and eventually ravaged Jerusalem less than forty years later. Prior to Peter, however, Jesus had made a similar prophecy, and showed it would have a fulfillment at the time of his second presence.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:31" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Matt. 24:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:27" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> Luke 21:25-27</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:12-66:6:17" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Revelation 6:12-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="ss"><strong>PERMANENCE OF PHYSICAL HEAVENS</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">Eliphaz the Temanite said of God: “Look! In his holy ones he has no faith, and the heavens themselves are actually not clean in his eyes.” However, Jehovah said to Eliphaz that he and his two companions had “not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:15:1-18:15:1" data-bid="111-1" class="b">Job 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:15:15-18:15:15" data-bid="111-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:7-18:42:7" data-bid="111-3" class="b"> 42:7</a>) By contrast, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:10-2:24:10" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Exodus 24:10</a> refers to the heavens as representing purity. Thus there is no cause stated in the Bible for God’s destroying the physical heavens.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">That the physical heavens are permanent is shown by the fact that they are used in similes relating to things that are everlasting, such as the peaceful, righteous results of the Davidic kingdom inherited by God’s Son.

Unlike God’s eternal existence, the permanence of any part of his physical creation is not independent. As seen in the earth, the physical creation must undergo a continual renewing process if it is to endure or retain its existing form.

This is because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. Paul contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, if he so designed, could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set it aside.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:1-58:1:2" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Heb. 1:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:8-58:1:8" data-bid="121-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:12-58:1:12" data-bid="121-3" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong>VARIOUS POETIC AND FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Because the physical heavens play a vital part in sustaining and prospering life on earth—by sunshine, rain, dew, refreshing winds, and other atmospheric benefits—they are spoken of poetically as Jehovah’s “good storehouse.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:11-5:28:12" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Deut. 28:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:13-5:33:14" data-bid="122-2" class="b"> 33:13, 14</a>) Jehovah opens its “doors” to bless his servants, as when causing manna, “the grain of heaven,” to descend upon the ground. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:23-19:78:24" data-bid="123-1" class="b">Ps. 78:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:31-43:6:31" data-bid="123-2" class="b"> John 6:31</a>) The clouds are as “water jars” in the upper chambers of that storehouse, and the rain pours forth as by “sluices,” certain factors, such as mountains or even God’s miraculous intervention, causing water condensation and subsequent rainfall in specific regions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:37-18:38:37" data-bid="124-1" class="b">Job 38:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:12-24:10:13" data-bid="124-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:41-11:18:45" data-bid="124-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:41-45</a>) On the other hand, the withdrawal of God’s blessing at times resulted in the heavens over the land of Canaan being “shut up,” becoming as hard in appearance and as nonporous as iron and having a copper-colored metallic brightness, with a dust-filled, rainless atmosphere.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:19-3:26:19" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Lev. 26:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:16-5:11:17" data-bid="125-2" class="b"> Deut. 11:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:23-5:28:24" data-bid="125-3" class="b"> 28:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:35-11:8:36" data-bid="125-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:35, 36</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">This aids in understanding the picture presented at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:21-28:2:23" data-bid="126-1" class="b">Hosea 2:21-23</a>. Having foretold the devastating results of Israel’s unfaithfulness, Jehovah now tells of the time of her restoration and the resulting blessings. In that day, he says, “I shall answer the heavens, and they, for their part, will answer the earth; and the earth, for its part, will answer the grain and the sweet wine and the oil; and they, for their part, will answer Jezreel.” Evidently this represents Israel’s petition for Jehovah’s blessing as being routed through the chain of things of Jehovah’s creation here named. For that reason these things are viewed as personified; hence, as if able to make a request or petition. Israel asks for grain, wine and oil; these products, in turn, seek their plant food and water from the earth; the earth, in order to supply this need, requires (or figuratively calls for) sun, rain and dew from the heavens; and the heavens (till now “shut up” due to the withdrawal of God’s blessing) can respond only if God accepts the petition and restores his favor to the nation, thereby putting the productive cycle in motion. The prophecy gives the assurance that he will do so.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:8-10:22:15" data-bid="127-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:8-15</a> David apparently uses the figure of a tremendous storm to represent the effect of God’s intervention on David’s behalf, freeing him from his enemies. The fierceness of this symbolic storm agitates the foundation of the heavens and they ‘bend down’ with dark low-lying clouds. Compare the literal storm conditions described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:16-2:19:18" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; also the poetic expressions at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:1-23:64:2" data-bid="129-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="ss"><strong><em>Stretching out the heavens</em></strong></p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">Jehovah, the “Father of the celestial lights” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="130-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>), is frequently spoken of as having ‘stretched out the heavens,’ just as one would a tent cloth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:1-19:104:2" data-bid="131-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:12-23:45:12" data-bid="131-2" class="b"> Isa. 45:12</a>) The heavens, both the expanse of atmosphere by day and the starry heavens by night, have the appearance of an immense domed canopy from the standpoint of humans on earth. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="132-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22</a> the simile is that of stretching out “fine gauze,” rather than the coarser tent cloth. This expresses the delicate finery of such heavenly canopy. On a clear night the thousands of stars do, indeed, form a lacy web stretched over the black velvet background of space. It may also be noted that even the enormous galaxy known as the Via Lactea or “Milky Way,” in which our solar system is located, has a filmy gauzelike appearance from earth’s viewpoint.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">It can be seen from the foregoing that the context must always be considered in determining the sense of these figurative expressions. Thus, when Moses called on the “heavens and the earth” to serve as witnesses to the things that he declared to Israel, it is obvious that he did not mean the inanimate creation but, rather, the intelligent residents inhabiting the heavens and the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:25-5:4:26" data-bid="133-1" class="b">Deut. 4:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:19" data-bid="133-2" class="b"> 30:19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:9-49:1:10" data-bid="134-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:10" data-bid="134-2" class="b"> Philippians 2:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:6-66:13:6" data-bid="134-3" class="b"> Revelation 13:6</a>.) This is also true of the rejoicing by the heavens and earth over Babylon’s fall, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:48-24:51:48" data-bid="135-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:48</a>. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:5-66:18:5" data-bid="136-1" class="b">Revelation 18:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:1-66:19:3" data-bid="136-2" class="b"> 19:1-3</a>.) Likewise it must be the spiritual heavens that “trickle with righteousness,” as described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:8-23:45:8" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:8</a>. In other cases the literal heavens are meant but are figuratively described as rejoicing or shouting out loud. At Jehovah’s coming to judge the earth, as described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:11-19:96:13" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Psalm 96:11-13</a>, the heavens, along with the earth, sea, and the field, take on a gladsome appearance. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:23-23:44:23" data-bid="139-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:23</a>.) The physical heavens also praise their Creator, in the same way that a beautifully designed product brings praise to the craftsman producing it. In effect, they speak of Jehovah’s power, wisdom and majesty.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:4" data-bid="140-1" class="b">Ps. 19:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:34-19:69:34" data-bid="140-2" class="b"> 69:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="ss"><strong>ASCENSION TO HEAVEN</strong></p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:2:11-12:2:12" data-bid="141-1" class="b">2 Kings 2:11, 12</a> the prophet Elijah is described as “ascending in the windstorm to the heavens.” The heavens here referred to are the atmospheric heavens in which windstorms occur, not the spiritual heavens of God’s presence. As the article on ELIJAH shows, Elijah did not die at the time of such ascension, but continued to live for a number of years after his heavenly transportation away from his successor Elisha. Nor did Elijah upon death ascend to the spiritual heavens, since Jesus, while on earth, clearly stated that “no man has ascended into heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:13-43:3:13" data-bid="142-1" class="b">John 3:13</a>) At Pentecost Peter likewise said of David that he “did not ascend to the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:34-44:2:34" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Acts 2:34</a>) In reality, there is nothing in the Scriptures to show that a heavenly hope was held out to God’s servants prior to the coming of Christ Jesus. Such hope first appears in Jesus’ expressions to his disciples (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:21-40:19:21" data-bid="144-1" class="b">Matt. 19:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:23-40:19:28" data-bid="144-2" class="b"> 23-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="144-3" class="b"> Luke 12:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="144-4" class="b"> John 14:2, 3</a>), and was fully comprehended by them only after Pentecost of 33 C.E.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:6-44:1:8" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Acts 1:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:4" data-bid="145-2" class="b"> 2:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:29-44:2:36" data-bid="145-3" class="b"> 29-36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:16-45:8:17" data-bid="145-4" class="b"> Rom. 8:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">The Scriptures show that Christ Jesus was the first one to ascend from earth to the heavens of God’s presence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:20-46:15:20" data-bid="146-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="146-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:24</a>) By such ascension and his presentation of his ransom sacrifice there, he ‘opened the way’ for those who would follow—the spirit-begotten members of his congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="147-1" class="b">John 14:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:20" data-bid="147-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:19-58:10:20" data-bid="147-3" class="b"> 10:19, 20</a>) In their resurrection these must bear “the image of the heavenly one,” Christ Jesus, in order to ascend to the heavens of the spirit plane, for “flesh and blood” cannot inherit that heavenly kingdom.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:50" data-bid="148-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:42-50</a>.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">The apostle Paul shows that it is not until the <span id="page735" class="pageNum" data-no="735" data-before-text="735"></span>second presence of Christ Jesus that members of his congregation are resurrected and ascend to heaven, while “the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:15-52:4:17" data-bid="149-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:15-17</a>) It may be noted that the “air” (Gr., <em>a·erʹ,</em> as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:23-44:22:23" data-bid="150-1" class="b">Acts 22:23</a>) in which the surviving Christians meet the Lord is not the same as the “heaven” (<em>ou·ra·nos</em>ʹ) and hence allowance must be made for something other than a literal ascension to heaven of these ‘surviving ones’ at this point. The text does not mention their dying, which is a prerequisite to their resurrection to spirit life.</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">It is also true that even where the expression “heavenly places” is used, this may have a meaning other than literal. The context provides the key to understanding. Thus, the apostle Paul in his letter to the Ephesians speaks of Christians then living on earth as though already enjoying such heavenly position, being raised up and “seated . . . together in the heavenly places in union with Christ Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:3-49:1:3" data-bid="151-1" class="b">Eph. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:6-49:2:6" data-bid="151-2" class="b"> 2:6</a>) The context shows that anointed Christians are so viewed by God because of his having ‘assigned them as heirs’ with his Son in the heavenly inheritance. While yet on earth, they have been exalted or ‘lifted up’ by such assignment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:11-49:1:11" data-bid="152-1" class="b">Eph. 1:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:18-49:1:20" data-bid="152-2" class="b"> 18-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:4-49:2:7" data-bid="152-3" class="b"> 2:4-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:22-49:2:22" data-bid="152-4" class="b"> 22</a>) These points may also shed light on the symbolic vision at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:12-66:11:12" data-bid="153-1" class="b">Revelation 11:12</a>. Likewise it provides a key for understanding the prophetic picture contained at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:9-27:8:12" data-bid="154-1" class="b">Daniel 8:9-12</a>, where what has previously been shown to represent a political power is spoken of as “getting greater all the way to the army of the heavens,” and even causing some of that army and of the stars to fall to the earth. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:3-27:12:3" data-bid="155-1" class="b">Daniel 12:3</a>, those servants of God on earth at the foretold time of the end are spoken of as shining “like the stars to time indefinite.” Note, too, the symbolic use of stars in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:3:22" data-bid="156-1" class="b">the book of Revelation, chapters one through three</a>, where the context shows that such “stars” refer to persons who are obviously living on earth and undergoing earthly experiences and temptations, these “stars” being responsible for congregations under their care.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="ss"><strong><em>The way to heavenly life</em></strong></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">The way to heavenly life involves more than just faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice and works of faith in obedience to God’s instructions. The inspired writings of the apostles and disciples show that there must also be a calling and choosing of such one by God through his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:9-55:1:10" data-bid="157-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:14-40:22:14" data-bid="157-2" class="b"> Matt. 22:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="157-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:9</a>) This invitation involves a number of steps or actions taken to qualify such a one for the heavenly inheritance, many of such steps being taken by God, others by the one called.

Whereas some have endeavored to relate Paul’s reference to the third heaven to the early rabbinical view that there were stages of heaven, even a total of “seven heavens,” this view finds no support in the Scriptures. As we have seen, the heavens are not referred to specifically as if divided into platforms or stages, but, rather, the context must be relied upon to determine whether reference is to the heavens within earth’s atmospheric expanse, the heavens of outer space, or the spiritual heavens. It therefore appears that the reference to the “third heaven” indicates the superlative degree of the rapture in which this vision was seen.

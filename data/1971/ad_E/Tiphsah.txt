TIPHSAH
(Tiphʹsah) [passage, ford].
1. A place at the extreme N of Solomon’s kingdom. (1 Ki. 4:24) Scholars generally identify it with Dibseh on the Euphrates River, some sixty miles (c. 97 kilometers) E-SE of Aleppo and almost that same distance from the confluence of the Euphrates and Balikh Rivers.
2. A place, apparently in the vicinity of Tirzah, that was struck down by Israel’s King Menahem (c. 791-780 B.C.E.). (2 Ki. 15:16) Its exact situation is not known. Khirbet Tafsah, about seven miles (c. 11 kilometers) SW of ancient Shechem, bears a similar name, but appears to be too far from the assumed site of Tirzah to be the location of this Tiphsah.

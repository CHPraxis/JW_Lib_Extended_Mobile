MALLOTHI
(Mal·loʹthi) [my discourse].
A Kohathite Levite and one of the fourteen sons of the singer Heman. (1 Chron. 25:4, 5) The family served as musicians under the direction of their father, Heman. (Vs. 6) When David organized the divisions of the Levites to serve in turns at the house of Jehovah, the nineteenth lot fell to Mallothi, who assumed the headship of that division of twelve musicians.—Vs. 26.

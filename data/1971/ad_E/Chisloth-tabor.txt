CHISLOTH-TABOR
(Chisʹloth-taʹbor) [loins or flanks of Tabor].
A city marking Zebulun’s boundary and apparently a variant form of Chesulloth. (Josh. 19:12, 18) It is usually identified with Iksal, less than three miles (4.8 kilometers) SE of Nazareth, at the foot of Mount Tabor, which location may account for its name.—See CHESULLOTH.

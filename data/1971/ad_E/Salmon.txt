SALMON
(Salʹmon).
The son of Judah’s chieftain Nahshon, likely born during the forty-year wilderness trek. Salmon married Rahab of Jericho, by whom he fathered Boaz. He was, therefore, a link in the genealogical line leading to David and Jesus. (Num. 2:3; Ruth 4:20-22; Matt. 1:4, 5; Luke 3:32) In 1 Chronicles 2:11 he is called Salma. However, this descendant of Ram, Salmon, whose progeny lived in Bethlehem, should not be confused with the Salma mentioned in 1 Chronicles 2:51, 54 as the “father” or builder of Bethlehem, for the latter was a descendant of Ram’s brother Caleb.—Compare 1 Chronicles 2:9, 18.

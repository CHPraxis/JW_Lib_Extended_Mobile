GITTITH
(Gitʹtith).
A musical expression of uncertain meaning, appearing in the superscriptions of Psalms 8, 81 and 84. The term seems to be derived from the Hebrew word gath, which is also the name of a town located on the border of Judah and Philistia. Some have suggested that “Gittith” has reference to a musical instrument or a melody originating at Gath. Another possibility is that “Gittith” denotes a tune associated with vintage songs, since gath denotes a press for wine or oil. The Greek Septuagint Version and the Latin Vulgate, therefore, render “Gittith” as “wine presses.”

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Semitic word meaning “My Teacher.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:51-41:10:51" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 10:51</a>) It may be that “Rabboni” was a more respectful form than “Rabbi,” which title of address means “Teacher,” or that it conveyed more personal warmth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:38-43:1:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:38</a>) However, when John wrote, perhaps the first person suffix (i) on this word had lost its special significance in the title, since John translates it as meaning merely “Teacher.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:16-43:20:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 20:16</a>.</p>

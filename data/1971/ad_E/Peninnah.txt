PENINNAH
(Pe·ninʹnah) [coral].
A wife of Elkanah. Peninnah produced many children, in contrast with Elkanah’s other wife, Hannah. Nonetheless, Peninnah was loved less than Hannah and so she ridiculed Hannah’s barrenness, especially at the time of the family’s annual visits to the tabernacle.—1 Sam. 1:1-8.

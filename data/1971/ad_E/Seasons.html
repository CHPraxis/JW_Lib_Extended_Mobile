<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A season is a period when a specific type of agricultural work is normal or a certain kind of weather prevails; a suitable or appointed time for something.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As the earth revolves around the sun, the tilt of the earth’s axis at an angle to the plane of the ecliptic produces a cycle of weather seasons. As markers of the passing of time, the heavenly bodies serve as indicators of seasons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:14-1:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 1:14</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:22-1:8:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 8:22</a> says that the earth’s seasons will “never cease.” For a correlation of the months of the Jewish and Gregorian calendars and the festival, weather and agricultural seasons, see pages 278 and 279.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Closely connected with the agricultural seasons were the annual “festival seasons” when the festivals established by the Mosaic law were celebrated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:23:31-13:23:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 23:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:3-14:31:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 31:3</a>) Hence, when Paul counseled some Jewish Christians who were “scrupulously observing days and months and <em>seasons,”</em> he meant the festival seasons that were a part of the Law, not simply weather or agricultural seasons.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:10-48:4:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 4:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Season” can therefore refer to a fixed or an appointed time or a period possessed of certain characteristics. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:18-45:8:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:9-48:6:9" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Gal. 6:9</a>; see APPOINTED TIMES OF THE NATIONS.) In time what constituted healthful teaching and proper conduct were made very clear to Christians. Accordingly, it was the “season” to be awake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:11-45:13:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 13:11-14</a>) The “times or seasons” or periods when Jehovah’s will in certain matters would take place were of real interest to his worshipers (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:7-44:1:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 1:7</a>), who understood them as they were progressively revealed.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:1-52:5:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In regard to the dwelling of nations on the earth, God “decreed the appointed seasons” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 17:26</a>; “fixed the epochs of their history,” <em>NE</em>) in that he determined when certain changes should occur, such as when the divinely appointed time came to uproot the Canaanite inhabitants of the Promised Land.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:13-1:15:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 15:13-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:8-24:25:11" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jer. 25:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:21-27:2:21" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Dan. 2:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:12-27:7:12" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 7:12</a>.</p>

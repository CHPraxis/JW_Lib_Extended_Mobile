GEDER
(Geʹder) [a wall, walled].
A town in Canaan, whose king was one of thirty-one conquered by Joshua. (Josh. 12:13) Its location is uncertain. Joshua 12:7, 8 shows it as being on the W side of the Jordan and its being mentioned next to Debir may place it in the Shephelah region. It may be the same as the Beth-gader at 1 Chronicles 2:51. In David’s time, a man called Baal-hanan the Gederite was in charge of David’s olive groves and sycamore trees in the Shephelah, and it is thought that he may have come from either Geder or Gederah.—1 Chron. 27:28.

JOBAB
(Joʹbab) [perhaps, howler, one who calls shrilly].
1. A descendant of Shem through Joktan. (Gen. 10:21, 25, 29; 1 Chron. 1:23) The exact region settled by the offspring of Jobab is not known today. Some would associate his name with Juhaibab, a town in the vicinity of Mecca.
2. “Son of Zerah from Bozrah”; an Edomite monarch who reigned sometime before Saul ruled as Israel’s first king. Jobab succeeded “Bela the son of Beor” to the throne.—Gen. 36:31-34; 1 Chron. 1:43-45.
3. King of Madon, a city in northern Palestine. Jobab and other monarchs joined Jabin the king of Hazor in an offensive against the Israelites but suffered defeat at the waters of Merom.—Josh. 11:1-8; 12:19.
4. Son of Benjamite Shaharaim by his wife Hodesh.—1 Chron. 8:1, 8, 9.
5. A descendant of Benjamite Shaharaim through Elpaal.—1 Chron. 8:1, 8, 11, 18.

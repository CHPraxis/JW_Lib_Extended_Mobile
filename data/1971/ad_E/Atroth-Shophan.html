<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city rebuilt by the tribe of Gad from among those captured from the realms of Kings Sihon and Og. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:33-4:32:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 32:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:35-4:32:35" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 35</a>) A suggested location is that of Rujm ʽAtarus, about one and a half miles (2.4 kilometers) NE of the site of Ataroth, this identification being based on a presumed relationship with the latter city. Others, however, consider it likely to have been located farther N in the same area as Jazer and Jogbehah, mentioned after Atroth-shophan.</p>

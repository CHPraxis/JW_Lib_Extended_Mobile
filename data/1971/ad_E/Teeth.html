<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Job, the faithful servant of God, barely escaping death in his sufferings, said: “I escape with the <em>skin of my teeth.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:20-18:19:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 19:20</a>) This Biblical statement is accurate. <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> (1956), Volume 26, page 321, comments: “On the enamel surface [of the teeth] is a highly indestructible pellicle [thin skin] or film indistinguishable to the naked eye known as the enamel cuticle (Nasmyth’s membrane).”</p>

At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:4:6-30:4:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Amos 4:6</a> the expression <em>“cleanness of teeth”</em> is paralleled with “want of bread,” representing famine conditions.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Teeth also symbolize destructive power of a nation or a people.

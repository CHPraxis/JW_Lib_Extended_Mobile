<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-nimʹrah) [place of the leopard or house of pure water].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town assigned to the tribe of Gad on the E side of the Jordan, also called simply Nimrah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:3-4:32:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 32:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:36-4:32:36" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 36</a>) It is described as in the “low plain” and as previously forming part of the realm of King Sihon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:27-6:13:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 13:27</a>) The ancient name seems to be preserved in modern Tell Nimrin, situated on the S side of the Wadi Nimrin, but the original site is evidently at Tell Beibil, a short distance away, where investigations show evidence of occupation during the Israelite period followed by abandonment. It thus lay about twelve miles (19 kilometers) E-NE of Jericho.—See NIMRIM.</p>

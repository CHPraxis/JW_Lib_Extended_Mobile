<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Boʹchim) [weepers].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site at which Jehovah’s angel addressed the Israelites, reproving them for having disregarded Jehovah’s warning against entering into relations with the pagan inhabitants of the land. The weeping that thereafter resulted among the people gave the place its name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:1-7:2:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 2:1-5</a>) The site is unknown but the expression “went up from Gilgal to Bochim” would indicate a location W of Gilgal, Gilgal evidently lying in the low valley of the Jordan.</p>

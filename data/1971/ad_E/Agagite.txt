AGAGITE
(Agʹag·ite) [belonging to Agag].
A term applied to Haman and to his father, Hammedatha, at Esther 3:1, 10; 8:3, 5. It apparently designates them as descendants of Agag and hence of Amalekite descent. The Jews traditionally have understood the expression in this way and take the Agag to be the monarch mentioned at 1 Samuel 15:8-33. Josephus (Antiquities of the Jews, Book XI, chap. VI, par. 5) refers to Haman as “by birth an Amalekite.” Mordecai was a descendant of Kish of the tribe of Benjamin, thus making him and Haman, in a sense, traditional enemies.—Esther 2:5.

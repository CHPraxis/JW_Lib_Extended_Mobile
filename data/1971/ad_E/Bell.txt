BELL
A hollow metallic vessel. This instrument is usually pear-shaped or cuplike, and gives a dominant musical note when struck. The sizes and shapes of bells and the uses to which they have been put by peoples of all times are legion. Their ringing has assembled people for civic and social reasons, and for war.
The first mention of bells in the Bible is in connection with the tabernacle service. On the hem of the solid-blue coat of the high priest were attached golden bells alternated with pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet material.â€”Ex. 28:33-35; 39:25, 26.
Pagan worshipers have used the bell for a variety of superstitious reasons: to drive away evil spirits, to break the power of thunderstorms, to announce deaths, and for fertility purposes.

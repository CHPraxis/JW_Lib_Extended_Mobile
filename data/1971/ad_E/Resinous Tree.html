<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This tree from the wood of which the ark was constructed by Noah cannot be identified with any degree of certainty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 6:14</a>) The <em>Authorized Version</em> simply transliterates the Hebrew name. On the basis of the similarity between the Hebrew name and the Hebrew term for “tar” (“pitch,” <em>AV;</em> Heb., <em>koʹpher</em>) some have related it to the resinous trees of the pine family, particularly to the cypress, which is a very durable tree, extremely resistant to decay.—See CYPRESS.</p>

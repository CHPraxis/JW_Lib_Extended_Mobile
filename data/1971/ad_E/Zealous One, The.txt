ZEALOUS ONE, THE
A designation distinguishing the apostle Simon from the apostle Simon Peter and evidently corresponding to the term “Cananaean” used by Matthew and Mark. (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13) Simon’s being called “the zealous one” does not necessarily mean that he was at one time associated with the political group called Zealots. The designation may simply have been an appellative appropriate to his personality.

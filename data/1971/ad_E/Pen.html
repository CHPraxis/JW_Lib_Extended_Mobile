<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">1. A small enclosure for animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:6-36:2:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:6</a>; see SHEEPFOLD.) In Micah’s prophecy, regathered and united Israel is likened to “a flock in the pen.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:2:12-33:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mic. 2:12</a>, <em>NW, Le</em>) The Masoretic text here uses the Hebrew word <em>bots·rahʹ,</em> which is elsewhere rendered “Bozrah,” the name of a city of Edom and a city of Moab. However, in view of the phraseology of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:2:12-33:2:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Micah 2:12</a> some authorities feel that <em>bots·rahʹ</em> also means a “pen” or “fold” (<em>JP, Mo</em>). If the word should be vowel-pointed slightly differently, it would correspond closely with the Arabic <em>sira</em> (pen).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">2. An implement for writing with ink or similar fluid. When ancients wrote on clay, wax or soft metal they used a stylus (see STYLUS), but writing was also done on parchment or papyrus with pen and ink. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:13-64:1:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">3 John 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:12-63:1:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 John 12</a>) The Greek word translated “pen” (<em>kaʹla·mos</em>) refers to a reed or cane and can literally be rendered “writing-reed.” Among ancient Egyptians the reed pen was made with a flat chisel-shaped head that was cut or sliced so that it would act as a brush. The reeds may have been dried and hardened by leaving them under dung heaps for several months, as has been the practice in recent years. The Greeks and Romans used a reed pen that was pointed and slit, as was later done with quill pens and as is done even with modern fountain pens.</p>

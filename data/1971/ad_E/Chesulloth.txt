CHESULLOTH
(Che·sulʹloth) [loins or slopes].
A boundary city of Issachar (Josh. 19:18) and probably the same as Chisloth-tabor. (Josh. 19:12) It is generally identified with Iksal, situated at the base of the hills of Nazareth and less than three miles (5 kilometers) SE of that city. Hence it lay in the plains of Esdraelon to the W of Mount Tabor.—See CHISLOTH-TABOR.

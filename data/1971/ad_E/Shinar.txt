SHINAR
(Shiʹnar).
The original name of the area between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers later called Babylonia. It was there that Nimrod assumed kingship over Babel, Erech, Accad and Calneh, and where construction of the temple-tower of Babel was aborted. (Gen. 10:9, 10; 11:2-8) Later, the king of Shinar, Amraphel, was one of the confederates that took Abraham’s nephew Lot captive. (Gen. 14:1, 9, 12) This territory was still called by its original name in the days of Joshua. (Josh. 7:21) It is referred to by the prophets Isaiah, Daniel and Zechariah.—Isa. 11:11; Dan. 1:2; Zech. 5:11; see BABEL; BABYLONIA.

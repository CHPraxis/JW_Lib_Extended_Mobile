<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>sa·raphʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This Hebrew word, in its plural form, is translated “seraphs” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:2-23:6:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:6-23:6:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6</a> and means “fiery” or “burning.” It is often used to modify the general Hebrew term for serpent (<em>na·hhash</em>ʹ) and may then be translated as “poisonous,” perhaps as referring to the burning and inflaming effect of the venom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:15-5:8:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 8:15</a>) It is first mentioned at the time of God’s inflicting punishment on the rebellious Israelites by sending “poisonous serpents [<em>n<sup>e</sup>hha·shimʹ s<sup>e</sup>ra·phim</em>ʹ]” among them. After Moses’ intercession, Jehovah instructed him to make a “fiery snake,” to be placed on a signal pole to which those bitten could then look and be healed and live. Moses formed the snake of copper. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:6-4:21:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 21:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:9-46:10:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:9</a>) Jesus gave prophetic significance to this by stating: “Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up, that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:14-43:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 3:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:14:29-23:14:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 14:29 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:6-23:30:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 30:6</a> a “flying fiery snake” is mentioned in God’s judgment against Philistia and in description of the wilderness area to the S of Judah. The expression “flying” is considered by some to refer to the rapid darting or lightninglike striking through the air done by venomous snakes when attacking.</p>

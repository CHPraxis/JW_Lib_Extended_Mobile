POUND
[Gr., liʹtra].
A weight mentioned only at John 12:3 and 19:39. The Greek term is usually equated with the Roman pound (Latin, libra, from. which the English abbreviation “lb” for pound is drawn). Thus it was a little less than twelve ounces avoirdupois or about 327 grams. Some versions render the Greek word mna as “pound” (Luke 19:18, AV, Dy, JB, WY), but it is more appropriately rendered “mina.” (Da, Fn, Ro, NW) Whereas “pound” is used in the Bible just as a weight or measurement, “mina” is a monetary weight indicating a specific value of gold or silver.

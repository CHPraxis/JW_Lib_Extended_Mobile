<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Haʹbor).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This proper name has been understood as applying either to a place or to a river. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:26-13:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>, though, the reference is definitely to a city or district to which the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III exiled numerous Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom. Some scholars have linked this Habor with Abhar, a town located on the Qizil Uzun River of NW Iran about 130 miles (209 kilometers) W of Tehran. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:6-12:17:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 17:6 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:11-12:18:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18:11</a> some favor the reading “Habor, the river of Gozan” (<em>AS, RS</em>), and suggest identifying the Habor with a tributary of the Euphrates, the Khabur River of SE Turkey and NE Syria. However, in agreement with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:26-13:5:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>, this phrase may instead be translated “Habor at [or, by] the river Gozan.”—<em>NW, Yg;</em> see GOZAN.</p>

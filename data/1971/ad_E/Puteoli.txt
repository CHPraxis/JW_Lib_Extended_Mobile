PUTEOLI
(Pu·teʹo·li).
In the first century C.E., a chief port SE of Rome. Paul arrived at Puteoli on his way to stand before Caesar in Rome about the year 59 C.E. (Acts 28:13) With the help of a S wind his ship arrived “on the second day” at Puteoli from Rhegium, a place some two hundred statute miles (322 kilometers) to the S-SE.
Christian brothers of Puteoli entreated Paul and those accompanying him to spend a week with them. (Acts 28:14) This indicates he enjoyed some freedom, though a prisoner. Earlier, while in custody at Caesarea and Sidon, Paul had similarly benefited from limited freedom.—Acts 24:23; 27:3.
Puteoli is generally identified with modern Pozzuoli, on the bay of the same name, about six miles (10 kilometers) W-SW of Naples. Extensive ruins of an ancient mole still stand. Josephus calls the site by its older name, Dicaearchia, and says a Jewish colony was located there.

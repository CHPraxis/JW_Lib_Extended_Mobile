<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Villages located in Manasseh’s territory E of the Jordan.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jair (a descendant of Judah through Hezron, but also reckoned as a descendant of Manasseh), a contemporary of Moses, is credited with capturing these “tent villages,” evidently twenty-three in number, and naming them after himself, Havvoth-jair. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:39-4:32:41" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Num. 32:39-41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:14-5:3:14" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Deut. 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:3-13:2:3" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:21-13:2:23" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 21-23</a>; see JAIR No. 1.) Years later, thirty cities in the possession of Judge Jair’s thirty sons were known as Havvoth-jair. Some critics view this as a contradictory explanation about the origin of the name “Havvoth-jair.” However, the Judges account does not state that the name “Havvoth-jair” was first used in this later period. It simply indicates that at the time of writing the name still was in use and was applied to these thirty cities.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:10:3-7:10:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judg. 10:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During the reign of Solomon the tent villages of Jair were included in one of the districts placed under a deputy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:7-11:4:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:13-11:4:13" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13</a>) As indicated by the context, the sixty cities mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:13-11:4:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:13</a> and other texts (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:30-6:13:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 13:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:23-13:2:23" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:23</a>) were fortified cities of the Argob region in Bashan and apparently did not include the numerous rural towns. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:4-5:3:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 3:4, 5</a>.) Hence, the “tent villages” of Jair should likely be regarded as distinct from these sixty cities.</p>

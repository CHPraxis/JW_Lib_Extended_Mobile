<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A net that was dragged along the bottom of a body of water to catch fish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:5-26:26:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 26:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:26:14-26:26:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:10-26:47:10" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 47:10</a>) In ancient Egypt, dragnets were made of flax cords and equipped with lead weights at the bottom and wooden floats at the top. Likely those used by the Israelites were similar.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The methods of dragnet fishing used anciently were probably much like those employed in the Middle East in more recent times. The dragnet was let down from boats in such a way as to surround a school of fish, and the long ropes attached to the opposite ends of the net were taken ashore, where several men on each rope gradually pulled the net as a semicircle to the beach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:47-40:13:48" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 13:47, 48</a>) Another method was to draw the net together in a narrowing circle. Fishermen then dived into the water and pulled a portion of the weighted edge under the rest of the net, thus forming a bottom. After this the net was drawn into a boat or boats. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:6-42:5:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 5:6, 7</a>) Sometimes the net was first dragged into shallower water before being emptied.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:8-43:21:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 21:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:21:11-43:21:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Scriptures, the dragnet is used figuratively with reference to the heart of an immoral woman (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:26-21:7:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:26</a>) as well as to schemes to ensnare others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:7:2-33:7:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mic. 7:2</a>) Also, military conquest is likened to fishing with a dragnet.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:15-35:1:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hab. 1:15-17</a>.</p>

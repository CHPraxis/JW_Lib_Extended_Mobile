JERIMOTH
(Jerʹi·moth) [swollen, tall].
1. A son or descendant of Benjamin’s firstborn Bela, and a valiant, mighty man.—1 Chron. 7:6, 7.
2. A Benjamite warrior who supported David while he was at Ziklag outlawed by King Saul.—1 Chron. 12:1, 2, 5.
3. A Merarite Levite.—1 Chron. 24:26, 30; see JEREMOTH No. 3.
4. A Kohathite Levite.—1 Chron. 6:33; 25:4; see JEREMOTH No. 4.
5. The prince over the tribe of Naphtali during David’s rule; son or descendant of Azriel.—1 Chron. 27:19, 22.
6. A son of David whose daughter married King Rehoboam. (2 Chron. 11:18) As Jerimoth is not included in the listings of David’s sons by his named wives, he might have been a son by a concubine or an unnamed wife. (2 Sam. 5:13) Jerimoth was apparently married to his cousin Abihail, the daughter of David’s oldest brother Eliab.—2 Chron. 11:18; 1 Sam. 17:13.
7. One of the Levite commissioners caring for the generous contribution, tithe and holy things brought in during Hezekiah’s reign.—2 Chron. 31:12, 13.

ASHHUR
(Ashʹhur) [perhaps, blackness].
Son of Hezron, born after his father’s death, and great-grandson of Judah. (1 Chron. 2:4, 5, 24) By his two wives he fathered seven sons. (1 Chron. 4:5-7) He is also said to be the father of Tekoa, which some construe to mean that he was the founder of the town by that name.

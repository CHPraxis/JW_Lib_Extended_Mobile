<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The authoritative direction and restraint exercised over the actions of men in communities, societies and states. Also, the person or body of persons or the organizations constituting the governing authority.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures forms of the word <em>ar·kheʹ</em> (“beginning”) are variously translated “principalities,” “governments,” “rulers,” “Sovereignties.” (<em>AV; Dy; NW; AT; JB</em>) <em>Ky·berʹne·sis</em> and <em>ky·ri·oʹtes,</em> rendered “government” in some translations, more correctly mean “steering [guiding or directing]” and “lordship,” respectively. In the Hebrew Scriptures, “government” is the English term sometimes used to translate <em>mem·sha·lahʹ,</em> “dominion” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:21-23:22:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 22:21</a>), and <em>mis·rahʹ,</em> “dominion” or “princely rule [or power].”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 9:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible reveals that there are invisible governments that are good, as established by God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:10-49:3:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 3:10</a>), as well as those that are wicked, established by Satan and the demons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) Jesus Christ was the active agent of God in originally setting up all righteous governments and authorities, invisible and visible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 1:15, 16</a>) He has been placed by his Father Jehovah as head of all government (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:8-51:2:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 2:8-10</a>), and he must rule until all opposing governments, invisible and visible, are brought to nothing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:24</a>) The apostle Paul indicated that there was a system of things to come in which there would be a government under the authority of Christ.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:19-49:1:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 1:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>WORLD GOVERNMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible pictures world governments as ‘beasts’ and says that they get their authority from the Dragon, Satan the Devil. God has permitted them to remain and has limited their scope and duration of rule, in harmony with his purpose.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. chaps. 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:1-27:8:27" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:18" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Rev. chaps. 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:1-66:17:18" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:25-27:4:25" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Dan. 4:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:35-27:4:35" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:11-43:19:11" data-bid="9-7" class="b"> John 19:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="9-8" class="b"> Acts 17:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:3-47:4:4" data-bid="9-9" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:3, 4</a>; see BEASTS, SYMBOLIC.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>CHRISTIANS AND GOVERNMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus Christ and the early Christians did nothing to interfere with the governments of their day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:15-43:6:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Jas. 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 4:4</a>) They recognized the fact that some form of government is necessary for the existence of society, and they never fomented revolution or civil disobedience. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:1-56:3:1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Titus 3:1</a>) Jesus set forth the guiding principle for true worshipers of God to follow when he said: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 22:21</a>) This principle enabled the early Christians (and Christians since then) to maintain a right balance as to relations with the two authorities, that of the civil governments and that of God. Jesus showed further that, while he was on earth, his position and, therefore, that of his disciples, was to be not one of rebellion toward the “Caesar” governments, but, rather, one of compliance with their regulations that did not conflict with God’s law. Pilate himself recognized this fact when he said: “I find no fault in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:38-43:18:38" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 18:38</a>) The apostles followed this principle.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:19-44:4:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 4:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:16-44:24:16" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 24:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:10-44:25:11" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 25:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:18-44:25:19" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 18, 19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:25-44:25:25" data-bid="14-6" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:31-44:26:32" data-bid="14-7" class="b"> 26:31, 32</a>; see ADMINISTRATION; KINGDOM; SUPERIOR AUTHORITIES.</p>

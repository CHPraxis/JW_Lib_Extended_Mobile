RUSH
[Heb., ʼagh·monʹ].
Any of a variety of grass-like plants commonly growing in marshes. The true rushes have round, frequently hollow, stems with three rows of grasslike leaves, and small brownish or greenish flowers. The designation ʼagh·monʹ may have included the various kinds of true rushes as well as the rushlike plants of the sedge family. Anciently, rushes were employed in starting the fire in a furnace.—Job 41:20.
At Job 41:2 “rush” may refer to a cord of twisted rushes or one spun from their fibers. The other Scriptural references to ʼagh·monʹ are illustrative. Jehovah took no delight in renegade Israel’s fasting, attended by bowing their heads ceremonially like a rush. (Isa. 58:5) At Isaiah 9:14, “rush” seems to refer to the false prophets (the “tail”) who merely spoke what the leaders of the nation of Israel (the “head” or “shoot”) wanted to hear.—Isa. 9:15; see also Isaiah 19:15, where “rush” appears to denote the Egyptians in general.

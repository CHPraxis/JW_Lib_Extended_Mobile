<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An open area that served as a center for buying and selling and as a place of public assembly in cities and towns of the ancient Middle East and the Roman world. In Greek and Roman cities, statues and public buildings, including religious edifices, surrounded the open area. It appears that some judicial matters were handled in marketplaces. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:19-44:16:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:19-21</a>.) Also, news, both local and foreign, could be obtained in the marketplace, for it was there that persons congregated and spoke about the latest happenings.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:17-44:17:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 17:17-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the marketplaces of Palestine children could be found playing games.

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:3-40:20:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 20:3, 4</a>.) The proud scribes and Pharisees wanted to be noticed by the throngs there and to be greeted in accord with their assumed high station. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:2-40:23:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 23:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:6-40:23:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:38-41:12:38" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Mark 12:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:43-42:11:43" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Luke 11:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:46-42:20:46" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 20:46</a>) Upon returning from the market, the tradition-keeping Pharisees and other Jews cleansed themselves by sprinkling before ever eating anything.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:3-41:7:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 7:3, 4</a>.</p>

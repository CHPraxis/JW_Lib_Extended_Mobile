<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(E·glaʹim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently one of the geographical extremities of Moab, that, according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:8-23:15:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>, was due to ‘howl’ over that nation’s despoiling. The exact location of the ancient site is unknown. However, Eglaim and a similar name, Agallim, mentioned by Eusebius as seven and four-tenths miles (11.9 kilometers) S of Rabba, may be preserved at Rujm el-Jilimeh in that area or at Khirbet Jeljul, a location dating from Nabataean-Roman times, a little farther S.</p>

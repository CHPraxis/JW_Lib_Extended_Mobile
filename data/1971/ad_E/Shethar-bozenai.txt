SHETHAR-BOZENAI
(Sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai) [perhaps, delivering the kingdom].
An official, perhaps a secretary, associated with Tattenai the Persian governor “beyond the River” during the reign of Darius I (Hystaspis). (Ezra 5:3, 6; 6:6, 13) Shethar-bozenai came with Tattenai and others to Jerusalem, to register their objections to the Jews’ rebuilding the temple, which work Artaxerxes had banned. However, the Jews kept working in spite of the complaints while an appeal to Darius was made on the strength of Cyrus’ original decree to rebuild the temple. Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues then wrote a letter to Darius asking him to check into this. Darius’ reply acknowledged Cyrus’ unchangeable decree and not only ordered Shethar-bozenai and his comrades to ‘keep their distance’ from Jerusalem, but demanded, under severe penalty, that material support be provided from the royal treasury for the Jews so that their temple building and services could continue. Shethar-bozenai and his associates did as commanded.—Ezra 4:23–6:13.

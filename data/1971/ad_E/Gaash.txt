GAASH
(Gaʹash) [perhaps, shaking, or, earthquake].
The name of a hill in the mountainous region of Ephraim S of Timnath-heres (or Timnath-serah). (Josh. 24:30; Judg. 2:9) The torrent valleys of Gaash, mentioned in 2 Samuel 23:30 and 1 Chronicles 11:32, apparently refer to ravines in the vicinity of that hill.

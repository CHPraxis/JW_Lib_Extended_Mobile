<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of the heavier metallic elements, having the specific gravity 11.34. With understanding, therefore, Moses poetically sang in triumph that the Egyptians “sank like lead” in the Red Sea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:10-2:15:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 15:10</a>) The dull-gray metal was useful as weight on fishlines and nets and as heavy lids or covers. The Hebrew word translated “plummet” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:7:7-30:7:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Amos 7:7, 8</a> may mean “lead” or “tin.” The Greek word for “sounding” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:28-44:27:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 27:28</a> is from a root meaning “to heave the lead.” For permanency and legibility liquid lead was sometimes poured into engravings on stone—a practice dating at least to Job’s day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:23-18:19:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 19:23, 24</a>) “Soldering” (Heb., <em>deʹveq</em>) is mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:7-23:41:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:7</a> in connection with the making of idols, but whether the solder was made of lead and tin, as today, is not known.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The most common source of lead was galena, a lead sulfide ore. It was mined in the Arabah between the S end of the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqabah. Tarshish (Spain) was another source of supply. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:12-26:27:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:12</a>) Lead ore had to be smelted in a furnace like the ores of other metals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:29-24:6:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 6:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:18-26:22:20" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ezek. 22:18-20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:22-4:31:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Numbers 31:22, 23</a>.) The first step in the refining process converted lead sulfide to lead oxide, which was itself sometimes used as a pottery glaze, as evidenced in the ruins of Egypt and Nineveh.—See REFINE, REFINER.</p>

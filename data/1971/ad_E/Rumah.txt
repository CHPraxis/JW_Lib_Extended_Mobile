RUMAH
(Ruʹmah) [height].
Home of Zebidah (and her father Pedaiah), a wife of King Josiah of Judah and the mother of Jehoiakim. (2 Ki. 23:34, 36) Its location is uncertain. The best possibility seems to be Khirbet Rumeh, which bears a similar name. It is situated less than fifteen miles (c. 24 kilometers) W of the Sea of Galilee and six miles (10 kilometers) N of Nazareth. But some connect Rumah with the Biblical town of Arumah, mentioned at Judges 9:41 and thought to have been located near Shechem.—See ARUMAH.

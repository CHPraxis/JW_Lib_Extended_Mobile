GALLIM
(Galʹlim) [heaps].
The home of Palti, to whom Saul gave his daughter Michal as his wife after David was outlawed. (1 Sam. 25:44) It is possibly the same as the Gallim whose inhabitants, centuries later, cried out in lamentation over the approaching Assyrian army under Sennacherib. (Isa. 10:24, 30) Gallim is placed at Khirbet Kakul, three miles (4.8 kilometers) NE of Jerusalem, by most modern geographers.

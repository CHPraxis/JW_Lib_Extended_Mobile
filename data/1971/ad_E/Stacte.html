<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One of the ingredients of the incense limited to sacred use. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:34-2:30:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 30:34-37</a>) The stacte drops perhaps were the product of the storax, a tree that exudes a brown, vanilla-flavored resin from incisions made in its stem and branches. Another possible source for stacte may be the opobalsam, a shrublike evergreen tree yielding a greenish-yellow oily resin.</p>

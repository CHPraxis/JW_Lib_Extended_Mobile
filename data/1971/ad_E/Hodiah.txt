HODIAH
(Ho·diʹah) [my splendor is Jah].
1. A man who married the sister of a certain Naham. The name appears in the genealogy of Judah.—1 Chron. 4:1, 19.
2. A Levite who assisted Ezra in explaining the law of Jehovah to the congregation of Israel assembled before the Water Gate at the public square of Jerusalem, and evidently also one of those who called upon the sons of Israel to bless Jehovah and his glorious name and then reviewed God’s dealings with his people. (Neh. 8:1, 5, 7; 9:5) This Hodiah may be the same as either No. 3 or 4 below.
3, 4. The name of two Levites whose descendants, if not they themselves, attested by seal to the confession contract made during Nehemiah’s governorship. If they personally did the sealing, then one of them could have been No. 2 above.—Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 9, 10, 13.
5. One of the “heads of the people” whose descendant, if not himself, attested to the confession contract in Nehemiah’s day.—Neh. 10:1, 14, 18.

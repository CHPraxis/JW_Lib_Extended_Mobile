ENGRAVING
The art of cutting designs or letters into materials such as wood (1 Ki. 6:29, 32), metal (Ex. 39:30) or stone. (Zech. 3:9) The earliest allusion to engraving in Scripture may be the reference to Judah’s seal ring. (Gen. 38:18) Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even diamond points. (Jer. 17:1) But the Ten Commandments were engraved on stone by God’s “finger.” (Ex. 31:18; 32:16; 34:1; 2 Cor. 3:7) Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder pieces of the high priest’s ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel, and each of the twelve precious stones adorning his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest’s turban, was engraved with the words: “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.” Filled with God’s spirit, Bezalel along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex. 35:30-35; 28:9-12; 39:6-14, 30.

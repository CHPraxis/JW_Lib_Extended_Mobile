<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(sarʹdo·nyx).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An ornamental stone that is a variety of agate, a kind of chalcedony. It is an onyx composed of two or more layers of milk-white chalcedony and transparent red sard. However, the contrasting layer is sometimes golden or brown. The red layer showing through the white one appeared much like the color of a fingernail to the Greeks, which was probably why they applied to it the Greek word <em>oʹnyx</em> (meaning “fingernail”), from which the English term “onyx” is derived. Sardonyx is found in various places, including Palestine and Arabia.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sardonyx was valued in ancient times for engraved <span id="page1449" class="pageNum" data-no="1449" data-before-text="1449"></span>jewels, cameos, intaglios, and seal rings. The stone is mentioned once in the Bible, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:19-66:21:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>, where the fifth foundation stone of “the holy city, New Jerusalem,” is a sardonyx stone.</p>

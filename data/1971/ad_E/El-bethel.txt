EL-BETHEL
(El-bethʹel) [the God of Bethel].
The name given by Jacob to the spot where he erected an altar in obedience to God’s command. (Gen. 35:1, 7) Certain scholars consider “The God of Bethel” to be an unlikely name for a location, and note that the translators of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Peshitta and Arabic versions omitted the initial “El” from the name. However, it should be remembered that the area around Bethel was full of meaning for Jacob. It was in this area some twenty years earlier that God revealed himself to Jacob in a dream, promising to protect him. At that time the patriarch was moved to respond, “Truly Jehovah is in this place.” (Gen. 28:10-22) Since this was the case, when later naming the altar site, Jacob was saying in effect, ‘God is in Bethel.’—Compare Genesis 33:20.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Na·halʹi·el) [perhaps, torrent valley of God].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place where the Israelites encamped not long before their fight with Amorite King Sihon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:19-4:21:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 21:19-24</a>) Eusebius’ <em>Onomasticon</em> locates it near the Arnon River. Nahaliel is therefore commonly linked with one of two wadies, the Wadi Wala (a tributary of the Arnon) and the Wadi Zerqua Maʽin about twelve miles (19 kilometers) N of the Arnon. A location on either of these wadies would fit the suggested identifications for Mattanah and Bamoth, the two Israelite encampments between which Nahaliel apparently lay.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Kerʹen-hapʹpuch) [perhaps, horn of antimony, or, beautifier].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The third and youngest of the daughters born to Job after his great test and suffering had ended and Jehovah had blessed him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:12-18:42:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 42:12-14</a>) The name may be suggestive of beautiful eyes, or may be indicative of her great beauty generally, as “no women were found as pretty as Job’s daughters in all the land.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:15-18:42:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 42:15</a>) Antimony, which is a bluish-white metallic substance, produces a brilliant black color and was used by Oriental women of Biblical days to dye their eyelashes, and perhaps their eyebrows, or to color the edges of their eyelids, thus making the eyes appear large and lustrous. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:30-12:9:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 9:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:30-24:4:30" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 4:30</a>.) So the meaning of the name Keren-happuch apparently relates to the small receptacle or horn anciently used for eye paint.</p>

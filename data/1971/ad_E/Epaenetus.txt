EPAENETUS
(E·paeʹne·tus) [Gr., praised, praiseworthy].
A Christian in the congregation at Rome whom Paul mentions by name and to whom he sends personal greetings. (Rom. 16:5) Epaenetus is called “a first fruits of Asia.” Possibly he was contacted personally by Paul, since the household of Stephanus is similarly referred to as “the first fruits of Achaia,” and Paul baptized this household.—1 Cor. 1:16; 16:15.

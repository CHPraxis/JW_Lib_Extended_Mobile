BAMOTH
(Baʹmoth) [heights, or, high place].
One of the encampment stages of the nation of Israel on its approach to the land of Canaan. (Num. 21:19, 20) Bamoth is listed as between Nahaliel and “the valley that is in the field of Moab, at the head of Pisgah.” It is probably a shortened form of Bamoth-baal.—See BAMOTH-BAAL.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Gaʹbri·el) [an able-bodied one of God].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The only holy angel other than Michael named in the Bible; the only materialized angel to give his name. Twice Gabriel appeared to Daniel: first, near the Ulai River “in the third year of the kingship of Belshazzar” to explain Daniel’s vision of the he-goat and the ram (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:1-27:8:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:15-27:8:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15-26</a>); and second, “in the first year of Darius” the Mede, to deliver the prophecy concerning the “seventy weeks.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:1-27:9:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 9:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:20-27:9:27" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20-27</a>) To Zechariah the priest, Gabriel brought the good news that he and his aging wife Elizabeth would have a son, John (the Baptist). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:11-42:1:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 1:11-20</a>) To Mary, the virgin girl betrothed to Joseph, Gabriel addressed himself, saying: “Good day, highly favored one, Jehovah is with you.” He then told her that she would give birth to a son, Jesus, who “will be called Son of the Most High; and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, . . . and there will be no end of his kingdom.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:38" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:26-38</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From the Bible record it is learned that Gabriel is a high-ranking angelic creature in close association with the heavenly court, one “who stands near before God”; that he was one “sent forth” by God to deliver special messages to servants of Jehovah here on earth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:19-42:1:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 1:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:26-42:1:26" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 26</a>); that his personal envisioned or materialized form was, true to the meaning of his name, “like an able-bodied man.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:15-27:8:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 8:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of Job’s three “companions”; the Naamathite. The meaning of name is rather indefinite. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:11-18:2:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 2:11</a>) Zophar was the third in turn to speak in the debate with Job. His general line of reasoning followed that of Eliphaz and Bildad; he accused Job of wickedness, telling him to put away his sinful practices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:11:1-18:11:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job chaps. 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:20:1-18:20:29" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20</a>) But after two rounds Zophar desisted; he had spoken his words of denunciation and had nothing to add in the third round. In the end Jehovah commanded that he and his companions offer a great sacrifice, and that Job pray in their behalf.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:7-18:42:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:7-9</a>.</p>

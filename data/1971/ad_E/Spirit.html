<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>ruʹahh;</em> Gr., <em>pneuʹma</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The English word “spirit” is from the Latin <em>spirare,</em> meaning “to breathe” (noun form <em>spiritus,</em> “a breath,” “breathing”), the words “respiration,” “expiration” and “inspiration” <span id="page1542" class="pageNum" data-no="1542" data-before-text="1542"></span>all being derived from the same source. Similarly the Greek <em>pneuʹma</em> comes from <em>pneʹo,</em> meaning “to breathe or blow,” and the Hebrew <em>ruʹahh</em> is believed to come from a root having the same meaning.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The noun forms <em>ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma,</em> then, basically mean “breath” but have extended meanings beyond that basic sense. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:19-35:2:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:15-66:13:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 13:15</a>.) They can also mean <em>wind;</em> the <em>vital force</em> in living creatures; <em>one’s spirit, dominant feeling</em> or <em>disposition; spirit persons,</em> including God and his angelic creatures; and <em>God’s active force</em> or <em>holy spirit.</em> (Compare Koehler and Baumgartner’s <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> pages 877-879; Brown, Driver and Briggs’ <em>Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> pages 924-926; <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by G. Kittel, Vol. VI, pages 332-451.) All these meanings have something in common: they all refer to that which is invisible to human sight and which gives evidence of force in motion. Such invisible force is capable of producing visible effects.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Another Hebrew word, <em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>) also means “breath,” but is more limited in range of meaning than <em>ruʹahh.</em> The Greek <em>pno·eʹ</em> seems to have a similar limited sense (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 17:25</a>), and was used by the <em>Septuagint</em> translators to render <em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>WIND</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Consider first the sense that is perhaps easiest to grasp. The context in many cases shows <em>ruʹahh</em> to mean “wind,” as the “east wind” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:10:13-2:10:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 10:13</a>), the “four winds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:6-38:2:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zech. 2:6</a>) The mention of such things as clouds, storm, the blowing of chaff or things of similar nature appearing in the context often makes evident this sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:31-4:11:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 11:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:45-11:18:45" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:11-11:19:11" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 19:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:21:18-18:21:18" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Job 21:18</a>, and so forth.) Because the four winds are used to mean the four directions—east, west, north and south—<em>ruʹahh</em> at times may be rendered as ‘direction’ or ‘side.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:9:24-13:9:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Chron. 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:49:36-24:49:36" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jer. 49:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:52:23-24:52:23" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 52:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:42:16-26:42:20" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Ezek. 42:16-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:41:15-18:41:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 41:15, 16</a> says of Leviathan’s closely fitting scales that “not even air [<em>ruʹahh</em>] can come in between them.” Here again <em>ruʹahh</em> represents air <em>in motion,</em> not merely air in a quiescent or motionless state. Thus the thought of an <em>invisible force</em> is present, the basic characteristic of the Hebrew <em>ruʹahh</em>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Evidently the only case in the Christian Greek Scriptures in which <em>pneuʹma</em> is used in the sense of “wind” is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:8-43:3:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 3:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Man cannot exercise control over the wind, cannot guide, direct, restrain or possess it. Because of this, “wind [<em>ruʹahh</em>]” frequently stands for that which is uncontrollable or unattainable by man, elusive, transitory, in vain, of no genuine benefit. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:26-18:6:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 6:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:7:7-18:7:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 7:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:8:2-18:8:2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 8:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:16:3-18:16:3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 16:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:29-20:11:29" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> Proverbs 11:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:15-20:27:16" data-bid="10-6" class="b"> 27:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:4-20:30:4" data-bid="10-7" class="b"> 30:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:14-21:1:14" data-bid="10-8" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:17-21:1:17" data-bid="10-9" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:11-21:2:11" data-bid="10-10" class="b"> 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:18-23:26:18" data-bid="10-11" class="b"> Isaiah 26:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:29-23:41:29" data-bid="10-12" class="b"> 41:29</a>, and so forth.)

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">God is invisible to human eyes (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:20-2:33:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:17-54:1:17" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 1:17</a>), and he is alive and exercises unsurpassed force throughout the universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:3-47:3:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Cor. 3:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:25-23:40:31" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Isa. 40:25-31</a>) Christ Jesus states: “God is a Spirit [<em>Pneuʹma</em>].” The apostle writes: “Now Jehovah is the Spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 4:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:17-47:3:18" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 3:17, 18</a>) The temple built on Christ as foundation cornerstone is “a place for God to inhabit by spirit.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:22-49:2:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 2:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">This does not mean that God is an impersonal, bodiless force like the wind. The Scriptures unmistakably testify to his personality; he also has location so that Christ could speak of ‘going to his Father,’ this in order that he might “appear before the person of God [literally “face of God”] for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:28-43:16:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 16:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:24</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:43-11:8:43" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:4" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Psalm 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:5-19:113:6" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 113:5, 6</a>.) For further discussion, see JEHOVAH (The Person Identified by the Name).</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The expression “my spirit” (<em>ruʹahh</em>) used by God at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:3-1:6:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 6:3</a> may mean “I the Spirit,” even as his use of “my soul” (<em>neʹphesh</em>) has the sense of “I the person,” or “my person.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:14-23:1:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 1:14</a>; see SOUL [God as Having Soul].) He thereby contrasts his heavenly spiritual position with that of earthly fleshly man.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong><em>God’s Son</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God’s “only-begotten son,” the Word, was a spirit person like his Father, hence “existing in God’s form” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-8</a>), but later “became flesh,” residing among mankind as the man Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Completing his earthly course, he was “put to death in the flesh, but [was] made alive in the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18</a>) His Father resurrected him, granted his Son’s request to be glorified alongside the Father with the glory he had had in his prehuman state (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:4-43:17:5" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 17:4, 5</a>), and God made him “a life-giving spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:45-46:15:45" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:45</a>) The Son thus became again invisible to human sight, dwelling “in unapproachable light, whom not one of men has seen or can see.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:14-54:6:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong><em>Other spirit creatures</em></strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Angels are designated by the terms <em>ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> in a number of texts.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:4-19:104:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 104:4</a> states that God makes “his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.” Some translations would render this to read: “Who makest the winds thy messengers, fire and flame thy ministers,” or similarly. (<em>RS, JP, AT, JB</em>) Such translation of the Hebrew text is not inadmissible (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:8-19:148:8" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 148:8</a>); however, the apostle Paul’s quotation of the text (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:7-58:1:7" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 1:7</a>) coincides with that of the <em>Septuagint</em> and harmonizes with the rendering first given. (In the Greek text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:7-58:1:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a> the definite article [<em>tous</em>] is used before “angels,” not before “spirits [<em>pneuʹma·ta</em>],” making the angels the proper subject of the clause.) <em>Barnes’ Notes</em> on Hebrews says: “It is to be presumed that [Paul], who had been trained in the knowledge of the Hebrew language, would have had a better opportunity of knowing its [referring to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:4-19:104:4" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 104:4</a>] fair construction than we can; and it is morally certain, that he would employ the passage <em>in an argument</em> as it was commonly understood by those to whom he wrote—that is, to those who were familiar with the Hebrew language and literature.”—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:14-58:1:14" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">God’s angels, though capable of materializing human form and appearing to men, are not by nature material or fleshly, hence are Invisible. They are actively alive and able to exert great force, and the terms <em>ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> therefore aptly describe them.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:12</a> speaks of Christian wrestling, “not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” The latter part of the text in Greek literally reads: “Toward the spiritual (things) [Gr., <em>pneu·ma·ti·kaʹ</em>] of the wickedness in the heavenly [places].” Most modern translations recognize that the reference here is not simply to something abstract, “spiritual wickedness” (<em>AV</em>), but refers to wickedness carried out by spirit <em>persons</em>. Thus, we have such renderings as: “the spirit-forces of evil on high” (<em>AT</em>), “the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (<em>RS</em>), “the spiritual army of evil in the heavens” (<em>JB</em>), “the superhuman forces of evil in the heavens” (<em>NE,</em> 1970 ed).</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S ACTIVE FORCE; HOLY SPIRIT</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">By far the majority of occurrences of <em>ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> relate to God’s spirit, his holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong><em>Not a person</em></strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It was not until the fourth century C.E. that the teaching that the holy spirit was a person and part of the “Godhead” became official church dogma. Earlier Christians, sometimes called church “fathers,” <span id="page1543" class="pageNum" data-no="1543" data-before-text="1543"></span>did not so teach; Justin Martyr of the second century C.E. taught that the holy spirit was an ‘influence or mode of operation of the Deity’; Hippolytus likewise ascribed no personality to the holy spirit. The Scriptures themselves unite to show that God’s holy spirit is not a person but is God’s <em>active force</em> by which he accomplishes his purpose and executes his will.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">It may first be noted that the words “in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one” (<em>AV</em>) found in older translations at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:7-62:5:7" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 John 5:7</a> are actually spurious additions to the original text. A footnote in <em>The Jerusalem Bible,</em> a Catholic translation, says that these words are “not in any of the early Greek MSS [manuscripts], or any of the early translations, or in the best MSS of the Vulg[ate] itself.” Modern translations as a whole, both Catholic and Protestant, do not include them in the main body of the text, due to recognizing their spurious nature.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong><em>Personification does not prove personality</em></strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It is true that Jesus spoke of the holy spirit as a “helper” and spoke of such helper as ‘teaching,’ ‘bearing witness,’ ‘giving evidence,’ ‘guiding,’ ‘speaking,’ ‘hearing,’ and ‘receiving.’ In so doing, the original Greek shows Jesus at times applying the personal pronoun “he” to that “helper” (paraclete). (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 14:16, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:26-43:15:26" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 15:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:7-43:16:15" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 16:7-15</a>.) However, it is not unusual in the Scriptures for something to be personalized or personified that is not actually a person. Wisdom is personified in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:20-20:1:33" data-bid="36-1" class="b">the book of Proverbs (1:20-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:1-20:8:36" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 8:1-36</a>) and feminine pronominal forms are used of it in the original Hebrew, as also in many English translations. (<em>AV, RS, JP, AT</em>) Wisdom is also personified at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:19-40:11:19" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 11:19 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:35-42:7:35" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Luke 7:35</a>, and is there depicted as having both “works” and “children.” The apostle Paul personalized sin and death and also undeserved kindness as “kings.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rom. 5:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:17-45:5:17" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:21-45:5:21" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> 6:12</a>) He speaks of sin as “receiving an inducement,” ‘working out covetousness,’ ‘seducing,’ and ‘killing.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:8-45:7:11" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Rom. 7:8-11</a>) Yet it is obvious that Paul did not mean that sin was actually a person.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">So, likewise with John’s account of Jesus’ words regarding the holy spirit, his remarks must be taken in context. Jesus personalized the holy spirit when speaking of that spirit as a “helper” (which in Greek is the masculine substantive <em>pa·raʹkle·tos</em>). Properly, therefore, John presents Jesus’ words as referring to that “helper” aspect of the spirit with masculine personal pronouns. On the other hand, in the same context, when the Greek <em>pneuʹma</em> is used, John employs a neuter pronoun to refer to the holy spirit, <em>pneuʹma</em> itself being neuter. Hence, we have in John’s use of the masculine personal pronoun in association with <em>pa·raʹkle·tos</em> an example of conformity to grammatical rules, not an expression of doctrine.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:16-43:14:17" data-bid="40-1" class="b">John 14:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:7-43:16:8" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 16:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong><em>Lacks personal identification</em></strong></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Since God himself is a Spirit and is holy and since all his faithful angelic sons are spirits and are holy, it is evident that if the “holy spirit” were a person there should reasonably be given some means in the Scriptures to distinguish and identify such spirit <em>person</em> from all these other ‘holy spirits.’ It would be expected that, at the very least, the definite article would be used with it in all cases where it is not called “God’s holy spirit” or is not modified by some similar expression. This would at least distinguish it as THE Holy Spirit. But, to the contrary, in a large number of cases the expression “holy spirit” appears in the original Greek without the article, thus indicating its lack of personality.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:3-44:6:3" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Acts 6:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:5-44:6:5" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:55-44:7:55" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 7:55;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:15-44:8:15" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 8:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:17-44:8:17" data-bid="41-5" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:19-44:8:19" data-bid="41-6" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:17-44:9:17" data-bid="41-7" class="b"> 9:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:24-44:11:24" data-bid="41-8" class="b"> 11:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:9-44:13:9" data-bid="41-9" class="b"> 13:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:52-44:13:52" data-bid="41-10" class="b"> 52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:2-44:19:2" data-bid="41-11" class="b"> 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:1" data-bid="41-12" class="b"> Romans 9:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:17-45:14:17" data-bid="41-13" class="b"> 14:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="41-14" class="b"> 15:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:16-45:15:16" data-bid="41-15" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:19-45:15:19" data-bid="41-16" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:3-46:12:3" data-bid="41-17" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 12:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:4-58:2:4" data-bid="41-18" class="b"> Hebrews 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:4-58:6:4" data-bid="41-19" class="b"> 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="41-20" class="b"> 2 Peter 1:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:20-65:1:20" data-bid="41-21" class="b"> Jude 20</a> in the <em>Kingdom Interlinear Translation</em> or other interlinear translations.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong><em>How baptized in its “name”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a> reference is made to the “name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” A “name” can mean something other than a personal name. When, in English, we say, “in the name of the law,” or “in the name of common sense,” we have no reference to a person as such. By “name” in these expressions we mean ‘what the law stands for or its authority’ and ‘what common sense represents or calls for.’ The Greek term for “name” (<em>oʹno·ma</em>) also can have this sense. Thus, while some translations (<em>AV, AS</em>) follow the Greek text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:41-40:10:41" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 10:41</a> literally and say that the one that “receiveth a prophet <em>in the name of</em> a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man <em>in the name of</em> a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward,” more modern translations say, “receives a prophet <em>because he is</em> a prophet” and “receives a righteous man <em>because he is</em> a righteous man,” or similar. (<em>RS, AT, JB, NW</em>) Thus, Robertson’s <em>Word Pictures in the New Testament</em> (Vol. I, p. 245) says on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>: “The use of name <em>(onoma)</em> here is a common one in the Septuagint and the papyri for power or authority.” Hence baptism ‘in the name of the holy spirit’ implies recognition of that spirit as having its source in God and as exercising its function according to the divine will.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Other evidence of its impersonal nature</em></strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Further evidence against the idea of personality as regards the holy spirit is the way it is used in association with other impersonal things, such as water and fire (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Matt. 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:8-41:1:8" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Mark 1:8</a>), and Christians are spoken of as being baptized “in holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:5-44:1:5" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Acts 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:16-44:11:16" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 11:16</a>) Persons are urged to become “filled with spirit” instead of wine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:18-49:5:18" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Eph. 5:18</a>) So, too, persons are spoken of as being ‘filled’ with it along with such qualities as wisdom and faith (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:3-44:6:3" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Acts 6:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:5-44:6:5" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:24-44:11:24" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> 11:24</a>) or joy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:52-44:13:52" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Acts 13:52</a>), and holy spirit is inserted or ‘sandwiched in’ with a number of such qualities at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:6-47:6:6" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>. It is most unlikely that such expressions would be made if reference were being made to a divine person. As to the spirit’s ‘bearing witness’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:32-44:5:32" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Acts 5:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:23-44:20:23" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 20:23</a>), it may be noted that the same thing is said of “the water and the blood” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:6-62:5:8" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 John 5:6-8</a>. While some texts refer to the spirit as ‘witnessing,’ ‘speaking,’ ‘saying’ things, other texts make clear that it spoke through persons, having no personal voice of its own. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:7-58:3:7" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:15-58:10:17" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 10:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:7-19:95:7" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> Psalm 95:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:33-24:31:34" data-bid="53-4" class="b"> Jeremiah 31:33, 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:2-44:19:6" data-bid="53-5" class="b"> Acts 19:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:4-44:21:4" data-bid="53-6" class="b"> 21:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:25-44:28:25" data-bid="53-7" class="b"> 28:25</a>.) It may thus be compared to radio waves that can receive a message from a person speaking into a microphone and transmit the message to persons a distance away, in effect, ‘speaking’ the message by a radio loudspeaker. God, by his spirit, transmits his messages and communicates his will to the minds and hearts of his servants on earth, who, in turn, may convey that message to yet others.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong><em>Distinguished from “power”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><em>Ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma,</em> therefore, when used with reference to God’s holy spirit, refer to God’s invisible active force by which he accomplishes his divine purpose and will. It is “holy” because it is from Him, not of an earthly source, and is free from all corruption as “the spirit of holiness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:4-45:1:4" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Rom. 1:4</a>) It is not Jehovah’s “power,” for this English word more correctly translates other terms in the original languages (Heb., <em>koʹahh;</em> Gr., <em>dyʹna·mis</em>). <em>Ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> are used in close association or even in parallel with these terms signifying “power,” which shows that there is an inherent connection between them and yet a definite distinction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:3:8-33:3:8" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Mic. 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:6" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Zech. 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:17-42:1:17" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> Luke 1:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="55-4" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:38-44:10:38" data-bid="55-5" class="b"> Acts 10:38</a>) “Power” is basically the ability or capacity to act or do things and it can be latent, dormant, inactively resident in someone or something. “Force,” on the other hand, more specifically describes energy <em>projected</em> and <em>exerted</em> on persons or things, and may be defined as “an influence which produces or tends to produce motion, or change of motion.” “Power” <span id="page1544" class="pageNum" data-no="1544" data-before-text="1544"></span>might be likened to the stored energy in a battery, while “force” could be compared to the current flowing from such battery. “Force,” then, more accurately represents the sense of the Hebrew and Greek terms as relating to God’s spirit, and this is borne out by a consideration of the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong>ITS USE IN CREATION</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">Jehovah God accomplished the creation of the material universe by means of his spirit or active force. Regarding the planet Earth in its early formative stages, the record states that “God’s active force [or “spirit,” (<em>ruʹahh</em>)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:2-1:1:2" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:6-19:33:6" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Psalm 33:6</a> says: “By the word of Jehovah the heavens themselves were made, and by the spirit of his mouth all their army.” Like a powerful breath, God’s spirit can be sent forth to exert power even though there is no bodily contact with that which is acted upon. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:8-2:15:8" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Exodus 15:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:10-2:15:10" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 10</a>.) Where a human craftsman would use the force of his hands and fingers to produce things, God uses his spirit. Hence that spirit is also spoken of as God’s “hand” or “fingers.”—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:3-19:8:3" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 19:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:28-40:12:28" data-bid="59-3" class="b"> Matthew 12:28</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:20-42:11:20" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Luke 11:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Modern science speaks of matter as “organized energy,” like “bundles of energy,” and recognizes that: “Matter can be changed into energy and energy into matter.” (<em>World Book Encyclopedia,</em> 1970 ed., Vol. 13, pp. 246-248) The immensity of the universe that man has thus far been able to discern with his telescopes gives some slight concept of the inexhaustible source of energy to be found in Jehovah God. As the prophet wrote: “Who has taken the proportions of the spirit of Jehovah?”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:12-23:40:13" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Isa. 40:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:25-23:40:26" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong><em>Source of animate life and reproductive powers</em></strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Not only inanimate creation but also all animate creation therefore owes its existence and life to the operation of Jehovah’s spirit that produced the original living creatures through whom all living creatures today have come to exist. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:4-18:33:4" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job 33:4</a>; see section of this article under “Breath; Breath of Life; Life Force.”) Jehovah used his holy spirit to revive Abraham and Sarah’s reproductive powers and therefore Isaac could be spoken of as “born in the manner of spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:28-48:4:29" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Gal. 4:28, 29</a>) By his spirit God also transferred his Son’s life from heaven to earth, causing conception in the womb of the virgin Jewess Mary.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:18-40:1:18" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Matt. 1:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:20-40:1:20" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:35-42:1:35" data-bid="64-3" class="b"> Luke 1:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH USES SPIRIT ON BEHALF OF HIS SERVANTS</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">A principal operation of God’s spirit involves its ability to inform, to illuminate, to reveal things. Therefore David could pray: “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your spirit is good; may it lead me in the land of uprightness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:10-19:143:10" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 143:10</a>) Much earlier, Joseph had given the interpretation of Pharaoh’s prophetic dreams, being enabled to do so by God’s help. The Egyptian ruler recognized the operation of God’s spirit in him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:16-1:41:16" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Gen. 41:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:25-1:41:39" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 25-39</a>) This illuminating power of the spirit is particularly notable in prophecy. Prophecy, as the apostle shows, did not spring from human interpretation of circumstances and events, so that the prophets were able to explain the meaning and significance of these or forecast the shape of coming events by their own ability. Rather, such men were “borne along by holy spirit,” conveyed, moved and guided by God’s active force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="67-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:2-10:23:2" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 23:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:12-38:7:12" data-bid="67-3" class="b"> Zech. 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:67-42:1:67" data-bid="67-4" class="b"> Luke 1:67;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:25-42:2:35" data-bid="67-5" class="b"> 2:25-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:16-44:1:16" data-bid="67-6" class="b"> Acts 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:25-44:28:25" data-bid="67-7" class="b"> 28:25</a>; see PROPHECY; PROPHET.) So, too, with all the inspired Scriptures. These were “inspired of God,” which translates the Greek <em>the·oʹpneu·stos,</em> meaning, literally, “God-breathed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="68-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>) The spirit operated in various manners in communicating and guiding such men, in some cases causing them to see visions or dreams (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:1" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:28-29:2:29" data-bid="69-2" class="b"> Joel 2:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:1-66:4:2" data-bid="69-3" class="b"> Rev. 4:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:3-66:17:3" data-bid="69-4" class="b"> 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:10-66:21:10" data-bid="69-5" class="b"> 21:10</a>), but in all cases operating on their minds and hearts to motivate and guide them according to God’s purpose.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:1" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Dan. 7:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:9-44:16:10" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> Acts 16:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:10-66:1:11" data-bid="70-3" class="b"> Rev. 1:10, 11</a>; see INSPIRATION.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">God’s spirit, then, not only brings revelation and understanding of God’s will but also energizes his servants to accomplish things in accord with that will. That spirit acts as a driving force that moves and impels them, even as Mark says the spirit “impelled” Jesus to go into the wilderness after his baptism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:12-41:1:12" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Mark 1:12</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:1-42:4:1" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Luke 4:1</a>.) It can be like a “fire” within them, causing them to be “aglow” with that force (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:19-52:5:19" data-bid="73-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:25-44:18:25" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> Acts 18:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> Rom. 12:11</a>), in a sense ‘building up steam’ or pressure in them to do certain work.

Yet it is not merely some unconscious, blind impulse, for their minds and hearts are affected as well so that they can intelligently cooperate with the active force given them. Thus the apostle could say of those who had received the gift of prophecy in the Christian congregation that the “gifts of the spirit of the prophets are to be controlled by the prophets,” so that good order might be maintained.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:31-46:14:33" data-bid="77-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:31-33</a>.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">Even as a force like electricity can be used to accomplish a tremendous variety of things, so God’s spirit is used to commission and enable persons to do a wide variety of things.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">The spirit has qualifying force or capacity; it can qualify persons for a work or for an office. Though Bezalel and Oholiab may have had knowledge of crafts before their appointment in connection with the making of the tabernacle equipment and priestly garments, God’s spirit ‘filled them with wisdom, understanding and knowledge’ so that the work could be done in the way purposed. It heightened whatever natural abilities and acquired knowledge they already had, and enabled them to teach others.

<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="ss"><strong>BREATH; BREATH OF LIFE; LIFE FORCE</strong></p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb">The account of the creation of man states that God formed man from the dust of the ground and proceeded to “blow [<em>na·phahh</em>ʹ] into his nostrils the breath [<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mah</em>ʹ] of life, and the man came to be a living soul [<em>neʹphesh</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="149-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>) As shown under SOUL, <em>neʹphesh</em> may be translated literally as a “breather,” that is, a “breathing creature,” either human or animal. <em>N<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em> is, in fact, used to mean “breathing thing [or creature]” and as such is used as a virtual synonym of <em>neʹphesh,</em> “soul.” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:20:16-5:20:16" data-bid="150-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 20:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:39-6:10:40" data-bid="150-2" class="b"> Joshua 10:39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:11-6:11:11" data-bid="150-3" class="b"> 11:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:29-11:15:29" data-bid="150-4" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:29</a>.) The record at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="151-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> uses <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> in describing God’s causing Adam’s body to have life so that the man became a “living soul.” Other texts, however, show that more was involved than simple breathing of air, that is, more than the mere introduction of air into the lungs and its expulsion therefrom. Thus, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="152-1" class="b">Genesis 7:22</a>, in describing the destruction of human and animal life outside the ark at the time of the Flood, we read: “Everything in which the breath [<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em>] of the force [or, “spirit” (<em>ruʹahh</em>)] of life was active in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died.” <em>N<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ,</em> “breath” is thus directly associated or linked with <em>ruʹahh</em> which here describes the “spirit” or “life force” that is active in all living creatures, human and animal souls.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="sb">As the <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament</em> (Vol. VI, p. 336) states: “Breath may be discerned only in movement [as in the movement of the chest or the expanding of the nostrils], and it is also a sign, condition and agent of life, which seems to be esp[ecially] tied up with breathing.” Hence, the <em>nesha·mahʹ</em> or simple breath is both the product of the <em>ruʹahh</em> or life force and also a principal means of sustaining that life force in living creatures. It is known from scientific studies, for example, that life is present in every single cell of the body’s billions of cells and that, while thousands of millions of cells die each minute, constant reproduction of new living cells goes on. The life force active in all the living cells is dependent upon the oxygen that breathing brings into the body, and which oxygen is transported to all the cells by the bloodstream. Without oxygen some cells begin to the after several minutes, others after a longer period. While a person can go without breathing for a few minutes and still survive, without the <em>life force</em> in his cells he is dead beyond all human ability to revive him. The Hebrew Scriptures, inspired by man’s Designer and Creator, evidently use <em>ruʹahh</em> to denote this vital force that is the very principle of life, and <em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em> to represent the breathing that sustains it.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sb">Because breathing is so inseparably connected with life, <em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em> and <em>ruʹahh</em> are used in clear parallel in various texts. Job voiced his determination to avoid unrighteousness “while my breath [<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em>] is yet whole within me, and the spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>] of God is in my nostrils.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:3-18:27:5" data-bid="153-1" class="b">Job 27:3-5</a>) Elihu said: “If that one’s spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>] and breath [<em>nesha·mah</em>ʹ] he [God] gathers to himself, all flesh will expire [that is, “breathe out”] together, and earthling man himself will return to the very dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:34:14-18:34:15" data-bid="154-1" class="b">Job 34:14, 15</a>) Similarly, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:29-19:104:29" data-bid="155-1" class="b">Psalm 104:29</a> says of earth’s creatures, human and animal: “If you [God] take away their spirit, they expire, and back to their dust they go.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="156-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5</a> Jehovah is spoken of as “the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it.” The breath (<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em>) sustains their existence; the spirit (<em>ruʹahh</em>) energizes and is the life force that enables man to be an animated creature, to move, walk, be actively alive. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:28-44:17:28" data-bid="157-1" class="b">Acts 17:28</a>.) He is not like the lifeless, breathless, inanimate idols of human fabrication.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:15-19:135:15" data-bid="158-1" class="b">Ps. 135:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:17-19:135:17" data-bid="158-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:14-24:10:14" data-bid="158-3" class="b"> Jer. 10:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:51:17-24:51:17" data-bid="158-4" class="b"> 51:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:19-35:2:19" data-bid="158-5" class="b"> Hab. 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="sb">While <em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em> (“breath”) and <em>ruʹahh</em> (“spirit,” “active force,” “life force”) are sometimes used in a parallel sense, they are not identical. True, the “spirit” or <em>ruʹahh</em> is at times spoken of as though it were the respiration (<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mah</em>ʹ) itself, but this seems to be simply because breathing is the prime visible evidence of the life force in one’s body.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:9:18-18:9:18" data-bid="159-1" class="b">Job 9:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:17-18:19:17" data-bid="159-2" class="b"> 19:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:3-18:27:3" data-bid="159-3" class="b"> 27:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="sb">Thus at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:10" data-bid="160-1" class="b">Ezekiel 37:1-10</a> the symbolic vision of the valley of dry bones is presented, the bones coming together, becoming covered with sinews, flesh and skin, but “as regards breath [<em>ruʹahh</em>], there was none in them.” Ezekiel was told to prophesy to the “wind [<em>ruʹahh</em>],” saying, “From the four winds [<em>ruʹahh</em>] come in, O wind, and blow upon these killed people, that they may come to life.” The reference to the <em>four</em> winds shows that wind is the appropriate rendering for <em>ruʹahh</em> in this case. However, when such “wind,” which is simply air in motion, entered the nostrils of the dead persons of the vision it became “breath,” which is also air in motion. Thus, the rendering of <em>ruʹahh</em> as “breath” at this point of the account (vs. 10) is also more appropriate than “spirit” or “life force.” Ezekiel also would be able to see the bodies begin to breathe, even though he could not see the life force or spirit energizing their bodies.</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="sb">As verses 11-14 show, this vision was symbolic of a spiritual (not physical) revivification of the people of Israel who were for a time in a spiritually dead state due to their Babylonian exile. Since they were already physically alive and breathing, it is logical to render <em>ruʹahh</em> as “spirit” in verse 14, where God states <span id="page1547" class="pageNum" data-no="1547" data-before-text="1547"></span>that he will put ‘his spirit’ in his people so that they would become alive, spiritually speaking.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="sb">A similar symbolic vision is given at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:19" data-bid="161-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 11</a>. The picture is presented of “two witnesses” who are killed and their corpses allowed to lie on the street for three and a half days. Then “spirit [or breath, <em>pneuʹma</em>] of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:11" data-bid="162-1" class="b">Rev. 11:1-11</a>) This vision again draws on a physical reality to illustrate a spiritual revivification. It also shows that the Greek <em>pneuʹma,</em> like the Hebrew <em>ruʹahh,</em> may represent the life-giving force from God that animates the human soul or person. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="163-1" class="b">James 2:26</a> states: “The body without spirit [<em>pneuʹma</em>] is dead.”—<em>Kingdom Interlinear Translatio</em>n.</p>
<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">Therefore, when God created man in Eden and blew into his nostrils the “breath [<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em>] of life” it is evident that simultaneously therewith God caused the life force or spirit (<em>ruʹahh</em>) to vitalize all the cells in Adam’s body.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="164-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:30-19:104:30" data-bid="165-1" class="b">Psalm 104:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:25-44:17:25" data-bid="165-2" class="b"> Acts 17:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="sb">This life force is passed on from parents to offspring through conception. Since Jehovah was the original Source of this life force for man, and the Author of the procreation process, one’s life can properly be attributed to Him, though received not directly but indirectly through one’s parents.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:9-18:10:12" data-bid="166-1" class="b">Job 10:9-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:13-19:139:16" data-bid="166-2" class="b"> Psalm 139:13-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:5-21:11:5" data-bid="166-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="ss"><strong><em>Life force or spirit is impersonal</em></strong></p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">As noted, the Scriptures refer to the <em>ruʹahh</em> or life force as being not only in humans but also in animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:17-1:6:17" data-bid="167-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:15-1:7:15" data-bid="167-2" class="b"> 7:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="167-3" class="b"> 22</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:18-21:3:22" data-bid="168-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:18-22</a> shows that man dies in the same manner as the beasts, for “they all have but one spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>], so that there is no superiority of the man over the beast,” that is, as to the life force common to both. This being so, it is clear that the “spirit” or life force (<em>ruʹahh</em>) as used in this sense is impersonal. As an illustration, one might compare it with another invisible force, electricity, which may be used to make various types of machines operate—causing stoves to produce heat, fans to produce wind, computers to solve problems, television sets to produce figures, voices and other sounds—yet which electric current never takes on any of the characteristics of the machines in which it functions or is active.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="sb">Thus, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="169-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a> says that when man’s “spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>] goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day <em>his thoughts do perish.”</em> The spirit or life force that was active in man’s body cells does not retain any of the characteristics of those cells, such as the brain cells and their part in the thinking process. If the spirit or life force (<em>ruʹahh; pneuʹma</em>) were not impersonal, then it would mean that the children of certain Israelite widows who were resurrected by the prophets Elijah and Elisha were actually in conscious existence somewhere in the period during which they were dead. So, too, with Lazarus, who was resurrected some four days after his death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:17-11:17:23" data-bid="170-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:17-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:32-12:4:37" data-bid="170-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 4:32-37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:38-43:11:44" data-bid="170-3" class="b"> John 11:38-44</a>) If such had been the case, it is reasonable that they would have remembered such conscious existence during that period and upon being resurrected would have described it, told about it. There is nothing to indicate that any of them did so. Hence, the personality of the dead individual is not perpetuated in the life force or spirit that stops functioning in the deceased person’s body cells.</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:7-21:12:7" data-bid="171-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> states that at death the person’s body returns to the dust “and the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it.” The person himself was never in heaven with God; what “returns” to God is therefore the vital force that enabled the person to live.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">In view of the impersonal nature of the life force or spirit found in man (as also in the animal creation) it is evident that David’s statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:5-19:31:5" data-bid="172-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a>, quoted by Jesus at the time of his death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:46-42:23:46" data-bid="173-1" class="b">Luke 23:46</a>), “Into your hand I entrust my spirit,” meant that God was being called upon to guard or care for that one’s life force. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:59-44:7:59" data-bid="174-1" class="b">Acts 7:59</a>.) That there be an actual and literal transmission of some force from this planet to the heavenly presence of God is not necessarily required. Even as the fragrant scent of animal sacrifices were spoken of as being ‘smelled’ by God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:20-1:8:21" data-bid="175-1" class="b">Gen. 8:20, 21</a>), whereas such scent undoubtedly remained within earth’s atmosphere, so, too, God could ‘gather in,’ or could accept as entrusted to him, the spirit or life force in a figurative sense, that is, without any literal transmission of vital force from earth.

<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="sb"><em>Ruʹahh</em> and <em>pneuʹma</em> are both used to designate the force that causes a person to display a certain attitude or emotion or to take a certain action or course. While that force within the person is itself invisible, it produces visible effects. This use of the Hebrew and Greek terms rendered “spirit” and basically related to breath or air in motion is paralleled to a considerable degree by English expressions. Thus, we speak of a person as ‘putting on airs,’ or of manifesting an ‘air of calmness’ or of ‘having a bad spirit.’ We speak of ‘breaking one’s spirit,’ in the sense of discouraging and disheartening him. As applying to a group of persons and the dominant feeling among them we may talk of ‘getting into the spirit of the occasion’ of their being gathered, or refer to the ‘mob spirit’ that infects them. Metaphorically we may refer to an ‘atmosphere of discontent,’ or to ‘winds of change and revolution blowing through a nation.’ By all this we refer to this invisible force, this dominant feeling, working in persons, moving them to speak and act as they do.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Similarly, we read of Isaac and Rebekah’s “bitterness of spirit” resulting from Esau’s marriage to Hittite women (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:34-1:26:35" data-bid="178-1" class="b">Gen. 26:34, 35</a>), and the sadness of spirit that overwhelmed Ahab, robbing him of his appetite. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:5-11:21:5" data-bid="179-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:5</a>) A “spirit of jealousy” could move a man to view his wife with suspicion, even to bring charges against her of adultery.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:5:14-4:5:14" data-bid="180-1" class="b">Num. 5:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:5:30-4:5:30" data-bid="180-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="sb">The basic sense of a force that moves and gives “drive” or “thrust” to one’s actions and speech is also seen in the reference to Joshua as “a man in whom there is spirit” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:18-4:27:18" data-bid="181-1" class="b">Num. 27:18</a>), and to Caleb as demonstrating a “different spirit” from that of the majority of the Israelites who had become demoralized by the bad report of ten spies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:14:24-4:14:24" data-bid="182-1" class="b">Num. 14:24</a>) Elijah was a man of much drive and force in his zealous service to God, and Elisha sought a “two parts” share in Elijah’s spirit as his successor.

<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="ss"><strong><em>Heart and spirit</em></strong></p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">The heart is frequently tied in with the spirit, indicating a definite relationship. Since the heart is shown to have the capacity for motivation due to being intimately related with emotions and affection (see HEART), it undoubtedly has a major share in the development of the spirit that one shows in the sense <span id="page1548" class="pageNum" data-no="1548" data-before-text="1548"></span>of a dominant feeling or activating force. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:21-2:35:21" data-bid="194-1" class="b">Exodus 35:21</a> places heart and spirit in parallel in saying that “everyone whose heart impelled him, . . . everyone whose spirit incited him” brought contributions for the tabernacle construction. Conversely, on learning of Jehovah’s powerful works on behalf of Israel the Canaanites’ ‘hearts began to melt and no spirit arose among them,’ that is, there was no urge or activating force to initiate action against the Israelite forces. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:2:11-6:2:11" data-bid="195-1" class="b">Josh. 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:1-6:5:1" data-bid="195-2" class="b"> 5:1</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:21:7-26:21:7" data-bid="196-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:7</a>.) References are also made to ‘pain of heart and breakdown of spirit’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:14-23:65:14" data-bid="197-1" class="b">Isa. 65:14</a>) or similar expressions. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="198-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:4-19:143:4" data-bid="198-2" class="b"> 143:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:7-19:143:7" data-bid="198-3" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:13-20:15:13" data-bid="198-4" class="b"> Proverbs 15:13</a>.) Evidently because of the forceful effect of the heart on the mind, Paul admonishes: “You should be made new in the force [<em>pneuʹma</em>] actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:24" data-bid="199-1" class="b">Eph. 4:23, 24</a>) The apostle possibly had in mind the earlier exhortations through Ezekiel to “make for yourselves a new heart and a newspirit” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:31-26:18:31" data-bid="200-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:11:19-26:11:20" data-bid="200-2" class="b"> compare 11:19, 20</a>); also David’s humble prayer on recovering from a sinful situation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:10-19:51:12" data-bid="201-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10-12</a>) By purifying their heart it would send forth a different motivation, along with a new spirit.—Contrast <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:30-5:2:30" data-bid="202-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 2:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:20-27:5:20" data-bid="202-2" class="b"> Daniel 5:20</a>.</p>

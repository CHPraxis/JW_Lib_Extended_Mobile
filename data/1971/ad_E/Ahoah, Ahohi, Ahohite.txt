AHOAH, AHOHI, AHOHITE
(A·hoʹah, A·hoʹhi, A·hoʹhite) [brotherly; a brother’s reed].
A descendant of Benjamin through Bela. (1 Chron. 8:1-4) There are some who think he is the same as Ahijah in 1 Chronicles 8:7. Some of his descendants, Ahohites, were prominent fighters in David’s army.—2 Sam. 23:9, 28; 1 Chron. 11:12, 29; 27:4.

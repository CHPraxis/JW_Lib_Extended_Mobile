EBENEZER
(Eb·en·eʹzer) [the stone of help].
1. A site near which Israel was twice defeated by the Philistines, resulting not only in the death of thirty-four thousand Israelites, including Hophni and Phinehas, but also in enemy capture of the ark of the covenant. News of this latter event precipitated the death of Eli the priest. (1 Sam. 4:1-11, 17, 18; 5:1) Bible geographers tentatively place Ebenezer at Majdel Yaba, some two and a half miles (4 kilometers) SE of the suggested site of Ephraimite Aphek (where the Philistines were encamped), and eleven miles (17.7 kilometers) E of modern Tel Aviv.
2. The name given to a stone erected by Samuel more than twenty years after the events mentioned in the preceding texts, likely to commemorate Israel’s victory over the Philistines by God’s help. (1 Sam. 7:2, 12) Although its exact location is today unknown, it was apparently a number of miles SE of No. 1 above, “between Mizpah and Jeshanah.”

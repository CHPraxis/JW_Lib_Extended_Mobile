MAON
(Maʹon) [dwelling].
1. A descendant of Caleb through Shammai. Maon may have been the father of Beth-zur’s inhabitants or the principal man or founder of that city.—1 Chron. 2:42, 45.
2. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Josh. 15:20, 48, 55) Israel’s King Saul pursued David and his men into the wilderness area surrounding Maon. But news of a Philistine raid forced Saul to abandon the chase. (1 Sam. 23:24-28) Later, David’s men were treated inhospitably by Nabal, a rich landowner apparently residing at Maon. (1 Sam. 25:2-11) This city is identified with Tell Maʽin atop a high hill about eight and a half miles (14 kilometers) S of Hebron.

SPEARMEN
These soldiers anciently comprised a section of the light infantry, and were backed up by archers and slingers. Charioteers and cavalrymen often carried spears. Spearmen were a part of the Roman occupational forces in Palestine, two hundred of whom were included in secretly escorting Paul out of Jerusalem.â€”Acts 23:23; see ARMS, ARMOR, pages 128, 129.

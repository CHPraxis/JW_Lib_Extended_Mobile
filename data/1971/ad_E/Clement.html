<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Clemʹent) [mild, merciful].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A faithful Christian who fought side by side with the apostle Paul, presumably at Philippi, for the sake of the “good news.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:3-50:4:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 4:3</a>) The name “Clement” was quite common and therefore provides no valid basis for connecting him with Clement of Rome, as is done by Origen.</p>

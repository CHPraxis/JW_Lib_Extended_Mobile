(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:3-6:10:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 10:3-5</a>) Gibeon’s call for help brought Joshua’s forces on a rescue mission from Gilgal. During the ensuing battle the Israelites trapped Japhia and his allied kings in a cave at Makkedah. Later he and the others were executed and their dead bodies hung on stakes until sunset, after which they were thrown into the cave where they had sought refuge.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:10:6-6:10:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 10:6-27</a>.</p>

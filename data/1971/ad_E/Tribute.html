<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Generally, money or other valuable consideration, such as livestock, paid by a state or ruler to a foreign power in acknowledgment of submission, or to maintain peace or to gain protection. Nations exacting tribute from other peoples frequently received gold and silver or products that were in short supply in their own land. In this way they strengthened their economic position while keeping the subjugated nations weak by drawing heavily on their resources.</p>

However, on account of unfaithfulness, the Israelites were often in an inferior position and were forced to pay tribute to others. As early as the time of the Judges, while under the domination of Moabite King Eglon, they paid tribute.

TABERAH
(Tabʹe·rah) [burning, conflagration, blaze].
An Israelite encampment in the wilderness of Sinai, the precise location of which is uncertain. On account of Israel’s complaining there, God sent a fire that consumed some of the people at the extremity of the camp. But, when Moses supplicated Jehovah, the “sank down” or was extinguished. This incident gave rise to the name “Taberah,” meaning “burning, conflagration, blaze.”—Num. 11:1-3; Deut. 9:22.

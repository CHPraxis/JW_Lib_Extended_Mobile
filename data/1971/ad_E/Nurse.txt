NURSE
Two kinds of nurses were employed in ancient times. The “nursing woman” (Heb., meh·neʹqeth; Gen. 24:59; 35:8; Ex. 2:7; 2 Ki. 11:2; 2 Chron. 22:11; Isa. 49:23) served as a mother’s substitute for breastfeeding an infant. Deborah was such a nurse to Rebekah but later served as her maid or caretaker, continuing as a family servant even after her mistress’ death. (Gen. 24:59, 67; 35:8) The other type nurse could be a male (Heb., ʼo·menʹ; Num. 11:12; Isa. 49:23 [“caretakers”]) or a female (Heb., ʼo·meʹneth; 2 Sam. 4:4). A person of either sex might care for children, the sick or older persons. The role of a nurse or caretaker was filled by aged Naomi toward her grandson Obed and by the beautiful virgin Abishag in connection with King David.—Ruth 4:13, 16, 17; 1 Ki. 1:1-4.

PALTIEL
(Palʹti·el) [deliverance of God].
1. Representative of Issachar at the time the tribes divided the Promised Land into inheritance portions; son of Azzan.—Num. 34:17, 18, 26.
2. Son of Laish from Gallim. Saul, after outlawing David, took his daughter Michal, David’s wife, and gave her in marriage to Palti (Paltiel). (1 Sam. 25:44) After becoming king, David demanded of Abner and Ish-bosheth that Michal be returned to him. This greatly grieved Paltiel, who followed her, weeping, until Abner ordered him to go home.—2 Sam. 3:13-16.

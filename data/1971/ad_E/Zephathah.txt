ZEPHATHAH
(Zephʹa·thah) [watchtower].
A valley near Mareshah where Jehovah enabled the forces of Judah’s King Asa to defeat those of Zerah the Ethiopian (967-966 B.C.E.). (2 Chron. 14:9-12) Zephathah is apparently represented by the modern Wadi Zeita, which, at one point, comes to within about a mile (c. 1.6 kilometers) N of the suggested site of Mareshah. The Greek Septuagint Version has been translated to read “in the valley north of Maresa” (Bagster), but “Zephathah” appears in the Hebrew Masoretic text.

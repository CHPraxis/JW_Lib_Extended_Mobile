A place mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:5-38:14:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zechariah 14:5</a> as the point to which the valley would reach as a result of the prophesied cleavage of the Mount of Olives. It must, therefore, refer to a site near Jerusalem and there may be an echoing of the name in that of the Wadi Yasul, which is an afflux to the Kidron valley from the Mount of Olives.</p>

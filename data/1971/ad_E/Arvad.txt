ARVAD
(Arʹvad) [perhaps, wandering].
In Ezekiel’s prophetic dirge concerning Tyre reference is made to men from Arvad who served as skilled rowers in Tyre’s navy and as valorous warriors in her army. (Ezek. 27:8, 11) Arvad is identified with the small rocky island today known as Ruad, lying about two miles (3.2 kilometers) off the coast of northern Syria (Phoenicia), some 125 miles (201 kilometers) N of Tyre. The inhabitants were descendants of Canaan.—Gen. 10:15, 18.

AMETHYST
(amʹe·thyst).
A semiprecious variety of crystallized quartz, purple or violet in color and used for jewelry. It occurs in the form of hexagonal crystals, and the color is attributed to traces of manganese or iron. One type of amethyst is the quartz variety (Occidental), whereas precious amethyst (Oriental) is a variety of corundum or sapphire. The name “amethyst” is taken from the Greek word a·meʹthy·stos, meaning “not to intoxicate.”
Israel’s high priest wore an amethyst stone in the third position of the third row of stones on his embroidered “breastpiece of judgment.” (Ex. 28:2, 15, 19, 21; 39:12) In his vision of “New Jerusalem,” John observed that the twelfth foundation of the holy city’s wall was amethyst.—Rev. 21:2, 10, 19, 20.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The plant that played such an important role in David’s encounter with the Philistines “in the low plain of Rephaim.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:22-10:5:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:22-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:14:13-13:14:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 14:13-16</a>) The only other reference to the plant is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:6-19:84:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 84:6</a>: “Passing along through the low plain of the baca bushes, they turn it into a spring itself.” This may refer to the same “low plain of Rephaim” where David’s fight took place and which plain is believed to be SW of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew word used comes from a root meaning “to weep” or “to drip.” It therefore seems to indicate a plant, shrub or tree that exudes tears of gum or perhaps a milky sap. Its identification is uncertain. There is no apparent foundation for the Rabbinical view that relates it to the mulberry tree (as also translated in <em>AV</em>). Since balsam trees (of which there are several in the different tree families) exude gum or resin, these have been suggested by many scholars. A balsam tree of the poplar family (<em>Populus euphratica</em>) is recommended by some botanists, due primarily to the ease with which its leaves are stirred by any breeze, producing a rustling sound. However, the Bible does not specify how the “sound of a marching” was produced (whether by means of the leaves, the branches, or by some other part of the plant such as pods or nettles), and simply indicates that it occurred in the “tops” of the plants. It could have been a mere rustling sound that served as a signal, or, as suggested by some, it may have been a noise of some volume produced by a rushing wind that served to cover up or even to simulate the sound of a marching army.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In view of the variant opinions and lack of clear evidence as to the identity of the plant, it would seem well simply to transliterate this Hebrew word, as is done in the <em>New World Translation,</em> here used.</p>

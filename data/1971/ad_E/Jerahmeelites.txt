JERAHMEELITES
(Je·rahʹme·el·ites).
The descendants of Judah through Jerahmeel son of Hezron. (1 Chron. 2:4, 9, 25-27, 33, 42) The Jerahmeelites lived in the southern part of Judah, apparently in the same general region as the Amalekites, Geshurites and Girzites whom David raided while residing among the Philistines as a fugitive from King Saul. When returning from such raids David would ambiguously report that these raids had been made “upon the south of Judah and upon the south of the Jerahmeelites and upon the south of the Kenites.” Philistine King Achish, therefore, assumed that David had raided Israelites, thus making himself a stench to his countrymen and enhancing his value to Achish. (1 Sam. 27:7-12) In reality, David later shared spoils of war with the older men “in the cities of the Jerahmeelites.”—1 Sam. 30:26, 29.

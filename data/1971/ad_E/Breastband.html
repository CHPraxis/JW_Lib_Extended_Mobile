<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A sash or girdle worn by a bride on her wedding day. It marked her status as a married woman. Jehovah as a “husband” to Israel illustrates the sin and extreme disregard of Israel toward him, saying: “Can a virgin forget her ornaments, a bride her breastbands? And yet my own people—they have forgotten me days without number.” Israel’s God should have been her greatest ornament, but she had forsaken him for other gods.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:2:32-24:2:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 2:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:3:20-23:3:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 3:20</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:18-23:49:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Glede [Heb., <em>day·yahʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew name for this bird occurs in the list of unclean birds at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:13-5:14:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:13</a>, but does not appear in the corresponding list at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:14-3:11:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:14</a>. Five Hebrew manuscripts, and also the <em>Samaritan Pentateuch</em> and the <em>Septuagint Version,</em> omit <em>day·yahʹ</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:13-5:14:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 14:13</a>. Some scholars believe that it may be a scribal correction originally placed in the margin but which eventually was introduced into the text itself. However, the plural form (<em>dhay·yohth</em>ʹ) appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:15-23:34:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 34:15</a> as describing birds gathered at the ruins of Edom following its desolation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is suggested that the Hebrew name of this bird is derived from the verb meaning “to fly swiftly.” The identification of the bird meant is quite uncertain; hence, the English name “glede” is probably as suitable a translation as any, since “glede” in English is a name variously applied to any of several birds of prey, though especially to the common European kite. Most modern authorities relate the Hebrew <em>dhay·yohthʹ</em> to the kite, there being more than one variety of this bird found in Palestine.—See KITE.</p>

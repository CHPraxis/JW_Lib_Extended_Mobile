<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Be·e·liʹa·da) [Baal (that is, Master or Owner) knows].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A son of David born after his coming to Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:14:3-13:14:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 14:3-7</a>) Without the first two letters of <em>Be</em>eliada, the contracted form Eliada (“God knows”) occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:16-10:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 5:16 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:3:8-13:3:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 3:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This difference in the spelling of the name has been the subject of much discussion. Some say that “Eliada” was probably the original form, that it is improbable David named a son after the pagan god Baal, and note that “Beeliada” appears only in the most recent of the three listings of David’s sons, and that in this verse (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:14:7-13:14:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 14:7</a>) the <em>Septuagint</em> reads <em>E·li·a·de</em>ʹ and the Syriac <em>Peshitta</em> (Lamsa’s) says “Eliada.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the other hand, there are those who take the position that the literal meaning of <em>baʹʽal</em> is not offensive, that it simply means “master” or “owner,” and that in this good sense David himself used the name, for example, when he called the place of battle “Baal-perazim.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:20-10:5:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:20</a>) Possibly, they say, David named this son in commemoration of the great victory Jehovah gave him at that place. There are several manuscripts that confirm “Beeliada” in the Masoretic text. The <em>Codex Alexandrinus</em> of the fifth century, which reads <em>Bal·li·a·daʹ,</em> the <em>Friderico-Augustanus</em> of the fourth century, where <em>Ba·leg·da·eʹ</em> is given, and the <em>Vulgate,</em> which reads <em>Baaliada,</em> all support the Masoretic. Those who say the name originally was “Beeliada” account for the shortened form “Eliada” as a later scribal change made out of deference to David at a time when <em>baʹʽal</em> had taken on an odious meaning. This, however, may be just another example where the Hebrews shortened a <span id="page206" class="pageNum" data-no="206" data-before-text="206"></span>name simply for brevity’s sake, a common practice even today the world over.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Syʹchar).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city of Samaria and the site of Jacob’s fountain. It was “near the field that Jacob gave to Joseph his son” in the vicinity of Shechem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:5-43:4:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:5, 6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:32-6:24:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 24:32</a>.) The Syriac Sinaitic codex has “Shechem” instead of “Sychar.” However, the best Greek manuscripts support the reading “Sychar.” Certain early non-Biblical writers distinguish between Shechem and Sychar; others do not. Some today who separate the two identify Sychar with the village of ʽAskar, about one-half mile (c. 1 kilometer) N of Jacob’s fountain and about the same distance NE of the apparent location of ancient Shechem.</p>

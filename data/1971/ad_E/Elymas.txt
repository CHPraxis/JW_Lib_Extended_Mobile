ELYMAS
(Elʹy·mas) [wise].
The professional name or title of “a certain man, a sorcerer, a false prophet,” named Bar-Jesus, a Jew who lived on the island of Cyprus in the first century C.E. (Acts 13:6-8) “Elymas” was not the Greek equivalent of his Hebrew name “Bar-Jesus,” but was, rather, a transliteration of an Arabic word, ‘alim, meaning “magi,” “sorcerer.” It was a title originally given to Persian priests of Babylonish sorcery. So when Luke says “sorcerer . . . is the way his name is translated,” the reference is to the assumed name “Elymas,” not “Bar-Jesus.” It was not uncommon for Jews of the time to indulge in magical arts and sorcery, nor, when living in Greek society, to assume a Greek name.—Acts 8:9-11; 19:17-19; see BAR-JESUS.

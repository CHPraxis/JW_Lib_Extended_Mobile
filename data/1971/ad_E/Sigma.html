<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SIGMA [C, Σ, σ, ς]. The eighteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, from which the English “s” originates. In the later cursive writing, when a word ends with <em>sigʹma,</em> its normal minuscular sign (σ) is not used, but ς is used in its place. However, when, as in the more ancient manuscripts, a word is in all capitals, the same letter (C or Σ) is used in all cases.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Sigʹma</em> is derived from the Hebrew <em>sin</em>. As a number, accented sigma (σ΄) equals 200, and, with the subscript (,‏σ), 200,000. The final form of the letter when accented (ς΄) denotes six, as in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:18-66:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 13:18</a>.</p>

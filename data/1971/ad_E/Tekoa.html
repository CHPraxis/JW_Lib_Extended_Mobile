<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Te·koʹa).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in the territory of Judah that is commonly identified with Khirbet Taquʽa, some ten miles (16 kilometers) S of Jerusalem and lying at an elevation of about 2,700 feet (c. 820 meters). To the E stretches the wilderness of Judah, of which the “wilderness of Tekoa” (where the Ammonites, Moabites and the forces from Mount Seir suffered a crushing defeat during Jehoshaphat’s reign) was apparently a part. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:20-14:20:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:24-14:20:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24</a>) King Rehoboam, David’s grandson, rebuilt and fortified Tekoa, and for centuries thereafter the city evidently served as an outpost in the Judean defense system. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:5-14:11:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:5, 6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:1-24:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 6:1</a>.) It was the home of Ikkesh, the father of one of David’s mighty men, Ira. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:26-13:11:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 11:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:28-13:11:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 28</a>) From there came the wise woman who, at the direction of Joab, appealed to King David in behalf of Absalom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:1-10:14:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 14:1-21</a>) And there, in the ninth century B.C.E., the prophet Amos raised sheep.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:1:1-30:1:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Amos 1:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Tekoa mentioned in the Judean genealogical records (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:3-13:2:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:24-13:2:24" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:5-13:4:5" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 4:5</a>) may have been a son of Asshur. However, Tekoa is not listed in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:5-13:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 4:5-7</a> among the seven sons of Asshur’s two wives, suggesting that Asshur, rather than being the father of a son named Tekoa, may have been the founder of the town or of its population.</p>

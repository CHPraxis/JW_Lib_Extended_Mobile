HENADAD
(Henʹa·dad).
A Levite whose descendants apparently served as supervisors in connection with the rebuilding of the temple by Zerubbabel. (Ezra 3:8, 9) Two of Henadad’s descendants are specifically referred to as sharing in the repair of Jerusalem’s wall, and one of his descendants attested by seal the confession contract made during Nehemiah’s governorship.—Neh. 3:17, 18, 24; 9:38; 10:1, 9.

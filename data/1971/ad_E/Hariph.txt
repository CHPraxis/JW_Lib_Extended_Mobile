HARIPH
(Haʹriph) [sharp, or, autumn].
Head of a family of which 112 males returned from Babylonian exile in 537 B.C.E.; also called Jorah. (Neh. 7:6, 7, 24; Ezra 2:18) The name Hariph is again listed among the heads of the people, evidently being represented by a descendant, who attested by seal the confession contract made during Nehemiah’s governorship.—Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 14, 19.

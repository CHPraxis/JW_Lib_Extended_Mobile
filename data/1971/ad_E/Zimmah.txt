ZIMMAH
(Zimʹmah) [loose conduct].
A Gershonite Levite. (1 Chron. 6:20) He is possibly the same Zimmah who is mentioned in verse 42. If this genealogy skips many names (as these lists commonly do), he may also be the one referred to at 2 Chronicles 29:12, whose descendant Joah helped to cleanse the temple in Hezekiah’s day.

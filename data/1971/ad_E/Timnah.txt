TIMNAH
(Timʹnah) [assigned portion].
1. A location at the boundary of Judah and Dan. (Josh. 15:1, 10; 19:40-43) Today it is often identified with a place preserving some similarity to the ancient name, Khirbet Tibnah, about two miles (c. 3 kilometers) W of the suggested site of Beth-shemesh.
Samson selected a Philistine woman of Timnah for marriage when “looking for an opportunity against the Philistines,” who then ruled over Israel. En route to the city, he killed a lion bare-handed at the vineyards of Timnah. (Judg. 14:1-6) In the time of King Ahaz, the Philistines captured Timnah and its dependent towns.—2 Chron. 28:16-19.
2. A city in the mountainous region of Judah. Scholars identify this Timnah with modern Tibnah, about two miles (c. 3 kilometers) N-NW of the possible site of Gibean (el-Jeba’). (Josh. 15:20, 48, 57) Apparently, near this Timnah Judah planned to shear his sheep, and at Enaim (which was on the road to Timnah) he had relations with Tamar, mistaking her for a harlot.—Gen. 38:12-18.

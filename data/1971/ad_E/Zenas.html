<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An acquaintance of Paul, concerning whom Titus was told: “Carefully <span id="page1688" class="pageNum" data-no="1688" data-before-text="1688"></span>supply Zenas . . . and Apollos for their trip.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:13-56:3:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 3:13</a>) At the time Zenas was evidently on the island of Crete, but where he and Apollos were going, whether to Nicopolis, where Paul hoped to meet Titus (vs. 12), or to some other place, is not stated. Paul says that Zenas was “versed in the [Mosaic] Law,” which may mean that he was either a Jew or a Jewish proselyte who had been converted to Christianity. His Greek name might favor the latter conclusion, but this is by no means decisive, since in the first century C.E., it was not uncommon for Jews to have Greek names. Other such examples include Justus, Dorcas and Mark.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:23-44:1:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 1:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:25-44:12:25" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 12:25</a>.</p>

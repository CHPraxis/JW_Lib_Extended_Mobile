URIEL
(U·riʹel) [flame of God or my light is God].
1. A Levite descendant of Kohath; son of Tahath.—1 Chron. 6:22, 24.
2. Chief of the Kohathites at the time David had the ark of the covenant brought to Jerusalem.—1 Chron. 15:5, 11, 12, 15.
3. Father of Micaiah (Maacah), who was the wife of King Rehoboam and mother of Abijah. (2 Chron. 13:1, 2; 11:21) Maacah was Absalom’s granddaughter. Since Absalom’s three sons apparently died young and childless (2 Sam. 14:27; 18:18), Micaiah must have been the child of Absalom’s daughter Tamar, and Uriel not the son but the son-in-law of Absalom.

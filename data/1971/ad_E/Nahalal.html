<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Na·halʹal) [perhaps, drinking place for flocks].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in Zebulun assigned to the Merarite Levites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:10-6:19:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:14-6:19:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:34-6:21:35" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 21:34, 35</a>) It was also called Nahalol. Rather than driving out the Canaanites inhabiting this city as divinely instructed, the Zebulunites subjected them to forced labor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:30-7:1:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 1:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:2-7:2:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:2</a>) It has been suggested that the site of Nahalal was perhaps at Tell el-Beida, about three miles (5 kilometers) to the SW of Maʽlul.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Amʹra·phel) [powerful people].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">King of Shinar in southern Mesopotamia, and an ally and supporter of King Chedorlaomer of Elam in the invasion and victory over the five kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and other cities of the Low Plain of Siddim. Amraphel and his allies were later overtaken by Abram, in his rescue of Lot, and completely routed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:1-1:14:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 14:1-16</a>) There have been attempts to identify Amraphel with Hammurabi, but the evidence is not strong.</p>

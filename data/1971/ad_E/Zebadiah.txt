ZEBADIAH
(Zeb·a·diʹah) [Jehovah has given].
1. A Benjamite, son or descendant of Beriah.—1 Chron. 8:1, 15, 16.
2. A Benjamite, son or descendant of Elpaal.—1 Chron. 8:1, 17, 18.

4. Joab’s nephew and chief of the fourth monthly rotational army division. His being ‘after his father Asahel,’ may indicate that he succeeded to the post after Asahel was put to death. (2 Sam. 2:23) Or if these monthly courses were organized after Asahel’s death, then it could mean that Zebadiah was put over a division named after Asahel.—1 Chron. 27:1, 7; see ASAHEL No. 1.
5. A gatekeeper involved in David’s organization of the Levitical services; son of Meshelemiah, a Korahite.—1 Chron. 26:1, 2.
6. One of the Levites whom Jehoshaphat in his third year, 934 B.C.E., dispatched to teach Jehovah’s law in the cities of Judah.—2 Chron. 17:7-9.
7. A leader of the house of Judah, son of Ishmael, among those whom King Jehoshaphat appointed over legal cases.—2 Chron. 19:8-11.
8. Head of the paternal house of Shephatiah. Zebadiah, son of Michael, led eighty males of his paternal house back to Jerusalem with Ezra in 468 B.C.E.—Ezra 8:1, 8.
9. One of the priests of the house of Immer who was among those encouraged by Ezra to dissolve their foreign marriage alliances.—Ezra 10:19, 20.

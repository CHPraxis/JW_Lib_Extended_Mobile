<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This translates the expression “Jehovah-shamʹmah,” applied to the city seen by the prophet Ezekiel in his vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:48:35-26:48:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 48:35</a>) The visionary city is depicted as foursquare (four thousand five hundred cubits to a side [6,562.5 feet (c. 2,000 meters)]) and as having twelve gates, each bearing the name of one of the tribes of Israel. (48:15, 16, 31-34) To an extent it is similar to the holy city New Jerusalem as seen in vision by the apostle John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:10-66:21:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10-16</a>) The visionary city of Ezekiel’s prophecy is to belong to “all the house of Israel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:6-26:45:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 45:6</a>) The name “Jehovah-shamʹmah,” or “Jehovah Himself Is There,” would signify a representational presence of God like that expressed in other texts, such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:5-19:46:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 46:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:132:13-19:132:14" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 132:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:24:23-23:24:23" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Isaiah 24:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:3:21-29:3:21" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Joel 3:21 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:10-38:2:11" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Zechariah 2:10, 11</a>, where Jehovah, whom the ‘heaven of the heavens cannot contain,’ is spoken of as though residing in an earthly city or place.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:27-11:8:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:27</a>.</p>

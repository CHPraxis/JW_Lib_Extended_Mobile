<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The word “asps” appears once in the Holy Bible, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:13-45:3:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 3:13</a>, where the apostle Paul, speaking of sinners, says: “Poison of asps is behind their lips.” Here the apostle is quoting from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:140:3-19:140:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 140:3</a>: “The venom of the horned viper is under their lips.” Concerning the “asp” of ancient times, Webster’s <em>Third New International Dictionary</em> (1961 ed.) says, “Variously identified as the horned viper or a small African cobra.”—See COBRA; VIPER.</p>

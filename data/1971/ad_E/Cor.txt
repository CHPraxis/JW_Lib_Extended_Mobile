COR
A dry measure and also one used for measuring oil. The cor corresponded to the homer and contained ten bath measures. (1 Ki. 4:22; 5:11; 2 Chron. 2:10; Ezek. 45:14) If the bath measure is to be reckoned at 5.81 gallons (22 liters), as favored by archaeological evidence, the cor measure would equal 58.1 gallons (220 liters).

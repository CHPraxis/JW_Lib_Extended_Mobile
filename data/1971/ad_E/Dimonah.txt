DIMONAH
(Di·moʹnah).
A southern city of Judah near the border of Edom. (Josh. 15:21, 22) It is suggested by some to be the same as “Dibon” mentioned at Nehemiah 11:25, and while its exact location remains uncertain, some geographers would identify it with el-Qebab between Beer-sheba and the Dead Sea.

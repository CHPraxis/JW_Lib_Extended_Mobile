<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although the literal meaning of this musical term is “the eighth,” its exact significance is uncertain. It may refer to a particular musical register, or mode, a lower one, and if any musical instruments were associated with the term, they would probably be those used to play the bass tones of the musical scale.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:15:21-13:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>, harps are spoken of as being “tuned to Sheminith [‘possibly referring to the eighth key or to the octave, a lower octave,’ ftn. c, <em>NW,</em> 1955 ed.; ‘probably the bass octave,’ ftn. z, <em>Da</em>].” Consistently, the superscriptions of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:6:0-19:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalms 6 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:12:0-19:12:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12</a> (both psalms being of somber character) read: “To the director (on stringed instruments) on the lower octave [<em>sh<sup>e</sup>mi·nithʹ</em>],” which may indicate that these songs would be accompanied by music in a lower range and sung accordingly.</p>

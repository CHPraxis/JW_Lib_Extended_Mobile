SHALISHAH
(Shalʹi·shah) [a third part].
A “land” or district Saul journeyed through while searching for his father’s she-asses (1 Sam. 9:3, 4), likely the area in which Baal-shalishah was located. (2 Ki. 4:42) This latter site is identified with Kefr Thilth, about thirteen and a half miles (22 kilometers) NW of Gilgal.—See BAAL-SHALISHAH.

ONYCHA
(onʹy·cha) [nail, claw, husk, flap, or that which hangs loose (down)].
An ingredient of the incense designated exclusively for sanctuary use. (Ex. 30:34-37) Some believe that onycha may have been derived from the closing valves of certain shellfish. However, since this ingredient was used for a sacred purpose, others consider it to have been a vegetable product instead of something obtained from an unclean animal.

ASHBEL, ASHBELITES
(Ashʹbel, Ashʹbel·ites) [perhaps, a secondary form of Ishbaal, man of the Lord].
Son of Benjamin, listed third at Genesis 46:21, but second at 1 Chronicles 8:1. In 1728 B.C.E. he came into Egypt with Jacob’s family. He appears to be called Jediael at 1 Chronicles 7:6, 10. The Ashbelites, his descendants, were registered in the census taken on the desert plains of Moab about 1473 B.C.E.—Num. 26:38.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In using this expression, the Bible does not indicate that it had more than the usual connotation of one who is friendly or a companion. Neither does it directly describe the specific functions of the friend of the king as an official title. However, based on the customs of other lands, it may be that the expression designated a court official who was a confidant, a personal friend and companion to a king and who at times executed confidential orders.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:26:26-1:26:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 26:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among Solomon’s court dignitaries, listed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:1-11:4:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:1-6</a>, are two sons of Nathan. One is mentioned as being “over the deputies,” whereas the other, Zabud, is called “the friend of the king.” In the reign of Solomon’s father, King David, Hushai the Archite is spoken of as having this relationship to King David, being called “David’s companion.” At David’s request Hushai returned to Jerusalem to frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel when Absalom conspired to usurp the throne.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:32-10:15:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:32-37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:16-10:16:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:16-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among the old Egyptian kings there were several ranks of king’s “friends.” The title did not indicate anything exclusive but was merely an honorary designation for officials whose real duties were indicated by other titles. ‘Friends to the king’ were also frequently mentioned in connection with the Grecian Empire. There a definite body of these friends was formed with whom the king conferred before making decisions on important matters. The office existed in Persia, Arabia and Ethiopia.</p>

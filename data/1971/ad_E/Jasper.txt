JASPER
A jasper stone representing one of Israel’s twelve tribes was placed in the last position in the second row of stones on Aaron’s “breastpiece of judgment.” (Ex. 28:2, 15, 18, 21; 39:11) The jeweled “covering” worn by the king of Tyre was adorned with jasper. (Ezek. 28:12, 13) In the vision of Jehovah’s heavenly throne of splendor, John observed that “the one seated is, in appearance, like a jasper stone and a precious red-colored stone.” (Rev. 4:1-3, 10, 11) “The holy city, New Jerusalem” is described as having a radiance “like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone shining crystal-clear.” The structure of the holy city’s wall was jasper, as was the first foundation stone.—Rev. 21:2, 10, 11, 18, 19.
Modern jasper is an opaque variety of quartz containing an admixture of iron oxide. Its colors, often arranged in layers, are white, red, yellow, brown or black. Jasper is harder than glass and is found in metamorphic rocks in mass or as distinct crystals. The best grades are used for gemstones and can be highly polished. Some scholars, however, believe that the jasper referred to in the Christian Greek Scriptures was not the modern jasper. Since the jasper at Revelation 21:11 is called a “most precious stone . . . shining crystal-clear,” the ancient stone may have been of greater rarity and value than the comparatively inexpensive modern jasper, and brilliantly translucent rather than opaque. Some scholars have suggested that the Greek term in reality refers to the diamond.

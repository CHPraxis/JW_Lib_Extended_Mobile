HRO
or, as commonly anglicized, rho [Ρ, ρ]. The seventeenth letter of the Greek alphabet, from which the English “r” is derived. The liquid hro is virtually identical in sound with the English “r,” an initial hro, however, having a hard breathing and being pronounced like hr.
The numerical symbol for 100 in Greek is accented (ρ΄), and for 100,000, hro with the subscript (,ρ).

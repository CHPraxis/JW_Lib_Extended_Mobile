ESHCOL
(Eshʹcol) [cluster].
1. A brother of Aner and Mamre the Amorite. (Gen. 14:13) Eshcol and his brothers were confederates of Abraham in defeating a league of Eastern kings.—Gen. 14:14, 24; see ANER No. 1.
2. A wadi or torrent valley, probably located a short distance N of Hebron. It was from this valley that the Israelite spies carried off a large cluster of grapes, and the vineyards in this area are still noted for the high quality of their grapes. (Num. 13:23, 24; 32:9; Deut. 1:24) The name possibly resulted from this event during the spying trip.

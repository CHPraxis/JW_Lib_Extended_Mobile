MOST HIGH
The Hebrew word ʽel·yohnʹ (Most High), used with reference to Jehovah, is also applied to other persons or things: King David, as above the other earthly kings (Ps. 89:20, 27), the place above the nations promised to Israel (Deut. 26:18, 19), the topmost basket (Gen. 40:17), the upper gate (2 Ki. 15:35), the upper pool (2 Ki. 18:17), the upper courtyard (Jer. 36:10), the uppermost story (Ezek. 41:7), the uppermost dining rooms (Ezek. 42:5), Upper Beth-horon (Josh. 16:5) and the upper source of the waters of Gihon. (2 Chron. 32:30) These uses illustrate that ʽel·yohnʹ denotes position rather than power.
When applied to Jehovah, “Most High” emphasizes his supreme position above all others. (Ps. 83:18) The title first appears at Genesis 14:18-20 with ʼEl (God), where Melchizedek is called “priest of the Most High God” and, in that capacity, blesses Abraham as well as the Most High God. “Most High” is used in combination with the divine name Jehovah (Gen. 14:22; Ps. 7:17) and the plural of excellence ʼElo·himʹ (God) (Ps. 78:56), and also appears alone.—Deut. 32:8; Ps. 9:2; Isa. 14:14.
The plural Aramaic form ʽel·yoh·ninʹ occurs at Daniel 7:18, 22, 25, 27, where it may be translated “Supreme One” (NW), the plural being the plural of excellence, majesty. The Aramaic form in the singular number, ʽil·layʹ (Most High) is used at Daniel 7:25.
The Greek word hyʹpsi·stos (Most High), as applying to Jehovah, is employed mainly by Luke, in his Gospel (twice in Gabriel’s announcement to Mary about the birth of Jesus) and in the Acts. (Luke 1:32, 35, 76; 6:35; 8:28; Acts 7:48; 16:17) The other occurrences are at Mark 5:7 and Hebrews 7:1.

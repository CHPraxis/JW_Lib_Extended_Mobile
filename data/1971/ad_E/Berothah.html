<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Ezekiel’s vision concerning the territorial inheritance of Israel Berothah is listed as on the northern boundary in the area between Hamath and Damascus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:16-26:47:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:16</a>) It appears to be the same as Berothai of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:8-10:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:8</a>, a city belonging to Hadadezer king of Zobah, from which David carried away “copper in very great quantity.” In the parallel record at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:8-13:18:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 18:8</a> the name Cun appears in its place. Berothah (or Berothai) is generally identified with modern Bereitan, about seven miles (11 kilometers) S of Baalbek in the valley known as the Beqa, lying between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains.—See CUN.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of the second son borne by Hosea’s wife Gomer. Jehovah commanded that the child be given this meaningful name to show that He had disowned faithless Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:8-28:1:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hos. 1:8, 9</a>) It has been suggested that this boy was not Hosea’s offspring but a child of Gomer’s adultery (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hos. 1:2</a>), for when Jezreel was born, it was said that Gomer “bore to <em>him</em> [Hosea] a son,” whereas regarding Lo-ammi it is merely said that “she proceeded to become pregnant and give birth to a son.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:3-28:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hos. 1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:8-28:1:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>

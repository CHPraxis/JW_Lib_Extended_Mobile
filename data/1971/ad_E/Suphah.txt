SUPHAH
(Suʹphah) [stormwind].
As ordinarily rendered, a region or valley, probably in the vinicity of the Arnon River. (Num. 21:14) This Hebrew word has been translated by such terms as “hurricane” (Ro) and “storm” (AS ftn.). However, most modern translations indicate that it was a region or valley, saying that Vaheb was located “by Suphah” (JB) or “in Suphah.”—AT, JP, NW, RS.

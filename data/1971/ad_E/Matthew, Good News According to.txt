MATTHEW, GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO
The inspired account of the life of Jesus Christ written, doubtless in Palestine, by the onetime tax collector Matthew or Levi. It is the first book in the Christian Greek Scriptures and has since ancient times been viewed as the first Gospel. Matthew’s account commences with the birth of Jesus and concludes with Christ’s post-resurrection commissioning of his followers to go and “make disciples of people of all the nations.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Hence, it covers the time between Jesus’ birth in 2 B.C.E. and his meeting with his disciples just before his ascension in 33 C.E.
TIME OF WRITING
Subscriptions, appearing at the end of Matthew’s Gospel in numerous manuscripts (all being later than the tenth century C.E.), say that the account was written about the eighth year after Christ’s ascension (c. 41 C.E.). This would not be at variance with internal evidence. The fact that no reference is made to the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy respecting Jerusalem’s destruction would point to a time of composition prior to 70 C.E. (Matt. 5:35; 24:16) And the expression “to this very day” (Matt. 27:8; 28:15) indicates a lapse of some time between the events considered and the time of writing.
ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN HEBREW
External evidence to the effect that Matthew originally wrote this Gospel in Hebrew reaches as far back as Papias of Hierapolis, who was at least nearly contemporaneous with the apostles. Papias may have been taught by the apostle John, for (according to Eusebius) Irenaeus identified him as “John’s hearer and the associate of Polycarp.” Eusebius quoted Papias as stating: “Matthew composed his history in the Hebrew dialect.” (The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, Book III, chap. 39) Early in the third century, Origen made reference to Matthew’s account and, in discussing the Gospels, is quoted by Eusebius as saying: “The first is written according to Matthew, the same that was once a publican, but afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, who having published it for the Jewish converts, wrote it in the Hebrew.” (The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, Book VI, chap. 25) The scholar Jerome (of the fourth and fifth centuries C.E.) wrote in his Catalogue of Ecclesiastical Writers that Matthew “composed a Gospel of Christ in Judaea in the Hebrew language and characters, for the benefit of those of the circumcision who had believed. . . . Furthermore, the Hebrew itself is preserved to this day in the library at Caesarea which the martyr Pamphilus so diligently collected.”
It has been suggested that Matthew, after compiling his account in Hebrew, may have personally translated it into koi·neʹ Greek.
INFORMATION UNIQUE TO MATTHEW’S GOSPEL
An examination of Matthew’s account shows that more than 40 percent of the material contained therein is not found in the other three Gospels. Unique is Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus (1:1-16), which takes an approach different from that set out by Luke (3:23-38). A comparison of the two indicates that Matthew gave the legal genealogy through Jesus’ foster-father Joseph, while Luke apparently gave Jesus’ natural genealogy. Other incidents mentioned only in Matthew’s account are: Joseph’s reaction to Mary’s pregnancy; the appearance of an angel to Joseph in a dream (1:18-25); the visit of the astrologers; the flight to Egypt; the slaughter of the young boys in Bethlehem and its districts (chap. 2); the dream of Pilate’s wife regarding Jesus.—27:19.
At least ten parables or illustrations found in Matthew’s account are not mentioned in the other Gospels. These include four in chapter 13, those of the weeds in the field, the hidden treasure, the “one pearl of high value,” and the dragnet. Others are the illustrations of the unmerciful slave (18:23-35), the workers in the vineyard (20:1-16), the marriage of the king’s son (22:1-14), the ten virgins (25:1-13) and the talents.—25:14-30.
At times Matthew provides supplementary details. Although material from the Sermon on the Mount also appears in Luke’s account (6:17-49), Matthew’s Gospel is far more extensive in this respect. (5:1–7:29) Whereas Mark, Luke and John mention the miraculous feeding of about 5,000 men, Matthew adds “besides women and young children.” (Matt. 14:21; Mark 6:44; Luke 9:14; John 6:10) Matthew mentions two demon-possessed men encountered by Jesus in the country of the Gadarenes, while Mark and Luke refer to only one. (Matt. 8:28; Mark 5:2; Luke 8:27) Matthew also tells of two blind men being healed on an occasion, whereas Mark and Luke mention only one. (Matt. 20:29, 30; Mark 10:46, 47; Luke 18:35, 38) Of course, all the writers were correct in that at least one person was involved in each incident. But Matthew was often more explicit as to number. This perhaps is to be attributed to his former occupation as a tax collector.
MATTHEW’S USE OF THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES
It has been estimated that Matthew’s Gospel contains about a hundred references to the Hebrew Scriptures. These include Christ’s own quotations from and allusions to the Hebrew Scriptures, among which are the following: a man’s enemies to be persons of his own household (Matt. 10:35, 36; Mic. 7:6); John the Baptist identified as the “Elijah” to come (Matt. 11:13, 14; 17:11-13; Mal. 4:5); Jesus’ and Jonah’s experiences compared (Matt. 12:40; Jonah 1:17); commandment on honoring parents (Matt. 15:4; Ex. 20:12; 21:17); rendering lip service to God (Matt. 15:8, 9; Isa. 29:13); need for two or three witnesses (Matt. 18:16; Deut. 19:15); statements on marriage (Matt. 19:4-6; Gen. 1:27; 2:24); various commandments (Matt. 5:21, 27, 38; 19:18, 19; Ex. 20:12-16; 21:24; Lev. 19:18; 24:20; Deut. 19:21); the temple made into a “cave of robbers” (Matt. 21:13; Isa. 56:7; Jer. 7:11); rejection of Jesus, the “stone” that became the “chief cornerstone” (Matt. 21:42; Ps. 118:22, 23); foes of David’s Lord put under his feet (Matt. 22:44; Ps. 110:1); disgusting thing in the holy place (Matt. 24:15; Dan. 9:27); Jesus’ disciples scattered (Matt. 26:31; Zech. 13:7); Christ apparently forsaken by God. (Matt. 27:46; Ps. 22:1) There are also Jesus’ statements used in resisting Satan’s temptations.—Matt. 4:4, 7, 10; Deut. 8:3; 6:16, 13.
Interesting, too, is Matthew’s inspired application of Hebrew Scripture prophecies to Jesus, proving him to be the promised Messiah. This aspect would have been of particular concern to the Jews, for whom the account seems to have been originally intended. The prophecies include: Jesus’ being born of a virgin (Matt. 1:23; Isa. 7:14); his birth in Bethlehem (Matt. 2:6; Mic. 5:2); his being called out of Egypt (Matt. 2:15; Hos. 11:1); the lamentation over the death of slaughtered children (Matt. 2:16-18; Jer. 31:15); John the Baptist preparing the way before Jesus (Matt. 3:1-3; Isa. 40:3); Jesus’ ministry bringing light (Matt. 4:13-16; Isa. 9:1, 2); his carrying of illnesses (Matt. 8:14-17; Isa. 53:4); his use of illustrations (Matt. 13:34, 35; Ps. 78:2); Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem on the colt of an ass (Matt. 21:4, 5; Zech. 9:9); the betrayal of Christ for thirty pieces of silver.—Matt. 26:14, 15; Zech. 11:12.
AN ACCURATE, BENEFICIAL RECORD
Matthew, being a close associate of Christ during Jesus’ later life on earth and thus an eyewitness of his ministry, could understandably record a moving and meaningful Gospel. This we possess in the former tax collector’s record of the life of Jesus Christ, he being enabled by God’s spirit to recall what Jesus said and did on earth. (John 14:26) Hence, Matthew accurately portrayed Jesus of Nazareth as the beloved Son of God having divine approval, as the one who came “to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many” and as the foretold Messianic King who was to arrive in glory. (Matt. 20:28; 3:17; 25:31) When on earth, Jesus pointed to his works and could truthfully say: “The poor are having the good news declared to them.” (Matt. 11:5) And today multitudes, both natural Jews and non-Jews, greatly benefit from such Kingdom good news as recorded in Matthew’s Gospel.

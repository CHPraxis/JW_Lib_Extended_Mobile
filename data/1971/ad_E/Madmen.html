<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Madʹmen) [possibly, dunghill].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Seemingly a place in Moab foretold to suffer calamity by sword. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:2-24:48:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 48:2</a>, “You, too, O Madmen, should keep silent,” translates the Hebrew phrase <em>gam-madh·menʹ tid·domʹmi.</em> Many scholars believe that the initial <em>m</em> in <em>madh·menʹ</em> (“Madmen”) was inadvertently repeated from the previous word (<em>gam</em>). Without the initial <em>m</em> the consonants of Madmen correspond to those of Dimon and, therefore, Madmen is often considered to be the same as Dimon (possibly, Khirbet Dimneh, two and a half miles [4 kilometers] NW of Rabbah). However, perhaps Madmen does not designate an actual location, since the renderings of the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> Syriac and Latin <em>Vulgate</em> versions suggest that the ancient Hebrew text read, ‘Yes, you [Moab] shall be utterly brought to silence.’</p>

EN-HADDAH
(En-had πdah) [mighty bubbling fountain, or swift fountain].
A city of Issachar, likely near En-gannim. (Josh. 19:17, 21) It is generally identified with el-Hadetheh, six miles (10 kilometers) E of Mount Tabor, though some suggest Khirbet el-Haddad, a little more than two miles NE of Megiddo.

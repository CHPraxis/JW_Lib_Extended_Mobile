BETH-GADER
(Beth-gaʹder) [house or place of a wall].
A name appearing in the genealogy of Judah. (1 Chron. 2:50, 51) The meaning of the name appears to be more geographical than personal, causing some scholars to consider it as relating to a town in Judah. (See ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) Beth-gader may possibly be linked with Geder, a town whose king was among those conquered by Joshua in the region W of the Jordan.—Josh. 12:13.

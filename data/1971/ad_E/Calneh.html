<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Calʹneh).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A city founded by Nimrod in the land of Shinar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:10-1:10:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:10</a>) It thus evidently lay in southern Mesopotamia, but the location is uncertain. Nippur, an ancient Babylonian city about fifty-six miles (90.1 kilometers) E-SE of Babylon, has long been suggested as its site, based on Talmudic tradition and other factors. Some scholars, however, prefer an identification with <em>Kulunu,</em> the early name of a city of some importance near Babylon. A third possibility is a twin city of Kish called Hursagkalama, the latter part of the name (-kalama) supposedly representing Calneh. Some translations (<em>RS, JB</em>) render Calneh not as a place-name but as the phrase “all of them” so that the text reads “Babel, Erech, and Accad, <em>all of them</em> in the land of Shinar” (<em>RS</em>), but this requires an adjustment in the pointing as found in the Masoretic text.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A place mentioned by the prophet Amos, along with the cities of Hamath and Gath, when warning the people of Israel and Judah of coming calamity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:6:2-30:6:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Amos 6:2</a>) While some commentators consider it to be the same as No. 1 above, most scholars view its association with Hamath and Gath as indicating a location in the region adjacent to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, rather than in Mesopotamia. They suggest an identification with <em>Kullani</em> in northern Syria (apparently represented today by modern Kullan Köy, about ten miles [16 kilometers] SE of Arpad), mentioned by Tiglath-pileser III as among the places subjugated during an Assyrian campaign in the west. If this identification is correct, then Calneh here may be the same as Calno of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:9-23:10:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:9</a>.—See CALNO.</p>

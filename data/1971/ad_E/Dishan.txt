DISHAN
(Diʹshan) [antelope].
A Seirite, a sheik of the Horite in the land of Edom. (Gen. 36:20, 21; 1 Chron. 1:38) Genesis 36:28 says the sons of “Dishan” were Uz and Aran, while 1 Chronicles 1:42 in the Masoretic text, Septuagint, and Syriac Peshitta refers to “Dishon” as their progenitor. This difference in vocalization, apparently the result of a copyist’s error, is resolved in many English translations (AS, AV, JB, Kx, Le, NW, Ro, Yg) by using “Dishan” in both texts, as does the Latin Vulgate.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>ʼe·lahʹ; ʼe·lohnʹ</em>], <strong>MASSIVE TREES</strong> [Heb., <em>ʼal·lahʹ, ʼal·lohnʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These Hebrew words are variously rendered oak, elm and teil tree in <em>AV,</em> also terebinth in <em>AS</em>. However, many authorities acknowledge that these words may have been applied in Bible times simply to big trees in general.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:2:9-30:2:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 2:9</a> the Amorite people were likened to the cedar for height and to “massive trees [<em>ʼal·lohnʹ</em>]” for vigor. These “massive trees” were especially abundant in Bashan in Transjordan and are used in comparisons along with the cedars of Lebanon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:13-23:2:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 2:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:1-38:11:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Zech. 11:1, 2</a>) Oars were fashioned from their wood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:6-26:27:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:6</a>) Deborah was buried under such a tree at Bethel, resulting in the name Allon-bacuth, which means “Big tree of weeping.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:8-1:35:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 35:8</a>) The location of such trees on hills and high places made them popular places of shade under which false worshipers could engage in idolatrous practices.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:13-28:4:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hos. 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Doubtless the massive trees of Bashan included the oak. Renowned for their sturdiness and strength, oak trees live to a very great age. Several kinds of oaks continue to grow in Bashan as well as in the lofty parts of the Hauran, Gilead, Galilee and Lebanon, some of them evergreens; while others are deciduous (that is, losing their leaves each fall). Their fruit, the acorn, is set in a cup and is rich in tannin. It is believed that the color for the “coccus scarlet” material used in the sanctuary (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:4-2:25:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 25:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:26:1-2:26:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 26:1</a>) was obtained from a scale insect that infects the branches of a species of oak.—See DYES, DYEING.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Another tree considered likely to be among the “big trees” of the Bible is the terebinth or turpentine tree. It is a common tree in Palestine, has a thick trunk and widespreading branches and may attain to heights of as much as fifty feet (15.2 meters), providing excellent shade. By making incisions in the bark a perfumed resin is obtained, from which turpentine is produced.</p>

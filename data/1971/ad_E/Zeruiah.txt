ZERUIAH
(Ze·ruʹiah) [perfumed with balsam].
King David’s sister and mother of Joab, Abishai and Asahel. (1 Chron. 2:16) Since Zeruiah and her sister Abigail are both called “daughters of Nahash,” never daughters of Jesse, it is likely that they were daughters of Jesse’s wife by a previous marriage to Nahash, therefore only half sisters of David. (2 Sam. 17:25; see NAHASH No. 2.) Apparently Zeruiah was considerably older than David, for her sons seem to have been about the same age as David. Zeruiah’s name is usually associated with her three sons, who were all valiant fighters for David. (2 Sam. 2:13, 18; 16:9) The only reference made to the boys’ father is that he was buried at Bethlehem.—2 Sam. 2:32.

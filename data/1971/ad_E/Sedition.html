<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Gr., <em>staʹsis,</em> a standing up or standing off, uprising, such as a popular commotion, an insurrection, sedition, uproar (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:7-41:15:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 15:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:19-42:23:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 23:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:25-42:23:25" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 25</a>); or, in a more private sense, dissension, controversy, sometimes embracing the idea of violence (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:2-44:15:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 15:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:7-44:23:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:10-44:23:10" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 10</a>)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It was a capital offense under Roman law to engage in sedition or to promote or take part in a riot. Thus the city recorder was alerting the riotous mob in Ephesus of their peril when he said: “We are really in danger of being charged with sedition over today’s affair, no single cause existing that will permit us to render a reason for this disorderly mob.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:40-44:19:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 19:40</a>) And Tertullus’ accusation before Roman Governor Felix that Paul was “stirring up seditions among all the Jews” was a very serious one. If found guilty, Paul would have been punished with death.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:5-44:24:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 24:5</a>.</p>

SHAVEH, LOW PLAIN OF
(Shaʹveh) [level (plain)].
“The king’s Low Plain,” where Abraham, victorious over Chedorlaomer and his allies, was met by the king of Sodom and received a blessing from Melchizedek, king of Salem. (Gen. 14:17-24) Centuries later, Absalom erected his monument in the “Low Plain of the King,” apparently the same place and likely near Jerusalem. (2 Sam. 18:18) Josephus indicated that Absalom’s Monument was set up “two furlongs [c. 1,215 feet (370 meters)] distant from Jerusalem.” However, the exact location of the Low Plain of Shaveh cannot now be ascertained.—Antiquities of the Jews, Book VII, chap. X, par. 3.

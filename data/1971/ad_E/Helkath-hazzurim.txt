HELKATH-HAZZURIM
(Helʹkath-haz·zuʹrim) [possibly, field of flints or, by a slight textual emendation, field of sides]. A field near the “pool of Gibeon.” Twenty-four young men, twelve representing the armies of Ish-bosheth and twelve from the servants of David, died there while ‘putting on a combat.’ The place was subsequently named from this incident.—2 Sam. 2:12-16.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>behth ʽeʹqedh ha·ro·ʽim</em>ʹ].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place on the road from Jezreel to Samaria, at which place Jehu met and slew the brothers of King Ahaziah of Judah by a cistern. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:12-12:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:12-14</a>) Its name apparently indicates a house where the sheep were bound to facilitate the work of shearing. Some versions render <em>behth ʽeʹqedh</em> as “meeting house,” indicating an inn where shepherds (<em>ha·ro·ʽim</em>ʹ) met; others simply transliterate the Hebrew name, viewing it as the name of a town. It is generally identified with Beit-Qad about three miles (4.8 kilometers) E of En-gannim (modern Jenin). There are several cisterns at this place.</p>

BETH-TAPPUAH
(Beth-tapʹpu·ah) [house or place of apples].
A city in the hill country near Hebron and part of Judah’s territorial inheritance. (Josh. 15:20, 48, 53) Some suggest it received its name from the Judean named Tappuah (1 Chron. 2:42, 43); however, it is also possible that Beth-tappuah (place of apples) was named from the apples that likely once grew there in abundance. It is identified today with modern Taffuh, four miles (6 kilometers) W-NW of Hebron, on a hill even today fruitful with olive trees and vineyards.—For information regarding TAPPUAH in the Shephelah of Judah and TAPPUAH and EN-TAPPUAH on the boundary of Ephraim and Manasseh, see those subjects.

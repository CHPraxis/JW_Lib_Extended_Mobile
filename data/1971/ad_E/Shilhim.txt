SHILHIM
(Shilʹhim).
A city in the southern part of Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 32) It seems to be the same as Sharuhen, listed among the cities in Judah’s territory belonging to Simeon. (Josh. 19:1, 6) The list at 1 Chronicles 4:31 appears to call the same city Shaaraim. Tell el-Farʽah, some nineteen miles (31 kilometers) W of Beer-sheba, is apparently the modern location.

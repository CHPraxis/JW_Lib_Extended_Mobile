CHITLISH
(Chitʹlish) [a man’s wall].
A city in the Shephelah in the inheritance of Judah. (Josh. 15:33, 40) Since the Septuagint uses the term Ma·a·khosʹ instead of Chitlish, it is usually identified with modern-day Khirbet el-Meqhaz five miles (8 kilometers) SW of Lachish. Some authorities associate Chitlish with the name Kentisha mentioned in the Palestinian list of Pharaoh Thutmose III, and a similar name found on an ostracon from a later date at Lachish.

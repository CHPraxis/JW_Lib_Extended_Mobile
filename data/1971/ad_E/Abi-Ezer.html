<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aʹbi-eʹzer) [father of help; helpful].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. One of the “sons of Gilead” the grandson of Manasseh, Joseph’s firstborn. A comparison of the accounts at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:28-4:26:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 26:28-30 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:17:1-6:17:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Joshua 17:1, 2</a> shows that he is also called Iezer (Jeezer, <em>AV</em>), which is a shortened form of Abi-ezer, the prefix “Ab” (father) being removed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Abi-ezer was a family head and an ancestor of Judge Gideon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:11-7:6:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 6:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:24-7:6:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:34-7:6:34" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:2-7:8:2" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 8:2</a>) It appears that after the division of land among the tribes of Israel, Abi-ezer’s family either originally or at a later time settled in the area of Ophrah, in the territory of Manasseh W of the Jordan.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The name is also used to stand for the “house of Abi-ezer” in a collective sense.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:2-7:8:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 8:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">2. A son of Hammolecheth, who was sister of Manasseh’s grandson Gilead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:18-13:7:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:18</a>) Some commentators view this Abi-ezer as being the same as No. 1 above.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">3. A Benjamite from Anathoth, one of King David’s thirty-seven most valiant fighters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:27-10:23:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:39-10:23:39" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 39</a>) He was head of a paternal house, and divisional head over a force of 24,000 fellow tribesmen, serving the king during the ninth month of each year. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:28-13:11:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 11:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:1-13:27:1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 27:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:12-13:27:12" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 12</a>) Along with other Benjamites, by his valor in war he fulfilled the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:27-1:49:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 49:27</a>. His town of Anathoth lay a few miles NE of Jerusalem, within the territory of Benjamin.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:60-13:6:60" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Chron. 6:60</a>.</p>

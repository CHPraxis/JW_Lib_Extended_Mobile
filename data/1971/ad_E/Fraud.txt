FRAUD
The intentional use of deception, trickery, or perversion of truth to induce another to part with some valuable thing belonging to him, or to give up a legal right.
Fraud, as dealt with in the Bible, is generally associated with business relationships. Dishonest business dealings are forbidden by God’s law. The Israelites were to deal honestly with one another. The hired laborer was specifically protected by the Law. (Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14) Jesus Christ included the injunction against fraud as being among the “commandments” of God. (Mark 10:19) Under the Law covenant, if a man defrauded his associate and later repented and brought the matter to light, confessing it, he was required to restore the full amount plus one-fifth of it to the person injured, as well as to offer a guilt offering to Jehovah.—Lev. 6:1-7.
False forms of religion likewise are considered fraudulent in the Scriptures. Paul’s sharp denunciation of Elymas the sorcerer resulted in his being struck with blindness because of the fraud and villainy he had practiced by “distorting the right ways of Jehovah.” (Acts 13:8-11) Paul also corrected Christians in Corinth who were taking one another to court, stating that they were wronging and defrauding their brothers by this action of going to court before unrighteous men and not before the holy ones in the congregation. They should rather suffer being defrauded than to take such matters before men of the world.—1 Cor. 6:1-8.
The Bible frequently warns against and denounces fraud and fraudulent practices, also pointing out that God will judge defrauders and will deliver his people from such ones.—Ps. 62:10; 72:4; 103:6; Prov. 14:31; 22:16; 28:16; Mic. 2:1, 2; Mal. 3:5.

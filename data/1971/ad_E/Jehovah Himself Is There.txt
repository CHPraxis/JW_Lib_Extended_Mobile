JEHOVAH HIMSELF IS THERE
This translates the expression “Jehovah-shamʹmah,” applied to the city seen by the prophet Ezekiel in his vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48. (Ezek. 48:35) The visionary city is depicted as foursquare (four thousand five hundred cubits to a side [6,562.5 feet (c. 2,000 meters)]) and as having twelve gates, each bearing the name of one of the tribes of Israel. (48:15, 16, 31-34) To an extent it is similar to the holy city New Jerusalem as seen in vision by the apostle John. (Rev. 21:2, 10-16) The visionary city of Ezekiel’s prophecy is to belong to “all the house of Israel.” (Ezek. 45:6) The name “Jehovah-shamʹmah,” or “Jehovah Himself Is There,” would signify a representational presence of God like that expressed in other texts, such as Psalms 46:5; 132:13, 14; Isaiah 24:23; Joel 3:21 and Zechariah 2:10, 11, where Jehovah, whom the ‘heaven of the heavens cannot contain,’ is spoken of as though residing in an earthly city or place.—1 Ki. 8:27.

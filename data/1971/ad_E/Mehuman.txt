MEHUMAN
(Me·huʹman) [trusty, but possibly a derivative of some as yet unknown Persian word].
One of the court officials of Persian King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), who ruled in the days of Mordecai and Esther. Mehuman was named first among the seven court officials ordered by Ahasuerus to bring Queen Vashti into his presence.—Esther 1:10, 11.

ADRAMYTTIUM
(Ad·ra·mytʹti·um).
A seaport city on the Aegean Sea, located in Mysia at the NW corner of Asia Minor, N of Pergamum. In modern Turkey the harbor site is now called Karatash, while the inland town of Edremit preserves the earlier name.
Adramyttium was part of the province of Asia under Roman rule and was evidently at one time a maritime commercial center of some importance, since it lay on the Roman road that passed through Pergamum and Ephesus to the south and Assos, Troas and the Hellespont to the west and north. It is likely that Paul passed through Adramyttium on his third missionary tour. The only direct Bible reference to the place, however, is at Acts 27:2. At Caesarea, Paul as a prisoner in the custody of the Roman officer Julius, boarded a ship from Adramyttium that was sailing to points along the coast of Asia Minor. Paul’s party left the ship at Myra in Lycia, transferring to a grain boat from Alexandria that was sailing for Italy. (Acts 27:3-6) The Adramyttium vessel likely continued on around the coast heading for its home port.

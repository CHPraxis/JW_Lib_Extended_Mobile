<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Cuʹshan) [belonging to Cush].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Cushan appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:7-35:3:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Habakkuk 3:7</a> as paralleling the “land of Midian” and hence evidently is another name for Midian or relates to a neighboring country. As shown in the article on CUSH, some descendants of Cush appear to have settled on the Arabian Peninsula; and the name <em>Kusi</em> or <em>Kushim</em> was anciently used to describe certain Arabic peoples of that region.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Luʹhith) [possibly, of tablets or planks].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place mentioned in prophecies of doom against Moab. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:1-23:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:5-23:15:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:5-24:48:5" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Jer. 48:5</a>) Some scholars believe that Luhith was a Moabite city located at the top of an ascent. Identified by Eusebius and Jerome with a place called Loueitha, Luhith has been linked with either modern Khirbet Mendint er Ras, about five miles (8 kilometers) E of the southern end of the Dead Sea, or nearby Khirbet Fas. Another view is that Luhith was not a city but merely the name of the ascent or slope to be used by the fleeing and weeping Moabite refugees.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:34:4-4:34:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 34:4</a>.</p>

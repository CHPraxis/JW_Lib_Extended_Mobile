SHIMEI
(Shimʹe·i) [Jehovah has heard].
1. Second-named son of Gershon (Gershom); grandson of Levi. (Ex. 6:16, 17; Num. 3:17, 18; 1 Chron. 6:16, 17) Several Shimeite families of Levites descended from him.—Num. 3:21-26; 1 Chron. 23:7, 10, 11; Zech. 12:13.
2. A Reubenite whose descendant Beerah, a chieftain, was taken into exile by Assyrian King Tilgath-pilneser (Tiglath-pileser III).—1 Chron. 5:1, 4-6.
3. A Merarite Levite.—1 Chron. 6:29.
4. A Gershonite Levite; ancestor of Asaph.—1 Chron. 6:39, 42.
5. A Benjamite whose nine sons (or descendants) were heads of forefathers’ houses living in Jerusalem. (1 Chron. 8:1, 19-21, 28) He is apparently called Shema in verse 13, there identified as a family head in Aijalon.
6. A Simeonite, the son of Zaccur; he had sixteen sons and six daughters.—1 Chron. 4:24-27.
7. One of David’s brothers.—2 Sam. 21:21; see SHAMMAH No. 2.
8. A descendant of Gershon through Ladan. During David’s reign, three sons (or descendants) of Shimei were heads of Levitical families.—1 Chron. 23:8, 9.
9. Head of the tenth division of Levitical musicians; son of Jeduthun.—1 Chron. 25:1, 3, 17.
10. Caretaker of David’s vineyards; a Ramathite.—1 Chron. 27:27.
11. A loyal supporter of King David who refused to Join Adonijah’s conspiracy. (1 Ki. 1:8) He is presumably the same Shimei appointed as King Solomon’s food deputy in Benjamin’s territory; son of Ela.—1 Ki. 4:7, 18.
12. A Benjamite from the village of Bahurim. Shimei, the son of Gera, of a family in King Saul’s house, harbored a grudging spirit toward David for years after Saul’s death and the removal of the kingship from his house. Shimei found an occasion to vent his long-contained wrath when David and his party fled from Jerusalem on account of Absalom’s rebellion. Just a little E of the Mount of Olives, Shimei walked along throwing stones and dust down at them and cursing David. Abishai asked David’s permission to kill Shimei, but David refused, hoping that perhaps Jehovah would turn Shimei’s curse into a blessing.—2 Sam. 16:5-13.
On David’s return, with the situation reversed, Shimei and a thousand other Benjamites were the first to meet him, Shimei bowing before him and making expression of repentance for his sins. Again Abishai wanted to kill him, but again David did not allow it, this time swearing that he would not put Shimei to death. (2 Sam. 19:15-23) However, before his death David told Solomon to “bring his gray hairs down to Sheol with blood.”—1 Ki. 2:8, 9.
At the start of his reign, Solomon called Shimei and ordered him to move to Jerusalem and remain in the city under penalty that if he ever left the city he would be put to death. Shimei agreed to these terms, but three years later he left the city to recover two of his slaves who had fled to Gath. On learning of this violation, Solomon called Shimei to account for breaking his oath to Jehovah and ordered Benaiah to execute him.—1 Ki. 2:36-46.
13. A Levite descendant of Heman who sanctified himself and helped dispose of the unclean objects removed from the temple at the beginning of Hezekiah’s reign. (2 Chron. 29:12, 14-16) Probably the same as No. 14 below.
14. The Levite second in charge of storing the generous contributions and tithes brought to the temple during Hezekiah’s reign. (2 Chron. 31:11-13) Probably identical with No. 13 above.
15. Ancestor of Mordecai; tribe of Benjamin.—Esther 2:5.
16. Brother of Governor Zerubbabel; descendant of David in the tribe of Judah.—1 Chron. 3:19.
17. One of the Levites who dismissed their foreign wives and sons when reprimanded by Ezra for having made foreign marriage alliances.—Ezra 10:10, 11, 23, 44.
18, 19. Two Israelites, sons of Hashum and Binnui respectively, who also sent away their foreign wives and sons.—Ezra 10:33, 38, 44.

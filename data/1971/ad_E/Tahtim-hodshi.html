<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “land” on the route of the census takers sent out by David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:24:4-10:24:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 24:4-6</a>) The exact location of Tahtim-hodshi is not known. However, it is mentioned between Gilead and Dan-jaan, placing it in the northern part of the Promised Land. The Lagardian edition of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> says “land of the Hittites toward Kadesh,” a similar reading being used by some modern translations.—<em>JB, NE</em> (1970 ed.), <em>RS</em>.</p>

ANAMIM
(Anʹa·mim).
Hamitic descendants of Mizraim. Since Mizraim became synonymous with Egypt, it is probable that the Anamim settled there or in that area. (Gen. 10:13; 1 Chron. 1:11) A cuneiform text considered as of the time of Sargon II of Assyria (latter part of the eighth century B.C.E.) apparently refers to them under the name Anami.

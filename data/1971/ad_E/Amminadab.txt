AMMINADAB
(Am·minʹa·dab) [my kinsman is generous].
1. A son of Ram of the family of Hezron, tribe of Judah. (1 Chron. 2:10) His son, Nahshon, was chieftain of Judah during the wilderness trek (Num. 1:7; 7:11, 12), and his daughter, Elisheba, became Aaron’s wife. (Ex. 6:23) Amminadab was an ancestor of King David and of Christ Jesus.—Ruth 4:19-22; Matt. 1:4-16; Luke 3:23-33.
2. Perhaps an alternative name for Izhar, a son of Kohath and father of Korah. (1 Chron. 6:22; compare verses 2, 18, 37, 38; Exodus 6:18, 21; Numbers 3:19, 27.) Some copies of the Septuagint give “Izhar” instead of “Amminadab” at 1 Chronicles 6:22.
3. A Levite, of the sons of Uzziel; a family head in David’s time. He helped to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem.—1 Chron. 15:10-12.

HARMON
(Harʹmon).
There is uncertainty as to what is designated by the Hebrew term transliterated “Harmon” (Amos 4:3, AS, NW, RS), some translators giving such widely differing renderings as “refuse heap” (AT) and “palace” (AV). If the reading of the Greek Septuagint (“the mountain Romman”) comes closer to the original Hebrew text, then perhaps “Harmon” refers to the “crag of Rimmon.”—Judg. 20:45, 47.

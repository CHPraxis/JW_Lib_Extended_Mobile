REZEPH
(Reʹzeph) [a heated stone or coal; stronghold].
A place cited in Sennacherib’s message to King Hezekiah boasting that Assyrian kings had ruined various “nations.” (2 Ki. 19:8-12; Isa. 37:12) Rezeph’s exact location is not known, several places having had this name. One such site, thought by some to have been part of an ancient district, is identified with modern Rusafah, located W of the Euphrates about ninety miles (145 kilometers) S of modern Harran. It is thus in the vicinity of the suggested site of Gozan, with which Rezeph is mentioned.

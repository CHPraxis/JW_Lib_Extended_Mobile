LEHI
(Leʹhi) [jaw(bone)].
The scene of one or, possibly, two Israelite victories over the Philistines. Its exact location is unknown today. But perhaps modern Khirbet es-Siyyaj, less than two miles (3 kilometers) E of Beth-shemesh, derives its name from the Greek word si·a·gonʹ (jawbone). It may therefore point to the ancient site.
At Lehi, Samson struck down a thousand Philistines with the moist jawbone of an ass. Subsequently he called the site Ramath-lehi (“the lofty place of the jaw[bone]”), probably to memorialize the victory Jehovah had given him there. (Judg. 15:9-19) Originally, though, Lehi may have gotten its name from the shape of its crags.
Later, according to the rendering of numerous translators, Shammah struck down many Philistines assembled at Lehi. (2 Sam. 23:11, 12; AT, JB, NW, RS) However, the Hebrew term la·hhay·yahʹ may also be rendered by such expressions as “into a troop” (AV, Le, Ro) instead of “to (at) Lehi.”

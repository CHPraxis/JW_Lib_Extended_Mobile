<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb. and Gr., “place of sacrifice”].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Basically, a raised structure or place on which sacrifices are offered or incense is burned in worship of the true God or of another deity. The first mention of an altar occurs after the flood when “Noah began to build an altar to Jehovah” and offered burnt offerings thereon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:20-1:8:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 8:20</a>) The only offerings mentioned prior to the Flood were those of Cain and Abel and, though it is likely that they did so, it is not stated whether they used altars or not.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:3-1:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Abraham built an altar at Shechem (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:7-1:12:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 12:7</a>) at a point between Bethel and Ai (12:8; 13:3), at Hebron (13:18), and also at Mount Moriah, where he sacrificed a ram given him by God in substitution for Isaac. (22:9-13) Only in this last case is a sacrifice specifically mentioned as being offered on these altars by Abraham. However, the basic meaning of the Hebrew word indicates that offerings were likely made in each case. Isaac later built an altar at Beer-sheba (26:23, 25) and Jacob built altars at Shechem and at Bethel. (33:18, 20; 35:1, 3, 7) These altars made by the patriarchs were doubtless of the type later mentioned by God in the Law covenant, either mounds of earth or platforms made up of natural (unhewn) stones.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:24-2:20:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 20:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Following the exodus from Egypt, Moses first constructed an altar following the victory over Amalek, naming it Jehovah-nissi (Jehovah is my signal, or, perhaps, Jehovah is my refuge). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:15-2:17:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 17:15, 16</a>) At the making of the Law covenant with Israel an altar was built by Moses at the foot of Mount Sinai and sacrifices were offered up on it. Blood from the sacrifices was sprinkled on the altar, on the book and on the people, thereby validating and putting in force the covenant.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:24:4-2:24:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 24:4-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:17-58:9:20" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:17-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>TABERNACLE ALTARS</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With the setting up of the tabernacle, two altars were constructed according to divine pattern. The altar of burnt offering (also called the “altar of copper” [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:39-2:39:39" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 39:39</a>]) was made of acacia wood in the form of a hollow chest, apparently without top or bottom. It was about seven and a quarter feet (2.2 meters) square and about four and a third feet (1.3 meters) high with “horns” projecting from the upper four corners. All its surfaces were overlaid with copper. A grating or network of copper was placed below the altar’s rim “down within,” “toward the center.” Four rings were placed at the four extremities near the grating, and these appear to be the same rings through which the two copper-sheathed acacia-wood poles were passed for carrying the altar. This might mean that a slot was cut through two sides of the altar allowing for a flat grating to be inserted, with the rings extending out on both sides. There is considerable difference of opinion among scholars on the subject, and many consider it likely that two sets of rings were involved, the second set, for insertion of the carrying poles, being attached directly to the outside of the altar. Copper equipment was made in the form of cans and shovels for the ashes, bowls for catching the blood of the animals forks for handling the flesh, and fire holders. All of this was made by Bezalel and Oholiab.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:27:1-2:27:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 27:1–8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:2-2:31:2" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 31:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:6-2:31:6" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:8-2:31:9" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:1-2:38:7" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 38:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:38:30-2:38:30" data-bid="8-6" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:14-4:4:14" data-bid="8-7" class="b"> Num. 4:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This copper altar for burnt offerings was placed before the entrance of the tabernacle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:6-2:40:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 40:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:29-2:40:29" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 29</a>) While it was of relatively low height, thus not necessarily requiring a means of approach, for ease of handling the sacrifices placed within it, the earth may have been raised around it, or there may have been a ramp leading up to it. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:22-3:9:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Leviticus 9:22</a>, which states that Aaron “came down” from making offerings.) Since the animal was sacrificed “at the side of the altar to the north” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:11-3:1:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lev. 1:11</a>), the “place for the fatty ashes” removed from the altar was to the E (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:16-3:1:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Lev. 1:16</a>), and the basin of copper for washing was located to the W (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:18-2:30:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex. 30:18</a>), this would logically leave the S as the open side on which such a means of approach might be placed.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>Altar of incense</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The altar of incense (also called the “altar of gold” [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:38-2:39:38" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 39:38</a>]) was likewise made of acacia wood, the top and sides being overlaid with gold. A border of gold ran around the top. The altar measured about 17.5 inches (44.5 centimeters) square and about 2 feet 11 inches (89 centimeters) high, and also had “horns” extending out from the four top corners. Two gold rings were made for the insertion of the acacia carrying poles overlaid with gold, and these rings were placed underneath the gold border on opposite sides of the altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:1-2:30:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 30:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:37:25-2:37:28" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 37:25-28</a>) A <span id="page59" class="pageNum" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>special incense was burned on this altar twice daily, in the morning and in the evening.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:12-3:16:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Lev. 16:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:4-58:9:4" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:5-66:8:5" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Rev. 8:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:19-14:26:19" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 19</a>.) The position of the altar of incense was within the tabernacle just before the curtain of the Most Holy so that it is spoken of as being “before the ark of the testimony.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:1-2:30:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 30:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:6-2:30:6" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:5-2:40:5" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 40:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:26-2:40:27" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>Sanctification and use of tabernacle altars</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At the time of the installation ceremonies, both altars were anointed and sanctified. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:9-2:40:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ex. 40:9, 10</a>) At that time, as also in subsequent sacrifices of certain sin offerings, blood of the sacrificed animal was put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering and the rest was poured out at its base. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:12-2:29:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex. 29:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:15-3:8:15" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Lev. 8:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:8-3:9:9" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 9:8, 9</a>) Some of the anointing oil and blood on the altar was spattered upon Aaron and his sons and their garments to sanctify them toward the conclusion of the installation ceremony. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:30-3:8:30" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Lev. 8:30</a>) In all, seven days were required for the sanctification of the altar of burnt offering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:37-2:29:37" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex. 29:37</a>) In other burnt offerings, communion sacrifices and guilt offerings the blood was sprinkled about upon the altar, while the blood of fowls sacrificed was spattered or drained at the side of the altar.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:2:2-3:2:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lev. 2:2-12</a>) Remaining portions of the grain offering were eaten by the high priest and his sons alongside the altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:10:12-3:10:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Lev. 10:12</a>) Annually on the atonement day the altar was cleansed and sanctified by the high priest’s placing some of the sacrificial animals’ blood on the horns of the altar and by spattering it seven times upon the altar.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:18-3:16:19" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Lev. 16:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In all the animal sacrifices presented, portions of the animal were made to smoke upon the altar, and for this purpose a fire was maintained on the altar and was never allowed to go out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:6:9-3:6:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Lev. 6:9-13</a>) From here the fire was obtained for the burning of incense.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Once a year the golden altar of incense was also atoned for by the placing of sacrificial blood upon its horns. Other occasions in which it was so treated were in the sin offerings made for members of the priesthood.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:10-2:30:10" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ex. 30:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:4:7-3:4:7" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Lev. 4:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE ALTARS</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Prior to the dedication of Solomon’s temple, the copper altar made in the wilderness served for Israel’s sacrificial offerings at the high place in Gibeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:4-11:3:4" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Ki. 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:39-13:16:40" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 16:39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:29-13:21:30" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 21:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:1:3-14:1:6" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 1:3-6</a>) The copper altar thereafter made for the temple covered an area sixteen times as large as the one made by Bezalel, measuring about 29 feet 2 inches (8.9 meters) square and about 14 feet 7 inches (4.5 meters) high. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:4:1-14:4:1" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Chron. 4:1</a>) In view of its height some means of approach was essential. God’s law prohibited the use of steps to the altar to prevent exposure of nakedness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:26-2:20:26" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ex. 20:26</a>) Some believe that the linen drawers worn by Aaron and his sons served to obviate this command and thus make steps allowable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:42-2:28:43" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ex. 28:42, 43</a>) However, it seems likely that an inclined ramp was used to approach the top of the altar of burnt offering. Josephus (<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book V, chap. V, par. 6) indicates that such an approach was used for the temple altar later built by Herod. If the arrangement of the altar of the temple followed that of the tabernacle, the ramp was probably on the S side of the altar. The “molten sea” in which the sacrifices were washed would thus be convenient, as it also lay toward the S. In other respects the altar constructed for the temple apparently was modeled after that of the tabernacle and no detailed description of it is given.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It was located where David had earlier built his temporary altar on Mount Moriah.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:2-1:22:2" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 22:2</a>) The blood of sacrificial animals was poured out at the altar’s base, and it is likely that some kind of conduit existed for carrying the blood away from the temple area. Herod’s temple is reported to have had such a conduit connected with the SW horn of the altar (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:15-38:9:15" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:15</a>) and, in the rock of the temple area where the altar is believed to have stood, an opening has been found that leads to an underground channel going out to the Kidron valley.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The altar of incense for the temple was made of cedarwood, but this seems to be the only difference between it and that of the tabernacle.

The altar consisted of several sections successively indented or recessed. Its dimensions are given in measurements of the long cubit of about 20.4 inches (51.8 centimeters). The base of the altar was one cubit thick and had a “lip” of one span (about 8.8 inches or 22.2 centimeters) as a border around the top, thus forming a sort of gutter or channel, perhaps for receiving blood poured out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:43:13-26:43:14" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ezek. 43:13, 14</a>) Resting on the base itself, but set in one cubit from its outer edge, was another section and it measured two cubits (40.8 inches or 103.6 centimeters) in height.

Finally, the altar hearth extended up yet another four cubits and was also stepped in one cubit from the preceding section; out from it extended four horns.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">During the period of the exile the Jews who fled to Elephantine in Upper Egypt set up a temple and an altar, according to the Elephantine papyri; and some centuries later the Jews near Leontopolis did likewise. (Josephus, <em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book XIII, chap. III, par. 1; <em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book VII, chap. X, pars. 2 and 3) This latter temple and altar were built by Priest Onias in an attempt at fulfilling <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:19:19-23:19:20" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Isaiah 19:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">In the Common Era, the apostle Paul in speaking to the Athenians referred to an altar inscribed “To <span id="page61" class="pageNum" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>an Unknown God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:23-44:17:23" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Acts 17:23</a>) Ample historical information is available to corroborate this. Apollonius of Tyana, who visited Athens sometime after Paul, wrote: “It is a much greater proof of wisdom and sobriety to speak well of all the gods, especially at Athens, where altars are set up in honor even of unknown gods.” Geographer Pausanias in his <em>Description of Greece</em> in the second century C.E. reported that on the road from the Phaleron Bay harbor to the city of Athens he had observed “altars of the gods named Unknown, and of heroes.” He also spoke of “an altar of Unknown Gods” at Olympia. A similar altar was discovered in 1909 at Pergamum in the precincts of the temple of Demeter. And in Rome on the Palatine Hill is an altar dating from about 100 B.C.E., with the inscription “Sacred to a god or goddess.”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF ALTARS</strong></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:13" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Hebrews chapters 8 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:1-58:9:28" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> 9</a> the apostle Paul clearly shows all the things related to the tabernacle and temple service to have been typical, though, as he states, he does not take the time to explain the significance of all the details. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:5-58:8:5" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Heb. 8:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:5-58:9:5" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:23-58:9:23" data-bid="92-3" class="b"> 23</a>) The significance of the two altars is made evident by information in the Christian Greek Scriptures. The altar of burnt offerings served as the point of mediation between God and man and hence points to God’s arrangement for the ransom sacrifice of his Son. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:16-46:10:21" data-bid="93-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:16-21</a>.) Its situation in front of the entrance to the sanctuary emphasizes the requirement of faith in that ransom sacrifice as a prerequisite for acceptance by God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:18" data-bid="94-1" class="b">John 3:16-18</a>) The insistence upon a single altar of sacrifice is in harmony with Christ’s declaration: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me,” as well as with the many texts declaring the unity to be manifest in the Christian faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="95-1" class="b">John 14:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> Matt. 7:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:13" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 1:10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:3-49:4:6" data-bid="95-4" class="b"> Eph. 4:3-6</a>; note also Isaiah’s prophecy, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:56:7-23:56:7" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Isaiah 56:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:7-23:60:7" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 60:7</a>, that people of all nations would come to God’s altar.)

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">It is notable that, though some individuals fled to the altar, taking hold of its horns, in hope of gaining protection, God’s law prescribed that the willful murderer was to be taken “even from being at my altar to die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:14-2:21:14" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Ex. 21:14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:50-11:1:53" data-bid="100-1" class="b">1 Kings 1:50-53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:28-11:2:34" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 2:28-34</a>.)

Rather the ideas of approach to God,—sacrifice, atonement, pardon and acceptance, salvation,—are gathered up and generally represented in the figure of the altar, even as the Jewish altar was the point at which all these ideas converged.”</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:8:3-66:8:4" data-bid="111-1" class="b">Revelation 8:3, 4</a> the golden altar of incense is expressly related to the prayers of the righteous. It was customary among the Jews to pray at “the hour of offering incense.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:9-42:1:10" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Luke 1:9, 10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:2-19:141:2" data-bid="113-1" class="b">Psalm 141:2</a>.) The single altar for offering incense also corresponds with the one avenue of approach outlined in the Christian Greek Scriptures.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:9-43:10:9" data-bid="114-1" class="b">John 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="114-2" class="b"> 14:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:23-43:16:23" data-bid="114-3" class="b"> 16:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:18-49:2:22" data-bid="114-4" class="b"> Eph. 2:18-22</a>; see OFFERINGS; TABERNACLE; TEMPLE.</p>

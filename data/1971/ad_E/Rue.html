<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A plant mentioned only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:42-42:11:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 11:42</a> with reference to the scrupulous tithing of the Pharisees. The common variety of rue (<em>Ruta graveolens</em>) is a strong-scented shrubby perennial with hairy stems that attains a height of about three feet (c. .9 meter). It has gray-green leaves and bears clusters of yellow flowers. Rue has been used medicinally as a stimulant and antispasmodic. During the days of Jesus’ earthly ministry rue may have been cultivated in Palestine for use in medicine and as a flavoring for food.</p>

SEAH
(seʹah).
A dry measure. (Gen. 18:6; 1 Sam. 25:18; 1 Ki. 18:32; 2 Ki. 7:1, 16, 18) According to rabbinical sources, the seah measure is equal to one-third of an ephah. Since the ephah measure is reckoned at .62 bushel (22 liters) on the basis of archaeological evidence regarding the capacity of the corresponding liquid bath measure (compare Ezekiel 45:11), the seah measure would equal .21 bushel (7.33 liters).

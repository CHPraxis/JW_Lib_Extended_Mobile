BETH-ARABAH
(Beth-arʹa·bah) [house of the desert plains, or, perhaps, house of the depression].
One of the six cities within Judah’s territory described as “in the wilderness.” (Josh. 15:61) It is used in describing the mutual boundaries of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. (Josh. 15:6) Though listed as within the tribal assignment of Judah, it is thereafter spoken of as pertaining to Benjamin, perhaps indicating the site as an enclave city of the Benjamites. (Josh. 18:22) Remaining evidence of the name may be seen in ʽAin el-Gharbah, a spring on the N side of the Wadi el-Qelt about three miles (5 kilometers) SE of Jericho. This location would place it in the desert region at the N end of the Dead Sea.

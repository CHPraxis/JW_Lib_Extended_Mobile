CANNEH
(Can πneh).
A place mentioned between Haran and Eden as among the traders of ancient Tyre. (Ezek. 27:23) Its association with Haran and Eden would seem to place it in northern Mesopotamia, along the middle course of the Euphrates River. Many authorities view the name as a contracted form of Calneh.

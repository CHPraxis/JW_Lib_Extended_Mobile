<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Numerous Biblical references mention saddling asses (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:3-1:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 22:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:21-4:22:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Num. 22:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:17:23-10:17:23" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 17:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:19:26-10:19:26" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 19:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:40-11:2:40" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 1 Ki. 2:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:13:13-11:13:13" data-bid="1-6" class="b"> 13:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:13:27-11:13:27" data-bid="1-7" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:24-12:4:24" data-bid="1-8" class="b"> 2 Ki. 4:24</a>), but no description is provided of the saddles. From the evidence of ancient monuments it appears that early saddles for horses were little more than a cloth or leather padding. The Hebrew verb “to saddle” basically means “to bind,” indicating that the saddles were strapped to the animal. One ancient relief depicts a boxlike saddle strapped to the back of a one-humped camel. Nothing definite can be said about the “saddle basket of the camel” mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:31:34-1:31:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 31:34</a> (<em>NW</em>). The Hebrew expression <em>kar hag-ga·malʹ</em> has been variously rendered “camel-bag” (<em>NE,</em> 1970 ed.), “camel’s litter” (<em>JB</em>) and “camel’s saddle.”—<em>AT</em>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Under the Law, anyone touching a saddle upon which one with a running discharge had been riding became unclean, as did a person touching an article on which a menstruating woman had been sitting.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:9-3:15:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 15:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:19-3:15:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19-23</a>.</p>

LUGGAGE
The Hebrew term keliʹ, sometimes rendered “luggage” and “baggage,” has a broad application and pertains to “something finished, accomplished, prepared.” It can apply to luggage or baggage in a camp.
An army camp, travelers, those gathering to an assembly away from their homes, and so forth, would have with them the necessary items as luggage or baggage. (1 Sam. 10:21, 22; 17:22; 25:9-13) David established the rule in Israel that the men left behind to guard the baggage during military campaigns should share the spoils of victory equally with the fighting men.—1 Sam. 30:21-25.
Egypt was told to outfit herself for exile by making “baggage for exile,” her fall to Babylon being certain, as foretold through the prophet Jeremiah. (Jer. 46:13, 19) In broad daylight, as part of a symbolic enactment relating to Jerusalem’s coming exile to Babylon, Ezekiel brought “luggage for exile” out of his house.—Ezek. 12:1-4, 7-11.

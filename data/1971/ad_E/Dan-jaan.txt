DAN-JAAN
(Dan-jaʹan) [possibly, Dan played a pipe; or simply, Dan of Jaan].
A place mentioned only once, on the route followed by Joab when taking the census ordered by David. (2 Sam. 24:1-6) The description seems to place its location in the extreme N of Israel, since it is stated that they went “on to Dan-jaan and went around to Sidon.” The fact that Beer-sheba is mentioned in the following verse (vs. 7) calls to mind the common expression “from Beer-sheba to Dan,” used by David in instructing Joab about the census. (1 Chron. 21:2) Dan-jaan may therefore refer to the city of Dan or possibly a suburb of that northern city.—Compare Judges 18:28, 29, where Dan and Sidon are also mentioned jointly; see also DAN No. 3.

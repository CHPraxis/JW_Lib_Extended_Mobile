BEULAH
(Beuʹlah) [owned as a wife, or, owned by a husband].
A Hebrew word (Beʽu·lahʹ) transliterated as a name at Isaiah 62:4 in some translations (AS; AV; Ro), whereas in others it is rendered “Married” (AT, RS), “Espoused” (Le), “my wedded wife” (Mo) and “Owned as a Wife” (NW).
The spiritual woman Zion was in a desolate state for seventy years (from 607 to 537 B.C.E.), following the destroying of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and the complete desolation of Judah. However, this restoration prophecy given by Jehovah through Isaiah, one of great import to Jewish captives in ancient Babylon and to members of spiritual Israel, assured restoration and repopulating of the land, a changed condition. Once-desolate Zion would be “a woman left entirely” no more, and her land would no longer be desolate, it being promised: “But you yourself will be called My Delight Is in Her [Heb., Hheph·tsi-vahʹ], and your land Owned as a Wife [Heb., Beʽu·lahʹ]. For Jehovah will have taken delight in you, and your own land will be owned as a wife.” Zion’s returning “sons,” released from Babylonian captivity, would settle in her once again, also ‘taking ownership of her as a wife.’ Zion’s, or Jerusalem’s, restoration meant a new condition for her, one that contrasted with her former desolate state. Because of this restored condition Jehovah, who delights in Zion, declared that she would be called “My Delight Is in Her” and her land “Owned as a Wife.”—Isa. chap. 62; compare Isaiah 54:1, 5, 6; 66:8; Jeremiah 23:5-8; 30:17; Galatians 4:26-31.

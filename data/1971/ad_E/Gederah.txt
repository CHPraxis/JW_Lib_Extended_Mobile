GEDERAH
(Ge·deʹrah) [wall, enclosure].
1. A city in the Shephelah assigned to Judah. (Josh. 15:20, 33, 36) Gederah is usually identified with Jedireh about four and a half miles (7.2 kilometers) NW of the suggested site of Eshtaol. Some of the inhabitants of this city were known for their pottery.—1 Chron. 4:23.
2. Apparently the name of a site in Benjamin’s territory, the home of “Jozabad the Gederathite.” (1 Chron. 12:1, 2, 4) Some geographers tentatively identify it with another Jedireh, less than one mile (1.6 kilometers) NE of Gibeon.

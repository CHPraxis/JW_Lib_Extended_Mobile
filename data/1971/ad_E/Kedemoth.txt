KEDEMOTH
(Kedʹe·moth) [possibly, beginnings, or, eastern parts].
The name applied to a city E of the Jordan and apparently also to the wilderness surrounding it. From the wilderness of Kedemoth Moses sent messengers to Amorite King Sihon, requesting permission to pass through his land. (Deut. 2:26, 27) Originally given to the Reubenites, Kedemoth was later assigned to the Merarite Levites. (Josh. 13:15, 18; 21:34, 36, 37; 1 Chron. 6:77-79) Geographers generally favor as a possible identification Kasr ez-Zaʽferan, situated about ten miles (16 kilometers) NE of what is thought to be the site of ancient Dibon.

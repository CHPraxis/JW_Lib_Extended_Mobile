<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew expression carries the thought of a fountain, spring or well of a land or sea monster, and is variously translated as: the dragon well or fountain (<em>AV, Dy, JB, Le</em>); the jackal’s well (<em>AS, RS</em>); the fountain or well of the Serpent, snake or Big Snake (<em>AT, NW, Ro</em>). The <em>Septuagint,</em> however, reads “the well of fig trees.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This water source was located along the route Nehemiah took on his first inspection of Jerusalem’s broken-down walls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:12-16:2:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Neh. 2:12, 13</a>) Since this name is not found again in the Scriptures, the fountain or well, if elsewhere referred to, must be under a different designation. En-rogel is commonly suggested as its alternate name. This could well be, for though En-rogel is a considerable distance down the Kidron valley, the account simply says that Nehemiah passed “in front of the Fountain,” and this could mean by the corner of the wall facing En-rogel and within sight of, but still some distance from, the fountain.—See EN-ROGEL.</p>

MASSA
(Masʹsa) [Heb., mas·saʼʹ, burden, pronouncement, weighty message].
A descendant of Abraham through Ishmael. (Gen. 25:12-14; 1 Chron. 1:29, 30) Massa’s offspring probably settled somewhere in N Arabia. In the annals of Tiglath-pileser III, Masʼa (Biblical Massa?) is mentioned along with Tema and other locations in N Arabia. Massa has been linked with the Ma·sa·noiʹ located by Greek geographer Ptolemy (second century C.E.) as NE of “Dumah” (the Dumat al-Ghandal area in N Arabia?).
The Hebrew word mas·saʼʹ is also found at Proverbs 30:1 (with the definite article ha) and at Proverbs 31:1 (without an article). This has given rise to the renderings ‘Agur son of Jakeh, of Massa’ and ‘Lemuel king of Massa.’ (Compare AT, JB, Ro, RS and/or their alternate readings.) However, Agur and Lemuel evidently were Israelites and, therefore, mas·saʼʹ is appropriately translated “oracle” (AS), “declaration” (Yg) and “weighty message.”—NW; compare Proverbs 30:5, 9; 31:30 with Psalm 12:6; Romans 3:1, 2.

LETUSHIM
(Le·tuʹshim) [perhaps, hammered, sharpened, or, oppressed].
A name appearing among the descendants of Abraham through Dedan, one of his sons by Keturah. (Gen. 25:3) This name has the plural Hebrew ending im, as do the names Asshurim and Leummim appearing in the same text. Because of this, many scholars believe that a tribe or people is meant. In view of their relationship to Dedan, this tribe likely located in the Arabian Peninsula, but precise identification is impossible.—See MIZRAIM.

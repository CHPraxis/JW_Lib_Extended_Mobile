DUNGEON
David felt as though he was in a dungeon at the time he was hiding in a cave as an outlaw refugee from King Saul. His circumstances looked very dark, with his life constantly in danger, traps in his pathway and no other place to flee. He prayed to Jehovah for liberation. (Ps. 142:7) Isaiah uses the term symbolically in two places: (1) at chapter 24, verse 22, speaking of kings being gathered together in a dungeon in the day when Jehovah becomes king, and (2) chapter 42, verse 7, concerning those in spiritual darkness and imprisonment. The aged Simeon, under inspiration, applied the latter prophecy to those to whom Jesus Christ would bring the light of truth.â€”Luke 2:25-32; see PRISON.

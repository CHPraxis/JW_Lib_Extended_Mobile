BILEAM
(Bilʹe·am) [perhaps, greed, or, destruction].
A town assigned to the Levites of the family of Kohath, given to them from the territory of the half tribe of Manasseh located W of the Jordan River. (1 Chron. 6:70) The listing of Levite cities at Joshua 21:11-39 does not include Bileam but many scholars believe that a scribal error caused Gath-rimmon to be repeated in verse 25 in place of Bileam. Most authorities agree that Bileam is a variant spelling of Ibleam, this latter form being more frequently used.—See IBLEAM.

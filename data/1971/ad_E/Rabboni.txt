RABBONI
(Rab·boʹni).
A Semitic word meaning “My Teacher.” (Mark 10:51) It may be that “Rabboni” was a more respectful form than “Rabbi,” which title of address means “Teacher,” or that it conveyed more personal warmth. (John 1:38) However, when John wrote, perhaps the first person suffix (i) on this word had lost its special significance in the title, since John translates it as meaning merely “Teacher.”—John 20:16.

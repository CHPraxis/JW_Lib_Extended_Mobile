GERAR, TORRENT VALLEY OF
In recent years it has been suggested that the torrent valley of Gerar corresponds to the Wadi esh-Shariʽah, running just S of Tell Abu Hureirah (the probable site of ancient Gerar). The general area around the torrent valley of Gerar was ideal for pastoral life. Apparently water could readily be found by digging pits in the torrent bed. (Gen. 26:17-19) The patriarch Abraham resided temporarily as an alien in this region. (Gen. 20:1, 2) Later, in a time of famine, Isaac returned to the area. Here he engaged in agriculture and raised flocks and herds. (Gen. 26:1, 6, 12-14) In the torrent valley itself Isaac’s servants dug two wells that provoked quarrels with the covetous shepherds of Gerar.—Gen. 26:17-22.

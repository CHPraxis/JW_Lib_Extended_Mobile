EGLATH-SHELISHIYAH
(Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah) [third Eglath, or, third young cow (heifer)].
A term used by Isaiah (15:5) and Jeremiah (48:34) in their pronouncements of doom against Moab, apparently referring to a site in that nation. Some hold that there were three towns in one vicinity with the same name, and that the third (the “third Eglath,” AT), is here the target of the prophets’ utterances. A precise identification of such sites has never been made.
Many scholars, however, are of the opinion that the Hebrew (ʽegh·lathʹ sheli·shi·yahʹ) should not be transliterated as a proper noun. They view it as a symbolic expression and would translate it as “a heifer of three years old.” (Dy, JP; see AV, Ro.) In this case, the prophets might be likening vanquished Moab to a sturdy, young, though full-grown cow, but from which are heard only pitiful ‘cries’ of anguish.

TIDAL
(Tiʹdal).
The king of Goiim and an ally or vassal of Elamite King Chedorlaomer when they and two other monarchs subjugated five kings near the Dead Sea. Following twelve years of domination, the five defeated kings staged a rebellion. Tidal, Chedorlaomer and the others came W to put it down, and in doing so took spoil and captives, including Abraham’s nephew Lot. Abraham pursued the oppressors and recovered the prisoners and pillaged goods, but there is no indication that Tidal or those kings with him were captured or slain.—Gen. 14:1-17.
There are some inscriptions that possibly refer to Tidal, but none are certain. On one tablet dealing with an altogether unrelated event are found the names of all four kings, though spelled somewhat differently. Other inscriptions contain the spellings Tud-khula and Tud-ghula.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Zalʹmon) [dark, dark place].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. An Ahohite warrior of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:8-10:23:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:28-10:23:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Apparently called Ilai at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:29-13:11:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A mountain near Shechem. From Mount Zalmon, Abimelech and his forces cut wood with which to burn down the vault belonging to the city of Shechem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:48-7:9:49" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 9:48, 49</a>) As the only mountains near Shechem are Ebel and Gerizim, Zalmon was either a peak or slope of one of these, or else some other less important hill nearby.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Zalmon at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:14-19:68:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 68:14</a> presumably refers to the same place unless its being mentioned along with Bashan (vs. 15) indicates that there was some place called Zalmon E of the Jordan.</p>

SHULAMMITE
(Shuʹlam·mite).
The designation for the beautiful country girl who is the principal character of The Song of Solomon (6:13). Likely this title portrays her as from the city of Shunem (modern Solem). (Compare 1 Kings 1:3.) Lending support to this view is the fact that the Septuagint Version calls the girl the “Sunamite.” Also, the ecclesiastical writer Eusebius of the fourth century C.E. referred to Shunem as Shulem.

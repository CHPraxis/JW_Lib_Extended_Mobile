DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
The wife of one’s son. The same Hebrew (kal·lahʹ) and Greek (nymʹphe) words translated “daughter-in-law” are also rendered “bride” in certain instances. “I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”—Rev. 21:9; Song of Sol. 4:8-12; Isa. 61:10; Jer. 7:34; John 3:29; Rev. 18:23; 21:2; 22:17.
Since the father himself in patriarchal times usually arranged for the marriage of his son, his daughter-in-law was largely his own choice. (Gen. chap. 24) She was welcomed into his household, and when it moved she moved with it. (Gen. 11:31) The Mosaic law prohibited a man from having relations with his daughter-in-law under the penalty of death.—Lev. 18:15; 20:12; Ezek. 22:11.
Dispositions of daughters-in-law and their attitudes toward in-laws vary a great deal. Ruth, for example, proved a most loyal and devoted companion to her mother-in-law Naomi, more so than Orpah, saying, “Your people will be my people, and your God my God. Where you die I shall die.” (Ruth 1:6-17, 22; 4:14, 15) Esau’s Hittite wives were most disconcerting to their in-laws Isaac and Rebekah. (Gen. 26:34; 27:46) Christ Jesus foretold that the Kingdom message would separate daughters-in-law from mothers-in-law.—Matt. 10:35; Luke 12:53.

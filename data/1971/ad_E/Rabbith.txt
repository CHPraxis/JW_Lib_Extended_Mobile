RABBITH
(Rabʹbith) [possibly, multitude].
According to the Masoretic text, a site on Issachar’s boundary. (Josh. 19:17, 18, 20) It is thought to be the same as Daberath. (Josh. 19:12) Supporting this view is the fact that Vatican Manuscript No. 1209, of the fourth century C.E., has Da·bei·ronʹ in place of “Rabbith.”—See DABERATH.

MINNITH
(Minʹnith) [possibly, allotment].
One of twenty Ammonite cities that Jephthah subdued after making his vow to Jehovah. (Judg. 11:30-33) Centuries later “wheat of Minnith” is mentioned as an item of Tyre’s trade. (Ezek. 27:2, 17) The exact location of Minnith is not known. One of a number of possible identifications is Khirbet Hanizeh, about four miles (6 kilometers) NE of Heshbon.

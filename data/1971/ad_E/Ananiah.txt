ANANIAH
(A·na·niʹah) [protected by Jehovah]
1. Father of Maaseiah and grandfather to Azariah, who assisted Nehemiah in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.—Neh. 3:23.
2. A city inhabited by members of the tribe of Benjamin after the return from exile. (Neh. 11:32) It is believed to be the same as Bethany (modern el-ʽAzariyeh) about two miles (3.2 kilometers) E of Jerusalem. The name “Bethany” may mean “house of Ananiah.”—See BETHANY No. 1.

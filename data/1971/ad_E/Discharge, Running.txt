DISCHARGE, RUNNING
A Biblical expression applicable to conditions of the genital organs of men and women. (Lev. 15:2, 19, 25; Num. 5:2, 3; 2 Sam. 3:29) In the case of men, it relates to an unhealthy state, in which there was a flow of matter from the genital organ, or the organ was obstructed by such matter. (Lev. 15:2, 3) No male offspring of Aaron was permitted to eat of the “holy things” while unclean due to a running discharge.—Lev. 22:4.
The expression “running discharge” sometimes applied to a woman’s regular, normal menstrual flow. (Lev. 15:19-24) Yet it was also used to designate a diseased, extended, and thus abnormal, flow of blood. (Lev. 15:25-30) In the latter sense, it applies to the chronic “flow of blood” from which one woman suffered for twelve years before Jesus Christ cured her.—Matt. 9:20-22.
According to the Law, a person having a running discharge was unclean, made articles and persons he or she touched unclean, and so forth. After a diseased discharge ceased, the individual took specified steps for purification.—Lev. chap. 15; see CLEAN, CLEANNESS.

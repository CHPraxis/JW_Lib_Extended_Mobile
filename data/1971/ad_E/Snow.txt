SNOW
Jehovah, the Producer of this marvel, can also control snowfall. (Job 37:6; Ps. 147:16) To serve His purpose, God has stored snow and hail “for the day of fight and war.”—Job 38:22, 23.
Each descending snow crystal washes out the atmosphere and carries with it such elements as sulfur and nitrogen, thus contributing to soil fertility while supplying moisture. (Isa. 55:10, 11) Snow can be a source of clean water for washing. (Job 9:30) Though either rare or unknown in certain areas of Palestine, it sometimes falls during January and February in hill country, as at Jerusalem. (Compare 2 Samuel 23:20; 1 Chronicles 11:22.) During most of the year there is snow in the heights and ravines of the Lebanon range, lofty Mount Hermon being snowcapped nearly all year long. (Jer. 18:14) Psalm 68:14 refers to snow in Zalmon, possibly Mount Zalmon near Shechem, unless mention of Bashan in verse 15 indicates a site E of the Jordan.
ILLUSTRATIVE USE
Snow is used in Scriptural similes to help convey the idea of whiteness. (Ex. 4:6; Num. 12:10; 2 Ki. 5:27; Dan. 7:9; Matt. 28:3; Rev. 1:14) Sometimes it is associated with purity. (Isa. 1:18; Lam. 4:7) For example, David begged God to purify him from sin, washing him that he might become “whiter even than snow.”—Ps. 51:7.
Job’s three companions, being no source of true comfort to him, were likened to a winter torrent, swollen by melting ice and snow in the mountains but running dry in the heat of summer. (Job 6:15-17) Sheol is said to snatch away sinners as drought and heat do snow waters. (Job 24:19) Just as snow is unnatural and would harm crops in summer, so “glory is not fitting for a stupid one.” (Prov. 26:1) However, a faithful envoy, one who would fulfill his commission to the satisfaction of those sending him, is likened to a drink cooled with snow from the mountains and bringing refreshment on a hot day of harvest.—Prov. 25:13.

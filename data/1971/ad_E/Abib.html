<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The original name of the first lunar month of the Jewish sacred calendar and of the seventh month of the secular calendar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:4-2:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 13:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:15-2:23:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:18-2:34:18" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 34:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:1-5:16:1" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Deut. 16:1</a>) It corresponds, generally, with part of March and part of April. The name is understood to mean “ripening grain” or “green ears,” and it was during this month that the barley harvest took place, followed some weeks later by the wheat harvest. The latter or spring rains also began and these helped to bring the Jordan River to flood stage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:3:15-6:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 3:15</a>) It was designated by Jehovah as the initial month of the sacred year at the time of the exodus from Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:1-2:12:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 12:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:4-2:13:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 13:4</a>) Following the Babylonian exile this name was replaced by the name “Nisan.”—See NISAN.</p>

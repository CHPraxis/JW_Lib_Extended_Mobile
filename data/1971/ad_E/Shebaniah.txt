SHEBANIAH
(Sheb·a·niʹah).
1. A priest who played a trumpet in the procession that accompanied the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem in David’s day.—1 Chron. 15:3, 24.
2. A priestly paternal house that Joseph represented in the days of High Priest Jeshua’s successor Joiakim. (Neh. 12:12, 14) In a generally similar list of priests having returned with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. the name Shecaniah appears in the place of Shebaniah. (Neh. 12:1-7) During Nehemiah’s governorship, a member of the same family (or some individual priest of the same name) attested to the national covenant then made.—Neh. 10:1, 4, 8.
3. One of the Levites, or a representative of a Levitical family of the same name, contemporaneous with Ezra and Nehemiah, who led the Jews in a prayer of confession, after which they proposed and sealed a covenant of faithfulness.—Neh. 9:4, 5, 38; 10:1, 9, 10.
4. Another Levite who attested to the same trustworthy arrangement, either in his own name or that of a forefather.—Neh. 9:38; 10:9, 12.

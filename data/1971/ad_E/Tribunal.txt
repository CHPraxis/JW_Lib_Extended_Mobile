TRIBUNAL
A court or forum of justice. The word appears in some Bible translations at 1 Corinthians 4:3, where Paul says: “Now to me it is a very trivial matter that I should be examined by you or by a human tribunal [Gr., an·thro·piʹnes he·meʹras].” The Greek expression literally means “human day,” and is understood to refer to a set day, or day set by men for a trial or for rendering judgment.
Paul acknowledged that men, such as Apollos, Cephas and himself, in a sense belonged to or were servants of the Corinthian congregation. (1 Cor. 3:21, 22) Yet some in that congregation were criticizing and judging Paul, which attitude grew out of their sectarianism, their fleshliness rather than spirituality, their looking to men instead of to Christ. (1 Cor. 9:1-4) Paul ably defended his ministry (1 Cor. 9:5-27), setting forth the general rule or view that what a Christian should primarily be concerned about is not the judgment of men, whether by the Corinthians or in a day before some human court. Rather, Paul was concerned about the future day of judgment or evaluation by God (through Jesus), who had given Paul the stewardship to which he must prove faithful.—1 Cor. 1:8; 4:2-5; Heb. 4:13.

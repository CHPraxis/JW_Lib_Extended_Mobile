<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Any of a variety of plants with saw-edged leaves that are usually thickly covered with stinging hairs containing an irritating liquid. When touched, the tips of the hairs break off and the sharp broken ends penetrate the skin, causing the liquid to enter the wound. At least four varieties of nettles are known to exist in Palestine, the most common being the Roman nettle, which frequently attains a height of six feet (1.8 meters) and is especially found amidst ruins.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew terms <em>hha·rulʹ</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:31-20:24:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 24:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:9-36:2:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Zeph. 2:9</a>) and <em>qim·mohshʹ</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:34:13-23:34:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 34:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:9:6-28:9:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Hos. 9:6</a>) are applied to plants that take over neglected fields and ruins. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:7-18:30:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 30:7</a>, the reference to <em>hha·rulʹ</em> suggests tall plants. Another Hebrew word <em>sir·padhʹ</em> (“brier,” <em>AV;</em> “nettle,” <em>Ro;</em> “stinging nettle,” <em>NW</em>) is contrasted with myrtle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:13-23:55:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 55:13</a>) Although “nettle” would fit the context of the scriptures cited above, there is considerable uncertainty as to the exact significance of the original-language terms. Especially is this so in view of the fact that at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:31-20:24:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:31</a> a form of the word <em>qim·mohshʹ</em> (“thistles,” <em>AT;</em> “thorns,” <em>AV;</em> “weeds,” <em>NW</em>) appears in parallel with <em>hha·rulʹ.</em> Therefore some scholars think <em>qim·mohshʹ</em> denotes weeds generally; others believe that <em>hha·rulʹ</em> may be a generic term applying to brush.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The translating of <em>hha·rulʹ</em> as “nettles” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:7-18:30:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 30:7</a> has been questioned by some on the basis that people would not voluntarily seek shelter under nettles. In a waterless region, though, people might well avail themselves of the shade of tall nettles or, because of hunger, be found gathering these plants for food. So the rendering is appropriate, although, as stated, it is not certain whether this plant is actually meant.</p>

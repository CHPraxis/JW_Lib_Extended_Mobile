<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This often translates the Hebrew word <em>qa·nehʹ</em> and its Greek equivalent <em>kaʹla·mos,</em> which terms evidently embrace numerous reedlike plants commonly growing in wet places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:40:21-18:40:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 40:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:30-19:68:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 68:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:19:6-23:19:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isa. 19:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:7-23:35:7" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 35:7</a>) Some scholars believe that in many cases the “reed” intended is <em>Arundo donax</em>. This plant is common in Egypt, Palestine and Syria. Its stem, terminating in a large plume of white flowers, has a <span id="page1381" class="pageNum" data-no="1381" data-before-text="1381"></span>diameter of two or three inches (5 or 7.6 centimeters) at the base and grows to a height of eight feet (2.4 meters) or more. The leaves measure from one to three feet (.3 to. 9 meter) in length. Even in recent times this reed has been used as a measuring rod.—See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:40:3-26:40:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 40:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:40:5-26:40:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:1" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Revelation 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:15-66:21:16" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 21:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In mockery, Roman soldiers placed a reed, representative of a royal scepter, in Jesus’ right hand, and later hit him with it. Also, a reed was used to convey a sponge soaked with sour wine to the impaled Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:29-40:27:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 27:29, 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:48-40:27:48" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 48</a>; see HYSSOP.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Figuratively, “reed” is used in the Bible to represent instability and frailty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:14:15-11:14:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:29:6-26:29:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ezek. 29:6, 7</a>) Egypt was compared to a crushed reed, the sharp, pointed slivers of which would penetrate the palm of anyone leaning upon it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:21-12:18:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:36:6-23:36:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isa. 36:6</a>) Concerning John the Baptist, Jesus said: “What did you go out into the wilderness to behold? A reed being tossed by a wind?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:7-40:11:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 11:7</a>) These words may have been intended to show that John the Baptist was not a person wavering or vacillating, but firm, stable and upright. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:20-40:12:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 12:20</a> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:3-23:42:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 42:3</a>), the “bruised reed” seems to represent oppressed people like the man with the withered hand whom Jesus healed on the sabbath.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:10-40:12:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 12:10-14</a>; see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:4-40:23:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 23:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Mark 6:34</a>; CALAMUS, CANE.</p>

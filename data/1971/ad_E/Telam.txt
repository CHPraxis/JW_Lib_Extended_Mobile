TELAM
(Teʹlam).
Twelve manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint say that Tela(m) was one of the limits of the dwellings of the Geshurites, Girzites and Amalekites in David’s day. (1 Sam. 27:8) This would appear to connect Telam with Telaim referred to at 1 Samuel 15:4, and Telem in southern Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 24) At 1 Samuel 27:8, the Hebrew Masoretic text reads “from long ago,” which differs from the expression “from Telam” by only two Hebrew consonants.—See TELAIM; TELEM No. 2.

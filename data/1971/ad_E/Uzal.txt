UZAL
(Uʹzal).
1. The sixth named of Joktan’s thirteen sons, and also the tribe descended from him.—Gen. 10:26-29; 1 Chron. 1:21.
2. A place referred to in connection with Tyre’s traders, at Ezekiel 27:19. According to an Arabic tradition, Uzal, or Auzal, was a former name for the centrally located Yemenite capital Sanʼa. An alternate suggestion is Azalla, a town near Medina, about halfway between Sanʼa and the Gulf of Aqabah.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As noted under the heading BLASPHEMY, the original Greek word <em>bla·sphe·miʹa</em> has a broader meaning than the present English word “blasphemy.” The <em>Greek-English Lexicon</em> of Liddell and Scott shows that <em>bla·sphe·miʹa</em> and the verb <em>bla·sphe·meʹo</em> basically indicate “defamatory, calumnious, abusive language.” In English, only when such speech is directed against God, not against his creatures, is it properly termed “blasphemy.” Concerning this, <em>The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia</em> (Vol. I, p. 291, col. 2, sec. 1, par. 3) says: “Our English translators [that is, primarily those of the <em>AV</em>] have not adhered to the right use of the term. They employ it with the same latitude as the Greek; but it is generally easy to perceive, from the connection and subject of a passage, whether <em>blasphemy,</em> properly so called, be meant, or only defamation.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thus, while the <em>Authorized Version</em> uses “blasphemy” and “blasphemed” in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:6-44:18:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 18:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:1-54:6:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 6:1</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:5-56:2:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Titus 2:5</a>, later translations say “slander,” “abusive talk [or ‘speech’],” “reviled,” “defamed,” “abused,” “speak abusively of,” and similar expressions. (See <em>RS, AT, NW</em>, and others.) The <em>Authorized Version,</em> however, does recognize this distinction elsewhere in the Greek Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As the following texts and surrounding verses show, abusive speech was directed against Christ at the time of his impalement by passersby, who said, “Bah! You would-be thrower-down of the temple and builder of it in three days’ time, save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.” Similar words came from one of the evildoers alongside. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:29-41:15:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 15:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:39-40:27:40" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt 27:39, 40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:39-42:23:39" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Luke 23:39</a>) Paul and his fellow Christians were objects of such speech by those who falsely construed their purpose, message and Christian conscience (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:6-44:18:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 18:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:8-45:3:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rom. 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:16-45:14:16" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 14:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:13-46:4:13" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:30-46:10:30" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 10:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:4-60:4:4" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:4</a>), yet they themselves were to “speak injuriously of no one,” and by their conduct gave no true grounds for their work or message to be spoken of abusively. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 4:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Col. 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:1-54:6:1" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:5-56:2:5" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Titus 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:2-56:3:2" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 3:2</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:2-61:2:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:2</a>.) Even the angels “do not bring . . . an accusation in abusive terms, not doing so out of respect for Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:11-61:2:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:11</a>) But such talk <em>can</em> be expected from those who indulge in loose conduct, those who are proud and mentally diseased over questionings and debates, and those who disregard or disrespect God’s appointments.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:4-54:6:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:10-61:2:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:8-65:1:10" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Jude 8-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The word <em>ga·dhaphʹ</em> is used in a corresponding way in the Hebrew Scriptures. Basically meaning “to hack” or “to cut,” it is used metaphorically to mean “to cut with reproachful words.” It is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:30-4:15:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Numbers 15:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:6-12:19:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 19:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:22-12:19:22" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:44:16-19:44:16" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Psalm 44:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:6-23:37:6" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Isaiah 37:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:23-23:37:23" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> 23</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:27-26:20:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel 20:27</a>. Two other related words are found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:28-23:43:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:51:7-23:51:7" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 51:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:5:15-26:5:15" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 5:15</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:8-36:2:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:8</a>. In all these cases harsh or coarse speech is indicated, directed against either Jehovah God himself or his people. A study of the context makes clear the nature of such “abusive speech.”—See EXECRATION; MALEDICTION; REVILING.</p>

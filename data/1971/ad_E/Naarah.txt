NAARAH
(Naʹa·rah) [girl].
1. A wife of the Judean Ashhur by whom he had four sons.—1 Chron. 4:1, 5, 6.
2. A city on the boundary of Ephraim (Josh. 16:5, 7) thought to be the same as Naaran. (1 Chron. 7:28) Naarah is generally considered to correspond to the No·o·rathʹ of Eusebius’ Onomasticon. Josephus seemingly calls this site Ne·a·raʹ. He relates that half of its waters were diverted to irrigate the palms near Archelaus’ palace at Jericho. (Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, chap. XIII, par. 1) It has been identified with Khirbet el-ʽAyash, some six and a half miles (10.5 kilometers) N-NE of Roman Jericho (Tulul Abu el-ʽAlayiq).

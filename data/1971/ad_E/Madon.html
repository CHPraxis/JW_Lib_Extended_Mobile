<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A royal Canaanite city that leagued itself with Hazor against the Israelites and was subsequently defeated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:1-6:11:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 11:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:19-6:12:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12:19</a>) Madon is usually identified with Qarn Hattin, about five and a half miles (9 kilometers) NW of Tiberias. Khirbet Madin, about half a mile (.8 kilometer) to the S, seems to preserve the ancient name “Madon.” However, some geographers question the identification.</p>

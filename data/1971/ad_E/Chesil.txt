CHESIL
(Cheʹsil) [stupidity].
The name of a town appearing in the list of places within the territory of Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 30) A comparison of Joshua 15:30 with Joshua 19:4 and 1 Chronicles 4:30 indicates that Chesil may be the same as Bethuel, perhaps being an uncomplimentary name applied to the place because of idolatrous practices carried on there. Some lexicographers view “Chesil” as a copyist’s error.—See BETHUEL NO. 2.

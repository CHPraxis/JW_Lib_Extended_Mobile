<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The words “abomination,” “abominable,” and “abominably” are used in the <em>Authorized Version</em> in translating eight Hebrew words and four Greek words. Later translations are usually more specific in rendering the original words, and this is helpful since the word “abomination” is rather broad in meaning and is drifting into disuse in everyday speech.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The words most frequently translated as “abomination” or “abominable” in the <em>Authorized Version</em> are <em>ta·ʽavʹ</em> and <em>toh·ʽe·vahʹ.</em> These are considered under the heading DETESTABLE THING.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>ba·ʼashʹ</em> is translated once as “abomination” in the <em>Authorized Version</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:4-9:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Samuel 13:4</a>. It there describes the effect of Saul’s attack on the Philistines, and the <em>Authorized Version</em> says that the Israelites were “had in abomination with the Philistines.” Other translations use the words “odious” (<em>RS</em>), “bad odor” (<em>AT</em>), or “foul-smelling’’ (<em>NW</em>), and the marginal reading in the <em>Authorized Version</em> says “did stink.” This is more in harmony with the basic meaning of <em>ba·ʼashʹ,</em> which literally means “to stink,” though it is often used in a metaphorical sense, as in the above text, to indicate that one has become odious to another or others because of his actions.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:30-1:34:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 34:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:5:21-2:5:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ex. 5:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:27:12-9:27:12" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Sam. 27:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:6-10:10:6" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 2 Sam. 10:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:16:21-10:16:21" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 16:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:19:6-13:19:6" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> 1 Chron. 19:6</a>; for its literal usage, see <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:18-2:7:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 7:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:21-2:7:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:8:14-2:8:14" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 8:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:16:20-2:16:24" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 16:20-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:5-19:38:5" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Psalm 38:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:10:1-21:10:1" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 10:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:2-23:50:2" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> Isaiah 50:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the <em>Authorized Version</em> the word <em>za·ʽamʹ</em> is also translated just once as “abominable” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:10-33:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 6:10</a>, but the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> here has “accursed.” It literally means “to foam” and is used in Hebrew to mean “to be angry, indignant; to curse.” In other texts the <em>Authorized Version</em> translates it with “abhor,” “abhorred,” “be angry with,” “curse,” and “indignation.” In the <em>New World Translation za·ʽamʹ</em> is uniformly translated with the words “denounce,” “denounced,” and “denunciation(s).”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:23:7-4:23:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Num. 23:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:11-19:7:11" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Ps. 7:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:14-20:22:14" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Prov. 22:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:24-20:24:24" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 24:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:25:23-20:25:23" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 25:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:14-23:66:14" data-bid="5-6" class="b"> Isa. 66:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:30-27:11:30" data-bid="5-7" class="b"> Dan. 11:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:12-38:1:12" data-bid="5-8" class="b"> Zech. 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:4-39:1:4" data-bid="5-9" class="b"> Mal. 1:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Pig·gulʹ</em> occurs only four times in the Hebrew Scriptures and is regularly translated in the <em>Authorized Version</em> as “abomination” or “abominable,” but it has the basic meaning of “impure,” “fetid,” or “foul.” At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:18-3:7:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Leviticus 7:18 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:7-3:19:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 19:7</a> <em>pig·gulʹ</em> is used to describe the meat of a sacrificial offering that was left after three days from the time of its being offered. The <em>Authorized Version</em> says the Israelites were instructed by God to consider such flesh as an “abomination,” but <em>An American Translation</em> here uses the word “refuse,” and the <em>New World Translation</em> says “a foul thing.”—See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:4-23:65:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:4 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:14-26:4:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 4:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The three related Hebrew words <em>sha·qatsʹ, sheʹqets</em> and <em>shiq·qutsʹ,</em> generally translated “abomination(s)” or “abominable” in the <em>Authorized Version,</em> basically refer to that which is “disgusting” and are considered under the heading DISGUSTING THING.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the Greek Scriptures the word <em>a·theʹmi·tos</em> is translated “abominable” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:3-60:4:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:3</a> in the <em>Authorized Version</em> but is correctly rendered “lawless” in the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> and “illegal” in the <em>New World Translation</em>.—Compare its use at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:28-44:10:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 10:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The related words <em>bde·lysʹso, bdeʹlyg·ma</em> and <em>bde·ly·ktosʹ</em> come from a Greek word meaning “to stink,” and imply “disgust.” The word <em>bdeʹlyg·ma</em> is used in the expression “abomination [<em>bdeʹlyg·ma</em>] of desolation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:15</a>, <em>AV</em>) This word is also dealt with under the heading DISGUSTING THING.</p>

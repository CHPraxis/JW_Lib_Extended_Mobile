RAMOTH
(Raʹmoth) [high places, height].
1. A Levitical city in the territory of Issachar. (1 Chron. 6:71-73) It is apparently the same as Remeth and Jarmuth (No. 2). (Josh. 19:17, 21; 21:27-29) Ramoth’s situation is sometimes tentatively located at Kokab el-Hawa, on a tableland about seven miles (11 kilometers) N of Beth-shean.
2. “Ramoth of the south” at 1 Samuel 30:27 apparently refers to the “Baalath-beer, Ramah of the south” mentioned at Joshua 19:1, 8. Its location was evidently in the Negeb.—See BAALATH-BEER.

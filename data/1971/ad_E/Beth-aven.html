<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-aʹven) [house of nothingness or idolatry].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A town in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, close by the ancient city of Ai. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:2-6:7:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 7:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:11-6:18:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18:11, 12</a>) It was in the wilderness, located E of Bethel and W of Michmash, and became involved in an outstanding battle when Saul and Jonathan routed the Philistines from this latter city.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:5-9:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:23-9:14:23" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. In lamenting the idolatrous conditions to which Israel had turned in his time, the prophet Hosea mentions Beth-aven together with Gibeah and Ramah, other prominent cities of Benjamin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:15-28:4:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hos. 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:5:8-28:5:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:5-28:10:5" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:10:8-28:10:8" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 8</a>) However, it appears that the prophet does not refer to the original town of Beth-aven, but, rather, applies the name in a derogatory sense to the city of Bethel, which at one time had been a ‘house of God’ but had now become a ‘house of idolatry’ due to the calf worship instituted there.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:12:28-11:12:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:28-30</a>.</p>

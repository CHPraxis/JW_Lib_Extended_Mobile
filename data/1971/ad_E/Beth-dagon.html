<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-daʹgon) [house of Dagon].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A town in the allotment of territory assigned to the tribe of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:21-6:15:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:41-6:15:41" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 41</a>) Although it is listed along with other towns of the Shephelah or lowlands region, the suggested location is on the Plains of Philistia at Khirbet Dajun, a short distance SW of modern Beit Dagan and about six miles (10 kilometers) SE of Jaffa. In this regard, it may be noted that other cities of the Philistine plain are listed in subsequent verses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:45-6:15:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 15:45-47</a>) Such location would make it an enclave city within the territory of Dan, as was also apparently the case with Gederah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:36-6:15:36" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 15:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A town in the territory of Asher, evidently in the eastern part thereof and near its border with Zebulun. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:24-6:19:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Josh. 19:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:27-6:19:27" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Identification is uncertain; Jelamet el-Atiqa, at the foot of the Mount Carmel range and about eight miles (13 kilometers) SE of Haifa, is suggested by some.</p>

BELIAL
(Beʹli·al) [worthlessness; a compound of beliʹ “not, without,” and yaʽalʹ, “worth, use, profit”].
The quality or state of being useless, base, good-for-nothing. The Hebrew term beli·yaʹʽal is applied to ideas, words and counsel (Deut. 15:9; Ps. 101:3; Nah. 1:11), to circumstances (Ps. 41:8), and, most frequently, to good-for-nothing men of the lowest sort. For example, men who induce worship of other gods (Deut. 13:13); those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah (Judg. 19:22-27; 20:13); the wicked sons of Eli (1 Sam. 2:12); insolent Nabal (1 Sam. 25:17, 25); opposers of God’s anointed, David (2 Sam. 20:1; 22:5; 23:6; Ps. 18:4); Rehoboam’s unsteady associates (2 Chron. 13:7); Jezebel’s conspirators against Naboth (1 Ki. 21:10, 13); and men in general who stir up contention. (Prov. 6:12-14; 16:27; 19:28) There will be a complete end of such creatures, for Jehovah promises: “No more will any good-for-nothing person pass again through you. In his entirety he will certainly be cut off.”—Nah. 1:15; see also 1 Samuel 1:16; 10:27; 30:22; Job 34:18.
By the time Bible writing resumed in the first century, “Belial” was used as a name for Satan. So when Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 6:15 in his series of parallel contrasts, “what harmony is there between Christ and Belial?” the conclusion usually drawn is that “Belial” is Satan; the Syriac Peshitta so translates the passage.

GILBOA
(Gil·boʹa).
A “mountain” traditionally identified with Jebel Fuquʽah, a crescent-shaped ridge of limestone hills lying E of the Plain of Esdraelon and extending first SE and then S. Ravines divide the range into several plateaus. Much of it is barren rock, with rugged channels in the northern and western parts, where chalk has been eroded. But wheat and barley are cultivated on the gradual western slopes. Also, pastureland, as well as fig and olive trees, can be found there. The northern side is the steepest and highest, rising to about 1,700 feet (518 meters) above sea level. The ancient name “Gilboa” seems to be preserved in the name of the village Jelbun, located on its southern slope, about six miles (10 kilometers) SW of Beth-shean.
Because of its strategic location E of the fertile plain of Esdraelon between the river Kishon and the Jordan valley, Gilboa figured in at least two major battles. At the “well of Harod,” commonly linked with the spring located on the NW spur of “Gilboa,” Gideon and his men encamped. (Judg. 7:1) Later, King Saul gathered his forces to Gilboa, and there suffered defeat at the hands of the Philistines. Three of his sons, Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchi-shua, were slain, and he himself committed suicide there.—1 Sam. 28:4; 31:1-4, 8; 2 Sam. 1:4-10, 21; 1 Chron. 10:1-8.

WORMWOOD
This designates many, frequently somewhat woody plants having an intensely bitter taste and a strong aromatic odor. Several varieties of wormwood are found in Palestine, particularly in desert areas. In Scripture, wormwood is compared with the aftereffects of immorality (Prov. 5:4) and the bitter experience that was to come and did come upon Judah and Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians. (Jer. 9:15; 23:15; Lam. 3:15, 19) It also represents injustice and unrighteousness (Amos 5:7; 6:12) and is used with reference to apostates. (Deut. 29:18) At Revelation 8:11, wormwood denotes a bitter and poisonous substance.

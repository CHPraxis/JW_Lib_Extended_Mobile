BETH-SHITTAH
(Beth-shitʹtah) [house of the acacia].
A town mentioned in describing the line of flight followed by the Midianites after their rout in the low plain of Jezreel by Judge Gideon. (Judg. 7:22) Since the Midianites were heading for the region of the Jordan, Beth-shittah must be located somewhere to the E or SE of the hill of Moreh and the well of Harod, in which vicinity the battle took place. (Judg. 7:l) Shattah, about three miles (5 kilometers) E of modern ʽEn-Harod, is suggested by some as the likely location and one giving evidence of the original name. Others consider it too near to the scene of the battle and recommend a location more to the SE, though offering no definite identification.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The powerful Amorite king of Bashan (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:19-11:4:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:19</a>) whom the Israelites defeated before crossing into the Promised Land. Og was one of the giant Rephaim. In fact, his immense iron bier (perhaps a sarcophagus, or possibly a bed frame) measured some 13 feet by 6 feet (3.9 by 1.8 meters). He and Sihon ruled the Amorites E of the Jordan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:11-5:3:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 3:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:13-5:3:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:46-5:4:47" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 4:46, 47</a>) The domain of Og extended from Mount Hermon to the Jabbok River, territory E of the Jordan that included sixty fortified cities and numerous rural towns.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The defeat of Og at the hands of Israel came toward the end of Israel’s forty-year wandering, just before they encamped on the plains of Moab. After defeating Sihon, Israel clashed with Og’s forces at Edrei and, in an overwhelming God-given victory, killed off Og and all his army and took possession of his cities and towns. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:33-4:22:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 21:33–22:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:3:1-5:3:13" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 3:1-13</a>) Og’s territory became part of Manasseh’s inheritance.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:2:10-6:2:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 2:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:9-6:9:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 9:9, 10</a>) The victory was a great encouragement to Israel and was remembered even many centuries later.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:4-5:31:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 31:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:22-16:9:22" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:10-19:135:12" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ps. 135:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:17-19:136:22" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 136:17-22</a>.</p>

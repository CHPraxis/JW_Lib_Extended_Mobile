JEHOVAH-JIREH
(Je·hoʹvah-jiʹreh) [Jehovah will see to (it), or, Jehovah will provide].
A place on one of the mountains in the land of Moriah where Abraham found a ram caught in a thicket and subsequently offered it instead of Isaac. Abraham viewed this ram as Jehovah’s provision and therefore named the place Jehovah-jireh.—Gen. 22:2, 13, 14.

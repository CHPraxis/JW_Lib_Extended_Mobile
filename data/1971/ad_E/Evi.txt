EVI
(Eʹvi) [possibly, desire].
One of the five Midianite kings or chieftains who were put to death at the time Israel’s army fought under Moses in executing Jehovah’s vengeance upon Midian for seducing Israel to attach itself to the Baal of Peor. These Midianite kings were dukes, allies or vassals of Sihon king of the Amorites. Their territory was given to the tribe of Reuben.—Num. 25:17, 18; 31:8; Josh. 13:15, 21.

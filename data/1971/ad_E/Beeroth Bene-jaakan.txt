BEEROTH BENE-JAAKAN
(Be·erʹoth Benʹe-jaʹa-kan) [wells of the sons of Jaakan].
A place at which the Israelites camped perhaps more than once during their wanderings in the wilderness, the last time being shortly before Aaron’s death on Mount Hor. (Deut. 10:6) It is tentatively identified with el-Birein, about forty miles (approximately 65 kilometers) SW of Beer-sheba. There are wells here and the probable location of Kadesh-barnea is but a few miles S. Archaeologist Nelson Glueck comments that there are a “strikingly large number of antiquity sites in this district.” (Rivers in the Desert, p. 97) Beeroth Bene-jaakan is evidently referred to as simply Bene-jaakan at Numbers 33:31.—See BENE-JAAKAN.

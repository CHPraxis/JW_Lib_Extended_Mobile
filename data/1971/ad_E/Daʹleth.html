<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[====].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The fourth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, as a number it denoted four. In sound it corresponds generally to our English “d.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There is considerable similarity between the letters <em>daʹleth</em> [====] and <em>rehsh</em> [====], allowing for possible scribal errors in copying. This may account for various differences in spelling, such as that of the “Rodanim” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:7-13:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 1:7</a> and the “Dodanim” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:4-1:10:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 10:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Hebrew, this fourth letter is used as the initial letter in the first word of each of the eight verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:25-19:119:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:25-32</a>.—See ALPHABET.</p>

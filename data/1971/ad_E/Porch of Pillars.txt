PORCH OF PILLARS
One of the official buildings Solomon constructed in the temple area sometime after he completed the temple. (1 Ki. 7:1, 6) In view of the mention of the Porch of Pillars between comments about the House of the Forest of Lebanon and the Porch of the Throne, it is quite possible that the Porch of Pillars was S of the temple and between these other two official buildings. Thus, one coming from the S might pass through or around the House of the Forest of Lebanon and then enter the Porch of Pillars, walking through it into the Porch of the Throne.
Discussing these buildings, the Cyclopœdia by M’Clintock and Strong (Vol. VII, p. 541) observes: “There are few tasks more difficult or puzzling than the attempt to restore an ancient building of which we possess nothing but two verbal descriptions.” Hence, at best only a suggested description of the Porch of Pillars can be made, and this is based on 1 Kings 7:6, for the information Josephus gives is scanty and obscure.
The building was 50 cubits (c. 73 feet or 22 meters) long and 30 cubits (c. 44 feet or 13 meters) wide. Its very name suggests that it was made up of rows of impressive pillars. First Kings 7:6 mentions another porch in front with pillars and a canopy. Perhaps this means that one first came to a porch having an extending canopy supported by pillars. Then this porch merged right into the Porch of Pillars proper. If the dimensions given apply just to the Porch of Pillars, then the size of the canopied portion is not given.
This building may have served as a grand entranceway to the Porch of the Throne and as a place where the king conducted the ordinary business of the kingdom and received some visitors.

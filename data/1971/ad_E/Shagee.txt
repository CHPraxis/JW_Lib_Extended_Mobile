SHAGEE
(Shaʹgee).
A Hararite whose son Jonathan was one of David’s mighty men. (1 Chron. 11:26, 34) The parallel passage at 2 Samuel 23:32, 33 reads, “Jonathan, Shammah the Hararite.” It is usually agreed that the words “son of” have somehow been lost, which, if supplied, would make the text read “Jonathan [the son of] Shammah the Hararite,” Shammah apparently being an alternate name for Shagee.

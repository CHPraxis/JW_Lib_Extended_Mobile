<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An inhabitant of the Philistine city of Ashdod. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:3-6:13:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 13:3</a>) Like the other Philistines, they were descendants of Ham through Mizraim and Casluhim, reaching Canaan apparently from the island of Crete.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:6-1:10:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 10:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:13-1:10:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:9:7-30:9:7" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Amos 9:7</a>; see ASHDOD; PHILISTIA, PHILISTINES.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:24-16:13:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:24</a> the term “Ashdodite” is also applied to their language. Whether they were still speaking the ancient Philistine language or a dialect resulting from centuries of foreign domination cannot be determined, in view of the absence of any record of their speech.</p>

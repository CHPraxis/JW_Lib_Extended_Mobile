CLEOPAS
(Cleʹo·pas) [renowned father, perhaps a contraction of Cleopatros].
One of the two disciples, neither of whom were apostles, who traveled to Emmaus on Jesus’ resurrection day. When Jesus joined them as a stranger and asked what they were debating, Cleopas replied: “Are you dwelling as an alien by yourself in Jerusalem and so do not know the things that have occurred in her in these days?” After Jesus explained many scriptures to them and then identified himself, Cleopas and his companion, instead of staying overnight in Emmaus, hastened back to Jerusalem and reported these things to the others. (Luke 24:13-35) This Greek name Cleopas should not be confused with the Aramaic name Clopas.—John 19:25.

SHUNEM
(Shuʹnem).
A city in the territory of Issachar (Josh. 19:17, 18) and not far from Jezreel and Mount Gilboa. (1 Sam. 28:4) Shunem is linked with modern Solem on the SW slope of Nebi Dahi and overlooking the low plain of Jezreel. The place lies about three miles (5 kilometers) N of Zerʽin (Jezreel) and some five miles (8 kilometers) N of the western end of the traditional site of Mount Gilboa.
It was at Shunem that the Philistines encamped before the battle that resulted in the death of King Saul. (1 Sam. 28:4) From Shunem came the beautiful Abishag (“the Shunammite”) who cared for aged King David (1 Ki. 1:3, 4) and, later, the prophet Elisha often lodged in the home of a hospitable couple there. (2 Ki. 4:8) It is believed that Shunem is referred to in an inscription of Thutmose III, the Tell el-Amarna tablets and an inscription of Sheshonk I (Shishak).

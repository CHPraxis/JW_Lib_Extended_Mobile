PREFECT
An official lower than a satrap in the Babylonian government. The title is used at Daniel 2:48 in conjunction with the “wise men.” It seems that these “wise men” were classed as to their official functions. Daniel, besides being one of the three high officials of Nebuchadnezzar, was appointed chief prefect over all the “wise men.”—Dan. 2:48; 3:2, 3, 27.
Under the rule of King Darius the Mede, the royal officials entered before Darius “as a throng,” indicating that a goodly number were involved, and said that all the officials, including the prefects, recommended the making of a law limiting petitions to the king only, for thirty days. Daniel continued to petition Jehovah, and was delivered, the conspirators themselves suffering death in the lion’s pit.—Dan. 6:6, 7, 24.

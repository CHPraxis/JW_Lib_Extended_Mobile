<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A term taken from several original-language words and variously translated to mean either a specific or a general area.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:14-16:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:14-16</a> reference is made to the ‘districts’ of Beth-haccherem, Mizpah and Beth-zur. Commentators have expressed the view that “district” may here be used as an official governmental term, that is, that each Persian “jurisdictional district” or “province” (1:3; <em>AV, RS</em>) was partitioned into smaller administrative districts. According to this opinion, the references to half of the district of Jerusalem (3:9, 12) and of Keilah (vss. 17, 18) mean that, for geographical or other reasons, the districts in which these cities stood were divided into two sections. Some hold that the Hebrew <em>peʹlekh</em> (translated “district”) may, like the related Assyrian term (<em>pilku</em>), in the case of Jerusalem and Keilah, refer simply to an “assigned portion.” The “prince” or “ruler” of the half district (<em>AS, AT, AV, JB</em>) would thus refer to an overseer who had charge of the work in that portion of the town.</p>

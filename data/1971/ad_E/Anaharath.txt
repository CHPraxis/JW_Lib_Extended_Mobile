ANAHARATH
(A·na·haʹrath) [narrow way, pass].
A city of the tribe of Issachar. (Josh. 19:18, 19) It has been identified with en-Naʽurah, about five and a half miles (8.8 kilometers) NE of Jezreel, in the eastern part of the Plain of Esdraelon. Anaharath is also mentioned in the ancient records of places captured by Thutmose III, as well as Amenhotep II on his second campaign. It apparently lay near the “Via Maris” in the important section leading back to the sea of Chinnereth.

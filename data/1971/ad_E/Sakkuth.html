<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Sakʹkuth) [booth; literally, <em>Sik·kuthʹ</em> (according to the Masoretic text), the name being purposely vocalized to correspond with the Hebrew word <em>shiq·qutsʹ</em> (disgusting thing)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Possibly an astral deity, as suggested by the fact that “Sakkuth” is put in a parallelism with the phrase “the star of your god.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:26-30:5:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 5:26</a>) Perhaps Sakkuth is to be identified with “Sakkut,” this being the Babylonian designation <span id="page1432" class="pageNum" data-no="1432" data-before-text="1432"></span>for Saturn (a star god). However, in the <em>Septuagint Version</em> the expression “Sakkuth your king” reads “the tent of Moloch,” and Stephen, who probably quoted the <em>Septuagint,</em> also used the words “the tent of Moloch.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:43-44:7:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 7:43</a>) This suggests that “Sakkuth” may be understood as denoting a portable shrine, a tent or booth, in which the idol image of Moloch was housed.—See ASTROLOGERS.</p>

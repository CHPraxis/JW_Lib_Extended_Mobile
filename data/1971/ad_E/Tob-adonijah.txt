TOB-ADONIJAH
(Tob-ad·o·niʹjah) [good is Lord Jehovah].
One of the Levites whom Jehoshaphat, in the third year of his reign, sent out to teach Jehovah’s law in the cities of Judah. (2 Chron. 17:7-9) Reference to Adonijah and Tobijah in the same verse leads some scholars to believe this name is a scribal dittograph, that is, an inadvertent repetition.

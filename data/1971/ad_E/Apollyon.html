<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(A·polʹly·on).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greek name used by the apostle John to translate the Hebrew “Abaddon” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:11-66:9:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 9:11</a>. Apollyon means “Destroyer,” and is given as the name of the “angel of the abyss.” Though most reference works apply this name to some evil personage or force, the whole setting of the apocalyptic vision is to the contrary, as it consistently portrays angels being used by God to bring woes upon His enemies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The use of the related verb <em>a·polʹly·mi</em> illustrates this, as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:12-59:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 4:12</a>, which says of God: “One there is that is lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to <em>destroy.”</em> (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 10:28</a>.) The unclean spirit cast out of a man by Jesus in a synagogue at Capernaum acknowledged Jesus as God’s agent and said: “What have we to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Did you come to <em>destroy</em> us?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:24-41:1:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 1:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:34-42:4:34" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 4:34</a>) Jesus warned unrepentant opposers among his listeners of the danger of being destroyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:3-42:13:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 13:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:16-42:20:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20:16</a>) These and other texts point to the glorified Christ Jesus as the one most likely referred to by this title.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:31-42:8:31" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 8:31</a>; see ABADDON.</p>

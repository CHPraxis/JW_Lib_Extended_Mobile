BRAZIER
Generally, a heating device consisting of a panlike receptacle elevated off the ground by means of legs and designed for holding burning coals or charcoal. The Hebrew word rendered brazier (ʼahh) is thought to be of Egyptian origin, suggesting that the brazier itself may have been an innovation from Egypt.
It appears that in the better homes the brazier was preferred to a depression in the floor of the house, in which a fire could be built. King Jehoiakim had a brazier, likely one made of metal, in his winter house.—Jer. 36:22, 23.
Some suggest that the brazier was a pitcherlike container placed in a depression in the center of the floor. In more recent times such an arrangement for heating has been used in the Middle East. After the fire goes out in the container, a tablelike frame is placed over it and this frame is, in turn, covered by a carpet. Those desiring to warm themselves stick their feet and legs and sometimes the lower part of their body under the carpet.

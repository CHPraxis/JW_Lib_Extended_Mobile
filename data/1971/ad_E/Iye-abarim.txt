IYE-ABARIM
(Iʹye-abʹa·rim) [Iyim (heaps, ruins) of the Abarim (borderland, regions beyond); hence called simply “Iyim” at Numbers 33:45].
One of Israel’s wilderness encampments. Its exact location is uncertain, but it was evidently on the southern border of Moab and near the torrent valley of Zered. (Num. 21:11, 12; 33:44) Perhaps Iye-abarim marked the southernmost point of the Abarim region.—Num. 33:47, 48; see ABARIM.

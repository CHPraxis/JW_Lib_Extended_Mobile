UNCLE
The Hebrew term dohdh, at times rendered “uncle” or “father’s brother” (Lev. 10:4; 20:20; 25:49; Num. 36:11; 1 Sam. 10:14-16; 14:50; Esther 2:7, 15; Jer. 32:7-9, 12; Amos 6:10), is much broader in its application than the English word “uncle.” It not only applies to a kinsman, usually the father’s brother, but can also denote (in the singular or plural) “love” (Prov. 7:18), expressions of endearment or of love (Song of Sol. 1:2, 4; Ezek. 16:8; 23:17) and a dear one or loved one. (Song of Sol. 1:14, 16; Isa. 5:1) The context or other related scriptures, however, often establish the family relationship designated by the Hebrew word dohdh. For example, dohdh is used to describe the relationship of King Jehoiachin to King Zedekiah. Since Zedekiah was the brother of Jehoiachin’s father Jehoiakim, the word dohdh in this case obviously designates an uncle or a father’s brother. (2 Ki. 24:6, 15, 17; 1 Chron. 3:15) A different family relationship is described at 1 Chronicles 27:32, where the counselor Jonathan is said to be David’s dohdh. Second Samuel 21:21 and 1 Chronicles 20:7 indicate that Jonathan was the son of David’s brother Shimei. Accordingly, the reference to David’s dohdh must be to David’s nephew and not to his uncle.
The feminine form of dohdh is used for one’s aunt. (Ex. 6:20; Lev. 18:14; 20:20) An uncle on the mother’s side of the family is designated in Hebrew by the expression “mother’s brother.”—Gen. 29:10.
The “son of Paul’s sister” revealed to Paul and then to the Roman commander of Jerusalem the plot that had been hatched against his uncle’s life.—Acts 23:16-22.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A prince, able administrator, and the son of Abda. Adoniram served as overseer of those conscripted for forced labor during the reigns of David, Solomon and Rehoboam, playing an important part in Solomon’s many building projects. Later, when the ten tribes revolted against the harsh dictates of Rehoboam at Shechem in 997 B.C.E., the king sent this conscriptor for forced labor to the people, but they “pelted him with stones, so that he died.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:10:18-14:10:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron 10:18</a>) He is variously referred to as Adoniram (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:4:6-11:4:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:5:14-11:5:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:14</a>), Adoram (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:20:24-10:20:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 20:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:12:18-11:12:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 12:18</a>) and as Hadoram.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:10:18-14:10:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 10:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. One of the headmen of the tribe of Benjamin who at one time lived in Jerusalem.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:15-13:8:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 8:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:28-13:8:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A city on the southern border of Canaan, whose king attacked Israel as they approached Canaan. The Israelites devoted the district to destruction and called it “Hormah,” meaning “ban.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:1-4:21:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 21:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:40-4:33:40" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 33:40</a>) They did not then settle there, however, and evidently some of the inhabitants escaped destruction. Hence, the king of Arad is included in the list of thirty-one kings later vanquished in Joshua’s whirlwind campaign. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:14-6:12:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 12:14</a>) The Kenites later settled in the wilderness area to the S of Arad.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:16-7:1:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judg. 1:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The site is identified with Tell ʽArad, one of the most imposing mounds in the Negeb region. It lies on a somewhat rolling plain about twenty-two and a half miles (36 kilometers) E-NE of Beer-sheba. It is one of the few sites in the Negeb that have retained their same names for the past three thousand years.</p>

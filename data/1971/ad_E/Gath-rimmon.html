<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A city of Dan (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:40-6:19:41" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:40, 41,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:45-6:19:45" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 45</a>) assigned to the Kohathite Levites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:20-6:21:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 21:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:23-6:21:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:66-13:6:70" data-bid="3-1" class="b">First Chronicles 6:66-70</a> appears to make Gath-rimmon an <em>Ephraimite</em> city. However, on the basis of the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:23-6:21:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 21:23, 24</a>, Hebrew scholars believe that, due to scribal error, a portion of the text has accidentally dropped out and been lost. So, they suggest inserting the following (corresponding to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:23-6:21:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 21:23</a>) before <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:69-13:6:69" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:69</a>: “And from the tribe of Dan, Elteke and its pasture ground, Gibbethon and its pasture ground . . . ” This could have been the original reading. However, not to be overlooked is the possibility that Gath-rimmon was a Danite enclave city located within Ephraim’s territory.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Gath-rimmon is usually identified with Tell ej-Jerisheh, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) NE of modern Tel Aviv.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. A city of Manasseh, given to the Kohathite Levites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:20-6:21:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 21:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:25-6:21:25" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 25</a>) Since the similar account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:70-13:6:70" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:70</a> has “Bileam,” many scholars believe this latter name originally appeared in place of Gath-rimmon at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:25-6:21:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joshua 21:25</a>.—See BILEAM; IBLEAM.</p>

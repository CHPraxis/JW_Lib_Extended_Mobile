<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Peʹleg) [division; stream].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A son of Eber and father of Reu in the line from Shem to Abraham, and therefore an early ancestor of Jesus. Peleg lived 239 years (2269-2030 B.C.E.) and founded one of the seventy post-Flood families.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:16-1:11:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 11:16-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:24-13:1:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:24-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:35-42:3:35" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 3:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Peleg was so named, for “in his days the earth was divided.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:25-1:10:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 10:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:19-13:1:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:19</a>) The text of these passages does not say that this notable division came at Peleg’s birth a hundred years after the Deluge, but simply “in his days.” If the name was given him at birth, its bestowal was possibly prophetic of the scattering that stemmed from the confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 11:1-9</a>; compare the name Noah (meaning “rest”) which also proved to be prophetic, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:29-1:5:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 5:29</a>.</p>

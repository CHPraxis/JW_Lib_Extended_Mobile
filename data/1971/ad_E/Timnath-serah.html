<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The city given to Joshua as his inheritance in the mountainous region of Ephraim. He requested Timnath-serah and the sons of Israel gave it to him “at the order of Jehovah.” Joshua built up the city and was later buried there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:49-6:19:50" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:49, 50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:30-6:24:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24:30</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:9-7:2:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judges 2:9</a> reads “Timnath-heres” instead of “Timnath-serah” in both the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Greek <em>Septuagint.</em> The reason for this difference in names is unknown.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Currently geographers prefer to identify Timnath-serah with Khirbet Tibneh, about eighteen miles (29 kilometers) S-SW of the probable ancient site of Shechem. Situated on the western edge of the mountainous region, Khirbet Tibneh overlooks the coastal plain. Mount Gaash, S of Timnath-serah (Timnath-heres) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:30-6:24:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 24:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:9-7:2:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Judg. 2:9</a>), cannot now be located definitely.</p>

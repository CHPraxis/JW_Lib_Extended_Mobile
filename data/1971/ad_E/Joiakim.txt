JOIAKIM
(Joiʹa·kim) [Jehovah raises up].
Son and successor of postexilic High Priest Jeshua. (Neh. 12:10, 12, 26) According to Josephus, he held office at the time Ezra returned (Antiquities of the Jews, Book XI, chap. V, par. 1) However, by the time of Nehemiah’s arrival later (455 B.C.E.), Joiakim’s son Eliashib had become high priest.—Neh. 3:1.

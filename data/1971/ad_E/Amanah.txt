AMANAH
(A·maʹnah) [firm or constant].
This name appears in the Hebrew at Song of Solomon 4:8 in connection with Lebanon and Mount Hermon. Most translations simply transliterate the Hebrew word; however, lexicographers Koehler and Baumgartner understand it to refer to the Anti-Lebanon range while Brown, Driver and Briggs apply it to that portion of the Anti-Lebanons in which the Nahr Barada has its source.—See ANTI-LEBANON.

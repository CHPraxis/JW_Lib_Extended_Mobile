JASHOBEAM
(Ja·shoʹbe·am) [the people return].
1. A Korahite warrior who joined David’s forces at Ziklag. (1 Chron. 12:1, 6) Possibly the same as No. 2 below.
2. The head one of David’s three most outstanding mighty men. Jashobeam once used his spear to fight off several hundred of the enemy and was also one of the three to force their way into the Philistine camp to get water for David from the cistern of Bethlehem. (1 Chron. 11:11, 15-19) In the course of events, Jashobeam was appointed head of the first monthly division of 24,000. (1 Chron. 27:1, 2) He was a son of Zabdiel; a Hachmonite. His name is spelled Josheb-basshebeth at 2 Samuel 23:8.—See JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH.

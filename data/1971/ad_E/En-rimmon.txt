EN-RIMMON
(En-rimʹmon) [spring by the pomegranate trees, or fountain of the pomegranate].
A city of Judah mentioned after the captivity as being inhabited by the sons of Judah. (Neh. 11:25, 29) Its name may be a combination of Ain and Rimmon, mentioned at Joshua 15:32 and 19:7 and 1 Chronicles 4:32. Jerome’s Onomastikon calls it “a very large village, inhabited by Jews, sixteen [Roman] miles [23.7 kilometers] from Eleutheropolis, to the south of Daroma.” Today it is generally considered identifiable with Khirbet Umm er-Ramamin, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) to the N-NE of Beer-sheba.

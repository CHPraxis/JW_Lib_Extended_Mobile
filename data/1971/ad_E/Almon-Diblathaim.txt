ALMON-DIBLATHAIM
(Alʹmon-dib·la·thaʹim) [hidden fig cakes].
A place between Dibon-gad and the plains of Moab, where the Israelites encamped in the fortieth year of their going out from Egypt (1473 B.C.E.). It was one of the last encampments during their wanderings. (Num. 33:46, 47) Usually identified with Khirbet Deleilat el-Gharbiyeh, a double ruin controlling three roads two and a half miles (4 kilometers) NE of Khirbet Libb. Possibly identical with Beth-diblathaim.—Jer. 48:22.

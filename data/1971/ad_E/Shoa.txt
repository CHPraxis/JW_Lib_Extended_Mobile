SHOA
(Shoʹa).
A people or an area named along with Pekod and Koa as providing military forces that Jehovah would bring against unfaithful Jerusalem. (Ezek. 23:4, 22, 23) Though uncertain, “Shoa” perhaps designates the ancient Sutu (or Su), a people mentioned in inscriptions along with the Kutu (Koa?) as fighting the Assyrians. The Tell el-Amarna tablets indicate that the Sutu lived as nomads in the Syrian desert E of Palestine. Later they apparently settled E of the Tigris River.

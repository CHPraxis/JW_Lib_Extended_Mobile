GRANDPARENTS
This term, as well as “grandfather” and “grandmother,” is rarely found in Bible translations. “Grandmother” at 1 Kings 15:10, 13 is translated from the same word as “mother” and is appropriately so rendered because Maacah was Asa’s grandmother, not his mother. (1 Ki. 15:1, 2, 8) It appears that Maacah continued as the queen mother during Asa’s reign until she was removed for her idolatry. (1 Ki. 15:13) Correspondingly, “father” on occasion indicated a grandfather or forefather. (Gen. 28:13) Grandparents are also identified by such expressions as “the father of your mother” and “mother’s father.”—Gen. 28:2; Judg. 9:1.
“Children or grandchildren,” the apostle says, should “keep paying a due compensation to their parents and grandparents [Gr., pro·goʹnois].” (1 Tim. 5:4) Another form of the same word (pro·goʹnon) is rendered “forefathers” at 2 Timothy 1:3. Timothy’s grandmother (Gr., mamʹme) Lois is commended for having ‘faith without hypocrisy,’ and she apparently assisted in the development of Timothy’s faith and spiritual growth.—2 Tim. 1:5; 3:14, 15.

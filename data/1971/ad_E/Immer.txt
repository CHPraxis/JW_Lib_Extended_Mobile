IMMER
(Imʹmer) [sheep, lamb].
1. A descendant of Aaron designated head of the sixteenth priestly division in David’s time. (1 Chron. 24:1, 6, 14) Apparently 1,052 of his descendants returned with Zerubbabel from Babylon in 537 B.C.E. (Ezra 2:37; Neh. 7:40) Two of the “sons of Immer” were among those putting away their foreign wives in Ezra’s time.—Ezra 10:20, 44.
2. Father of Meshillemith (or Meshillemoth); possibly the same as No. 1 above.—1 Chron. 9:12; Neh. 11:13.
3. Father of the priest Pashhur, an opposer of Jeremiah who had the prophet put in stocks. Jeremiah prophesied that Pashhur and all his house would be taken to Babylon. (Jer. 20:1, 2, 6) If the designation “the son of Immer” is to be understood as denoting a descendant rather than an actual son, this Immer may be No. 1 above.
4. Father of Zadok, one who shared in repairing Jerusalem’s wall. (Neh. 3:29) This Immer may, however, be the same as No. 1 above, if the designation “the son of Immer” is to be regarded as meaning a descendant.
5. Seemingly a place in Babylonia from which certain priests returned who were unable to prove their genealogy.—Ezra 2:59; Neh. 7:61.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[good].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “land” to which Jephthah fled from his half brothers. In Tob he gathered a force of men before his half brothers asked him to be their commander in fighting against the Ammonites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:3-7:11:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 11:3-11</a>) There is possibly another Biblical reference to Tob if the name “Ishtob” is rather to be translated “men of Tob” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:10:6-10:10:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>. (See <em>AS, JP, RS, NW,</em> 1955 ed., ftn.) Tob’s location is not definitely known. However, it is often identified with the region centering around et-Taiyibeh, nearly forty miles (c. 64 kilometers) E-SE of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

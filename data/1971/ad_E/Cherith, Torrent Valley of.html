<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Cheʹrith) [perhaps, cut].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site where Elijah concealed himself and was fed by ravens after announcing a coming drought to Israel’s King Ahab.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:17:1-11:17:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:1-7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some geographers, on the basis of the expression “east [Hebrew, ʽ<em>al p<sup>e</sup>neh</em>ʹ] of the Jordan” (17:3, <em>AT, JB, NW, RS</em>), have tentatively identified Cherith with the Wadi el-Yabis in Gilead, a stream flowing into the Jordan about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) SE of Beth-shean. Others, however, hold the view that this same Hebrew expression may also be rendered “on the front of” or <em>“before</em> the Jordan” (<em>Yg, AS</em>), implying that Cherith could have been situated on either side of the Jordan River. Additionally, they consider it unlikely that the torrent valley of Cherith would be identified with a location so near Elijah’s Gilead home (17:1), for such a hiding place would obviously be investigated by Ahab’s forces in their search for the prophet. (18:10) In view of these factors, the location remains unidentifiable.</p>

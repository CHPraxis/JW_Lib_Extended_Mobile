<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Mo·seʹrah, Mo·seʹroth) [perhaps, band(s) (as a fetter); or, chastisement, possibly alluding to Aaron’s death].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The place where the Israelites were encamped when Aaron died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:6-5:10:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 10:6</a>) It was evidently near Mount Hor (whereon Aaron died), but its exact location is unknown. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:38-4:33:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 33:38</a>) Some scholars tentatively locate Moserah seventeen miles (27 kilometers) W-SW of Jebel Madurah (Mount Hor?). The plural form of Moserah, <span id="page1180" class="pageNum" data-no="1180" data-before-text="1180"></span>“Moseroth,” appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:30-4:33:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 33:30, 31</a>, and apparently refers to an earlier Israelite encampment there.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ʽAʹyin or, as commonly anglicized, ayin [ע]. The sixteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, later used also outside the Hebrew Scriptures as a number to denote seventy.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greek vowel <em>oʹmi·kron</em> (from which we get our English “o”) is derived from ʽ<em>aʹyin;</em> however, the Hebrew letter is not a vowel but a <em>consonant</em>. It represents a peculiar guttural sound pronounced at the back of the throat and has no equivalent in English. It is transliterated in writing by a raised, reversed comma (ʽ). It appears as the initial letter in each of the verses of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:121-19:119:128" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:121-128</a>, Hebrew text.</p>

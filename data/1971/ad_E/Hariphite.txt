HARIPHITE
(Harʹi·phite).
A designation applied to a Benjamite, Shephatiah, who joined David at Ziklag while David was still under restrictions because of Saul. Shephatiah’s being called a Hariphite may mean that he was either a native of Hariph or Hareph (a place of unknown location) or a descendant of a certain Hariph or Hareph.—1 Chron. 12:1, 2, 5.

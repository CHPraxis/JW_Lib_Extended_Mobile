RUE
A plant mentioned only at Luke 11:42 with reference to the scrupulous tithing of the Pharisees. The common variety of rue (Ruta graveolens) is a strong-scented shrubby perennial with hairy stems that attains a height of about three feet (c. .9 meter). It has gray-green leaves and bears clusters of yellow flowers. Rue has been used medicinally as a stimulant and antispasmodic. During the days of Jesus’ earthly ministry rue may have been cultivated in Palestine for use in medicine and as a flavoring for food.
Instead of “rue,” the parallel account at Matthew 23:23 mentions “dill,” as does the third-century manuscript (Chester Beatty Papyrus No. 1) at Luke 11:42.

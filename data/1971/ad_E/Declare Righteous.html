<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In many translations this Biblical expression is rendered as “justify” and the noun forms as “justification.” The original words <em>(di·kai·oʹo</em> [verb] and <em>di·kaiʹo·ma, di·kaiʹo·sis</em> [nouns]) in the Christian Greek Scriptures, where the fullest explanation of the matter is found, basically carry the idea of “absolving or clearing of any charge,” “to hold as guiltless,” and hence “to acquit or to pronounce and treat as righteous.”—Arndt and Gingrich’s <em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian literature,</em> pp. 196, 197; Liddell and Scott’s <em>A Greek-English Lexicon,</em> p. 354; Edward Robinson’s <em>A Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,</em> pp. 184, 185.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thus the apostle Paul speaks of God as being “proved righteous [form of <em>di·kai·oʹo</em>]” in his words and winning when being judged by detractors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:4-45:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 3:4</a>) Jesus said that “wisdom is proved righteous by its works”; and that, when rendering an account on Judgment Day, men would be “declared righteous [form of <em>di·kai·oʹo</em>]” or condemned by their words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:19-40:11:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 11:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:36-40:12:37" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12:36, 37</a>) Jesus said of the humble tax collector who prayed repentantly in the temple, that he “went down to his home proved more righteous” than the boastful Pharisee praying at the same time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:9-42:18:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 18:9-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:15-42:16:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:15</a>) The apostle Paul states that the person who dies is “acquitted [form of <em>di·kai·oʹo</em>] from his sin,” having paid the penalty of death.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:7-45:6:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 6:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, in addition to such usages, these Greek words are used in a special sense as referring to an act of God whereby one is accounted guiltless (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:38-44:13:39" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 13:38, 39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:33-45:8:33" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:33</a>) and also to God’s act in declaring a person perfect in integrity and judged worthy of the right to life, as will be seen.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>DECLARING MEN RIGHTEOUS IN PRE-CHRISTIAN TIMES</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Originally, Adam was perfect, a righteous man, a human “son of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:38-42:3:38" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>) He was righteous by virtue of God’s creation of him and was declared “very good” by his Creator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) But he failed to maintain integrity before God and lost righteousness for himself and for his future offspring.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 3:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Nevertheless, from among his descendants there came men of faith who “walked with the true God,” such as Noah, Enoch, Job and others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:22-1:5:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 5:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:1-1:7:1" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Job 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:3-18:2:3" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> 2:3</a>) Of Abraham, it is stated that he exercised faith in God and was “declared righteous”; also, it is written that Rahab of Jericho manifested her faith by her works and so was “declared righteous,” her life being spared when the city of Jericho was destroyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:21-59:2:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 2:21-23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:25-59:2:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 25</a>) It may be noted that in James’ epistle (as cited) and also in Paul’s letter to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:3-45:4:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">the Romans (4:3-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:9-45:4:11" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>), in which he quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:6-1:15:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 15:6</a>, the expression is used that Abraham’s faith was “counted to him as righteousness.” Understanding of this expression is aided by considering the sense of the Greek verb <em>lo·giʹzo·mai,</em> “to count,” here used.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong><em>How “counted” righteous</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This Greek verb <em>lo·giʹzo·mai</em> was used regularly in ancient times for numerical calculations or computations, such as in accounting, being used when referring both to something that was entered on the debit side of an account and also to something entered on the credit side thereof. In the Bible it is used to mean “to reckon, credit, count, or take into account.” Thus <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:5</a> says that love “does not keep account [form of <em>lo·giʹzo·mai</em>] of the injury” (compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:16-55:4:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:16</a>); and the psalmist David is quoted as saying: “Happy is the man whose sin Jehovah will by no means take into account.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:8-45:4:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 4:8</a>) Paul showed to those who looked at things according to their face value the need to make a proper evaluation of matters, to ‘look at both sides of the ledger,’ as it were. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:2-47:10:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:7-47:10:7" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:10-47:10:12" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10-12</a>) At the same time Paul was concerned that “no one should put to [his] credit [form of <em>lo·giʹzo·mai</em>]” more than was correct as regards his ministry.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:6-47:12:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The word <em>lo·giʹzo·mai</em> may also mean “to estimate, appraise, count or class [with a group, class or type].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:1-46:4:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:1</a>) Thus Jesus said that he would be “reckoned [form of <em>lo·giʹzo·mai</em>] with lawless ones,” that is, counted or classed as in among them or as if one of them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:37-42:22:37" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 22:37</a>) In his letter to the Romans, the apostle says that in the case of the uncircumcised person keeping the Law, his “uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision,” that is, estimated or looked upon as if it were circumcision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:26-45:2:26" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 2:26</a>) In a similar sense, Christians were urged to ‘reckon themselves to be dead as regards sin but alive as regards God by Christ Jesus.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:11-45:6:11" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 6:11</a>) And anointed Christians from among the Gentiles, though not fleshly descendants of Abraham, were “counted as the seed” of Abraham.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:8-45:9:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rom. 9:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">So, also, Abraham’s faith, combined with works, was “counted [reckoned, credited, or attributed] to him as righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:20-45:4:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 4:20-22</a>) This, of course, does not mean that he and other faithful men of pre-Christian times were perfect or free from sin; yet, by virtue of their exercise of faith, they were not classed as unrighteous like the rest of the world of mankind. As persons striving to live according to right standards and follow God’s commands (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:2-19:119:3" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 119:2, 3</a>), they were not counted as living unclean, sinful lives, like those not knowing or not obeying God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:1-19:32:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 32:1, 2</a>) Thus, God could, by reason of their faith, have dealings with such imperfect men and bless them, doing so while still remaining true to his own perfect standards of justice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:10-19:36:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 36:10</a>) However, such ones recognized their need for redemption from sin and were awaiting God’s due time to provide it.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:7-19:49:9" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 49:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:26-58:9:26" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>CHRIST JESUS’ “ONE ACT OF JUSTIFICATION”</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Scriptures show that Jesus Christ when on <span id="page437" class="pageNum" data-no="437" data-before-text="437"></span>earth was actually perfect in human organism (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:18-60:1:19" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:18, 19</a>) and that he maintained his perfection by continuing to retain and strengthen his integrity under test. This was in accord with God’s purpose to make the Chief Agent of salvation “perfect through sufferings.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:10-58:2:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 2:10</a>) That is, Jesus was perfected as to obedience and integrity-keeping and was perfected for his position as God’s High Priest of salvation, as Paul shows at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:7-58:5:10" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:7-10</a>. Finishing his earthly course free from flaw in any sense of the word, Jesus was acknowledged by God as justified. He was thus the only man who, through test, stood firmly and positively just, or righteous before God <em>on his own merit.</em> By this “one act of justification [form of <em>di·kaiʹo·ma</em>],” that is, by Jesus’ proving himself perfectly righteous through his entire flawless course, including his sacrifice, he provided the basis for declaring righteous those persons having faith in Christ.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:17-45:5:19" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rom. 5:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:25-45:3:26" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 3:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:25-45:4:25" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 4:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>IN THE CHRISTIAN CONGREGATION</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">With the coming of God’s Son as the promised Redeemer, a new factor existed upon which God could base his dealings with his human servants. The followers of Jesus Christ who are called to be his spiritual brothers, with the prospect of being joint heirs with him in the heavenly kingdom (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:17-45:8:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rom. 8:17</a>), are first declared righteous by God on the basis of their faith in Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:24-45:3:24" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rom. 3:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:28-45:3:28" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 28</a>) This is a judicial act of Jehovah God; therefore before him as the Supreme Judge no one can “file accusation” against his chosen ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:33-45:8:34" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rom. 8:33, 34</a>) Why does God take this action toward them?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">First, it is because Jehovah is perfect and holy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:3-23:6:3" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Isa. 6:3</a>); hence, in harmony with his holiness, those whom he accepts as his sons must be perfect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:5" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4, 5</a>) Jesus Christ, God’s chief Son, showed himself perfect, “loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Heb. 7:26</a>) His followers, however, are taken from among the sons of Adam, who, because of sin, fathered an imperfect, sinful family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:22-46:15:22" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:22</a>) Thus, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:12-43:1:13" data-bid="39-1" class="b">John 1:12, 13</a> shows, Jesus’ followers were not, to begin with, sons of God. By his undeserved kindness, Jehovah God arranged a process of “adoption” through which he accepts such favored ones and brings them into a spiritual relationship as part of his family of sons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:16" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Rom. 8:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:1-62:3:1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:1</a>) Consequently, God lays the basis for their entry into or their adoption to sonship by declaring them righteous through the merit of Christ’s ransom sacrifice in which they exercise faith, acquitting them of all guilt due to sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rom. 5:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:11" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 8-11</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:12-43:1:12" data-bid="42-1" class="b">John 1:12</a>.) They are, therefore, “counted” or “credited” as being completely righteous persons, all their sins being forgiven and not charged up against them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:6-45:4:8" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Rom. 4:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:1-45:8:2" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 8:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:12-58:10:12" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:14-58:10:14" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">This declaring of such Christians righteous, therefore, goes much farther than in the case of Abraham and others, previously discussed. The Scriptural record makes clear that prior to Christ’s coming no such sonship nor such a heavenly hope had been opened up to men.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:12-43:1:12" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 1:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:17-43:1:18" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:10-55:1:10" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:3" data-bid="44-4" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:1-62:3:1" data-bid="44-5" class="b"> 1 John 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It can be seen that, though enjoying the status of righteous persons before God, these Christians do not possess actual or literal perfection in the flesh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:8" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 John 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) In view of the prospect of heavenly life for these followers of Christ, such literal perfection in fleshly organism now is not actually needed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:42-46:15:44" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:42-44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:50-46:15:50" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:1-58:3:1" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> Heb. 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="46-4" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:3, 4</a>) However, by their being declared righteous, having righteousness “counted” or “credited” to them, God’s requirements of justice are satisfied and he brings the adopted ones into the “new covenant” validated by the blood of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Luke 22:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:28</a>) These adopted spiritual sons in the new covenant that is made with spiritual Israel are ‘baptized into Christ,’ eventually dying a death like his.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:3-45:6:5" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Rom. 6:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:10-50:3:11" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Phil. 3:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Although Jehovah does not take into account against them their sins of fleshly weakness and imperfection, nevertheless, a conflict exists in these Christians, as illustrated in Paul’s letter to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:25" data-bid="49-1" class="b">the Romans (7:21-25</a>). It is between the law of their renewed mind (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:23" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:23</a>), or “God’s law,” and “sin’s law” that is in their members. This is because their fleshly bodies are not perfected, even though they are “counted righteous” and their sins are forgiven. This conflict contributes to the test of their integrity toward God. They can win this conflict by the help of God’s spirit and the assistance of their merciful High Priest, Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:25-45:7:25" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Rom. 7:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:18" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:17, 18</a>) To win, however, they must constantly exercise faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice and follow him, thus maintaining their righteousness in God’s eyes. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:11-66:22:11" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Revelation 22:11</a>.) Thereby they ‘make their calling and choosing sure’ for themselves.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:1" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Heb. 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:11" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:9-11</a>) The faithful footstep followers of Christ await a resurrection like his (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:5-45:6:5" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Rom. 6:5</a>), looking forward to becoming recipients of “divine nature.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:4-61:1:4" data-bid="61-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>OTHER RIGHTEOUS ONES</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In one of Jesus’ illustrations or parables relating to the time of his coming in Kingdom glory persons likened to “sheep” are designated as “righteous ones,” blessed by God and invited to inherit the kingdom prepared for them. They are rewarded with everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:46" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-46</a>) It is notable, however, that in this illustration these “righteous ones” are presented as separate and distinct from those whom Christ calls “my brothers.” (Vss. 34, 37, 40, 46; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:10-58:2:11" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:10, 11</a>.) The texts themselves indicate that the righteousness of these sheeplike ones accrues to them from their showing faith in Christ, not merely calling him “Lord,” but also demonstrating that faith by rendering assistance to Christ’s spiritual “brothers.”—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="64-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">A parallel situation may be noted in the vision recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:3-66:7:17" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Revelation 7:3-17</a>. Here, a “great crowd” of indefinite number, having a favorable position before God’s throne by virtue of having “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,” are shown as distinct from the 144,000 ‘sealed ones.’ (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:13-49:1:14" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:1-47:5:1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 5:1</a>.) The ‘sealed ones’ are elsewhere represented as those “bought from among mankind, as a first fruits to God and to the Lamb” and are depicted as with the Lamb Jesus Christ in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:4" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1-4</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:22-58:12:23" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22, 23</a>.) As regards the unnumbered “great crowd” of mankind certain expressions applied to them correspond exactly with those used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:4" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1-4</a>. There mankind is described as receiving blessings resulting from the descent of the New Jerusalem from heaven, the “tent of God” then being with mankind. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:17" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Revelation 7:15-17</a> with 21:3, 4.) This picture harmonizes well with Paul’s statement concerning the expectant “creation” awaiting the “revealing of the sons of God” in order that they too may be “set free from enslavement to corruption and have the <span id="page438" class="pageNum" data-no="438" data-before-text="438"></span>glorious freedom of the children of God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:18-45:8:23" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Rom. 8:18-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>GOD PROVED RIGHTEOUS IN ALL HIS ACTS</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It can be seen that in his dealings with imperfect humans, as described above, God never violates his own standards of righteousness and justice. He does not declare sinful persons righteous on their own merit, thereby overlooking or condoning sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:1-19:143:2" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ps. 143:1, 2</a>) As the apostle Paul explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus. God set him forth as an offering for propitiation through faith in his blood. This was in order to exhibit his own righteousness, because he was forgiving the sins that occurred in the past while God was exercising forbearance; so as to exhibit his own righteousness in this present season, that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:26" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23-26</a>) Thus God, through undeserved kindness, has provided a legal arrangement on the basis of Christ’s sacrifice by which he can be completely just and righteous in forgiving the sins of those exercising faith.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>ATTEMPTS AT PROVING ONESELF RIGHTEOUS</strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Since God alone can declare a man righteous, attempts to prove oneself righteous on the basis of one’s own merit, or by acceptance of the judgment of others as to one’s righteousness, are of no value. Job was reproved because, though not charging God with any wrong, he gave attention to “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:1-18:32:2" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Job 32:1, 2</a>) The man versed in the Law who questioned Jesus about the way to everlasting life was indirectly reproved by Jesus for his attempt to prove himself righteous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:25-42:10:37" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Luke 10:25-37</a>) Jesus condemned the Pharisees for seeking to declare themselves righteous before men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:15-42:16:15" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Luke 16:15</a>) The apostle Paul, in particular, showed that, due to all men’s imperfect, sinful state, none could be declared righteous through trying to establish their own righteousness by works of the Mosaic law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:19-45:3:24" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Rom. 3:19-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:10-48:3:12" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> Gal. 3:10-12</a>) Instead, he stressed faith in Christ Jesus as the true basis for such declaration of righteousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:3-45:10:4" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Rom. 10:3, 4</a>) The inspired letter of James complements Paul’s statement by showing that such faith must be made to live, not by works of Law, but by works of faith, as in the cases of Abraham and Rahab.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:24-59:2:24" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Jas. 2:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:26-59:2:26" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Certain men, falsely claiming to be apostles, unjustly challenged the apostleship and Christian works of Paul, seeking thereby to draw away the Corinthian congregation to themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:12-47:11:13" data-bid="80-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:12, 13</a>) Paul, knowing that he was faithfully carrying out a stewardship for Christ, stated that he was not concerned with the judgment of men, who, wholly unauthorized, sat in effect as a “human tribunal” to judge him. He did not even rely on his own judgment of himself, but looked to Jehovah as his Examiner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:1-46:4:4" data-bid="81-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:1-4</a>) Thus the principle is set forth that reliance cannot be put in the judgment of men as to one’s righteousness or lack of it, unless their judgment is backed up by God’s Word. The person must look into God’s Word and let it examine him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) Where the backing of God’s Word is evident, one being reproved by a Christian brother, especially by one having authority to reprove, would not properly turn aside such reproof by trying to prove himself righteous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:1-20:12:1" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Prov. 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:11-58:12:11" data-bid="83-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="83-3" class="b"> 13:17</a>) And anyone in a position of responsibility who sits in judgment of a matter or a dispute would be condemned by God if he pronounced “the wicked one righteous in consideration of a bribe.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:23-23:5:23" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Isa. 5:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:8-59:2:9" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Birʹza·ith) [well of the olive tree].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A name in the genealogy of Asher of the family of Malchiel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:30, 31</a>) Some commentators suggest it to be the name of a woman; however, women were rarely included in Jewish genealogies and, when they were for special reasons, they were generally clearly identified as women. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:24-13:7:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:30" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:32-13:7:32" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 32</a>) Because Birzaith is the only name of those listed in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:30-13:7:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 7:30, 31</a> that is not found in the parallel genealogical record of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:17-1:46:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 46:17</a>, and also because of the meaning of the name, others consider Birzaith to refer to a site around which the descendants of Malchiel settled, or an area in which Malchiel was a chief inhabitant, even as Shobal is spoken of as the “father of Kiriath-jearim” and Salma as the “father of Bethlehem.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:51-13:2:52" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:51, 52</a>) Supposing Birzaith to have been the name of a place, some would identify it with Birzeit (4.3 miles [6.9 kilometers] N of Ramallah); but, despite the similarity of the names, Birzeit’s location near the southern border of Ephraim (instead of in the territory of Asher) does not lend much support to such a conclusion.—See ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.</p>

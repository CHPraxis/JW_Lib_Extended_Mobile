<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The names “Arab” and “Arabian” in the Scriptures are used chiefly in a broad sense as applying to an inhabitant of Arabia, that immense land to the E and S of Palestine. At times the context and use infer a specific tribe or ethnic group.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:10:15-11:10:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:9:14-14:9:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 9:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:21:16-14:21:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 21:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A number of Arabian tribes were Semitic, descending from Shem through Joktan; others were Hamitic, descending through Ham’s son Cush.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page102" class="pageNum" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>For the most part the Arabians were a wandering people who led a pastoral life, dwelling in tents.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:21-26:27:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:21</a>) God’s servants had numerous contacts with them. The Midianite merchants on their way to Egypt to whom Joseph was sold were Arabian, as were the Sabeans from S Arabia who raided Job’s cattle and she-asses.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Rulers of Arabian kingdoms paid tribute to King Solomon.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Though nomadic, generally independent, and often quite isolated from the mainstream of activity of those times, the Arabs came in for prophetic attention and judgment by God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:21:13-23:21:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 21:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:17-24:25:24" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Jer. 25:17-24</a>) Centuries later, some Arabians were perhaps among those becoming members of the early Christian congregation at Pentecost.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:11-44:2:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 2:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 41</a>; see ARABIA.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the Scriptures the term occurs five times, always in the plural (Heb., <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ma·rim</em>ʹ). It is generally rendered “lees” by Bible translators, and has reference to suspended particles that precipitate and settle to the bottom when wine is allowed to stand undisturbed. Keeping a good wine “on the dregs” for a long time to age fully gives it clarity, strength and mellowness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 25:6</a>) On the other hand, when a wine that is bad to start with due to a poor quality of grape is left to congeal on the dregs, it does not improve in taste or smell, facts to which the prophets refer in illustrations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:11-24:48:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 48:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:12-36:1:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Zeph. 1:12</a>) Also, in a figure of speech the psalmist says that “all the wicked ones of the earth” will be compelled to drain the cup of Jehovah’s anger, drinking the dregs and all, down to the last bitter drop.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:75:8-19:75:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 75:8</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:32-26:23:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 23:32-34</a>; see WINE AND STRONG DRINK.</p>

MIJAMIN
(Mijʹa·min) [from the right hand].
1. Descendant of Aaron selected by lot to head the sixth division of priestly service in King David’s day.—1 Chron. 24:1, 3, 5, 9.
2. One of the heads of the priests who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel. (Neh. 12:1, 5, 7) He may have founded the paternal house of Miniamin mentioned at Nehemiah 12:17 (where the name of the head of that house appears to have been an inadvertent scribal omission in the Hebrew text).
3. One of the “sons of Parosh” who sent away foreign “wives along with sons” as Ezra counseled.—Ezra 10:25, 44.
4. A priest (or possibly the ancestor of a priest) listed among those attesting by seal the “trustworthy arrangement” of Nehemiah’s time. (Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 7, 8) He seems to be identical with the Miniamin of Nehemiah 12:41.
“Mijamin” and “Miniamin” seem to be variations of one name. The letter nun (n) appears in the Hebrew name from which the English “Miniamin” is transliterated, but it has probably been assimilated in the Hebrew form that is rendered “Mijamin.”

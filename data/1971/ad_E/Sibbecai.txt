SIBBECAI
(Sibʹbe·cai).
One of David’s mighty men, a Hushathite. (1 Chron. 11:26, 29) Sibbecai, in a war with the Philistines at Gob, slew Saph (Sippai), one of the giantlike Rephaim, thereby subduing the enemy. (2 Sam. 21:18; 1 Chron. 20:4) When David organized the monthly rotational service of the nation’s forces, Sibbecai was placed in charge of the eighth division. (1 Chron. 27:1, 11) He is apparently called Mebunnai at 2 Samuel 23:27.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The original Hebrew word <em>b<sup>e</sup>dhilʹ</em> means <em>that which is separated</em> or <em>removed</em> from precious metals by smelting. The word is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:25-23:1:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:25</a>: “I shall smelt away your scummy dross as with lye, and I will remove all your waste products [<em>b<sup>e</sup>dhilʹ</em>].” The first reference to tin, soon after the Exodus, includes it among the valuable spoils of war taken from the Midianites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:2-4:31:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 31:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:22-4:31:22" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22</a>) There were no tin mines in Palestine; the heavy dark oxide of tin called “cassiterite” came from river sands in Tarshish and England. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:12-26:27:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:12</a>) Of the six products of the ancient metallurgist’s furnace, tin had the lowest melting point of all, only 449° F. (232° C.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:18-26:22:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 22:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:20-26:22:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20</a>) Tin, it appears, was used to make plummets, for at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:10-38:4:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:10</a> (which speaks of the “plummet”) the Masoretic text reads “the stone [or, weight], the tin.” In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:7:7-30:7:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Amos 7:7, 8</a> the Hebrew word translated “plummet” may mean tin or lead. Tin’s greatest usefulness, however, was as a hardening agent; 2 to 18 percent tin alloyed with copper has been found in ancient specimens of bronze.</p>

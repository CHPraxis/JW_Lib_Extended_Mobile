<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ge-harʹa·shim) [valley of craftsmen].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A valley named for the community of craftsmen living there. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:14-13:4:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:14</a>) The community was ‘fathered’ or founded by Joab, though evidently not the Joab of David’s time. It was settled by Benjamites after the Babylonian exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:31-16:11:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 11:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:35-16:11:35" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 35</a>) The exact location of the site is uncertain. Some geographers tentatively locate it at Wadi esh-Shellal, a broad valley located a few miles SE of Jaffa; others prefer the identification with Sarafand el-Kharab to the SW of the former.—See ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.</p>

SIGMA
SIGMA [C, Σ, σ, ς]. The eighteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, from which the English “s” originates. In the later cursive writing, when a word ends with sigʹma, its normal minuscular sign (σ) is not used, but ς is used in its place. However, when, as in the more ancient manuscripts, a word is in all capitals, the same letter (C or Σ) is used in all cases.
Sigʹma is derived from the Hebrew sin. As a number, accented sigma (σ΄) equals 200, and, with the subscript (,‏σ), 200,000. The final form of the letter when accented (ς΄) denotes six, as in Revelation 13:18.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Gr., <em>sy·kaʹmi·nos</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This tree is mentioned but once, in Jesus’ statement to the apostles relative to their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:5-42:17:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 17:5, 6</a>) The Greek word used was regularly applied to the mulberry tree, and the black mulberry (<em>Morus nigra</em>) is commonly cultivated in Palestine. It is a sturdy tree growing to a height of about twenty feet (6 meters), with large heart-shaped leaves and dark-red or black fruit resembling the blackberry. The white mulberry (<em>Morus alba</em>) is used to feed silkworms, and their culture was evidently introduced into Syria during Roman times and continues there.</p>

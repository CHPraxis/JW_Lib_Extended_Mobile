<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Heb., <em>’a·menʹ;</em> Gr., <em>a·menʹ</em>)<em>.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This word is a transliteration from the Hebrew in both English and Greek. The original meaning is “sure,” “truly,” “so be it,” “truth.” The Hebrew root word from which it is drawn (<em>’a·manʹ</em>) means, literally, “to build, support,” and, figuratively, “to be firm, faithful.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the word is used as a solemn expression to obligate oneself legally to an oath or covenant and its consequences (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:5:22-4:5:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 5:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:15-5:27:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 27:15-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:13-16:5:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Neh. 5:13</a>), as a solemn expression to subscribe to an expressed prayer (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:36-13:16:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:36</a>), to an expression of praise (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:6-16:8:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 8:6</a>) or to an expressed purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:36-11:1:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:5-24:11:5" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer. 11:5</a>) Each of the first four books or collections of the Psalms concludes with this expression, perhaps indicating that it was customary for the congregation of Israel to join in at the end of the song or psalm with an “Amen.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:13-19:41:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 41:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:19-19:72:19" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 72:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:52-19:89:52" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 89:52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:48-19:106:48" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 106:48</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>’a·manʹ</em> is applied to Jehovah as the <em>“faithful</em> God” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:9-5:7:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 7:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:7-23:49:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isa. 49:7</a>), and describes his reminders and promises as “trustworthy” and “faithful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:28-19:89:28" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 89:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:37-19:89:37" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 37</a>) In the Christian Greek Scriptures the title “Amen” is applied to Christ Jesus as the “faithful and true witness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:14-66:3:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 3:14</a>) Jesus made singular use of the expression in his preaching and teaching, using it very often to preface a statement of fact or a promise or prophecy, thereby to emphasize the absolute truthfulness and reliability of what he said. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:18-40:5:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:2-40:6:2" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:5-40:6:5" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:16-40:6:16" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 24:34</a> and others) In these cases the Greek word (<em>a·menʹ</em>) is translated as “truly” (<em>AV,</em> “verily”) or, when doubled, as throughout the book of John, “most truly.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:51-43:1:51" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 1:51</a>) Jesus’ use of “amen” in this way is said to be unique in sacred literature, and it was consistent with his divinely given authority.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:29-40:7:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 7:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, as Paul shows at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:19-47:1:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:19, 20</a>, the title “Amen” applies to Jesus not merely in the sense of a truth speaker or true prophet and spokesman of God, but also as the one in whom all of God’s promises find fulfillment and whose course of faithfulness and obedience even to a sacrificial death confirms and makes possible the bringing to reality all such promises and declarations of purpose. He was the living Truth of those revelations of God’s purpose, the things to which God had sworn.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:17-43:1:17" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 14:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 18:37</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The expression “amen” is used many times in letters, especially those of Paul, when the writer has expressed some form of praise to God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:25-45:1:25" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 1:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:27-45:16:27" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 16:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:21-49:3:21" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Eph. 3:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:11-60:4:11" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:11</a>), or expresses the wish that God’s favor be manifested in some manner toward the recipients of the letter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:33-45:15:33" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 15:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:20-58:13:21" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:20, 21</a>) It is also used where the writer earnestly subscribes to what is expressed.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:7-66:1:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:20-66:22:20" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 22:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The prayer expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:36-13:16:36" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 16:36</a> and those contained in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:13-19:41:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b">the Psalms (41:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:19-19:72:19" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 72:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:52-19:89:52" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 89:52;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:106:48-19:106:48" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 106:48</a>), as well as the expressions contained in the canonical letters, all indicate the correctness of the use of “Amen” at the close of prayers. It is true that not all the prayers recorded show such conclusion such as David’s closing prayer for Solomon (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:19-13:29:19" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Chron 29:19</a>) or Solomon’s dedication prayer at the inauguration of the temple (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:53-11:8:61" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:53-61</a>), although such expression may well have been made. (Note <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:20-13:29:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:20</a>.) Similarly, its use is not recorded in Jesus’ prayers (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:39-40:26:39" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 26:39,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:42-40:26:42" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:1-43:17:26" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> John 17:1-26</a>), nor in the prayer of the disciples at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:24-44:4:30" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 4:24-30</a>. However, the weight of the prior evidence presented strongly indicates the rightness of the use of “Amen” as a conclusion to prayer, and Paul’s statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:16-46:14:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:16</a> in particular shows that it was customary for those in Christian assembly to join in the Amen to a prayer. Additionally, the examples of those in heaven, recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:13-66:5:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 5:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:10-66:7:12" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 7:10-12</a>; and 19:1-4, all give support to its use in <span id="page65" class="pageNum" data-no="65" data-before-text="65"></span>in subscribing to prayers or solemn statements and thereby, through the use of this one word, expressing the confidence, strong approval and earnest hope that is in their hearts.</p>

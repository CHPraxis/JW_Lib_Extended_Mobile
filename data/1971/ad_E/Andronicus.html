<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A faithful Jewish Christian in the congregation at Rome to whom Paul sent greetings. Paul calls Andronicus and Junias “my relatives.” While the Greek word used here (<em>syg·ge·nesʹ</em>) in its broader sense can mean “fellow-countrymen,” the primary meaning is “blood relative of the same generation.” The context indicates that Andronicus likely was so related to Paul. Like Paul, Andronicus had suffered imprisonment, was now a ‘man of note’ among the apostles, and had become a Christian prior to Paul.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:7-45:16:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 16:7</a>.</p>

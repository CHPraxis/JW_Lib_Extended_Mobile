JEHOIARIB

The priest whose paternal house was selected by lot as first of the twenty-four priestly divisions organized during David’s rule. (1 Chron. 24:1-3, 5-7) Some of the postexilic descendants of this paternal house, or another priest with the same name, lived in Jerusalem. (1 Chron. 9:3, 10) The name is spelled Joiarib in the parallel list at Nehemiah 11:10.

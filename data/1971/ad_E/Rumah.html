<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Home of Zebidah (and her father Pedaiah), a wife of King Josiah of Judah and the mother of Jehoiakim. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:34-12:23:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 23:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:36-12:23:36" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 36</a>) Its location is uncertain. The best possibility seems to be Khirbet Rumeh, which bears a similar name. It is situated less than fifteen miles (c. 24 kilometers) W of the Sea of Galilee and six miles (10 kilometers) N of Nazareth. But some connect Rumah with the Biblical town of Arumah, mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:41-7:9:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judges 9:41</a> and thought to have been located near Shechem.—See ARUMAH.</p>

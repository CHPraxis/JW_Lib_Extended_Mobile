<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A son of Benjamin listed among those who went into Egypt in 1728 B.C.E. with Jacob’s household, or who were born shortly thereafter. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:21-1:46:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 46:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:26-1:46:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 26</a>; see BENJAMIN No. 1.) The omission of his name from later lists of Benjamite families may indicate that he died childless, or that his sons merged with a different tribal family.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A name found in some translations of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:2-26:38:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:2 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:1-26:39:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 39:1</a> (<em>AS, JB, Le, LXX, Mo, Yg, Ro</em>) viewed by some scholars as designating a barbarous people called Rosh, who are said to have lived in Russia along the Volga River N of the Taurus Mountains. In view of the meaning of the term and its application to Gog, however, it is appropriately translated as a title rather than a geographic name: “head chieftain” (<em>NW</em>); “chief prince” (<em>AV, Dy, Fn, JP, RS</em>); “great prince” (<em>AT</em>), “prince of the head” and “head prince” (<em>Vg</em>); “leader and head” (<em>Peshitta</em>); “head great one.”—Targums.</p>

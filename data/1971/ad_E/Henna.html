<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>koʹpher,</em> twice translated “camphire” in the <em>Authorized Version,</em> is generally considered to be “henna” and is so rendered in many modern Bible translations. This shrub, mentioned only in The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:1:14-22:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon (1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:4:13-22:4:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:7:11-22:7:11" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 7:11</a>), still grows wild in Palestine. Ordinarily the henna plant’s maximum height is about ten feet (c. 3 meters). It bears clusters of small cream-colored, four-petal flowers at the tips of its branches, their strong fragrance being especially enjoyed by Middle Eastern peoples. Often a sprig of henna is put in bouquets, and women wear it in their hair and in their bosoms.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From ancient times henna has been employed as a cosmetic. The pulverized leaves of the plant are combined with hot water to form a paste, which is applied to the part of the body to be dyed and then is usually left overnight. When the henna paste is washed off, the stain, commonly an orange or reddish color, remains. It lasts for about three weeks, after which another application is required. Henna has been used to dye the nails of fingers and toes, fingertips, hands and feet, beards, hair, and even the manes and tails of horses, as well as skins and leather. Testifying to its ancient usage are findings of Egyptian mummies with stained fingernails. Also, the Hebrew root from which <em>koʹpher</em> is thought to be derived has been defined as “to smear,” seemingly indicative of its use as a dye.</p>

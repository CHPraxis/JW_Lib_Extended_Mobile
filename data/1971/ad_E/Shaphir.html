<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shaʹphir) [beautiful].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A place, evidently in Judah, the inhabitants of which were included in Micah’s prophecy of judgment due to come upon Judah and Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:1:11-33:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 1:11</a>) In this section of the prophecy, Micah makes a frequent play on words in his usage of the place-names. (See BETH-EZEL.) The present tentative identification of Shaphir is with Khirbet el-Kom, a site on a hill dominating the Wadi es-Saffar (Arabic form of Shaphir), about nine miles (15 kilometers) W of Hebron.</p>

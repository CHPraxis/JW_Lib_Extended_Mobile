<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ha πdrach).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A land against which Jehovah expressed a pronouncement through his prophet <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:1-38:9:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zechariah (9:1</a>). A consideration of the pronouncement suggests that it is directed against Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, Sidon and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:1-38:9:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zech. 9:1-8</a>) Hence, although various identifications have been suggested and many would link Hadrach with the <em>Hatarikka</em> mentioned in Assyrian texts, it may well be a symbolic name designating the territory in which these many cities were located.</p>

MYRRH
An aromatic gum resin. (Song of Sol. 1:13; 4:6, 14; 5:1, 13) Its precise source in ancient times is uncertain. But generally myrrh is in most instances believed to have been the resin obtained from the low-growing thorny shrub or tree known as Commiphora myrrha or the related variety Commiphora kataf. Both of these shrubs thrive in rocky areas, particularly on limestone hills. Their wood and bark have a strong odor. Although the resin exudes by itself from the stem or the thick and stiff branches of either variety, the flow can be increased by means of incisions. Initially the clear, white or yellowish-brown resin is soft and sticky but, upon dripping to the ground, it hardens and turns dark red or black.
Myrrh was one of the ingredients for the holy anointing oil. (Ex. 30:23-25) Esteemed for its fragrance, it was used to scent garments, beds and other items. (Compare Psalm 45:8; Proverbs 7:17; Song of Solomon 3:6, 7.) The Shulammite maiden of The Song of Solomon appears to have applied liquid myrrh to her body before retiring for the night. (Song of Sol. 5:2, 5) Massages with oil of myrrh were included in the special beauty treatment given to Esther. (Esther 2:12) Myrrh was also one of the substances employed in preparing bodies for burial. (John 19:39, 40) It was apparently viewed as having sufficient value to be presented as a gift to one born king of the Jews.â€”Matt. 2:1, 2, 11.

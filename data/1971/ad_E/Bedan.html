<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beʹdan).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. Listed with Gideon (Jerubbaal), Jephthah and Samuel as delivering Israel from enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:11-9:12:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 12:11</a>) However, nowhere else in the Bible nor in secular history is mention made of such a Bedan. C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch, in their <em>Biblical Commentary on the Books of Samuel,</em> p. 118, remark: “It is extremely improbable that Samuel should have mentioned a judge here, who had been passed over in the book of Judges on account of his comparative insignificance.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Bedan is by some understood to refer to Barak. The context of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:11-9:12:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:11</a> denotes a major deliverer and recalls the oppression by Sisera and the deliverance that followed, a deliverance in which Jehovah used Barak. Barak is named along with Gideon and Jephthah in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:32</a>. The <em>Septuagint</em> and Syriac <em>Peshitta</em> read “Barak” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:12:11-9:12:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:11</a>. Nevertheless, others believe Bedan refers to Judge Abdon. Both names, Barak and Abdon, bear certain similarities to “Bedan” in Hebrew.—See BARAK.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. A descendant of Manasseh.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:17-13:7:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 7:17</a>.</p>

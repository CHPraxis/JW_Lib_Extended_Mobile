ANAB
(Aʹnab) [grapes].
A town in the S part of the hill country of Judah from which the giant Anakim were expelled by Joshua. (Josh. 11:21; 15:48, 50) The site is identified with the modern village of ‘‏Anab or the nearby ruins of Khirbet ʽAnab. It lies on the Wadi el-Khalil about fifteen miles (24 kilometers) SW of Hebron or about halfway between Hebron and Beersheba.
The original name of the city may have been Kiriath-anab, since Egyptian texts apparently mention it as Qrtʽnb.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Relative, either by common ancestry or by marriage. Kinsman has special reference to a male relative. There are several words in the original Bible languages having the following meanings and usages.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Go·ʼel’</em> (from Hebrew <em>ga·ʼalʹ,</em> meaning “to redeem” or “to buy back”) has reference to the nearest male relative with the right of a repurchaser or an avenger of blood. Willful murderers were to be put to death by the “avenger of blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:16-4:35:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 35:16-19</a>) Boaz’ relationship to Naomi and Ruth was as a “repurchaser.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:20-8:2:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ruth 2:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:3:9-8:3:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:3:12-8:3:13" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:1-8:4:1" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:3-8:4:3" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:6-8:4:6" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:8-8:4:8" data-bid="2-7" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:14-8:4:14" data-bid="2-8" class="b"> 14</a>) Jehovah himself, the Great Father or Life-giver, is both an Avenger and a Repurchaser for his servants.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:35-19:78:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 78:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:14-23:41:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa. 41:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:14-23:43:14" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 43:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:6-23:44:6" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 44:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:24-23:44:24" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:5-23:54:5" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 54:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:16-23:63:16" data-bid="3-8" class="b"> 63:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:50:34-24:50:34" data-bid="3-9" class="b"> Jer. 50:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Sh<sup>e</sup>ʼerʹ</em> (Hebrew, meaning “flesh”) has reference to a fleshly relative or blood relative. God’s laws forbade having sexual relations with a close “blood relation,” such as one’s aunt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:6-3:18:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lev. 18:6-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:19-3:20:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20:19</a>) If a fellow Israelite fell into debt to an alien, then a brother, an uncle, a cousin or any other “blood relative,” could buy him back. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:47-3:25:49" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 25:47-49</a>) Or if one died having no sons, daughters, brothers or uncles, then the next closest “blood relation” received the inheritance.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:10-4:27:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 27:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Qa·rohvʹ</em> (Hebrew, meaning “near”) includes, not only one closely related, but also an intimate acquaintance. If a brother became so poor that he had to sell his possessions, then one “closely related” had to buy them back for him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:25-3:25:25" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 25:25</a>) Job grieved that his “intimate acquaintances” had left him, and David lamented that his “close acquaintances” also stood aloof.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:14-18:19:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 19:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:11-19:38:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 38:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Ya·dhaʽʹ</em> (Hebrew, meaning to “know,” “to be acquainted”) could mean a kinsman or just an acquaintance. Naomi had a “kinsman of her husband” named Boaz. Jehu executed all of Ahab’s house including his “acquaintances.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:1-8:2:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ruth 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:11-12:10:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 10:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures we find <em>syg·ge·nesʹ</em> (kin, relative), meaning a relative by blood, but it is never used in speaking of the relation between parents and children. Following this rule, note that Jesus said to his followers: “You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives [<em>syg·ge·nonʹ</em>] and friends.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:16-42:21:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 21:16</a>) When the twelve-year-old Jesus was missing, his parents began looking for him among the “relatives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:44-42:2:44" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 2:44</a>) When you spread a feast, Jesus counseled, do not invite your “relatives” who could pay you back, but, rather, the poor people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:12-42:14:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 14:12-14</a>) When Peter brought the good news of salvation to Cornelius his “relatives” were also present. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:24-44:10:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 10:24</a>) Paul, in his letter to the Romans, referred to the Israelites as well as a number of individuals as his “relatives.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:3-45:9:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 9:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:7-45:16:7" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 16:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:11-45:16:11" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:21-45:16:21" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>

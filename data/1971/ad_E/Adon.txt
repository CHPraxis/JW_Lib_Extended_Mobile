ADON
(Aʹdon; Heb., ʼa·dhohnʹ) [lord, master].
The Hebrew word ʼa·dhohnʹ carries the thought of ownership or headship. It is used of God and of men, in that both own or are head over others. The plural form ʼadho·nimʹ sometimes denotes the simple numerical plural and is then translated “lords” or “masters.” (Ps. 136:3; Isa. 26:13) At other places the plural form denotes excellence or majesty, whether of God or man (Ps. 8:1; Gen. 39:2), and in such cases any appositional pronouns or modifying adjectives are in the singular number. (Ps. 45:11; 147:5) In some places two plurals are used side by side to distinguish Jehovah by the plural of excellence from the numerous other lords.—Deut. 10:17; Ps. 136:3; compare 1 Corinthians 8:5, 6.
ʼA·dhohnʹ and ʼadho·nimʹ are used in referring to kings (1 Sam. 26:17), government officials (Gen. 45:9), owners of slaves (Gen. 39:2), husbands (Gen. 18:12), and fathers (Gen. 31:35). They are also used in respectful address (with the pronoun “my” affixed), corresponding to the English “sir.” (Gen. 19:2; 23:6) Angels who appeared to men were thus addressed also.—Judg. 6:13; Dan. 12:8.
The titles ʼA·dhohnʹ and ʼAdho·nimʹ are applied to Jehovah twenty-five times in the Scriptures. In nine places ʼA·dhohnʹ has the definite article ha before it, so limiting application of the title to Jehovah. (Ex. 23:17; 34:23; Isa. 1:24; 3:1; 10:16, 33; 19:4; Mic. 4:13; Mal. 3:1) At all six places where ʼA·dhohnʹ without the definite article refers to Jehovah it describes him as Lord (Owner) of the earth and so is not ambiguous. (Josh. 3:11, 13; Ps. 97:5; 114:7; Zech. 4:14; 6:5) At the ten places where ʼAdho·nimʹ is used of Jehovah the immediate context makes certain his identity.—Deut. 10:17; Neh. 8:10; 10:29; Ps. 8:1, 9; 135:5; 136:3; 147:5; Isa. 51:22; Hos. 12:14; see ADONAY.

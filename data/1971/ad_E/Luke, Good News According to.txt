LUKE, GOOD NEWS ACCORDING TO
An account primarily relating the events of Jesus’ earthly ministry. Its purpose was to present an accurate record in logical order, verifying the certainty of what Theophilus had been taught orally. (Luke 1:3, 4) As suggested by its having a place in the Bible canon, this record was also to benefit many other persons, both Jews and non-Jews. Whereas topical arrangement appears to predominate at times, this Gospel follows a chronological order in general outline.
WRITER AND TIME WRITTEN
Although not named therein, the physician Luke (Col. 4:14) has generally been credited with the writership of this account. There is written evidence to this effect from as early as the second century C.E., the Gospel being attributed to Luke in the Muratorian Fragment (c. 170 C.E.). Certain aspects of this Gospel may also be viewed as pointing to a well-educated physician as its writer. The vocabulary found therein is more extensive than that of the other three Gospels combined. At times the descriptions of afflictions healed by Jesus are more specific than in the other accounts.—Compare Matthew 8:14; Mark 1:30; Luke 4:38; Matthew 8:2; Mark 1:40; Luke 5:12.
It was evidently before writing the book of Acts that Luke completed his Gospel. (Acts 1:1, 2) Since he had accompanied Paul to Jerusalem at the end of the apostle’s third missionary journey (Acts 21:15-17), he would have been in a good position to trace accurately the things pertaining to Jesus Christ in the very land where the Son of God had carried out his activity. Following Paul’s arrest at Jerusalem and during Paul’s later imprisonment in Caesarea, Luke would have had many opportunities to interview eyewitnesses and to consult written records. So it is reasonable to conclude that the Gospel may have been written at Caesarea sometime during Paul’s confinement there for about two years (c. 56-58 C.E.).—Acts 21:30-33; 23:26-35; 24:27.
POINTS OF UNIQUENESS
As in the case of the three other Gospels, Luke’s account provides abundant evidence that Jesus is indeed the Christ the Son of God. It reveals Jesus to have been a man of prayer, one who relied fully on his heavenly Father. (Luke 3:21; 6:12-16; 11:1; 23:46) It contains numerous supplementary details, which, when combined with the three other Gospels, furnish a more complete picture of the events associated with Christ Jesus. Almost all of chapters 1 and 2 are without parallel in the other Gospels. Seven specific miracles and more than twice that number of illustrations are unique to the book. The miracles are: Jesus’ causing some of his disciples to have a miraculous catch of fish (5:1-6), his raising a widow’s son at Nain (7:11-15) and his healing a woman bent double (13:11-13), a man afflicted with dropsy (14:1-4), ten lepers (17:12-14) and the ear of the high priest’s slave (22:50, 51). Among the illustrations are: the two debtors (7:41-47), the neighborly Samaritan (10:30-35), the barren fig tree (13:6-9), the grand evening meal (14:16-24), the lost drachma coin (15:8, 9), the prodigal son (15:11-32), the unrighteous steward (16:1-8), the rich man and Lazarus (16:19-31), and the widow and the unrighteous judge (18:1-8).
Chronological material appearing in this Gospel aids in determining when John the Baptist and Jesus were born and when they began their respective ministries.—Luke 1:24-27; 2:1-7; 3:1, 2, 23; see REGISTRATION.
AUTHENTICITY
Indicative of the authenticity of Luke’s Gospel and the harmony between it and other Bible books are the numerous Hebrew Scripture references it contains and the quotations made therein from the Hebrew Scriptures. (Compare Luke 2:22-24; Exodus 13:2; Leviticus 12:8; Luke 3:3-6; Isaiah 40:3-5; Luke 7:27; Malachi 3:1; Luke 4:4, 8, 12; Deuteronomy 8:3; 6:13, 16; Luke 4:18, 19; Isaiah 61:1, 2.) Further testifying to the book’s authenticity is the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple.—Luke 19:41-44; 21:5, 6.

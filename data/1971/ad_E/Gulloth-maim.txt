GULLOTH-MAIM
(Gulʹloth-maʹim) [Heb., Gul·lothʹ maʹyim; perhaps, springs of water].
A site requested by Caleb’s daughter at the time of her marriage to Othniel. (Josh. 15:17-19; Judg. 1:13-15) Many versions render Gul·lothʹ maʹyim as “springs of water,” while “Upper Gul·lothʹ and Lower Gul·lothʹ” are generally translated ‘upper springs and lower springs.’ (See AV, JB, RS, Yg.) It may be noted, however, that Caleb’s daughter apparently did not simply desire “springs” from her father. She desired “a field,” according to Joshua 15:18. Thus Gul·lothʹ maʹyim is sometimes rendered “well-watered land.” (Kx; see also Dy.) Because of the uncertainty, some scholars choose to leave it untranslated, simply employing the transliterations “Gullath-maim” (AT) or “Gulloth-maim.” (NW) The exact location of Gulloth-maim is unknown.—See DEBIR No. 2.

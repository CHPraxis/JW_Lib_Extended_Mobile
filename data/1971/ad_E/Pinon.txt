PINON
(Piʹnon) [darkness].
One of the sheiks of Esau (Edom). (Gen. 36:40-43; 1 Chron. 1:51, 52) Some think these names are listings of places or settlements rather than individuals or that the names came to apply to the particular regions or cities ruled by the sheiks (“These are the sheiks of Edom according to their dwellings in the land”).—See TIMNA No. 3.

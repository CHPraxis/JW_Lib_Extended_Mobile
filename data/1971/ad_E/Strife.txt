STRIFE
A number of original-language words convey the basic idea of strife and contention. Among the causes for strife alluded to in the Scriptures are hatred (Prov. 10:12), rage (Prov. 15:18; 29:22), intrigues (Prov. 16:28), ridicule (Prov. 22:10), heavy drinking (Prov. 23:29, 30), slander (Prov. 26:20), arrogance or pride and lack of right teaching. (Prov. 28:25; 1 Tim. 6:4) Strife destroys peace and happiness. Its unpleassant and repelling effect on other persons is repeatedly highlighted in the book of Proverbs. (Prov. 19:13; 21:9, 19; 25:24; 27:15) Contentions between those who at one time enjoyed a brotherly relationship may present an almost insurmountable barrier to reconciliation. “A brother who is transgressed against is more than a strong town; and there are contentions that are like the bar of a dwelling tower.”—Prov. 18:19.
As one of the works of the flesh that is hated by Jehovah (Gal. 5:19, 20; compare Proverbs 6:19; Romans 1:28, 29, 32; James 3:14-16), strife or contention has no place in the Christian congregation (Rom. 13:13; 1 Cor. 3:3; 2 Cor. 12:20; Phil. 2:3; Titus 3:9), and one of the qualifications for a Christian overseer is that he be a nonbelligerent man. (1 Tim. 3:1, 3) Therefore, persons persisting in contention or strife are among those to receive God’s adverse judgment.—Rom. 2:6, 8.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul had to contend with persons who were given to strife. Some were declaring the good news out of contentiousness, probably with a view to making themselves prominent and undermining Paul’s authority and influence. But Paul did not permit this to take away his joy in seeing that Christ was being publicized.—Phil. 1:15-18.

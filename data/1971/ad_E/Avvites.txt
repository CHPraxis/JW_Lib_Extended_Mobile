AVVITES
(Avʹvites).
Inhabitants of Avva (see AVVA), who were among the peoples whom the Assyrians used to replace exiled Israelites after capturing Samaria in 740 B.C.E. (2 Ki. 17:24) All these transplanted inhabitants came to be known as Samaritans.
The Avvites, though learning the fear of Jehovah to some degree, nevertheless, made and worshiped the gods Nibhaz and Tartak.—2 Ki. 17:29-33.

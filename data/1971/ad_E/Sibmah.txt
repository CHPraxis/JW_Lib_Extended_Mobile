SIBMAH
(Sib πmah) [balsam].
A town E of the Jordan, taken by Israel from Amorite King Sihon and assigned to the Reubenites, who desired it because of surrounding pasturelands. Apparently it was also called Sebam. (Num. 32:2-5, 37, 38; Josh. 13:15, 19, 21) Originally a city of the Moabites (compare Numbers 21:25, 26), it reverted to them at an undisclosed time, and was noted for its vineyards and summer fruitage. (Isa. 16:8, 9, 13, 14; Jer. 48:32, 46, 47) The exact location of Sibmah (Sebam) is now unknown, though it is mentioned with Heshbon and Nebo (Num. 32:3), and Jerome said that it was only about 500 paces from Heshbon. However, some identify it with Qurn el-Kibsh, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) W-SW of the suggested site of Heshbon (modern Heshban) on the Wadi Salmah.

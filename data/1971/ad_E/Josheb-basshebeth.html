<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Joʹsheb-bas·sheʹbeth).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The head one of David’s three most outstanding mighty men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:8-10:23:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:8</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:11-13:11:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:11</a> he is called Jashobeam, which is probably the more correct form. There are other scribal difficulties with the text in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:8-10:23:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:8</a>, making it necessary for the obscure Hebrew in the Masoretic text (which appears to read, “He was Adino the Eznite”) to be corrected to read “He was brandishing his spear.” (<em>NW</em>) Other modern translations read similarly. (<em>AT, JB, Mo, Ro</em> ftn., <em>RS</em>) Thus Samuel is made to agree with the book of Chronicles and with the construction pattern in this section of material. It is “the three” that are being discussed, but to introduce another name, Adino, makes four. Additionally, each of the three mighty men has one of his deeds credited to him, so if the overpowering of the 800 were attributed to someone else, there would be no deed credited here to Josheb-basshebeth (Jashobeam).—See JASHOBEAM No. 2.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There is a possibility that the deed ascribed to Josheb-basshebeth at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:8-10:23:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:8</a> is not the same as that mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:11-13:11:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>. This may explain why the Samuel account speaks of 800 slain, whereas the Chronicles account refers to 300 slain.</p>

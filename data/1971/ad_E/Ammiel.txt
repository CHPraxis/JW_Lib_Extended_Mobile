AMMIEL
(Amʹmi·el) [my kinsman is God].
1. Son of Gemalli of the tribe of Dan. One of twelve sent out by Moses to spy out the land of Canaan. (Num. 13:12) He was among the ten spies who gave a bad report of the Promised Land and died by the scourge from Jehovah.—14:36, 37.
2. Father of Machir of Lo-debar in Transjordan. It was in the house of Machir that Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, was lodging when David desired to extend loving-kindness to him.—2 Sam. 9:4, 5, 7; 17:27.
3. Father of Bath-sheba, Uriah’s wife later taken by David. (1 Chron. 3:5) At 2 Samuel 11:3, he is called Eliam, which is simply a transposition of the same Hebrew letters. He was possibly the son of Ahithophel, the Gilonite, who was David’s counselor but who turned traitor.—2 Sam. 23:34; 15:31.
4. A Levite, the sixth son of Obed-edom. He was a gatekeeper who shared responsibility for the storehouses of the house of Jehovah, during David’s time.—1 Chron. 26:4, 5, 12-15.

AGAG
(Aʹgag).
1. Balaam, in his third prophetic utterance, foretold that a king of Israel would be “higher than Agag, and his kingdom will be lifted up.” (Num. 24:7) These words were spoken about 1473 B.C.E. and no subsequent reference is made to Agag until the reign of King Saul (1117-1077 B.C.E.). Because of this some authorities suggest that “Agag” was a title used by the kings of the Amalekites similar to the title of Pharaoh used by the kings of Egypt. It may also be simply a case of the repeated use of a personal name. At any rate the manner of Balaam’s reference to Agag indicates that his kingdom was at that time a powerful one.—Num. 24:20; see AMALEK, AMALEKITES.
2. The king of Amalek who was defeated by King Saul in fulfillment of Jehovah’s decree. (Ex. 17:14; Deut. 25:17-19; 1 Sam. 15:1-7) However, Saul failed to execute Agag and allowed the people to keep some of the spoil, and this resulted in Samuel’s pronouncement of God’s rejection of Saul as king. (1 Sam. 15:8-29) Agag was then executed by Samuel, who told him: “Just as your sword has bereaved women of children, in that way your mother will be most bereaved of children among women.”—1 Sam. 15:32, 33; compare Judges 1:5-7.

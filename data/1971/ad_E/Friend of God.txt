FRIEND OF GOD
Among the divine blessings bestowed upon Abraham was the privilege and honor of being called “Jehovah’s friend.” This was by reason of Abraham’s outstanding faith, which he demonstrated to the greatest degree possible in his willingness to offer up his son Isaac as a sacrifice.—Isa. 41:8; 2 Chron. 20:7; Jas. 2:21-23.
By proper use of “unrighteous riches” it is possible to make friends with Jehovah God and his Son, who can receive one into “the everlasting dwelling places,” as pointed out by Jesus Christ in his illustration about the unrighteous steward. (Luke 16:1-13) Jesus did, in fact, call his disciples his friends, and they were therefore also the friends of his Father. (John 15:13-15; 14:21) The requirements for being a guest in Jehovah’s tent as one of his friends are outlined in Psalm 15:1-5. In contrast, friendship with the world constitutes enmity with God. (Jas. 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17) Mankind as a whole is alienated from and at enmity with God. However, reconciliation is possible, but only through Jesus Christ and the ministry of reconciliation with which God has entrusted his Son’s ambassadors. Ultimately life everlasting will be the exclusive possession of the friends of God.—2 Cor. 5:18-20; Rev. 21:3, 4; Ps. 37:29.

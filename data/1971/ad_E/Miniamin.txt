MINIAMIN
(Mi·niʹa·min) [from the right hand].
1. One of the Levites serving under Kore in office of trust for the distribution of the holy contribution among their brothers at priests’ cities in King Hezekiah’s day.—2 Chron. 31:14, 15.
2. One of the priestly paternal houses existing in the time of High Priest Joiakim. (Neh. 12:12, 17) The “Mijamin” of Nehemiah 12:5 may have been its founder.
3. A priest among those with trumpets who participated in the ceremony for the inauguration of Jerusalem’s rebuilt wall in Nehemiah’s day. (Neh. 12:40, 41) He is possibly the priest called “Mijamin” at Nehemiah 10:7.

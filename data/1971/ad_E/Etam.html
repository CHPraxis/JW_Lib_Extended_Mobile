<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Eʹtam) [place of birds of prey].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A settlement of Simeonites within the territory of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:24-13:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:32-13:4:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 32</a>) Its location is uncertain, although some connect it with Khirbet ʽAitum, centrally located in Judah’s territory almost twenty-nine miles (46.7 kilometers) W of En-gedi and twenty-eight miles (45 kilometers) SW of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. The crag Etam, where Samson lived after burning the Philistines’ fields. From this crag, 3,000 men of Judah took him, willingly bound, back to the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:15:8-7:15:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 15:8-13</a>) Whereas no positive identification for the crag Etam is possible, a connection with the town (No. 3 below) cannot be altogether eliminated. However, just two and a half miles (4 kilometers) E-SE of the suggested site of Samson’s hometown Zorah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:2-7:13:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 13:2</a>) is ʽAraq Ismaʽin, an isolated crag with a lofty cavern affording a broad view of the Shephelah below. Appropriate to the meaning of the name, this may possibly be the site of the crag Etam.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. A town of Judah located probably at Khirbet el-Khokh, on a hill two miles (3.2 kilometers) SW of Bethlehem. Apparently Etam and Bethlehem had been settled by close relatives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:3-13:4:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:3, 4</a>; see ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) According to Josephus, King Solomon often took a morning chariot ride from Jerusalem those eight miles (13 kilometers) out to Etam, where there were gardens and streams. (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book VIII, chap. VII, par. 3) The town was rebuilt and fortified by Solomon’s successor Rehoboam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:5-14:11:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:5, 6</a>) To the W of here was a spring connected, according to the Talmud, by aqueduct with Jerusalem.</p>

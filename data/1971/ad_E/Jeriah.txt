(Je·riʹah) [founded of Jehovah; Jehovah sees].
Son or descendant of Kohath’s son Hebron. (1 Chron. 23:12, 19) Jeriah and/or his paternal house is mentioned in connection with David’s organization of the Levites (1 Chron. 24:23, 30, 31) and, when appointed over territory E of the Jordan, is called the head of the Hebronites. In this instance his name is spelled “Jerijah.”—1 Chron. 26:31, 32.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aʹnak) [long-necked].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name applied to the progenitor of a tribe of unusually tall men and probably to the tribe itself, since at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:22-4:13:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 13:22 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:13:28-4:13:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a> the article is used with the name in Hebrew. While it seems to be the personal name of the son of “Arba . . . the father of Anak” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:13-6:15:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 15:13</a>), it may be, instead, a descriptive name that first applied to Arba himself (as the original “longneck”) and thereafter to his progeny. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:14-6:15:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joshua 15:14</a> with 14:15, where Arba is called “the great man among the Anakim.”)—See ANAKIM.</p>

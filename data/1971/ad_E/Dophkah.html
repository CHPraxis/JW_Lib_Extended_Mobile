<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first stopping place for the Israelites after leaving the wilderness of Sin on their way to the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:33:12-4:33:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 33:12, 13</a>) The Bible does not indicate its exact geographical location. However, many scholars associate Dophkah with the Egyptian <em>mafkat,</em> a district named for the turquoise mined since ancient times around Serabit el-Khadim, about twenty miles (32.2 kilometers) E of modern-day Abu Zenima on the Sinai Peninsula.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of two rocks or toothlike crags associated with Jonathan’s victory over the Philistines recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:4-9:14:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Samuel 14:4-14</a>. Jonathan, looking for a passage to cross over to attack the Philistine outpost, saw the two crags, one on the N facing Michmash (where the Philistines were encamped), the other on the S facing Geba. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:16-9:13:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:5-9:14:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:5</a>) Between these two cities the Wadi Suweinit descends toward the Jordan and becomes a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs somewhat to the E of the cities. The location of the two crags is considered to have been at the point where the wadi makes a sharp bend, though the precise identification of the crags is conjectural. Nevertheless, in the book <em>The Romance of the Last Crusade,</em> by Major Vivian Gilbert of the British Army, the author presents the account of a brigade major in General Allenby’s army in Palestine who, upon receiving orders to take the village of Michmash, successfully employed the information in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:1-9:13:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Samuel chapters 13 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:1-9:14:52" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14</a> regarding these two crags to locate a pass up to the rocky prominence on which Michmash lay.</p>

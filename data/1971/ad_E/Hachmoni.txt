HACHMONI
(Hachʹmo·ni) [wise].
1. Ancestor of Zabdiel and his son Jashobeam. Jashobeam was the head one of David’s top three mighty men and is called “the son of a Hachmonite.” (1 Chron. 11:11; 27:2) “Hachmonite” is spelled “Tahchemonite” at 2 Samuel 23:8. If 1 Chronicles 12:6 refers to the same Jashobeam, the Hachmonites were descendants of the Levite Korah.—See JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH.
2. Father or ancestor of Jehiel. Jehiel was with King David’s sons, presumably as a tutor. (1 Chron. 27:32) Possibly the same as No. 1 above.

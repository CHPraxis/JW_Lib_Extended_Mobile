REPHAN
(Reʹphan).
An astral deity mentioned by Stephen in his defense before the Sanhedrin. (Acts 7:43) Stephen likely quoted from the Septuagint Version the words of Amos 5:26, 27, to show that Israel’s captivity resulted from their idolatry with foreign deities, such as Rephan (Kaiwan). The translators of the Septuagint rendered “Kaiwan” as Hrai·phanʹ, but in Stephen’s quotation the designation Hrom·phaʹ appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text. Hrai·phanʹ, as well as its variant Hrom·phaʹ, is considered to be the Egyptian designation for Saturn.—See ASTROLOGERS; KAIWAN.

CORINTHIANS, LETTERS TO THE
Two inspired canonical letters written by the apostle Paul to the Christians in Greece during the first century C. E. The letters stand in seventh and eighth places, respectively, in most English versions of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Paul identifies himself as the writer of both letters, addressing First Corinthians to “the congregation of God that is in Corinth,” and Second Corinthians to “the congregation of God that is in Corinth, together with all the holy ones who are in all of Achaia.”—1 Cor. 1:1, 2; 2 Cor. 1:1.
That Paul did indeed write First and Second Corinthians cannot be seriously questioned. In addition to the apostle’s own testimony, the authenticity and general acceptance of both letters are attested by external testimony. The two letters are ascribed to Paul by prominent writers of the first to the third centuries. Also, what is known as “The Canon of Athanasius” (367 C.E.) lists, among “fourteen letters of Paul the apostle,” “two to the Corinthians.” This list is the first example of the catalogue of books of the Christian Greek Scriptures as we have them today, preceding by thirty years the list published by the Council or Synod of Carthage, Africa, in 397 C.E.
CORINTH, AND PAUL’S MINISTRY THERE
In the days of Paul, Corinth was a great commercial center, known for its wealth, as well as being the capital of Achaia. (See CORINTH.) Gross immorality was practiced there, and it once even affected the Christian congregation in that city, the apostle finding it necessary to rebuke the congregation because among them arose a case of “such fornication as is not even among the nations,” for a certain man had taken his father’s wife. (1 Cor. 5:1-5) Corinth was noted for the splendor of its public buildings, theaters, temples and images of false gods and goddesses. According to the Greek geographer Strabo (who lived perhaps between 63 B.C.E. and 24 C.E.), there were no fewer than a thousand prostitutes or courtesans to be found at the temple of Aphrodite. In public prayers, the gods were petitioned to multiply the number of the city’s prostitutes.
The Isthmian Games were held on the isthmus where Corinth was situated. Being acquainted with such athletic contests, the Corinthian Christians would well appreciate Paul’s encouragement to run the Christian race with determination, the apostle informing them: “The way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air.”—1 Cor. 9:24-27.
Paul arrived in Corinth about 50 C.E. Initially he gave a talk in the synagogue every sabbath “and would persuade Jews and Greeks,” the Greeks in this case evidently being proselytes to the Jews’ religion. (Acts 18:1-4) However, after encountering opposition and abusive speech among those in the synagogue, the apostle turned his attention to “people of the nations,” the Gentiles in Corinth, and many “began to believe and be baptized.” Told by the Lord in a vision, “I have many people in this city,” the apostle remained there for a year and six months “teaching among them the word of God.” (Acts 18:5-11) Because Paul had been instrumental in establishing a Christian congregation in Corinth, he could say to them: “Though you may have ten thousand tutors in Christ, you certainly do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have become your father through the good news.”—1 Cor. 4:15.
FIRST CORINTHIANS
Time and place, and reasons for writing
During his third missionary tour Paul spent some time in Ephesus. (Acts 19:1) Probably during the last year of his stay there, the apostle received disturbing news about conditions in the Corinthian congregation. Paul had been told “by those of the house of Chloe” that dissensions existed among the Corinthians. (1 Cor. 1:11) Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus had also come from Corinth and may have provided some information about the situation there. (1 Cor. 16:17, 18) Also, Paul had received a letter of inquiry from the Christian congregation in Corinth. (1 Cor. 7:1) Hence, out of deep regard for the spiritual welfare of his fellow believers there, Paul wrote this first letter to the Christian congregation in Corinth, about 55 C.E. That Ephesus was the place of composition is made certain by Paul’s words recorded at 1 Corinthians 16:8: “But I am remaining in Ephesus until the festival of Pentecost.”
In the introduction to First Corinthians Paul mentions an associate, Sosthenes, who may have penned the letter as dictated by Paul. This is likely, since toward its conclusion we read: “Here is my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand.”—1 Cor. 1:1; 16:21.

SECOND CORINTHIANS
Time and place of writing
Paul wrote his second letter to the Corinthians probably during the late summer or early autumn of 55 C.E. The apostle had written the first letter in Ephesus, where he probably stayed as planned, until Pentecost of that year, or longer. (1 Cor. 16:8) Paul then departed for Troas, where he was disappointed in not meeting Titus, who had been sent to Corinth to assist in the collection for the holy ones in Judea. So Paul proceeded to Macedonia, where Titus joined him with a report on the Corinthians’ reaction to his first letter. (2 Cor. 2:12, 13; 7:5-7) Paul then wrote the second letter to them from Macedonia, evidently dispatching it by the hand of Titus. Then, after a few months, his efforts to visit Corinth materialized. So Paul actually visited the Corinthians twice. After his first visit, at which time he established the congregation, he made a plan for a second visit, which failed. But “the third time” that he planned or got “ready” he was successful, for he was able to see them again in 56 C.E. (2 Cor. 1:15; 12:14; 13:1) During this second visit in Corinth he wrote his letter to the Romans.
Reasons for writing
Titus brought Paul a favorable report. The first letter to the Corinthians had awakened in them sadness in a godly way, repentance, earnestness, a desire to clear themselves, indignation fear and a righting of the wrong. Paul responded in his second letter commending them for their favorable reception and application of counsel, urging them to “kindly forgive and comfort” the repentant man they had evidently expelled from the congregation. (2 Cor. 7:8-12; 2:1-11; compare 1 Corinthians 5:1-5.) Paul also wanted to encourage them to proceed further with the relief work for their needy fellow believers in Judea. (2 Cor. 8:1-15) Then, too, there were persons in the congregation who continued to challenge Paul’s position and authority as an apostle, making it necessary for him to defend his apostolic position; really, it was not for himself, but “it was for God,” that is, to save the congregation that belonged to God, that Paul spoke very strongly in his letter, and ‘boasted’ of his credentials as an apostle.—2 Cor. 5:12, 13; 10:7-12; 11:16-20, 30-33; 12:11-13.

LIGHT SHED ON SCRIPTURES PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN
Paul fortified his arguments by use of the Hebrew Scriptures in his inspired letters to the Corinthians. When exposing the foolishness of worldly wisdom as displayed by the false apostles he proved the importance of getting the superior wisdom of God by pointing out what the psalmist had said to a generation centuries before, that “the thoughts of men . . . are as an exhalation” (Ps. 94:11; 1 Cor. 3:20), and by asking what Isaiah had asked the rebellious Jews: “Who has taken the proportions of the spirit of Jehovah, and who . . . can make him know anything?” (Isa. 40:13; 1 Cor. 2:16) Paul proved that the Christian minister has a right to receive material aid by showing that Deuteronomy 25:4, “You must not muzzle a bull while it is threshing,” really was written primarily for the ministers’ sakes. (1 Cor. 9:9, 10) He demonstrated that God had long ago promised a resurrection, by calling on the statements at Isaiah 25:8 and Hosea 13:14, about swallowing up death. (1 Cor. 15:54, 55) Additionally, he shed much light on the Lord’s evening meal by his detailed discussion of Jesus’ words spoken at the time He established the observance.—Luke 22:19, 20; 1 Cor. 11:23-34.
Paul demonstrated what God’s attitude had always been as to spiritual cleanness by quoting from or alluding to Deuteronomy 17:7; Leviticus 26:11, 12; Isaiah 43:6; 52:11 and Hosea 1:10. (1 Cor. 5:13; 2 Cor. 6:14-18) He showed that the matter of material giving had not been overlooked by God’s servants in the past and that the generous Christian is viewed favorably by Jehovah. (Ps. 112:9; 2 Cor. 9:9) And he indicated that the principle in the Law of establishing every matter at the mouth of two or three witnesses applies in the Christian congregation. (Deut. 19:15; 2 Cor. 13:1) These and other references to scriptures written beforehand illustrate these texts and clarify their application for us.—See the book “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,” pp. 208-216.

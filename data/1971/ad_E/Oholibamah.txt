OHOLIBAMAH
(O·hol·i·baʹmah) [tent of the high place].
1. A Canaanite wife of Esau. She bore him three sons, Jeush, Jalam and Korah, all of whom became sheiks of Edom. Oholibamah was a daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Hivite Zibeon.—Gen. 36:2, 5-8, 14, 18, 25.
2. The designation for an Edomite sheik; some scholars would apply these listed names to places, believing they should read “the sheik of Oholibamah,” etc.—Gen. 36:40, 41; 1 Chron. 1:51, 52.

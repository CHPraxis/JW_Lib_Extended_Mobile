<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Zephʹa·thah) [watchtower].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A valley near Mareshah where Jehovah enabled the forces of Judah’s King Asa to defeat those of Zerah the Ethiopian (967-966 B.C.E.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:9-14:14:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:9-12</a>) Zephathah is apparently represented by the modern Wadi Zeita, which, at one point, comes to within about a mile (c. 1.6 kilometers) N of the suggested site of Mareshah. The Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> has been translated to read “in the valley north of Maresa” (Bagster), but “Zephathah” appears in the Hebrew Masoretic text.</p>

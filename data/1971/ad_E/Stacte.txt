STACTE
One of the ingredients of the incense limited to sacred use. (Ex. 30:34-37) The stacte drops perhaps were the product of the storax, a tree that exudes a brown, vanilla-flavored resin from incisions made in its stem and branches. Another possible source for stacte may be the opobalsam, a shrublike evergreen tree yielding a greenish-yellow oily resin.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An inferior kind of wheat, the kernels of which are not readily separated from the chaff. Spelt was anciently cultivated in Egypt (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:9:32-2:9:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 9:32</a>), where, according to the Greek historian Herodotus (Book II, par. 39), it was made into bread. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:4:9-26:4:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:9</a>.) The Israelites seem to have planted it as a border around their fields to serve as a kind of fence.â€”<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:25-23:28:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 28:25</a>.</p>

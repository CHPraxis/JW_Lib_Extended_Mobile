ANAMMELECH
(A·namʹme·lech).
A deity of the Sepharvites that proved unable to deliver them from the Assyrian aggressors. (2 Ki. 18:34) The worship of Anammelech included the revolting practice of child sacrifice.—2 Ki. 17:31.
It has been suggested that the name “Anammelech” may be understood to mean “Anu-melekh,” that is, the Babylonian sky-god Anu worshiped in the manner of the Ammonite god Melekh (Molech).—Compare 1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:10; Jeremiah 7:31.

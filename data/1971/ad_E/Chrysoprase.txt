CHRYSOPRASE
(chrysʹo·prase).
A semiprecious, translucent gemstone, an apple-green variety of chalcedony. The color is caused by a trace of nickel oxide in the mineral. Superstitious persons once believed that the stone possessed power to cure eye diseases.
The only Biblical reference to chrysoprase is in Revelation, where it is mentioned as constituting the tenth foundation of the wall of “the holy city, New Jerusalem.”—Rev. 21:2, 20.

EUNICE
(Euʹnice) [blessed with victory; good victory].
A believing Jewess, the daughter of Lois. She was the wife of an unbelieving Greek and the mother of Timothy. (Acts 16:1) Very likely the apostle Paul met Eunice at Lystra in Asia Minor on his first missionary tour, and it was then, as a result of his preaching, that she and her mother Lois became Christians. (Acts 14:4-18) The faith of Eunice was “without any hypocrisy.” (2 Tim. 1:5) Although married to a pagan husband, she was exemplary in teaching her son Timothy the “holy writings” from his “infancy” and, upon becoming a Christian, she doubtless instructed him accordingly. (2 Tim. 3:15) Since Eunice’s husband was a Greek, Timothy’s parents had not had him circumcised.—Acts 16:3.

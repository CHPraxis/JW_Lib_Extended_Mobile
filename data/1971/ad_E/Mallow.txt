MALLOW
This translates the Hebrew word ʼo·rohthʹ (2 Ki. 4:39; Isa. 26:19), considered to be the plural of ʼoh·rahʹ, “light.” (Esther 8:16; Ps. 139:12) According to Koehler and Baumgartner’s Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros, ʼo·rothʹ denotes the dwarf mallow (Malva rotundifolia). This identification is based on the fact that this plant is very sensitive to light, hence perhaps the Hebrew designation ʼo·rohthʹ, “light-[herb].” Also, its fruit is edible, thus harmonizing with 2 Kings 4:39. The dwarf mallow is a creeping plant having nearly round, somewhat lobed, saw-edged leaves with long leafstalks. Its flowers are only about a half inch (c. 1.3 centimeters) across and vary in color from pale blue to white. The flat and circular mucilaginous fruits are commonly called “cheeses.”

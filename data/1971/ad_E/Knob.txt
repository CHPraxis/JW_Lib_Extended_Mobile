KNOB
An ornamental part of the golden lampstand used in the Tabernacle; designated by the Hebrew word Kaph·tohrʹ (or, kaph·torʹ), evidently referring to a round protrusion. (Ex. 25:31-36; 37:17-22) These “knobs” alternated with the ornamental blossoms on the main stem and each of the six branches of the lampstand. Some of the knobs seem to have formed a boss or projecting support for these branches. They are discernible on the lampstand as depicted in the relief on the Arch of Titus (in Rome), where Roman soldiers are shown carrying spoils from the temple in Jerusalem, destroyed in 70 C.E.

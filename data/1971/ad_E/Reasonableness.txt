REASONABLENESS
“Reasonable” appropriately conveys the thought of the Greek word e·pi·ei·kesʹ, which has been defined as meaning “seemly, fitting; hence, equitable, fair, moderate, forbearing, not insisting on the letter of the law; it expresses that considerateness that looks ‘humanely and reasonably at the facts of a case.’”—An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words (Vol. II, pp. 144, 145) by W. E. Vine.
Reasonableness is a distinctive feature of heavenly wisdom. (Jas. 3:17) It is a quality that a man who is appointed as an overseer in a Christian congregation must have. (1 Tim. 3:2, 3) He would have to be reasonable with himself, in dealing with others and in his view of problems. Also, Christians generally are encouraged to be reasonable. The apostle Paul counseled the Philippians: “Let your reasonableness become known to all men.” (Phil. 4:5) And Titus was instructed to remind the Christians of Crete “to be reasonable.” (Titus 3:1, 2) This was especially fitting, since the inhabitants of Crete as a whole had the reputation of being liars, injurious wild beasts and unemployed gluttons.—Titus 1:12.
At 1 Peter 2:18 house servants are admonished to “be in subjection to their owners with all due fear, not only to the good and reasonable, but also to those hard to please.”

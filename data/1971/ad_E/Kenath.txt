KENATH
(Keʹnath) [possibly, possession].
A site E of the Jordan captured by Nobah, probably a Manassite, who thereafter called it by his own name. (Num. 32:42) But the designation “Nobah” perhaps did not stick, for later “Kenath” is reported to have been taken by Geshur and Syria. (1 Chron. 2:23) Most geographers today link Kenath with the ruins at Qanawat (or Canatha, about fifty miles [80 kilometers] SE of Damascus), one of the original ten cities of the Decapolis.

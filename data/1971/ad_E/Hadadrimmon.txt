HADADRIMMON
(Ha·dad·rimʹmon).
Evidently a location in the valley plain of Megiddo. (Zech. 12:11) Hadadrimmon is often identified with Rummaneh, a site about four and a half miles (7 kilometers) S-SE of Megiddo.
The ‘great wailing’ at Hadadrimmon mentioned in Zechariah’s prophecy perhaps alludes to the lamentation over King Josiah, killed in battle at Megiddo. (2 Ki. 23:29; 2 Chron. 35:24, 25) But some associate this lamentation with ritualistic mourning ceremonies like those for the false god Tammuz (compare Ezekiel 8:14), and consider “Hadadrimmon” to be the composite name of a god. This is unlikely, especially since Jehovah’s words, through Zechariah, are part of a prophecy concerning the Messiah. Hardly could idolatrous weeping ceremonies serve as a prophetic illustration; but the mourning for a faithful Judean king could well do so.—Compare John 19:37; Revelation 1:7 with Zechariah 12:10-14.

GIRZITES
(Girʹzites).
A people who were among the victims of a raid that David and his 600 men made during their sixteen-month stay with the Philistines. David took much livestock as spoil, but did not preserve any of the Girzites alive. Probably nomads, the Girzites lived in the territory S of Judah in the general direction of Egypt.—1 Sam. 27:2, 7-9.

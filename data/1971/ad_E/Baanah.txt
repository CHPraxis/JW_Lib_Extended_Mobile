BAANAH
(Baʹa·nah) [son of distress].
1. A son of Rimmon the Benjamite. He and his brother Rechab were chiefs of marauding bands belonging to Saul’s son Ish-bosheth. Baanah and his brother murdered Ish-bosheth while he was taking a siesta, but when they brought his head to David, who had recently been installed as king, he ordered them killed and their hands and feet cut off, and had them hanged by the pool in Hebron.—2 Sam. 4:2-12.
2. Father of one of David’s mighty men, Heleb the Netophathite.—2 Sam. 23:29; 1 Chron. 11:30.
3. One who was possibly a leader of those returning from Babylonian captivity with Zerubbabel.—Ezra 2:2; Neh. 7:7.
4. One of the “heads of the people” whose descendant, if not himself, attested to Nehemiah’s “trustworthy arrangement.” (Neh. 9:38; 10:14, 27) He may be the same as No. 3, above.

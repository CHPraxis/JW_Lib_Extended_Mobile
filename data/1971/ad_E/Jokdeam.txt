JOKDEAM
(Jokʹde·am.) [people’s burning].
A city in the mountainous region of Judah. (Josh. 15:20, 48, 56) It may be the same as Jorkeam (1 Chron. 2:44), for in Vatican Manuscript No. 1209 this name replaces “Jokdeam” at Joshua 15:56. The site is perhaps to be identified with Khirbet Raqaʽ, about four and a half miles (c. 7 kilometers) S of Hebron.

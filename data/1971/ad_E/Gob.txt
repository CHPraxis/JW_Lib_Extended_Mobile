GOB
[pit, or, locust].
A site where David’s men twice struck down giant warriors of the Philistines’ forces, (2 Sam. 21:18, 19) The parallel narrative at 1 Chronicles 20:4 lists the place of the first encounter as “Gezer” (“Gath” in some copies of the Greek Septuagint and Syriac versions), while leaving the place of the second encounter unnamed. (20:5) Both accounts, however, show that a third confrontation took place at “Gath” (2 Sam. 21:20; 1 Chron. 20:6), and therefore many scholars have assumed that “Gob” is a scribal error for “Gath.” To others, however, it seems unlikely that such an oversight would occur twice in consecutive verses and they conclude that Gob may simply have been the name of a now unidentified site near Gezer.

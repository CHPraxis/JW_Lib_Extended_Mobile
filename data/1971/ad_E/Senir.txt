SENIR
(Seʹnir) [possibly, coat of mail].
The Amorite name for Mount Hermon. (Deut. 3:9) Since 1 Chronicles 5:23 mentions “Senir and Mount Hermon,” the name “Senir” may also have been used to denote a part of the Hermon or Anti-Lebanon range. Senir was a source of juniper timbers (Ezek. 27:5) and a haunt of lions and leopards. (Song of Sol. 4:8) One Assyrian inscription describes Senir (Sa-ni-ru) as “a mountain, facing the Lebanon.”—See HERMON.

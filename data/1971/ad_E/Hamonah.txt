HAMONAH
(Ha·moʹnah) [crowd, the feminine form of Ha·mohn’].
A symbolic city in the vicinity of the valley in which Gog and his crowd are to be buried, after their combined attack on God’s people ends in defeat and mass slaughter. The city derives its name from that circumstance, as a memorial of Jehovah’s victory over these foes. (Ezek. 39:16) A city implies an organized body of persons, here apparently relating to the organization for bone disposal described in Ezekiel 39:11-15.—See GOG No. 2.

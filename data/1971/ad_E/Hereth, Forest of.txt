HERETH, FOREST OF
(Heʹreth).
One of David’s hiding places while pursued by Saul. (1 Sam. 22:5) The “forest of Hereth” was apparently named after a town in its locality. This may be identified with modern-day Kharas, about three and a half miles (5.6 kilometers) S-SE of the suggested site of Adullam (vs. 1) and NW of Hebron.

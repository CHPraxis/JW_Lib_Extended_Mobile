<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Eʹder) [drove, flock].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. A descendant of Beriah of the tribe of Benjamin who dwelt in Jerusalem.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:1-13:8:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:15-13:8:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15, 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:8:28-13:8:28" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A descendant of Mushi of the Levitical family of Merari, assigned to priestly service during the time of David.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:23:21-13:23:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 23:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:23:23-13:23:25" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:24:30-13:24:30" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 24:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. A city in the southern part of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:21-6:15:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 15:21</a>) Since the <em>Septuagint</em> has <em>“A·raʹ”</em> instead of “Eder” in this text, most geographers consider them identical, locating both at Tell Arad, twenty-two and a half miles (36.2 kilometers) E-NE of Beer-sheba.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">4. A tower near which Jacob (Israel) pitched his tent sometime after the death of Rachel. Although its exact location is not known, it was apparently located some place between Bethlehem and Heron. The name Eder (meaning “drove” or “flock”) indicates it provided shelter for shepherds and served as a watchtower from which they could oversee their flocks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:19-1:35:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 35:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:21-1:35:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:27-1:35:27" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 27</a>) While tenting here, his son Reuben “profaned [Jacob’s] lounge,” having relations with Jacob’s concubine Bilhah.—Vs. 22; 49:3, 4.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The same Hebrew expression here translated “tower of Eder” (<em>migh·dal-ʽeʹdher</em>) is used by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:8-33:4:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Micah (4:8</a>) when referring to the “tower of the drove.” This expression may allude to the name of Jacob’s camping site, and is used in connection with the restoration of Jehovah’s “limping” people. (Vs. 7) With “Zion” restored they would be watched over as from a lookout “tower” and thereby be guarded from further danger. Such an illustration is consistent with other similes in Micah’s prophecy, he referring to the Messiah as one who would do “shepherding” (5:2-4) and Jehovah’s people as “the flock of [God’s] inheritance.”—7:14.</p>

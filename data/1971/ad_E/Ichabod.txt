ICHABOD
(Ichʹa·bod) [Where is the glory?].
Posthumous son of Phinehas and brother of Ahitub; grandson of High Priest Eli. The name Ichabod, given to him by his dying mother while giving birth, signified that glory had gone away from Israel in view of the capture of the Ark and the deaths of Phinehas and Eli.—1 Sam. 4:17-22; 14:3.

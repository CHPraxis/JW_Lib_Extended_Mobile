<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After being attacked by Gideon’s forces, the enemy Midianites fled “as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:12-7:7:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 7:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:19-7:7:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19-22</a>) Tabbath is usually identified with Ras Abu Tabat, about three miles (c. 5 kilometers) E of the Jordan River and six miles (c. 10 kilometers) N of the suggested site of Succoth. Abel-meholah apparently was W of the Jordan and is spoken of as “by [opposite, <em>JB</em>] Tabbath.”—See ABEL-MEHOLAH.</p>

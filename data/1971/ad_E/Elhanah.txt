ELHANAN
(El·haʹnan) [God is gracious].
1. The son of Jair who, in war with the Philistines, struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite. (1 Chron. 20:5) In 2 Samuel 21:19 Elhanan is identified as the “son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite.” However, it is generally agreed that the original reading of 2 Samuel 21:19 corresponded to 1 Chronicles 20:5, the difference in the two texts having arisen through scribal error.—See LAHMI.
2. Son of Dodo of Bethlehem; one of David’s mighty men.—2 Sam. 23:24; 1 Chron. 11:26.

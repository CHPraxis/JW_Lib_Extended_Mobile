<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Scriptures richly abound in references to forms of posture and gestures, the descriptions in the Bible being sufficient to show that they were much the same as those practiced in the Middle East today. These Orientals are considerably more demonstrative and less inhibited in the expression of their feelings than are many of the Western peoples. Either accompanied by words or without words, attitudes and gestures carried considerable force and meaning.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>PRAYER AND HOMAGE</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Standing</em>. Among the Hebrews and many of the other nations mentioned in the Bible there was no set form of posture for prayer. All the attitudes assumed were highly respectful. Standing was a common posture. Jesus spoke of this position for prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:25-41:11:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 11:25</a>) Jesus was evidently standing immediately after being baptized and was praying when the heaven was opened up and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, God’s own voice speaking from the heavens.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 3:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>Kneeling</em> was a common attitude of prayer. Jesus himself knelt in the Garden of Gethsemane. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:41-42:22:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:41</a>) In representing the nation of Israel in prayer Solomon knelt at the inauguration of the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:54-11:8:54" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:54</a>) While many of the instances in the Bible use the word “knees” in the plural, it may be that at times a person would kneel upon one knee, as is done sometimes by modern Orientals.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:40-44:9:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 9:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:36-44:20:36" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:5-44:21:5" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:14-49:3:14" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Eph. 3:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Bowing.</em> The Jews, wherever they were found, when worshiping turned their faces toward the city of Jerusalem and its temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:42-11:8:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:44-11:8:44" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:10-27:6:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Dan. 6:10</a>) In Ezekiel’s vision he saw twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, bowing with their faces toward the E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:8:16-26:8:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 8:16</a>) Temples of the sun worshipers were built in such a manner that the entrance was on the W side, making the worshipers face E on entering. But the temple of Jehovah was built with the entrance in the E so that the worshipers of Jehovah there turned their backs on the place of the rising of the sun.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>Extending the arms.</em> In both the postures of standing and kneeling, the palms of the hands would sometimes be spread out to the heavens or the hands would be lifted up or extended forward as in supplication. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:22-11:8:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:6:13-14:6:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 6:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:6-16:8:6" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Neh. 8:6</a>) The face would sometimes be uplifted (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:26-18:22:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 22:26</a>), or <span id="page163" class="pageNum" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span>one might lift up his eyes toward the heavens.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:19-40:14:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 14:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:34-41:7:34" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Mark 7:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:1-43:17:1" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> John 17:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Sitting and prostrating.</em> Sitting was another posture employed in prayer, the petitioner evidently kneeling and then sitting back upon his heels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:16-13:17:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chron. 17:16</a>) From this position he could bow his head or rest it on his bosom. Or, as Elijah did, he might crouch to the earth and put his face between his knees. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:42-11:18:42" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 18:42</a>) ‘Falling down’ or ‘falling on one’s face’ is often the way the Scriptures express one’s prostrating himself. This was usually done by falling on the knees and bowing forward, resting on the hands or, more often, the elbows, with the head touching the ground. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:26-1:24:26" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 24:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:48-1:24:48" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:6-16:8:6" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Neh. 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:22-4:16:22" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Num. 16:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:45-4:16:45" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:39-40:26:39" data-bid="13-6" class="b"> Matt. 26:39</a>) In great sorrow or very fervent prayer the petitioner might actually lie on his face with his body outstretched. In cases of extreme distress, the petitioner might wear sackcloth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:21:16-13:21:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 21:16</a>) False worshipers also bowed down before their idols. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:25:2-4:25:2" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Num. 25:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:18-12:5:18" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:5-27:3:12" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Dan. 3:5-12</a>) Additionally, false worshipers would often kiss their idols.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:18-11:19:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Religious gestures toward an object.</em> Job pointed out the danger of letting one’s heart be enticed toward some object of reverence such as the sun or the moon to the point of making a gesture toward it, placing one’s hand to one’s mouth in a kiss as was done by pagan moon worshipers and those giving homage to idols. Job realized that this was a denial of the true God and would require an accounting for such error.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:31:26-18:31:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Christian postures for prayer.</em> Jesus prayed publicly, in sincerity, as did Paul and others. He also recommended private prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:5-40:6:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 6:5, 6</a>) But Jesus condemned ostentatiousness in making long prayers for a pretense, a practice into which some of the scribes had fallen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:40-41:12:40" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 12:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:20:47-42:20:47" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 20:47</a>) However, Christians adopted many of the customs and practices of the Jewish synagogue of which God did not disapprove, and the same attitudes and postures of prayer are mentioned in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Nowhere do they give support to the facial or bodily attitude of assumed piety and sanctimoniousness, making any given posture essential, such as placing the palms together or clasping the hands when offering prayer, as many of the artists of Christendom have depicted. In fact, prayers can be made silently and completely without outward manifestation, when the individual is carrying on an assigned duty or is faced with an emergency. Christians are told to carry on prayer “with every form of prayer and supplication.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:18-49:6:18" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 6:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RESPECT, HUMILITY</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>Kneeling</em>. The attitudes and postures of the Orientals in expressing respect for one another and especially when petitioning superiors were much the same as the attitudes practiced in prayer. We find examples of kneeling in supplication before others. This was not in worship of the superior person, but in acknowledgment of that one’s position or office, with deep respect.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:14-40:17:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 17:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:40-41:1:40" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mark 1:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:17" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 10:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:1:13-12:1:13" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 1:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Bowing</em> was more frequently used in greeting others or in approaching them on a matter of business or in displaying a high degree of respect. Jacob bowed seven times on meeting Esau. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:33:3-1:33:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 33:3</a>) Solomon, even though he was king, showed respect to his mother by bowing to her.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:2:19-11:2:19" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Bowing could also be a symbol of acknowledgment of defeat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:14-23:60:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 60:14</a>) Those persons defeated might appear before their conqueror in sackcloth and, additionally, with ropes upon their heads in an appeal for mercy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:20:31-11:20:32" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:31, 32</a>) Some think that the ropes mentioned were put about their necks to symbolize their captivity and submission.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Although it was a common thing for the Jews to bow before authority to show respect, Mordecai refused to bow before Haman. This was because Haman, as an Agagite, was very likely an Amalekite, concerning whom Jehovah had said that he would completely wipe out their remembrance from under the heavens and that he would have war with Amalek from generation to generation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:14-2:17:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14-16</a>) Since bowing down or prostration would have a connotation of peace toward Haman, and possibly because the Persians considered such act a gesture of homage or worship, Mordecai refused to perform this act, because he would have violated God’s command in doing so.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:5-17:3:5" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><em>Prostrating.</em> Joshua prostrated himself before an angel, “as prince of the army of Jehovah,” not in worship, but in acknowledgment of the superior office the angel held and of the fact that the angel was obviously sent from Jehovah with a command for him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:14-6:5:14" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Josh. 5:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When Jesus was on earth, persons would prostrate themselves before him to petition and to do obeisance to him and he did not reprove them. This was because he was the appointed King, the King-designate, as he himself said: “God’s royal majesty has approached” (<em>ED</em>); “The kingdom of God has drawn near.” (<em>NW,</em> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:15-41:1:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mark 1:15</a>) Jesus was the heir to the throne of David and therefore was rightfully honored as a king.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:9-40:21:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 21:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:13-43:12:15" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> John 12:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">However, the apostles of Jesus Christ refused to permit others to prostrate themselves before them. This was for the reason that, in the instances described, prostration was done as an attitude of worship, as though the power of the holy spirit in the apostles, which performed the healing and other powerful works, was their own. The apostles realized that the power was from God and that credit for these things should be given to him and all worship directed toward Jehovah through Jesus Christ, of whom they were merely the representatives.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:25-44:10:26" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 10:25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In connection with the respect paid to Jesus, the word often used is <em>pro·sky·neʹo,</em> a word having the basic meaning of doing obeisance, but variously translated as “to worship, bow to the ground, fall prostrate,” Jesus was not accepting worship, which belongs to God alone (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>), but recognized the act of the one doing obeisance as recognition of the authority given Him by God. The angel whom Jesus Christ sent to bring the Revelation to John expressed the principle that man’s worship belongs only to God, when he refused to accept worship from John.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10</a>; see WORSHIP.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Covering the head</em> was a sign of respect on the part of women. This custom was followed in the Christian congregation. In discussing the principle of Christian headship the apostle Paul stated: “Every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames the one who is her head . . . That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:10" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3-10</a>; see HEADSHIP.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Removing one’s sandals</em> was a gesture of respect or reverence. Moses was commanded to do this at the burning bush and Joshua in the presence of an angel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:5-2:3:5" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ex. 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:5:15-6:5:15" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Josh. 5:15</a>) Since the tabernacle and the temple were holy places, the priests are said to have performed their duties at the sanctuary barefooted. Likewise, the loosening of the laces of another person’s sandals or bearing his sandals for him was considered a menial duty and an expression of one’s humility and consciousness of insignificance when contrasted with his master. It is still a practice in the East that, when one enters a house, his sandals are taken off, sometimes by a servant.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 3:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:27-43:1:27" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> John 1:27</a>; see SANDAL.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><em>Pouring water on another’s hands.</em> Elisha was identified as the minister or servant of Elijah by the expression “[he] poured out water upon the hands of Elijah.” This was a service performed particularly after meals. In the East it was not the <span id="page164" class="pageNum" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>custom to use knives and forks, but fingers, and the servant would afterward pour water over the hands of his master to wash them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:3:11-12:3:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">2 Ki. 3:11</a>) A similar practice was the washing of feet, performed as an act of hospitality, also of respect and, in certain relationships, of humility.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:5-43:13:5" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 13:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:32-1:24:32" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Gen. 24:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:24-1:43:24" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 43:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:10-54:5:10" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>AGREEMENT, SHARING TOGETHER</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><em>Handshaking or striking the palms</em> of the hands were gestures employed to express agreement, ratification or confirmation of a contract or bargain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:19-15:10:19" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ezra 10:19</a>) The Scriptures warn against doing this in guaranteeing security of a loan for another person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:1-20:6:3" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Prov. 6:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:18-20:17:18" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 17:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:26-20:22:26" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 22:26</a>) Joint participation or sharing together was also denoted by a handshake or grasping of another’s hand.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:15-12:10:15" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:9-48:2:9" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Gal. 2:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>BLESSING</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><em>Putting hands on head; lifting hands.</em> Since the Hebrew word <em>ba·rakhʹ</em> has to do with both bending the knees and kneeling and blessing, it is probable that persons when receiving a blessing knelt down and bowed themselves toward the one giving the blessing. Then the one blessing would put his hands on the head of the one being blessed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:48:13-1:48:14" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Gen. 48:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:16-41:10:16" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Mark 10:16</a>) In bestowing a blessing upon a group of people, it was common to lift the hands toward them as the blessing was uttered.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:9:22-3:9:22" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Lev. 9:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:50-42:24:50" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Luke 24:50</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>SWEARING</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><em>Raising hand</em>; <em>placing hand under thigh.</em> In making an oath it was customary to raise the right hand. God speaks of himself as doing this, symbolically. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:40-5:32:40" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Deut. 32:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:62:8-23:62:8" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Isa. 62:8</a>) The angel in Daniel’s vision raised both his right hand and his left to heaven to utter an oath. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:7-27:12:7" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Dan. 12:7</a>) Another method of confirming an oath was to place one’s hand under the other’s thigh (hip), as Abraham’s steward did in swearing that he would get a wife for Isaac from Abraham’s relatives (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:2-1:24:2" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Gen. 24:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:9-1:24:9" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 9</a>), and as Joseph did for Jacob in swearing not to bury Jacob in Egypt.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:47:29-1:47:31" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Gen. 47:29-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">There is some obscurity about the exact significance of this method of swearing. The word “thigh” is from the Hebrew <em>ya·rekhʹ,</em> which in its appearances in the Hebrew Scriptures is most often translated “thigh,” sometimes “side,” as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:22-2:40:22" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Exodus 40:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:24-2:40:24" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 24</a>, and less often “loins,” in which cases it usually is used in a euphemistic sense. It applies to the upper part of the leg from the hip to the knee, in which the femur is located.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">A form of the same Hebrew word is also used in the case of Jacob where the angel “touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint by the sinew of the thigh nerve” and left him crippled.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:32:32-1:32:32" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Gen. 32:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">We can be sure that there was no phallic connotation in the actions of Abraham and Jacob, as some claim, for all phallic practices were abhorred by the faithful Hebrews. According to the Jewish rabbi Rashbam, this method was used when a superior adjured an inferior, such as a master his servant or a father his son, who also owes him obedience. And according to another Jewish scholar, Abraham Ibn Ezra, it was the custom in those days for a servant to take an oath in this manner, placing his hand under his master’s thigh, the latter sitting upon his hand. This signified that the servant was under his master’s authority.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>GRIEF, SHAME</strong></p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span id="page165" class="pageNum" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span><em>The laying on of hands</em> was a method of designating the appointment of a person to an office or duty, as in the case of the seven men who were appointed by the apostles to care for the food distribution in the congregation at Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:6-44:6:6" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Acts 6:6</a>) Timothy was appointed to a position of oversight by the body of older men in the congregation.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">The laying on of hands also had other significances, one being the acknowledgment of something, as at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:10-2:29:10" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Exodus 29:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:15-2:29:15" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 15</a>, where Aaron and his sons acknowledged the sacrifices as being offered in their behalf.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The laying on of hands was also used to designate certain ones to whom benefits or power would flow, as in Jesus’ healing (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:40-42:4:40" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Luke 4:40</a>) and in the holy spirit’s coming upon those upon whom Paul laid his hands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:6-44:19:6" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Acts 19:6</a>) This does not mean that the spirit passed through the hands of Paul, but that as Christ’s representative he was authorized to designate, in harmony with the requirements laid down, who would receive gifts of the spirit. (See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:19" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-19</a>.) That it was not necessary to lay on hands to transmit the gifts of the spirit was shown by the fact that in the case of Cornelius and his household the apostle Peter was merely present when they were given holy spirit and the gift of tongues.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:44-44:10:46" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Acts 10:44-46</a>.</p>

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb"><em>Shaking dust from feet</em>. Shaking the dirt or the dust off of one’s feet likewise indicated disclaiming of responsibility.

<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sb"><em>Girding up of the loins</em> implies preparation for action.

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb"><em>Lying down at feet.</em> When Ruth wanted to remind Boaz of his position as repurchaser, she came at night, uncovering his feet and lying down by them. When he awoke, she said to him: “I am Ruth your slave girl, and you must spread out your skirt over your slave girl, for you are a repurchaser.” Ruth hereby indicated that she was willing to undergo brother-in-law marriage.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:3:6-8:3:9" data-bid="124-1" class="b">Ruth 3:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb"><em>Appearance when fasting.</em> ‘Afflicting one’s soul’ most likely referred to fasting, and could represent mourning, acknowledgment of sins, repentance or contrition. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:29-3:16:29" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Lev. 16:29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:31-3:16:31" data-bid="125-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:1:12-10:1:12" data-bid="125-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:35:13-19:35:13" data-bid="125-4" class="b"> Ps. 35:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:13-29:1:14" data-bid="125-5" class="b"> Joel 1:13, 14</a>) Hypocritical persons of Jesus’ day on earth put on a sad face, disfiguring their faces so as to make a show in appearing to be carrying out holiness by fasting, but Jesus told his disciples that when fasting they should grease their heads and wash their faces so <span id="page166" class="pageNum" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>that they would appear normal to men, knowing that the Father looks upon the heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:16-40:6:18" data-bid="126-1" class="b">Matt. 6:16-18</a>) Fasting was sometimes practiced by Christians so as to give undivided attention to spiritual matters.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:2-44:13:3" data-bid="127-1" class="b">Acts 13:2, 3</a>; see FAST.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb"><em>Laying hand on eyes of deceased.</em> Jehovah’s expression to Jacob, “Joseph will lay his hand upon your eyes” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:46:4-1:46:4" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Gen. 46:4</a>), was a way of saying that Joseph would be the one favored to close Jacob’s eyes after his death, which was a duty of the firstborn son. Jehovah here indicated to Jacob that the right of firstborn should go to Joseph.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:5:2-13:5:2" data-bid="129-1" class="b">1 Chron. 5:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="sb"><em>Whistling.</em> To “whistle at” something represented astonishment or wonderment.

<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sb">It was the custom of kings or men of authority to <em>lean on the arm</em> of a servant or one in an inferior position, as did King Jehoram of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:7:2-12:7:2" data-bid="131-1" class="b">2 Ki. 7:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:7:17-12:7:17" data-bid="131-2" class="b"> 17</a>) King Ben-hadad supported himself on the hand of his servant Naaman as he bowed down at the house of his god Rimmon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:18-12:5:18" data-bid="132-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="ss"><strong>ILLUSTRATIVE USAGE</strong></p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="sb"><em>Washing another’s feet</em>. Jesus employed one of the Oriental customs in an illustrative way when, giving his disciples a lesson in humility and serving one another, he washed his disciples’ feet. Peter spoke up, asking him to wash not only his feet but also his hands and his head. But Jesus replied: “He that has bathed does not need to have more than his feet washed, but is wholly clean.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:3-43:13:10" data-bid="133-1" class="b">John 13:3-10</a>) Here Jesus was referring to the fact that after one had been to the bath he would, on returning from the bath to his house, need only to wash the dust of the road from his sandaled feet. He used this cleanness as figurative of spiritual cleanness.</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="sb"><em>Walking.</em> Another illustrative expression is “to walk,” meaning to follow a certain course of action, as “Noah walked with the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:9-1:6:9" data-bid="134-1" class="b">Gen. 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:22-1:5:22" data-bid="134-2" class="b"> 5:22</a>) Those walking with God followed the life course outlined by God and found his favor. The Christian Greek Scriptures, using this same expression, picture the two contrasting courses of action pursued by one before and after becoming a servant of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="135-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:10-49:2:10" data-bid="135-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:17" data-bid="135-3" class="b"> 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:2-49:5:2" data-bid="135-4" class="b"> 5:2</a>) In a similar manner “running” is used to symbolize a course of action. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:4-60:4:4" data-bid="136-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:4</a>) God said that the prophets in Judah “ran” though not sent by him, meaning that they took the prophetic course falsely, unauthorized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:23:21-24:23:21" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Jer. 23:21</a>) Paul describes the Christian course in terms of “running.” He likens it to a race that one can run either well or poorly and in which one must run according to the rules in order to win the prize.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:24-46:9:24" data-bid="138-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:2-48:2:2" data-bid="138-2" class="b"> Gal. 2:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:7-48:5:7" data-bid="138-3" class="b"> 5:7</a>.</p>

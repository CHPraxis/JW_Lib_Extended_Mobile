MALCHI-SHUA
(Malʹchi-shuʹa) [my king saves, or, my king (i.e., Jehovah) is opulence].
One of King Saul’s sons. (1 Sam. 14:49; 1 Chron. 8:33; 9:39) He was struck down in battle by the Philistines at Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. 31:2; 1 Chron. 10:2) and his corpse (along with those of his brothers Jonathan and Abinadab and that of his father Saul) was fastened by the Philistines on the wall of Beth-shan. However, valiant men of Israel retrieved the bodies, burned them in Jabesh and buried their bones there.—1 Sam. 31:8-13.

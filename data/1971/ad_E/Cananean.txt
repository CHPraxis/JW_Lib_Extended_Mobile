CANANAEAN
(Ca·na·naeʹan) [jealous one, zealot].
A designation distinguishing the apostle Simon from the apostle Simon Peter. (Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18) The term “Cananaean” is thought to be of Aramaic origin and apparently corresponds to the Greek word ze·lo·tesʹ meaning “zealot; enthusiast.”—Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13.

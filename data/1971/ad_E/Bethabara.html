<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth·abʹa·ra) [house of the ford].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This name appears in the <em>Authorized Version</em> rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:28-43:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 1:28</a> in place of Bethany. Some ancient manuscripts read thus, but it appears that the responsibility for this name rests primarily with Origen (c. 250 C.E.), who favored it over Bethany because this latter place was unknown to him as a site E of the Jordan. The oldest and most reliable manuscripts support the use of the name Bethany in this text. As for the Bethabara of Origen’s day, though known in his time, its identification has since also become uncertain. Most geographers recommend a site E of the Jordan opposite Jericho, while some suggest a ford called ʽAbarah some twelve miles (19 kilometers) S of the Sea of Galilee and a short distance NE of Beth-shean.—See BETHANY No. 2.</p>

HORESH
(Hoʹresh) [wooded place].
A site in the wilderness of Ziph where David hid from Saul. Here also Jonathan acknowledged David as the next king of Israel and the two men “concluded a covenant” of mutual support. (1 Sam. 23:15-19) Horesh is usually identified with modern-day Khirbet Khoreisa, about five and a half miles (8.8 kilometers) S-SE of Hebron.

ETHAN
(Eʹthan) [long-lived, permanent, ever-flowing].
1. One of four men whose wisdom, though great, was exceeded by Solomon’s. Ethan is singled out as being the Ezrahite, whereas the other three, Heman, Calcol and Darda, are referred to as sons of Mahol. (1 Ki. 4:31) This Ethan may be the writer of Psalm 89, for the superscription identifies Ethan the Ezrahite as its writer. In 1 Chronicles 2:6, Ethan, Heman, Calcol and Dara are all spoken of as sons of Zerah of the tribe of Judah and possibly are the same as the men mentioned in 1 Kings. Ethan is referred to as the father of Azariah.—1 Chron. 2:8.
2. The father of Adaiah and the son of Zimmah, a Levite of the family of Gershom.—1 Chron. 6:41-43.
3. A son of Kishi (1 Chron. 6:44) or Kushaiah (1 Chron. 15:17), a Levite of the family of Merari. Ethan was a singer and a cymbalist. (1 Chron. 15:19) Because of his close association with Heman it has been suggested that Ethan is the Jeduthun who was appointed by David to serve before the tabernacle at Gibeon and that his name was changed from Ethan to Jeduthun after his appointment. (Compare 1 Chronicles 15:17, 19 with 1 Chronicles 16:39-41 and 25:1.)—See JEDUTHUN No. 1.

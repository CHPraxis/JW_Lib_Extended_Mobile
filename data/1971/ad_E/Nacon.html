<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Naʹcon) [possibly, made ready].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:6:6-10:6:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 6:6</a>, the name of the threshing floor where Uzzah died for grabbing hold of the ark of the covenant. The parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:9-13:13:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 13:9</a> says “Chidon,” probably indicating that one writer mentioned the name of the place, the other that of its owner, or that one name is an altered form of the other.</p>

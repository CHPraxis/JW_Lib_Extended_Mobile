<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ha·roʹsheth).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site, called fully “Harosheth of the nations,” that served as military headquarters for Sisera, the army chief of the Canaanite king Jabin, who ruled in Hazor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:2-7:4:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 4:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:13-7:4:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Judge Barak pressed his victory over these enemy forces to this same point. (Vs. 16) The name “Harosheth” seems to be preserved at el-Harithiyeh, near the western exit of the Plain of Esdraelon and about eleven miles (17.7 kilometers) NW of Megiddo. However, geographers usually hold that the actual ancient site was at nearby Tell ʽAmr.</p>

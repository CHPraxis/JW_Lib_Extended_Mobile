SENAAH
(Se·naʹah) [perhaps, hated].
Over three thousand “sons of Senaah” returned from exile in Babylon with Zerubbabel in 537 B.C.E. (Ezra 2:1, 2, 35; Neh. 7:38) Senaah may be the same as Hassenaah, a name having the Hebrew definite article has.—Neh. 3:3.
Many of the names in the lists of Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 are apparently places rather than people, and Senaah is accordingly thought by some to be a place a few miles N of Jericho, where Eusebius and Jerome mention a tower “Magdalsenna.” Nearby is Khirbet el-ʽAuja el Foka, often identified as Senaah, with its postexilic settlement Sheikh-Teruni also close by.

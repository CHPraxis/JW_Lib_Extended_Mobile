TERESH
(Teʹresh) [possibly, desire].
One of two doorkeepers in the Persian palace who conspired against King Ahasuerus. Upon learning of the plot, Mordecai informed Queen Esther who, in turn, revealed it to the king. Teresh and his accomplice were hanged on a stake, and the incident was entered in the royal records.—Esther 2:21-23; 6:1, 2.

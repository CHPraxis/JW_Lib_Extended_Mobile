ADVERSARY
(Heb., tsar; Gr. an·tiʹdi·kos).
An enemy that contends with or resists; an antagonist or opponent. The most wicked adversary, Satan the Devil, caused men and angels (see DEMON) to join his opposition to God and man. Satan first showed his opposition in the Garden of Eden, where, through cruel and underhanded action, he turned Eve and then Adam into a course of rebellion that brought sin and death upon all mankind. In the courts of heaven Satan displayed his antagonism, charging Jehovah with bribing Job for his loyalty, a charge which, in effect, became an issue of universal importance.—Job 1:6-11; 2:1-5; see SATAN.
Worshipers of Jehovah in all ages have endured similar opposition from the Adversary by means of his agents. For example, when the remnant of God’s people returned from Babylon, there were those who tried to prevent rebuilding the temple and the city wall. (Ezra 4:1; Neh. 4:11) Hateful Haman, having the spirit of the Devil, proved a wicked adversary of the Jews in the days of Queen Esther. (Esther 7:6) Christians today must be alert, watchful, on guard, and must put up a hard fight for the faith against the Adversary’s machinations. (Eph. 6:11, 12; Jude 3) Peter counsels: “Keep your senses, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. But take your stand against him, solid in the faith.” (1 Pet. 5:8, 9) Eventually, Jehovah’s power will triumph over all opposers.—Jer. 30:16; Mic. 5:9.
When God’s people were unfaithful He allowed their adversaries to plunder and defeat them. (Ps. 89:42; Lam. 1:5, 7, 10, 17; 2:17; 4:12) The enemy, however drew wrong conclusions from these victories, taking credit for themselves and praising their gods. (Deut. 32:27; Jer. 50:7) Jehovah was therefore obliged to humble these proud and boasting adversaries (Isa. 1:24; 26:11; 59:18; Nah. 1:2); and this he did for his holy name’s sake.—Isa. 64:2; Ezek. 36:21-24.
The Greek word an·tiʹdi·kos (adversary) is used in other places to describe a complainant or adversary in a legal case.—Matt. 5:25; Luke 12:58; 18:3.

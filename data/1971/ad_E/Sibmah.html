<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town E of the Jordan, taken by Israel from Amorite King Sihon and assigned to the Reubenites, who desired it because of surrounding pasturelands. Apparently it was also called Sebam.

However, some identify it with Qurn el-Kibsh, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) W-SW of the suggested site of Heshbon (modern Heshban) on the Wadi Salmah.</p>

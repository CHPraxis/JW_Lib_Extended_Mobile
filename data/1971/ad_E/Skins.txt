SKINS
The skin is classified as an organ of the body, and indeed performs many functions for the body’s well-being, including protection, regulation of body temperature, and removal of certain waste materials. The Bible mentions skin afflictions (Lev. 13:1-46; 21:20; Deut. 28:27) and certain deteriorating effects of disease and starvation upon the skin.—Job 7:5; 30:30; Lam. 4:8; 5:10.
According to the Law, skins of animals used for certain sin offerings were burned outside the camp of Israel, or outside the gate of Jerusalem. (Ex. 29:14; Lev. 4:11, 12; 8:17; 9:11; 16:27; Heb. 13:11) The priest received the skin of an animal presented by an Israelite for a burnt offering.—Lev. 7:8.
Jehovah provided skin garments for Adam and Eve to cover their nakedness, after they had sinned. (Gen. 3:21) Undressed skins were used for garments by some, notably some of the prophets (2 Ki. 1:8; Matt. 3:4), including some false prophets. (Zech. 13:4) Animal skins also served for sandals (Ezek. 16:3, 10), bags (1 Sam. 17:40), skin bottles for water, milk, wine, and so forth (Gen. 21:14; Josh. 9:13; Judg. 4:19; Matt. 9:17), as drumheads and possibly as a sounding base for the neʹvel or “stringed instrument.” (Isa. 5:12) Skins were used as coverings for the tabernacle.—Ex. 25:2, 5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19.
Skin of sheep, goats or calves was also employed as a writing material.—See PARCHMENT.
FIGURATIVE USE
Concerning Job, Satan said to Jehovah: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (Job 2:4) The Devil thereby challenged man’s integrity.
Job himself said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (Job 19:20) This harmonizes with the fact that tooth enamel is produced by epithelial or skin cells. A possible reading is: “And my flesh becomes hairless in my teeth.” (Compare Job 13:14.) But if the usual reading is taken, Job likely meant that he had a very narrow escape from death.

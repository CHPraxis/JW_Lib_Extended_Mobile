ZALMON
(Zalʹmon) [dark, dark place].
1. An Ahohite warrior of David. (2 Sam. 23:8, 28) Apparently called Ilai at 1 Chronicles 11:29.
2. A mountain near Shechem. From Mount Zalmon, Abimelech and his forces cut wood with which to burn down the vault belonging to the city of Shechem. (Judg. 9:48, 49) As the only mountains near Shechem are Ebel and Gerizim, Zalmon was either a peak or slope of one of these, or else some other less important hill nearby.
Zalmon at Psalm 68:14 presumably refers to the same place unless its being mentioned along with Bashan (vs. 15) indicates that there was some place called Zalmon E of the Jordan.

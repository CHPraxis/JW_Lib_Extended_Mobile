EPHESDAMMIM
(Eʹphes·damʹmim) [perhaps, end or boundary of Dammim (blood)].
The camping site of the Philistines between Socoh and Azekah, from which point Goliath strode out to mock the battle lines of Israel. (1 Sam. 17:1, 4-10) Ephesdammim is apparently the same as Pas-dammim, mentioned at 1 Chronicles 11:13. Its location today is uncertain.

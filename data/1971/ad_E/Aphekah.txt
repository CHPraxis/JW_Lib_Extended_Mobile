APHEKAH
(A·pheʹkah) [strong place, fortress].
A city in the mountainous region of southern Judah, mentioned as in the neighborhood of Hebron. (Josh. 15:48, 53) The name is the feminine form of Aphek, but the towns mentioned as in its vicinity do not seem to allow for identifying it with any of the several towns called Aphek.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A device that can be alternately expanded and contracted, first drawing in air through a valve, then forcibly expelling it out an exit tube. For giving furnaces a forced draft, the bellows are more efficient than mere fanning, or the antiquated lung-powered hollow reeds and blowtubes also used for this purpose. The construction of bellows was simple: A bag mounted on a frame or base was attached to a tube leading to the furnace, which tube may have been of iron, or reed tipped with fire-resistant clay. Hand-operated bellows were useful for small forges, but for large high-temperature furnaces dual foot-powered bellows were employed, one under each foot of the operator, who pumped down alternately, first one foot and then the other, each time pulling a cord to refill the compressed one. To give these big furnaces a constant draft, two men worked two pairs of bellows. This instrument is specifically mentioned only once in the Scriptures (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:6:29-24:6:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 6:29</a>), though perhaps alluded to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:16-23:54:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:16 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:22:20-26:22:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 22:20, 21</a>. In these texts the references are figurative and the illustrations are drawn from the methods used for refining metals.â€”See REFINE, REFINER.</p>

BAHURIM
(Ba·huʹrim) [young men].
A village by the Mount of Olives, situated on the N side of an ancient road leading to Jericho and the Jordan. It is generally identified with Ras et-Tmim, a short distance NE of Jerusalem.
Weeping Paltiel walked after Saul’s daughter Michal as far as Bahurim when she was being returned to King David. General Abner’s order: “Go, return!” sufficed to turn him back at that point. (2 Sam. 3:16) Later, David, when abandoning Jerusalem due to his son Absalom’s conspiracy, crossed the torrent valley of Kidron, went up “the ascent of the Olives,” crossed beyond the summit and came to Bahurim. (2 Sam. 15:23, 30; 16:1, 5) Here Shimei, the Benjamite relative of Saul, began walking along the mountainside cursing David, throwing stones and tossing dust. (2 Sam. 16:5-13; 19:15-23) Bahurim was also the point at which Ahimaaz and Jonathan, the sons of Zadok and Abiathar, had to hide in the well of a certain man when on their way to deliver a message to King David.—2 Sam. 15:27; 17:17-20.

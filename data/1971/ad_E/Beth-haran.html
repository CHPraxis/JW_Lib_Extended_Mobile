<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city on the eastern side of the Jordan in the territory requested by the tribe of Gad because of its good pastureland. It was either built or rebuilt by the Gadites and, although situated in a low plain, it became one of their fortified cities.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:1-4:32:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 32:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:36-4:32:36" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:27-6:13:27" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Josh. 13:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The name seems to have continued in that of Tell er-Rameh on the Wadi er-Rameh (Wadi Hesban) in the Plains of Moab, but the original site of Beth-haran (Beth-haram) is considered to have been a few miles E at Tell Iktanu, about eight miles (13 kilometers) NE of the point where the Jordan flows into the Dead Sea. The site has imposing remains and was in position to dominate the surrounding region. It was also near a source of renowned hot springs, which may partly account for King Herod’s having built a palace in this area. In the first part of the Common Era the site of Tell er-Rameh <span id="page222" class="pageNum" data-no="222" data-before-text="222"></span>was known as Livias, a name given it by Herod Antipas, and later changed to Julias.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>m<sup>e</sup>ro·rim</em>ʹ].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Along with the roasted lamb and unleavened bread, the Israelites were to eat bitter greens or herbs on the Passover night (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:8-2:12:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 12:8</a>), and this continued to be the arrangement in all future Passover celebrations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:9:11-4:9:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 9:11</a>) Nothing specific is stated as to the kind or kinds of bitter greens. The significance of the bitter greens is thought by some as intended to remind the Israelites of the bitterness of the experience during the Egyptian bondage.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The same Hebrew term (<em>m<sup>e</sup>ro·rim</em>ʹ) occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:15-25:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lamentations 3:15</a> and is usually rendered “bitterness,” or “bitter things,” though some suggest “bitter herbs (or greens)” as a suitable translation to correspond with the mention of wormwood in the same verse.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A man who is appointed, installed, invested as a prince or principal one. Five Midianite chieftains, “dukes of Sihon,” called “kings of Midian” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:8-4:31:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 31:8</a>, were killed when Israel took vengeance on the Midianites for the affair of the Baal of Peor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:21-6:13:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 13:21</a>) The leaders of the enemies of God’s people are called “dukes” (“princes,” <em>AT; AV; RS</em>) at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:11-19:83:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 83:11</a>. The term appears also at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:32:30-26:32:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 32:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A Messianic prophecy states that, when the enemies of God’s people come against them, “seven shepherds, yes, eight dukes of mankind [“princes of men,” <em>AV,</em> margin, <em>RS</em>]” will be raised up. Seven representing completeness, the “eight dukes” would evidently mean that a considerable number of capable men appointed under the Messiah would be taking the lead among Jehovah’s people.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:5:5-33:5:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mic. 5:5</a>.</p>

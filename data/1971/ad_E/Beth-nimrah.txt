BETH-NIMRAH
(Beth-nimʹrah) [place of the leopard or house of pure water].
A town assigned to the tribe of Gad on the E side of the Jordan, also called simply Nimrah. (Num. 32:3, 36) It is described as in the “low plain” and as previously forming part of the realm of King Sihon. (Josh. 13:27) The ancient name seems to be preserved in modern Tell Nimrin, situated on the S side of the Wadi Nimrin, but the original site is evidently at Tell Beibil, a short distance away, where investigations show evidence of occupation during the Israelite period followed by abandonment. It thus lay about twelve miles (19 kilometers) E-NE of Jericho.—See NIMRIM.

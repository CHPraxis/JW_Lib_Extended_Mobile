BEESHTERAH
(Be·eshʹte·rah) [house of Ashterah].
A city E of the Jordan, given to the Gershonites of the tribe of Levi. (Josh. 21:27) The parallel passage at 1 Chronicles 6:71 indicates it to be the same as Ashtaroth. Beeshterah is evidently a contraction of Beth-ashtoreth, comparable to the contraction of Beth-shan to the modern form Beisan.—See ASHTAROTH.

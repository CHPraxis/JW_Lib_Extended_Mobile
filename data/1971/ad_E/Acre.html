<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As used in the Scriptures, “acre” is understood to denote the measure of land that a span of bulls can plow in a day, since the Hebrew word thus rendered (<em>tseʹmedh</em>) literally means “span.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:14-9:14:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 14:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:5:10-23:5:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 5:10</a>) Likely this measure was somewhat less than an English acre. The word <em>jugerum,</em> found in the Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> refers to an area of .62 acre (.25 hectare).</p>

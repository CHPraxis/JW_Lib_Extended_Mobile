ABIDAN
(Abʹi·dan) [father of judgment].
The chieftain of the tribe of Benjamin at the time of the census of Israel in the second year of the exodus from Egypt. He was the son of Gideoni. (Num. 1:11, 16) He was the head over the 35,400 men of Benjamin over twenty years of age who camped on the W side of the tabernacle.—Num. 2:18, 22, 23.
At the completion of the tabernacle and its inauguration (1512 B.C.E.), during twelve days each chieftain presented a noncompetitive offering of silver and gold dishware, worth about $224, in addition to offerings of grain, oil, incense and livestock, and it was on the ninth day that Abidan represented the tribe of Benjamin in this manner. (Num. 7:10, 60-65) He died during the forty-year journey in the wilderness.—Num. 14:29, 30.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “son” of Ham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:6-1:10:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:8-13:1:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:8</a>) Although Put is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, none of his individual offspring are named. Often his descendants lent military support to Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:9-24:46:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 46:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:4-26:30:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ezek. 30:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:9-34:3:9" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Nah. 3:9</a>) They served as mercenaries in the armies of Tyre and contributed to that city’s greatness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:3-26:27:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:10-26:27:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Put was also foretold to be among the forces of Gog of Magog.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:5-26:38:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Available evidence points to a connection between Put and the Libyans of N Africa. In four of its occurrences, “Put” is rendered “Libyans” or “Libya” by the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and the Latin <em>Vulgate.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:9-24:46:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 46:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:27:10-26:27:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ezek. 27:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:30:5-26:30:5" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 30:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:5-26:38:5" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 38:5</a>) The Hebrew Put also corresponds closely to the <em>Putaya</em> (usually considered to be Libya) of old Persian inscriptions. However, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:3:9-34:3:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nahum 3:9</a> seems to indicate that Put and the <em>Lu·vimʹ</em> (Libyans) are separate peoples. But this in itself would not rule out identifying Put with the Libyans. The term “Libyans” was perhaps more comprehensive than the Hebrew designation <em>Lu·vimʹ,</em> as may be inferred from Herodotus’ reference to “Libyans and various nations of Libyans.”—Book II, sec. 32.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The identification of Put with the <em>Punt</em> of Egyptian inscriptions is not generally accepted today for phonetic reasons.</p>

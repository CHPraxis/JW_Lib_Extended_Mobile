ZEBUL
(Zeʹbul) [lofty abode].
A commissioner of the city of Shechem, subservient to Gideon’s son Abimelech. When a certain Gaal and his brothers came to Shechem and attempted to arouse the city against Abimelech, Zebul informed Abimelech and later challenged the rebel leader Gaal to prove his boasts by fighting. The Shechemite rebels were defeated and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers from the city.—Judg. 9:26-41.

CASIPHIA
(Ca·si·phiʹa) [possibly, place of silversmiths].
A “place” evidently situated in Babylonia and apparently near the gathering point of the exiles returning with Ezra to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E. (Ezra 8:17-20) Other than stating that it was the area from which Ezra recruited Levites and Nethinim while encamped at the river Ahava, the Bible does not precisely identify Casiphia as either a city or a district. Some authorities suggest Ctesiphon as the possible ancient site in view of the orthographical similarity and its suitable location on the Tigris River.

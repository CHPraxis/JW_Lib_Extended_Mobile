TELEM
(Teʹlem) [lambs or oppression].
1. A gatekeeper among those dismissing their foreign wives in the days of Ezra.—Ezra 10:16, 17, 24.
2. A city in the southern part of Judah. (Josh. 15:21, 24) It may be represented by Tell Umm es-Salafeh, some twenty-six miles (c. 42 kilometers) W-SW of the southern end of the Dead Sea. It is possibly the same as Telaim, though the two names could have different meanings.—See TELAIM.

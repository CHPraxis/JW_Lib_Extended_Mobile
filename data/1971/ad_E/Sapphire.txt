SAPPHIRE
A transparent or translucent precious stone; a variety of corundum that is just below the diamond in hardness. Although sapphires occur in many colors, the deep-blue shades are most highly esteemed. The sapphires referred to in the Bible were apparently blue. A sapphire was one of the stones in the high priest’s “breastpiece of judgment.”—Ex. 28:15-18; 39:11.
INFERIOR TO WISDOM
Job, who lived about the seventeenth century B.C.E., described the efforts of men in digging deep into the earth to mine gold and precious jewels, and mentions the sapphire among the rare stones so located. But, says Job, valuable as sapphire is and difficult to obtain, wisdom is far superior and cannot be paid for with such stones.—Job 28:4-6, 12, 16.
FIGURATIVE USE
The lustrous beauty, the pleasurable, captivating, and enthralling effect caused by viewing precious gems was used figuratively in connection with visions of God’s glory. After the Law covenant was instituted Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and seventy of the older men of Israel received a vision of Jehovah, and beneath his feet “there was what seemed like a work of sapphire flagstones and like the very heavens for purity.” (Ex. 24:8-11) In visions of the glory of Jehovah, Ezekiel twice beheld “the likeness of a throne” that was “like sapphire stone.”—Ezek. 1:1, 26-28; 10:1-4.
When Jehovah, as Zion’s husbandly Owner, spoke of her restoration and beautification he said: “I will lay your foundation with sapphires.” (Isa. 54:5, 11) Similarly, the apostle John’s vision of the heavenly New Jerusalem revealed that sapphire was part of its foundations.—Rev. 21:2, 19.

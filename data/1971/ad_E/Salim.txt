SALIM
(Sa πlim) [possibly from an Aramaic or Hebrew word meaning completed].
A place mentioned at John 3:23 to help locate Aenon, where John the Baptist baptized persons. Hence, Salim must have been well known at the time. Today its situation and that of Aenon are both uncertain. However, see AENON.

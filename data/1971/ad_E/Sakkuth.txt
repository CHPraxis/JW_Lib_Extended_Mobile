SAKKUTH
(Sakʹkuth) [booth; literally, Sik·kuthʹ (according to the Masoretic text), the name being purposely vocalized to correspond with the Hebrew word shiq·qutsʹ (disgusting thing)].
Possibly an astral deity, as suggested by the fact that “Sakkuth” is put in a parallelism with the phrase “the star of your god.” (Amos 5:26) Perhaps Sakkuth is to be identified with “Sakkut,” this being the Babylonian designation for Saturn (a star god). However, in the Septuagint Version the expression “Sakkuth your king” reads “the tent of Moloch,” and Stephen, who probably quoted the Septuagint, also used the words “the tent of Moloch.” (Acts 7:43) This suggests that “Sakkuth” may be understood as denoting a portable shrine, a tent or booth, in which the idol image of Moloch was housed.—See ASTROLOGERS.

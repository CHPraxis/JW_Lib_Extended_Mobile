<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The official residence of the Roman governors. In the governor’s palace at Jerusalem, Pontius Pilate questioned Christ Jesus and, in its courtyard, Roman soldiers mocked him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:16-41:15:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 15:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:28-43:18:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> John 18:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:33-43:18:33" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:9-43:19:9" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 19:9</a>) Some have identified the governor’s palace with the Castle of Antonia, but others suggest that it was probably the palace built by Herod the Great. The following reasons have been presented in support of the latter view: (1) According to the first-century Jewish philosopher Philo, Herod’s palace was called the “house of the procurators [or, governors],” and it was there that Governor Pilate hung shields in honor of Tiberius Caesar. (2) The Jewish historian Josephus reports that the procurator Gessius Florus took up his quarters there. (<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book II, chap. XIV, par. 8) (3) Herod’s palace in Caesarea served as the governor’s palace in that city.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:33-44:23:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 23:33-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The palace of Herod at Jerusalem was situated in the NW corner of the upper city. According to Josephus’ description, it was surrounded by a 30-cubit (44-foot; 13-meter)-high wall equipped with towers at equidistant intervals. Within the walls there were porticoes, courts and groves of trees. The rooms were luxuriously furnished with gold and silver vessels and marble seats. One hundred guests could be accommodated in each of the bedrooms.—<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book XV, chap. IX, par. 3; <em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book V, chap. IV, par. 4.</p>

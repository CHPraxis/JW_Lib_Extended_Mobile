<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Seph·ar·vaʹim).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city from which the king of Assyria brought people to dwell in Samaria after the Israelites had been taken into exile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:24-12:17:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:24</a>) Earlier, Sepharvaim and its king appear to have experienced defeat at the hands of the Assyrians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:13-12:19:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:13-23:37:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:13</a>) Being mentioned along with places in Syria and Babylonia, Sepharvaim was perhaps in one of these areas. Tentative identifications include Sippar on the Euphrates N of Babylon, and Sibraim (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:16-26:47:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:16</a>) between Hamath and Damascus.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The price that the Philistines charged the Israelites for sharpening various metal implements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:20-9:13:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:20, 21</a>) The pim apparently was a weight, but its modern equivalent cannot be definitely established. Several stone weights found in Palestinian excavations bear the consonants of “pim” in ancient Hebrew characters and vary from 7.18 to 8.13 grams (.231 to .261 ounce troy). On this basis the pim would be approximately two-thirds of a shekel.</p>

JEHOZADAK
(Je·hozʹa·dak), Jozadak (Joʹza·dak) [Jehovah is righteous].
The shorter form is used in Nehemiah, the longer form elsewhere.
Father of High Priest Jeshua (or Joshua). (Ezra 3:2; Hag. 1:12; Zech. 6:11) Jehozadak was taken into captivity after Nebuchadnezzar killed his father, chief Priest Seraiah, and thus through him the high-priestly line was preserved.—1 Chron. 6:14, 15; 2 Ki. 25:18-21; Neh. 12:26.

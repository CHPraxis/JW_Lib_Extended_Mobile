HAMOR
(Haʹmor) [he-ass].
A Hivite chieftain; father of Shechem. It was from the sons of Hamor that Jacob purchased a tract of land where he pitched his tent and then later set up an altar. After Shechem violated Jacob’s daughter Dinah, Simeon and Levi, in avenging their sister, killed both Hamor and his son.—Gen. 33:18-20; 34:1, 2, 25, 26.

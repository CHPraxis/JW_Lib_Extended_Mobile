JAHZEIAH
(Jah·zeiʹah) [Jah sees].
One who apparently opposed Ezra’s proposal that the sons of Israel send away their foreign wives and the children born to them; son of Tikvah. (Ezra 10:3, 10, 11, 15) One commentary contends that this opposition of Jahzeiah and Jonathan was not against Ezra’s suggestion but against the procedure adopted for carrying it out. According to the Septuagint and Vulgate, Jahzeiah and the others assisted rather than opposed Ezra. Hence, an alternate rendering of verse 15 says that Jonathan and Jahzeiah “were the ones that acted representatively in this behalf.”—NW, 1955 ed., ftn. a; AV; AS, margin; Dy; Knox.

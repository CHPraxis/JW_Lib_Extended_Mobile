ZIMRI
(Zimʹri).
1. A son of Zerah and grandson of Judah.—1 Chron. 2:4, 6.
2. The Simeonite chieftain, son of Salu, who brought Cozbi the Midianitess into the camp of Israel, committing fornication with her in his own tent. For this, Zimri and Cozbi were slain by Phinehas, with Jehovah’s approval. This quick action put an end to the scourge that had already executed thousands of guilty Israelites.—Num. 25:6-8, 14-18.
3. Fifth king of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. Zimri ruled in Tirzah for seven days in about 951 B.C.E. He had previously been chief of half the chariots under King Elah, but when the army was away at Gibbethon, and King Elah had remained behind, Zimri killed him and all the rest of Baasha’s house, and made himself king. His rule was very short because the army made Omri king and immediately returned to besiege Tirzah, whereupon Zimri burned the king’s house down over himself. Zimri is noted for doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. (1 Ki. 16:3, 4, 9-20) Jezebel’s last words recalled the consequences that befell Zimri. As Jehu triumphantly rode into Jezreel, she taunted from the window: “Did it go all right with Zimri the killer of his lord?”—2 Ki. 9:30, 31.
4. A descendant of Saul and Jonathan. (1 Chron. 8:33-36; 9:42) It has been suggested that he may be the same as No. 3 above; the reason adduced is that there is a possibility that this Zimri (No. 3) was trying to recover the kingship as a member of Saul’s household.
5. An apparent geographic location that is unknown; sometimes, but without good authority, connected with Abrabam’s son Zimran.—Jer. 25:25; Gen. 25:1, 2.

BETH-RAPHA
(Beth-raʹpha) [house of Rapha, or, perhaps, house of a giant].
The name appears at 1 Chronicles 4:12 where Eshton is said to have become “father to Beth-rapha.” The use of “Beth” (house) in the name has led many commentators to view it as applying to a family “house” or a place. Thus, Keil and Delitzsch’s Commentaries on the Old Testament (Chronicles, p. 88) observes: “Eshton begat the house (the family) of Rapha, of whom also nothing further is said; for they can be connected neither with the Benjamite Rapha (viii. 2) nor with the children of Rapha (xx. 4, 6, 8).”—See ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.

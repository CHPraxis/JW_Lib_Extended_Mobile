HEʼ
[====].
The fifth letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, representing five when used as a number. The meaning of the name is “window.”
In speaking, heʼ has a guttural sound somewhere between the softer ʼaʹleph and the harsher hhehth. It thus corresponds generally to the English “h,” and is similar to the sound of “h” in the word “behind.” In the Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each verse of Psalm 119:33-40. The letters heʼ [====] and hhehth [====] are very similar in form.

JOKNEAM
(Jokʹne·am) [possibly, let the people acquire].
A city in Carmel conquered by Joshua. (Josh. 12:7, 22) Originally assigned to the tribe of Zebulun (Josh. 19:10, 11), Jokneam subsequently was given to the Merarite Levites. (Josh. 21:34) Today it is usually identified with Tell Qeimun. This mound at the foot of Mount Carmel lies some seven miles (11 kilometers) NW of Megiddo and overlooks the Valley of Jezreel. At 1 Kings 4:12 “Jokmeam” is generally viewed as a spelling error for “Jokneam.”

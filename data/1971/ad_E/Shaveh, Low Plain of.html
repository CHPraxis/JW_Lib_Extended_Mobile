<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“The king’s Low Plain,” where Abraham, victorious over Chedorlaomer and his allies, was met by the king of Sodom and received a blessing from Melchizedek, king of Salem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:14:17-1:14:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 14:17-24</a>) Centuries later, Absalom erected his monument in the “Low Plain of the King,” apparently the same place and likely near Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:18-10:18:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 18:18</a>) Josephus indicated that Absalom’s Monument was set up “two furlongs <span id="page1481" class="pageNum" data-no="1481" data-before-text="1481"></span>[c. 1,215 feet (370 meters)] distant from Jerusalem.” However, the exact location of the Low Plain of Shaveh cannot now be ascertained.—<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book VII, chap. X, par. 3.</p>

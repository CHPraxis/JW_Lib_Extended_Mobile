<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Son of Hezron, born after his father’s death, and great-grandson of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:4-13:2:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:24-13:2:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24</a>) By his two wives he fathered seven sons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:5-13:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:5-7</a>) He is also said to be the father of Tekoa, which some construe to mean that he was the founder of the town by that name.</p>

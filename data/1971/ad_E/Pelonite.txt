PELONITE
(Pelʹo·nite).
A term used with reference to two of David’s principal warriors, Helez and Ahijah. (1 Chron. 11:26, 27, 36; 27:10) Helez is referred to as “the Paltite” in the parallel record at 2 Samuel 23:26, and some lexicographers consider this the preferred rendering of the designation. The name of Ahijah (1 Chron. 11:36) does not appear, in that form at least, in the corresponding list at 2 Samuel 23:24-39.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In Isaiah’s time the worship of these deities evidently involved setting a table of food and drink before them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:11-23:65:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 65:11</a>) Arabic tradition identifies the planet Jupiter with the “greater [good] luck” and the planet Venus with the “lesser [good] luck.” Hence, it has been suggested that the god of Good Luck (Gad) may be identified with Jupiter, and the god of Destiny (Meni) with Venus.</p>

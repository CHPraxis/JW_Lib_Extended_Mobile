<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The true God, the Creator of the glorious heavenly bodies, has glory and brilliance beyond the ability of fleshly sight to endure, for “no man may see [God] and yet live.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:20-2:33:20" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20</a>) Only the angels, spirit creatures, have vision that can behold his face in a literal sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:10-40:18:10" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Matt. 18:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:19-42:1:19" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> Luke 1:19</a>) Nevertheless, he does not expose men to such an experience. In loving-kindness he enables men to see his fine qualities through his Word, including the revelation of Himself by means of his Son Christ Jesus.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:27-40:11:27" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Matt. 11:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="65-3" class="b"> 14:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">God gives us an idea of the effect of his presence in the book of Revelation. The apostle John had a vision that approximated seeing God, in the sense that it revealed the effect of beholding him on his throne. God was not like a man in appearance, for he has not revealed any figure of his to man, as John himself said later: “No man has seen God at any time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="66-1" class="b">John 1:18</a>) Rather, God was shown to be like highly polished gems, precious, glowing, beautiful, that attract the eye and win delighted admiration. He was “in appearance, like a jasper stone and a precious red-colored stone, and round about the throne there [was] a rainbow like an emerald in appearance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:3-66:4:3" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Rev. 4:3</a>) Thus, he is lovely in appearance and pleasant to look at, causing one to lose oneself in wonderment. About his throne there is further glory and an atmosphere of calmness, serenity. The appearance of a perfect rainbow of emerald indicates that, reminding one of the enjoyable quieting calm that follows a storm.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:12-1:9:16" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Genesis 9:12-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">How different the true God is, therefore, from the gods of the nations, who are often depicted as being grotesque, angry, fierce, implacable, merciless, whimsical as to their favors and disfavors, horrifying and fiendish and ready to torture earthly creatures, human souls, in some kind of “hellfire” or inferno.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>“A God exacting exclusive devotion”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">“Even though there are those who are called ‘gods,’ whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords,’ there is actually to us one God the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="69-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:5, 6</a>) Many of these gods are ‘mighty ones,’ but Jehovah is the Almighty God. He is a God exacting exclusive devotion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:5-2:20:5" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5</a>) He requires his worshipers to worship him with spirit and truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="71-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) His worshipers should fear him, which means to hate bad and to recognize his sovereignty and supremacy, his almightiness and his righteousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:7-20:1:7" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Prov. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:13-20:8:13" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:20-24:11:20" data-bid="72-3" class="b"> Jer. 11:20</a>) They should stand in reverent awe of him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:13-23:8:13" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Isa. 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:28-58:12:29" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Among other mighty ones called “gods” in the Bible, is Jesus Christ, who is “the only-begotten god.” But he himself plainly said: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="74-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:8-42:4:8" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> Luke 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:20-5:10:20" data-bid="74-3" class="b"> Deut. 10:20</a>) The angels are “godlike ones,” but one of them stopped John from worshiping him, saying: “Be careful! Do not do that! . . . Worship God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:5-19:8:5" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Ps. 8:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:7-58:2:7" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="75-3" class="b"> Rev. 19:10</a>) Mighty men among the Hebrews were called “gods” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:1-19:82:7" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ps. 82:1-7</a>); but no man was purposed by God to receive worship. When Cornelius began to do obeisance to Peter, that apostle stopped him with the words, “Rise; I myself am also a man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:25-44:10:26" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Acts 10:25, 26</a>) Certainly the false gods invented and fashioned by men down through the centuries since the rebellion in Eden are not to be worshiped. The Mosaic law warns strongly against turning from Jehovah to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:3-2:20:5" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ex. 20:3-5</a>) Jehovah the true God will not forever tolerate rivalry from false, worthless gods.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:10-24:10:11" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Jer. 10:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The apostle Paul tells that God is the One who declares persons righteous and that after Christ, as God’s king, brings to nothing all other authority and power, and thereafter hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, God will then become “all things to everyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:33-45:8:33" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Rom. 8:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:23-46:15:28" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:23-28</a>) Eventually, all those living will acknowledge God’s sovereignty and will praise his name continually.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:150:1-19:150:6" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ps. 150;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:11" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:22-66:21:27" data-bid="81-3" class="b"> Rev. 21:22-27</a>; see EL; ELOHIM; JEHOVAH.</p>

LITTER
A portable couch or bed usually covered with a canopy and curtained in on the sides, designed so that a person of importance, either seated or reclined, can be carried about by men or beasts of burden; a palanquin as used in the Orient. The royal litter of King Solomon was made of Lebanese cedarwood, with silver pillars and supports of gold, and with the seat or cushion upholstered in costly and beautiful wool dyed reddish purple. The interior was richly ornamented, possibly with ebony wood.—Song of Sol. 3:7-10.
A portable funeral couch for transporting the remains of the dead was known as a so·rosʹ or bier.—Luke 7:14.

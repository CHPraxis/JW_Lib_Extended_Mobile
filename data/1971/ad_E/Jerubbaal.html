<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name given to Gideon son of Joash the Abi-ezrite after he had torn down his father’s altar to Baal and the wooden sacred pole by it; then on an altar built to Jehovah, Gideon sacrificed a bull belonging to his father, using the pieces of the sacred pole as fuel.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:11-7:6:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 6:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:25-7:6:27" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Early next morning the men of Ophrah, on discovering what had been done, were highly incensed. Accordingly they inquired, and finding that Gideon had done this thing, demanded that he be put to death. Gideon’s father Joash took the side of Gideon, saying: “Will you be the ones to make a legal defense for Baal to see whether you yourselves may save him? Whoever makes a legal defense for him ought to be put to death even this morning. If he is God, let him make a legal defense for himself, because someone has pulled down his altar.” The Bible account continues: “And he began to call him Jerubbaal on that day, saying: ‘Let Baal make a legal defense in his own behalf, because someone has pulled down his altar.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:28-7:6:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 6:28-32</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Aarʹon·ites).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The expression “Aaronites” appears in <em>AV</em> and <em>Mo</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:12:27-13:12:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 12:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:27:17-13:27:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 27:17</a>. The Masoretic text in Hebrew simply uses the name Aaron. <em>LXX</em> (at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:12:27-13:12:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:27</a>) says “of the family of Aaron.” It is evident that the word “Aaron” is here used in a collective sense, much as is the name “Israel,” and stands for the house of Aaron or his male descendants in David’s time who were of the tribe of Levi and were serving as priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:48-13:6:53" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 6:48-53</a>) <em>NW</em> reads: “And Jehoiada was the leader [of the sons] of Aaron, and with him were three thousand seven hundred” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:12:27-13:12:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:27</a>), bracketing the words “of the sons” to denote that they are supplied.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The larval stage of butterflies or moths. “Caterpillar” translates the Hebrew word <em>ga·zam</em>ʹ<em>,</em> thought to be derived from a root meaning “to cut” or one denoting “to shear.” In numbers, caterpillars, like locusts, literally cut or shear away the leaves of vegetation piece by piece, leaf by leaf, until the plant is almost denuded of its greenery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:4-29:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joel 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:25-29:2:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:4:9-30:4:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Amos 4:9</a>) While the traditional view is that the Hebrew term <em>ga·zam</em>ʹ signifies “locust,” the translators of the <em>Septuagint Version</em> used the Greek word <em>kamʹpe,</em> meaning caterpillar. Also, a recent Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by Koehler and Baumgartner favors translating <em>ga·zam</em>ʹ as caterpillar. It is thus rendered, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:1:4-29:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joel 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/29:2:25-29:2:25" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:25</a>, in the translation by Isaac Leeser and the <em>New World Translation;</em> “palmerworm” in the <em>Authorized Version;</em> “shearer” in <em>An American Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The colors of caterpillars generally blend in with the immediate surroundings, although some are brightly colored and adorned with striking designs. The caterpillar’s head has short antennae, from two to six simple eyes on each side and strong biting jaws. Aside from the head, it generally has twelve segments or rings, with a pair of jointed, clawed legs attached to each of the first three segments, which legs later develop into those of the adult insect. The six front legs serve for locomotion as well as for holding food in place when the caterpillar is feeding. Most caterpillars have five additional pairs of false or stump legs, each being equipped with a series of hooks. Four pairs of these legs are situated on the sixth to the ninth segments respectively and one pair on the last segment.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Caterpillars are almost exclusively vegetarian. Their appetites are voracious, some caterpillars consuming twice their own weight of greenery in a day. Hence, in large numbers they cause no little damage to <span id="page303" class="pageNum" data-no="303" data-before-text="303"></span>vegetation. However, many birds largely subsist on this larval stage of butterflies or moths.</p>

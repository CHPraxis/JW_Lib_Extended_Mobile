<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">There are a number of original-language terms that usually designate some kind of wine (Heb., <em>ti·rohshʹ</em> [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:28-1:27:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 27:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:37-1:27:37" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:8-28:2:9" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Hos. 2:8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:22-28:2:22" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 22</a>]; Heb., <em>hheʹmer</em> [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:14-5:32:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 32:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:2-23:27:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isa. 27:2</a>] and the corresponding Aramaic term <em>hhamarʹ</em> [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:1-27:5:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Dan. 5:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:4-27:5:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:23-27:5:23" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 23</a>]; Gr., <em>gleuʹkos</em> [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:13-44:2:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:15-44:2:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 15</a>]). But the Hebrew word <em>yaʹyin</em> is found most frequently in the Scriptures. It first appears in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:20-1:9:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 9:20-24</a>, where the reference is to Noah’s planting a vineyard after the flood and then becoming intoxicated on the wine therefrom. The Greek word <em>oiʹnos</em> (basically corresponding to the Hebrew term <em>yaʹyin)</em> first occurs in Jesus’ comments on the inadvisability of using old wineskins for <em>new, partially fermented wine,</em> as the pressure developed through fermentation would burst the old wineskins.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:17-40:9:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 9:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:2:22-41:2:22" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mark 2:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:37-42:5:38" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Luke 5:37, 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Various strong alcoholic liquors apparently derived from pomegranates, dates, figs, and the like, were usually designated by the Hebrew term <em>she·kharʹ.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:28:7-4:28:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Num. 28:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:26-5:14:26" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:12-19:69:12" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Ps. 69:12</a>) The Hebrew word <em>ʽa·sisʹ,</em> at The <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:8:2-22:8:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 8:2</a>, refers to the “fresh juice of pomegranates,” but in other passages the context points to wine.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WINE MAKING</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In Palestine the grapes were gathered during August and September, depending on the type of grapes and the climate of the region. The vintage season was practically over by the time the “festival of booths” was celebrated in the early part of autumn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:16:13-5:16:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 16:13</a>) After being picked, the grapes were placed in limestone vats or troughs where men usually crushed them barefooted, singing songs as they trod the winepress. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:16:10-23:16:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 16:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:30-24:25:30" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Jer. 25:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:33-24:48:33" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 48:33</a>) With such comparatively gentle crushing methods the stems and seeds were not broken down, little of the tannic acid in the skins was expressed, and this, in turn, made for a high-quality wine, one that was smooth and soft on the palate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:7:9-22:7:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 7:9</a>) Sometimes heavy stones were used instead of feet.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:3-23:63:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 63:3</a>; see PRESS.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The first “must” or fresh juice that flows from the broken skins of the grapes, if kept separate from the greater volume of juice extracted under pressure, makes the richest and best wines. Fermentation begins within six hours after the crushing, while the juice is still in the vats, and slowly progresses for a period of several months. The alcohol content of the natural wines varies from 8 to 14 percent by volume, but this can be increased with the addition of sugar to the must or by adding alcoholic spirits later on. If grapes are low in sugar content, and fermentation continues too long, or if the wine is not properly protected from oxidizing, it turns to acetic acid or vinegar.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:14-8:2:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ruth 2:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">During the aging period the wine was kept in jars or skin bottles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:13:12-24:13:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jer. 13:12</a>) These containers were probably vented in such a way as to allow the carbon dioxide gas (a by-product in the conversion of the sugars to alcohol through fermentation) to escape without admitting oxygen from the air to contact and contaminate the wine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:19-18:32:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 32:19</a>) As the wines were left undisturbed, they gradually clarified, the dregs falling to the bottom, with an improvement in the bouquet and flavor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:39-42:5:39" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 5:39</a>) Thereafter wines were usually transferred to other vessels.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 25:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:11-24:48:11" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Jer. 48:11</a>; see DREGS.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Wine was not at first a part of the Passover meal, but was added later, perhaps after the return from Babylonian exile. It was therefore on the table when Jesus celebrated the Passover the last time with his apostles and was conveniently used by him in instituting the Memorial of his death. The red “blood of grapes” was a fitting representation of Jesus’ own sacrificial blood. On that occasion Jesus spoke of such wine as “this product of the vine,” and since it was perhaps seven months after the grape harvest there can be no question but that it was fermented juice of the vine.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:11-1:49:11" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Gen. 49:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:18-40:26:18" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:27-40:26:29" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 27-29</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">As indicated by Jesus and reported by the physician Luke, wine had certain medicinal value as an antiseptic and mild disinfectant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:34-42:10:34" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Luke 10:34</a>) The Bible also recommends it as a curative remedy in cases of certain intestinal disturbances. Paul counseled Timothy: “Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:23</a>) This was sound medical advice. Dr. Salvatore P. Lucia, professor of medicine, University of California School of Medicine, writes: “Wine is the most ancient dietary beverage and the most important medicinal agent in continuous use throughout the history of mankind. . . . Actually, few other substances available to man have been as widely recommended for their curative powers as have wines.”—<em>Wine as Food and Medicine,</em> pp. 5, 58; see DISEASES AND TREATMENT, page 453.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Contrary to the erroneous opinions of some, alcoholic liquors are not mental stimulants, but are in reality sedatives and depressants of the central nervous system. “Give intoxicating liquor, you people, to the one about to perish and wine to those who are bitter of soul,” not as a mental stimulant to make such ones more conscious of their misery, but, rather, as the proverb says, that they may ‘forget their troubles.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:6-20:31:7" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Prov. 31:6, 7</a>) There was an ancient custom among the Romans of giving criminals drugged wine to blunt the pain of execution.

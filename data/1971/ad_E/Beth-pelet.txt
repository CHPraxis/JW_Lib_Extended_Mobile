BETH-PELET
(Beth-pelʹet) [place of refuge or escape].
A town in the southern part of Judah’s inheritance. (Josh. 15:21, 27) It was among the Judean cities reoccupied after the Babylonian exile. (Neh. 11:26) The other towns listed with it indicate a location in the vicinity of Beer-sheba, but the identification is uncertain; some suggest Khirbet el-Meshash, about ten miles (16 kilometers) E of Beer-sheba.

EZRAHITE
(Ezʹra·hite).
A person belonging to the family of Ezrah, or possibly Zerah, as this is almost the same Hebrew form; and Ethan and Heman are called sons of Zerah. (1 Chron. 2:6; compare 1 Kings 4:31.) The superscription of Psalm 89 identifies Ethan the Ezrahite as its writer, and, in addition to mentioning the “sons of Korah,” the superscription of Psalm 88 also accredits Heman the Ezrahite.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-le·baʹoth) [house or place of lionesses].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city listed among the places given to the tribe of Simeon as enclave cities within the territory of Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:1-6:19:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:6-6:19:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6</a>) It is named between Hazar-susah and Sharuhen, and this indicates a location in the Negeb region, evidently to the W or SW of Beer-sheba. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:32-6:15:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 15:32</a> it evidently appears simply as Lebaoth, while at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:31-13:4:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 4:31</a> Beth-lebaoth is replaced by the name “Beth-biri.” This latter name could be a postexilic name for the same location.—See BETH-BIRI.</p>

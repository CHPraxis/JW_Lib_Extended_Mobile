<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This is a transliteration of the Hebrew word <em>na·woythʹ</em> and seems to apply to a place where certain prophets resided in the time of Samuel.

Driver corroborates this view, observing: “Probably it [<em>na·woyth</em>ʹ] is the name of some locality in Ramah, the signification of which is lost to us.”—<em>Notes on the Hebrew Text and the Topography of the Books of Samuel</em> (1913), p. 159.</p>

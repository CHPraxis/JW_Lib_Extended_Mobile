SHAALBIM
(Sha·alʹbim) [place of foxes].
A city whose Amorite inhabitants were subjected to forced labor by the house of Joseph. (Judg. 1:35) Later, Shaalbim was included in one of the districts annually providing Solomon’s household with food. (1 Ki. 4:7-9) It is generally understood to be the same as Shaalabbin, a border city of Dan. (Josh. 19:40-42) There is only the difference of the final consonant in the Hebrew spelling of the two names. Shaalbon may be an alternate name for Shaalbim.—2 Sam. 23:32; 1 Chron. 11:33.
Ancient Shaalbim is usually identified with modern Selbit, which appears to preserve the Biblical name. It is situated about sixteen miles (c. 25 kilometers) W-NW of Jerusalem and relatively near the suggested sites of other places mentioned with Shaalbim in the Scriptures.

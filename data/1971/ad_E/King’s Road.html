<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The road from which the Israelites promised not to depart if allowed to pass through Edomite territory and the Amorite realm of King Sihon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:17-4:20:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 20:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:21:21-4:21:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 21:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:2:26-5:2:27" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Deut. 2:26, 27</a>) So this road must have extended from the Gulf of Aqabah at least as far as the Jabbok, the apparent N boundary of Sihon’s territory. Many believe that it ran as far N as Damascus and generally corresponded to the paved Roman highway built by Emperor Trajan in the second century C.E. With the exceptions of needed adjustments for modern traffic, the present-day road closely follows the ancient Roman highway, portions of which still exist.</p>

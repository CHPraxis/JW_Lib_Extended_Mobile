HUSHAH
(Huʹshah) [possibly, haste].
Either a “son” of or a city “fathered” or “founded” by Ezer of the tribe of Judah. (1 Chron. 4:1, 4; for a comparable example see ATROTH-BETH-JOAB.) If Hushah designates a city, then it was likely the home of one of David’s mighty men, Sibbecai, who was probably also called Mebunnai. (1 Chron. 27:11; compare 2 Samuel 23:27; 1 Chronicles 11:29.) Those who regard Hushah as the name of a city generally identify it with Husan, about four miles (6.4 kilometers) W of Bethlehem.

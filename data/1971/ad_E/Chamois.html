<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A small goatlike antelope characterized by its hook-tipped horns and noted for its agility and surefootedness at dizzying heights. The grown male may measure thirty-two inches (.8 meter) at the shoulder, and may weigh about sixty-five pounds (29.5 kilograms). The summer coat of the chamois is a tawny color that gets darker with the advent of the winter season. The chamois is listed among the animals suitable for food according to the requirements of the Law.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:5-5:14:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 14:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There is uncertainty as to the animal meant by the Hebrew word <em>zeʹmer,</em> variously rendered “chamois” (<em>AV, AS, ER, NW, Yg</em>), “mountain goat” (<em>La</em>), “mountain sheep” (<em>AT, JB, Mo, Ro</em>), “antelope” (<em>Le</em>), and simply transliterated as “zemer.” (<em>Kx</em>) The Hebrew root from which the word <em>zeʹmer</em> is thought to be derived suggests a bouncing, leaping animal, hence likely a kind of gazelle. Authorities who maintain that the chamois was never found in Palestine consider the rendering of <em>zeʹmer</em> as “chamois” to be in error. However, it may be noted that local varieties of this animal are to be found in the Carpathian and Caucasian Mountains, thus allowing for the possibility that at one time a variety of the chamois may have existed in the ranges of Lebanon.</p>

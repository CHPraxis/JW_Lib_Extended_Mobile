<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah God as Creator of all things is the Builder <em>par excellence.</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Job 38:4-6</a>) His Word the Logos, who became Jesus Christ, is the Master Worker that he used in creating all things.

The ability to plan, to manufacture instruments and to build was planted in man at his creation and was manifested early in human history.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:20-1:4:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4:20-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Cain, the first son of Adam and Eve, is the first man mentioned in the Bible as the builder of a city, giving it the name of his son Enoch. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:17-1:4:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 4:17</a>) Noah was the builder of an ark, the pattern of which was given to him by Jehovah. Resinous wood was the material used for this ark of three stories, which was covered inside and outside with tar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:14-1:6:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 6:14-16</a>; see ARK No. 1.) Nimrod, a “mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah,” was the builder of several cities, namely, Babel, Erech, Accad, Calneh and also Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah and Resen.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:9-1:10:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 10:9-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When the Israelites were in slavery in Egypt they built cities as storage places for Pharaoh, namely, Pithom and Raamses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:11-2:1:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 1:11</a>) When they were led by Jehovah into the Promised Land they there found cities that had been built by the Canaanite inhabitants. Many of these cities with their houses were taken and used by the Israelites.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:10-5:6:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 6:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Moses supervised the building of the tabernacle in the wilderness, with all its utensils, the pattern being divinely provided. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:9-2:25:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 25:9</a>) Taking the lead in the fabrication and construction were Bezalel and Oholiab, whose abilities were accentuated by God’s holy spirit so that the finished work was done exactly as God had commanded Moses.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:25:40-2:25:40" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 25:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:30-2:36:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 35:30-36:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">After David took the city of Jerusalem from the Jebusites he did considerable building there, including a house for himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:9-10:5:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:9-11</a>) His son Solomon was a builder of renown, the temple of Jehovah being his foremost project. The architectural plans for this temple had been given to David by inspiration. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:11-13:28:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:11, 12</a>) David had gathered much of the material for the temple building, gold, silver, copper, iron, timbers, stones and precious stones, contributed by the people and also from David’s own funds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:14-13:22:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Chron. 22:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:2-13:29:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 29:2-8</a>) Hiram, king of Tyre, acted toward Solomon as he had toward David by supplying materials, particularly cedar and juniper timbers, as well as supplying many workmen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:5:7-11:5:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Ki. 5:7-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:5:18-11:5:18" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:2:3-14:2:3" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 2:3</a>) King Hiram also sent a man named Hiram (Hiram-abi), son of a Tyrian man and an Israelite woman, a very skilled worker in gold, silver, copper, iron, stones, timbers and fabrics.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:13-11:7:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:2:13-14:2:14" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 2:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Solomon did other extensive building works, including a house for himself as well as the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Porch of Pillars and the Porch of the Throne. The building of the temple and other governmental buildings occupied twenty years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:6:1-11:6:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:1-11:7:2" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:6-11:7:7" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:10-11:9:10" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 9:10</a>) Following this, Solomon embarked on a nationwide building program, including Gezer and Lower Beth-horon, Baalath and Tamar (Tadmor) in the wilderness, along with storage cities, chariot cities and cities for the horsemen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:17-11:9:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:17-19</a>) Excavations in Palestine, particularly at Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer, have uncovered city gates and fortifications that archaeologists attribute to Solomon.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A notable builder among the kings of Israel and Judah was Solomon’s son Rehoboam. His works included the rebuilding of Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. Rehoboam also reinforced and provisioned the fortified places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:5-14:11:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:5-11</a>) Other builders were King Baasha of Israel, who “began to build Ramah”; King Asa of Judah, building at Geba in Benjamin and Mizpah; Hiel the Bethelite, who rebuilt ruined Jericho at the forfeit of Abiram his firstborn at the laying of its foundation, and of Segub his youngest son at the putting up of the doors, in fulfillment of Joshua’s prophecy (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:17-11:15:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:15:22-11:15:22" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:16:34-11:16:34" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 16:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:26-6:6:26" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> Josh. 6:26</a>); and King Ahab of Israel, who constructed a house of ivory, besides several cities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:22:39-11:22:39" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:39</a>) Some archaeologists believe that the heavy fortifications and the constructions at Megiddo, formerly thought to be Solomon’s stables, actually belonged to Ahab, whose rule began about fifty-seven years after Solomon’s death. Building works uncovered in the stratum below these are now considered to be Solomon’s fortifications.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">King Uzziah of Judah was an extensive builder. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:9-14:26:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9, 10</a>) Uzziah displayed evidence of military genius in fortifying Jerusalem with “engines of war, the invention of engineers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:15-14:26:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:15</a>) Scenes of wall reliefs depicting Sennacherib’s assault on Lachish show special kinds of fortifications on the towers, attributed by archaeologists to Uzziah.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jotham did a great deal of building. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:27:3-14:27:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Chron. 27:3, 4</a>) And Hezekiah did considerable fortifying of Jerusalem, in connection with which he dug a water tunnel from the spring of Gihon to bring water inside the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:2-14:32:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:2-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:30-14:32:30" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 30</a>) This water tunnel can still be viewed by visitors to Jerusalem.—See the names of the kings under their respective headings.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">After the exile, Zerubbabel traveled from Babylon with a company of nearly 50,000 persons and began the rebuilding of the temple of Jehovah in Jerusalem. It was completed in the year 516 B.C.E. Later, in 455 B.C.E., Nehemiah came from Shushan to rebuild the wall of the city.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:1-15:2:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:2:64-15:2:65" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 64, 65;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:15-15:6:15" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 6:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:1-16:6:1" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> Neh. 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:7:1-16:7:1" data-bid="25-5" class="b"> 7:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is known mainly for his military exploits. Nonetheless, he was a great <span id="page265" class="pageNum" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>builder. Though he never built a temple to Jehovah, at Babylon he built fifty-four temples to false gods. He was also a notable builder of public works. His inscriptions concern themselves not with his military exploits but with his building projects, including temples, palaces, streets, embankments and walls. He made Babylon the wonder city of the ancient world, and in all of Babylonia no building compared with the famous hanging gardens that King Nebuchadnezzar built to satisfy the homesick longings of his Median queen. Those gardens were rated as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">King Herod the Great rebuilt the second temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem. Because of the distrust of the Jews, he was compelled to bring the materials in first, then to raze the second temple piecemeal as he constructed the new one. For this reason and for dislike of Herod, the Jews do not consider it the third temple, although it is often designated as such by others. By the year 30 C.E. reconstruction in the temple area had been under way for forty-six years (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:20-43:2:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 2:20</a>), and it continued for many more years. Herod also built an artificial harbor city, Caesarea, rebuilt Samaria and carried on other vast building projects within Palestine and in other lands.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jesus, when on earth, was in the building trade, being referred to as a “carpenter.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:3-41:6:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mark 6:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Building materials used in Bible times were earth, wood of various sorts, stone, precious stones, metals fabrics, plaster, mortar, bitumen whitewash made of lime, coloring for decorating wood and dyes for fabrics. At times bricks were painted or enameled.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">A number of building tools and instruments are mentioned in the Bible, including the ax (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:5-5:19:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deut. 19:5</a>), hammer (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:21-7:4:21" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Judg. 4:21</a>), forge hammer and anvil, nails and a soldering or joining process (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:7-23:41:7" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 41:7</a>), saw (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:15-23:10:15" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Isa. 10:15</a>), stone-saw (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:7:9-11:7:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:9</a>), measuring line or rope (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:16-38:1:16" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Zech. 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:1-38:2:1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>), measuring reed (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:40:3-26:40:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezek. 40:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:15-66:21:15" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:15</a>), plummet (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:7:7-30:7:8" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Amos 7:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:9-38:4:10" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Zech. 4:9, 10</a>), leveling instrument (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:21:13-12:21:13" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:28:17-23:28:17" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Isa. 28:17</a>), wood scraper and compass (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:13-23:44:13" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isa. 44:13</a>), billhook (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:12-23:44:12" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isa. 44:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:3-24:10:3" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:3</a>), chisel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:25-2:20:25" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ex. 20:25</a>) and scales.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:12-23:40:12" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Isa. 40:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Christian congregation is considered a house or temple built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus as the foundation cornerstone. It is called “God’s building,” “a place for God to inhabit by spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:20-49:2:22" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:20-22</a>) Jesus applied the fulfillment of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:22-19:118:22" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 118:22</a> to himself, as being the “stone” that the Jewish religious leaders and their followers, as “builders,” rejected.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jesus likened his hearers to two kinds of builders, one of which built his personality and way of life on the rock-mass of obedience to Christ and was, therefore, able to withstand the storms of opposition and tribulation.

(20:5) Both accounts, however, show that a third confrontation took place at “Gath” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:21:20-10:21:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 21:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:20:6-13:20:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 20:6</a>), and therefore many scholars have assumed that “Gob” is a scribal error for “Gath.” To others, however, it seems unlikely that such an oversight would occur <em>twice</em> in consecutive verses and they conclude that Gob may simply have been the name of a now unidentified site near Gezer.</p>

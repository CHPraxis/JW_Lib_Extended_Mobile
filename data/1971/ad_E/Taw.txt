TAW
[ת].
The twenty-second and last letter of the Hebrew alphabet; later, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, used also as a number to denote four hundred. The name of the letter literally means “mark.”
The corresponding Greek letter is called tau and through it comes our English “t.” The Hebrew taw, having the point (dagesh lene) in it, has a sound similar to our English “t” but, when it does not have this point, it is pronounced as “th.” In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:169-176.

ACRE
As used in the Scriptures, “acre” is understood to denote the measure of land that a span of bulls can plow in a day, since the Hebrew word thus rendered (tseʹmedh) literally means “span.” (1 Sam. 14:14; Isa. 5:10) Likely this measure was somewhat less than an English acre. The word jugerum, found in the Latin Vulgate, refers to an area of .62 acre (.25 hectare).

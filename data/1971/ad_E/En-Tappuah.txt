EN-TAPPUAH
(En-Tapʹpu·ah) [spring of Tappuah, or spring by the apple trees].
A spring by the city of Tappuah, used as a point of definition of the boundary between the inheritance of the tribe of Manasseh and that of Ephraim. (Josh. 17:7) The name may have also been used for the city of Tappuah itself. (Josh. 17:8) Some identify En-Tappuah with a spring near the city of Yasuf, to the S of which lies Tell Sheikh Abu Zarad, the suggested location of Tappuah.—See TAPPUAH No. 3.

SCYTHIAN
(Scythʹi·an).
The Scythians were a fierce, nomadic people. They are generally associated with the region N and NE of the Black Sea. Recent evidence suggests that they also extended their roaming to western Siberia near the border of Mongolia. In the first century C.E. the name “Scythian” implied the worst of barbarians. However, even such persons could become Christians and have an equal standing with other believers as members of Christ’s body. Wrote the apostle Paul: “There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.”—Col. 3:11.

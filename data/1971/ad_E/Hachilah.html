<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Hach·iʹlah) [dark].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A hill in the wilderness of Ziph, where David and his men concealed themselves from King Saul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:19-9:23:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 23:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:26:1-9:26:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 26:1-3</a>) Today its exact location is unknown. While some would identify Hachilah with Dahr el-Kola (a long ridge about ten miles [16 kilometers] W of En-gedi), this has been questioned on the basis that the Hebrew word for “hill” does not apply to a long ridge.</p>

MEUNIM
(Me·uʹnim) [Heb., Meʽu·nimʹ].
On the basis of the name, the Meunim are considered to have been an Arabian people residing in and around Maʽan, a city about twenty miles (32 kilometers) SE of Petra.
Judean King Uzziah (829-777 B.C.E.), with Jehovah’s help, successfully warred against the Meunim. (2 Chron. 26:1, 7) Perhaps at that time some of the Meunim captives were constituted temple slaves and, therefore, their descendants are later listed among the Nethinim returning from Babylonian exile.—Ezra 2:1, 2, 43, 50; Neh. 7:52; compare Psalm 68:18.
During Hezekiah’s reign (745-716 B.C.E.) a band of Simeonites struck down the tent-dwelling Meunim in the vicinity of Gedor.—1 Chron. 4:24, 39-41; see AMMONIM.

MULE
The hybrid offspring of a he-ass and a mare. The mule’s body resembles that of the horse, but its short, thick head, long ears, short mane, small feet and its tail terminated by a tuft of long hairs are characteristic of the ass. The mule combines some of the finer qualities of both parents: the endurance, hardiness and surefootedness of the ass, and the strength, vigor and courage of the horse. The animal is less prone to disease than the horse, displays greater patience when bearing heavy burdens and enjoys a much longer life-span. The hinny, the offspring of a stallion and a she-ass, is smaller than the mule and lacks its strength and beauty. Both sexes of the mule, with rare exceptions, are sterile.
These animals were among the gifts brought to Solomon by kings desiring to hear his wisdom. (1 Ki. 10:24, 25; 2 Chron. 9:23, 24) Other mules may have been obtained from traders, such as the Phoenicians. (Ezek. 27:8, 9, 14) In the time of David, mules were used as mounts by prominent persons. David’s own she-mule was assigned for Solomon’s use on the occasion of his anointing at Gihon.—2 Sam. 13:29; 18:9; 1 Ki. 1:33, 34, 38, 39.
Mules were valued as burden-bearers. (2 Ki. 5:17; 1 Chron. 12:40) Jehovah, by means of his prophet Isaiah, indicated that mules would be one of the means of transport for bringing his scattered people to Jerusalem. (Isa. 66:20) It is therefore of note that in fulfillment of prophecy those returning from Babylonian exile brought with them 245 mules in addition to other beasts of burden.—Ezra 2:66; Neh. 7:68.
Humans are counseled not to make themselves persons without understanding, like a horse or a mule whose spiritedness must be curbed by means of a bridle or a halter.—Ps. 32:9.

EL
[god, probably from a Hebrew root meaning strong, mighty].
Used with reference to Jehovah, to other gods and to men. In the Scriptures, when referring to Jehovah, it is found by itself in poetical books, such as Job and Psalms. Where it does occur in prose, it generally has an adjective qualifying it, such as in the titles ʼEl roʼiʹ (God of sight) (Gen. 16:13) and ʼEl Shad·dayʹ (God Almighty) (Gen. 17:1). It is also used extensively in the makeup of proper names, such as Elisha (God is salvation) and Michael (Who is like God?).
At Isaiah 9:6 Jesus Christ is prophetically called ʼEl Gib·bohrʹ, “Mighty God” (not ʼEl Shad·dayʹ, which applies to Jehovah at Genesis 17:1). ʼEl is used of idol gods at Psalm 81:9.
The plural form, ʼe·limʹ, is used when referring to other gods, at such places as Daniel 11:36 (ʼEl ʼe·limʹ, “God of gods”) and Exodus 15:11 (“gods”). It is also used as the plural of majesty and excellence, as in Psalm 89:6: “Who can resemble Jehovah among the sons of God [ʼE·limʹ]?” That the plural form is used to denote a single individual here and in a number of other places is supported by the translation of ʼE·limʹ by the singular form The·osʹ in the Septuagint Version; likewise by Deus in the Vulgate.
In some places ‘El appears with the definite article thus, ha-ʼEl (literally “the God”) with reference to Jehovah, thereby distinguishing him from other gods. (Gen. 46:3; 2 Sam. 22:31) See the New World Translation appendix, page 1452, for a list of occurrences.

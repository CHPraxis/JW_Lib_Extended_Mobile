<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Misʹre·photh-maʹim) [literally, burning of waters].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A point to which the Israelites pursued the armies of northern Canaanite kings allied with Jabin after having defeated them at the waters of Merom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:1-6:11:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 11:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:8-6:11:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>) When the Promised Land was divided into inheritance portions, the area extending from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim remained to be conquered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:2-6:13:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jos. 13:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:6-6:13:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Misrephoth-maim is usually associated with the ruins at Khirbet el-Musheirefeh, about twelve miles (19 kilometers) N of Acco (Acre). This location would have provided the citizens of Misrephoth-maim access to the cities in the plain of Acco and also the Huleh Basin. Perhaps Misrephoth-maim (“burning of waters”) got its name from the warm springs situated less than two hundred yards (183 meters) from the site.</p>

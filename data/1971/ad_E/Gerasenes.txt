GERASENES
(Gerʹa·senes).
In the “country of the Gerasenes,” of which at least a portion lay E of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus Christ healed two demon possessed men. (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39; compare Matthew 8:28-34.) The exact limits of this region are today unknown, and the identification is uncertain. Some scholars would link the “country of the Gerasenes” with the area around Khersa on the E shore of the Sea of Galilee. Others suggest that the designation may apply to the large district radiating from the city of Gerasa (Jerash).—See GADARENES.

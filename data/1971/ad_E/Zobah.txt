ZOBAH
(Zoʹbah).
A Syrian (Aramaean) kingdom otherwise known as Aram-Zobah. (Psalm 60, superscription) One of its kings was Hadadezer. (1 Ki. 11:23) The compound form “Hamath-zobah” may designate adjoining kingdoms named Hamath and Zobah. (2 Chron. 8:3) Zobah seems to have been located N of Damascus with a domain extending to the region of Hamath on the N and to the river Euphrates on the E.—2 Sam. 8:3.
King Saul warred against the kings of Zobah. (1 Sam. 14:47) The Ammonites later hired Syrians of Zobah and other troops to fight against David, but all were defeated by his army. (2 Sam. 10:6-19; 1 Chron. 19:6-19) It was likely in this war that David vanquished and took spoil from Zobah’s King Hadadezer, including much copper (eventually used in temple construction) from his cities Betah (apparently also named Tibhath) and Berothai (Cun?). (2 Sam. 8:3-12; 1 Chron. 18:3-9) One of the mighty men of David’s military forces was Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah.—2 Sam. 23:8, 36; see ARAM No. 5; HADADEZER.

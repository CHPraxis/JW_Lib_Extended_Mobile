<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Ashʹta·roth).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city in the region of Bashan, generally identified today with Tell ʽAshterah about twenty miles (32 kilometers) E of the Sea of Galilee. The low hill there is surrounded by a well-watered plain. Its name would indicate that it was a center of worship of the goddess Ashtoreth or Astarte.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Biblical references to it are principally with regard to giant King Og of Bashan, who is spoken of as reigning “in Ashtaroth, in Edrei.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:4-5:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:10-6:9:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Josh. 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:12:4-6:12:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 12:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:12-6:13:12" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 13:12</a>) The conquered territory of Og’s kingdom was originally assigned to the Machirites of the tribe of Manasseh, but Ashtaroth later passed to the Gershonites as a Levitical city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:13:29-6:13:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 13:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:71-13:6:71" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:71</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:21:27-6:21:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Joshua 21:27</a>, which corresponds with the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:71-13:6:71" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:71</a>, the city is called Beeshterah, understood to mean “house of Astarte.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The city is referred to in Assyrian inscriptions and in the Tell el-Amarna Letters.</p>

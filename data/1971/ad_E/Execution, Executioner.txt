EXECUTION, EXECUTIONER
For laws, commandments and commissions to have vitality and worth, they must be legally enforced. Execution usually has to do with enforcing the penalties, especially the death penalty, imposed for violation of laws. Supreme Law not only has a Lawgiver, it also has a Law Enforcer: “Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Statute-giver, Jehovah is our King.” “One there is that is lawgiver and judge.” (Isa. 33:22; Jas. 4:12) So Jehovah himself is an executioner of judgment and vengeance upon violators of His law.—Ex. 12:12; Deut. 10:17, 18; Ezek. 25:11-17; 2 Thess. 1:6-9; Jude 14, 15.
Jehovah also delegated certain power of execution to others. For example: “Your blood of your souls shall I ask back. . . . From the hand of each one who is his brother, shall I ask back the soul of man. Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image he made man.” (Gen. 9:5, 6) In this regard certain responsibilities as executioner fell upon the “avenger of blood.” (Num. 35:19) (See AVENGER OF BLOOD.) Depending upon the circumstances, the authority as executioner was sometimes invested in the priests of Israel (Num. 5:15-31), or in the entire congregation, with the eyewitnesses taking the lead in executing an offender. (Lev. 24:14-16; Deut. 17:2-7) The power of execution was also in the hands of the judges and kings, or someone whom they appointed.—Judg. 8:20, 21; 2 Sam. 1:15; 1 Chron. 14:16; 2 Ki. 9:6-9; 10:24-28; Jer. 21:12; 22:3.
Ancient rulers were surrounded by trusted bodyguards to whom execution of their master’s edicts could be entrusted. Potiphar was one who held this position. (Gen. 37:36; 41:12) It was one of Herod’s body guardsmen who beheaded John the Baptist.—Mark 6:27.
Execution of the death penalty in Israel was either by stoning or by the sword. (Lev. 20:2; 2 Sam. 1:15) Jehovah’s Messianic King, the Lord Jesus Christ, and other loyal heavenly associates of his are legal executioners, authorized as such by “the Judge of all the earth.”—Gen. 18:25; Ps. 149:6-9; Rev. 12:7-9; 19:11-16; 20:1-3.

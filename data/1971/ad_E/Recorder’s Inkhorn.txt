RECORDER’S INKHORN
At Ezekiel 9:2, 3, 11 the man in linen responsible to mark individuals on the forehead is described as having “a recorder’s inkhorn at his hips,” such evidently being held in place by the girdle about his waist. This recorder’s or secretary’s inkhorn may have been similar to those used at one time in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian ‘scribe kit’ was a long, narrow case made out of wood and having a compartment or slots for reed pens. On the outer face, near the top, it had at least one recess for a small cake of dried ink. The scribe could prepare to write by applying the moistened end of his pen to the ink. Inscriptions show that Syrian scribes used a similar ‘scribal kit’.

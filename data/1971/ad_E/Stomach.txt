STOMACH
In the single mention of this word in the Scriptures, the apostle Paul recommends that the young man Timothy use a little wine for the sake of his stomach. (1 Tim. 5:23) In some instances where the Hebrew words translated “belly” and “inward parts” are used, they apparently include the stomach. (Prov. 13:25; Jonah 1:17) The same is true in the usage of “belly” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, as, for example, at Romans 16:18 and 1 Corinthians 6:13.—See BELLY.

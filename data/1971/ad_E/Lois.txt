LOIS
(Loʹis) [better, agreeable].
Timothy’s grandmother and apparently the parent of his mother Eunice. That she was not Timothy’s paternal grandmother is indicated by the Syriac rendering “thy mother’s mother.” Lois is commended by Paul, who indicates that she was a Christian woman having ‘faith without hypocrisy.’ (2 Tim. 1:5) The family’s residence apparently was in Lystra. (Acts 16:1, 2) Comparison of 2 Timothy 1:5 with 2 Timothy 3:15 suggests that Lois and Eunice both taught Timothy from the Scriptures.

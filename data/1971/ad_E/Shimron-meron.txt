SHIMRON-MERON
(Shimʹron-meʹron).
A town, the domain of a king defeated by Joshua. (Josh. 12:7, 8, 20) It is perhaps the full name of the town Shimron, or possibly a reference to the fact that the king of Shimron was one of those defeated at the waters of Merom. (Josh. 11:1, 5, 7, 8) Some manuscripts separate the names as being two towns, Shimron and Meron, but no place called Meron is elsewhere alluded to.—See SHIMRON No. 2.

DIʹGAMMA
[====] .
A letter appearing in the ancient Greek alphabet but which went out of general use at an early period. It was retained, however, as a numeral denoting the number 6. The name diʹgam·ma given the letter is due to its resemblance to two capital gamʹma letters on top of each other (====). Some suggest that it corresponded to the Hebrew waw (====) and had the sound of “v” or “w.” In the Greek manuscript that John wrote, the number 666 as found at Revelation 13:18 may have been represented by the three Greek letters: Khi (==== =six hundred), Xi (==== =sixty) and Diʹgam·ma (==== = six).

PAPHOS
(Paʹphos).
A city on the W coast of the island of Cyprus. Here Paul, after working his way across the island with Barnabas and John Mark, encountered the sorcerer Bar-Jesus (Elymas), who opposed their preaching to Sergius Paulus the proconsul. For this he was made temporarily blind by Paul, miraculously. Witnessing this act, Sergius Paulus was converted to Christianity.—Acts 13:6-13.
Two Cypriot cities have borne the name Paphos, “Old Paphos” and “New Paphos.” New Paphos, the city referred to in the Acts account, was capital of the senatorial province of Cyprus when Paul visited the island during his first missionary tour. This city is thought to be represented by the ruins at the ancient seaport of Baffo about a mile S of modern Ktima. The natural harbor there, which served as a naval base during Greek and Roman times, was no doubt the point from which Paul and his companions sailed N-NW toward Perga in Asia Minor. Moles of the ancient harbor at Baffo still stand, as do the remains of various public and private buildings and a city wall.
Barnabas and Mark no doubt revisited the site around 49 C.E.—Acts 15:36-39.

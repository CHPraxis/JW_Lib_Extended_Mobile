<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah promised that Abraham’s seed would be given the land “from the river of Egypt” to the Euphrates River. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:15:18-1:15:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 15:18</a>) Commentators generally understand “the river of Egypt” to refer to the “torrent valley of Egypt” now identified with Wadi el-ʽArish of the Sinai Peninsula, which <span id="page1415" class="pageNum" data-no="1415" data-before-text="1415"></span>empties into the Mediterranean Sea ninety miles (145 kilometers) E of Port Said. (See EGYPT, TORRENT VALLEY OF.) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:13:5-13:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 13:5</a> certain translations read “river [<em>shi·hhohrʹ</em>] of Egypt” (<em>NW, La, AS</em>), and this reference also may be to Wadi el-ʽArish. However, another possibility is that both texts refer to a branch of the Nile.—See SHIHOR.</p>

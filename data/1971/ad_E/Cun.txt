CUN
[firm, upright].
One of the cities of King Hadadezer of Zobah from which David took large amounts of copper, later used in the temple construction. (1 Chron. 18:8) In the parallel account at 2 Samuel 8:8 the name Berothai appears in its place and may refer to the same place. Others suggest that modern Kuna, some distance N of Bereitan, the suggested location of Berothai, is possibly to be identified with the Biblical Cun.—See BEROTHAH, BEROTHAI.

SPAN
A linear measure approximately corresponding to the distance between the end of the thumb and the end of the little finger when the hand is spread out. (Ex. 28:16; 39:9; 1 Sam. 17:4; Ezek. 43:13) Two spans equal one cubit; and three handbreadths, one span. There is evidence that the cubit commonly used by the Israelites was about 17.5 inches (44.5 centimeters) in length. (See CUBIT.) Accordingly, the span would be 8.75 inches (22.25 centimeters) in length.
When highlighting Jehovah’s greatness, the prophet Isaiah asked: “Who has . . . taken the proportions of the heavens themselves with a mere span?”—Isa. 40:12.

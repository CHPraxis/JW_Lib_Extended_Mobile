SELF-WILL
The Greek term rendered “self-willed” (Titus 1:7; 2 Pet. 2:10, AS, AV, NW) literally means “self-pleasing” and “denotes one who, dominated by self-interest, and inconsiderate of others, arrogantly asserts his own will.” (An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, by W. E. Vine, Vol. III, p. 342) Self-will is therefore a quality that is out of harmony with the spirit of Christianity. Especially should it not be reflected by Christian overseers. (Titus 1:5, 7) The apostle Peter described individuals who had departed from proper Christian conduct as being “daring” and “self-willed.”—2 Pet. 2:10.

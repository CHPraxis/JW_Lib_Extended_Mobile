<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An Areopagite, or judge of the Athenian Areopagus, who heard Paul’s defense and became a Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:34-44:17:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:34</a>; see AREOPAGUS.) Dionysius’ being mentioned with Damaris, a woman who also became a believer, provides no real basis for concluding that they were married to each other.</p>

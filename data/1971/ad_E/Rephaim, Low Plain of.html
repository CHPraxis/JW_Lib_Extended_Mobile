<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A broad plain or valley near Jerusalem. Presumably it got its name from the tall people named the Rephaim who must have lived there at one time. It is listed as a boundary between the territories of Judah and Benjamin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:1-6:15:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:8-6:15:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:11-6:18:11" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 18:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:16-6:18:16" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 16</a>) At its northern end was a mountain (or ridge) that faced the Valley of Hinnom. The traditional identification for the low plain of Rephaim is the plain of the Baqaʽ. It descends for about three miles (5 kilometers) from Jerusalem SW toward Bethlehem. Near its SW end it narows into the Wadi el Werd.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The plain’s fertility (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:17:5-23:17:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 17:5</a>) and its proximity to Jerusalem and Bethlehem would have made it desirable to the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:13-10:23:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:11:15-13:11:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:15-19</a>) After David had been anointed as king over Israel the Philistines made raids in the low plain of Rephaim. David followed God’s directions, however, and was victorious over them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:17-10:5:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:17-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:14:8-13:14:17" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 14:8-17</a>.</p>

JOAHAZ
(Joʹa·haz) [shortened form of Jehoahaz, meaning “Jah has taken hold”].
1. Variant spelling of the name of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, as found in certain translations (AS, JP, Ro, RS) of 2 Kings 14:1. There the Masoretic Hebrew text reads Yoh·ʼa·hhazʹ, but on the authority of manuscripts that read Yehoh·ʼa·hhazʹ, other translations (AT, JB, Mo, NW) render the name Jehoahaz.—See JEHOAHAZ No. 2.
2. Father of King Josiah’s recorder Joah.—2 Chron. 34:1, 8.
3. Variant spelling, at 2 Chronicles 36:2, of the name of Jehoahaz, the son and successor of Josiah, king of Judah. Here certain translations (AS, AT, JP, Ro) follow the Masoretic text and read Joahaz, whereas others (AV, JB, Mo, NW) read Jehoahaz.—See JEHOAHAZ No. 3.

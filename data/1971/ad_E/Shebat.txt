SHEBAT
(Sheʹbat).
The postexilic name of the eleventh Jewish lunar month of the sacred calendar, but the fifth of the secular calendar. (Zech. 1:7; Deut. 1:3; 1 Chron. 27:14) It corresponds to part of January and part of February. The meaning of the name is uncertain.
This midwinter month comes somewhat after the peak of the heavy rains but is still a time of major rainfall. Mean average temperatures run about 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7.2 degrees Centigrade) in Jerusalem and about ten degrees higher along the Mediterranean coast. The pink and white flowers of the almond tree are the first to brighten up the winter scenery and herald the approach of spring.
Shebat was unmarked by any festival seasons in the Bible record.

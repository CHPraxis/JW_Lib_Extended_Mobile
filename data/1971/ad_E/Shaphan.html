<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shaʹphan) [rock badger].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Son of Azaliah and a royal secretary. King Josiah, in 642 B.C.E., sent Shaphan and two other officials to High Priest Hilkiah with instructions for temple repairs. On this occasion Hilkiah turned over to Shaphan “the very book of the law,” possibly even the original, recently found in the temple. No sooner had Shaphan read a portion of the Law to Josiah, than he and his son Ahikam, along with others, were dispatched by Josiah as a delegation to inquire concerning Jehovah’s purpose for Judah. They went to the prophetess Huldah, and reported back to the king Jehovah’s prophecy that destruction would come, but not during Josiah’s reign.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:22:3-12:22:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:3-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:34:8-14:34:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:8-28</a>.</p>

HASHABNEIAH
(Hash·ab·neiʹah) [possibly, Jehovah has taken account of me].
1. Father of Hattush. The latter did repair work on Jerusalem’s wall.—Neh. 3:10.
2. One of eight Levites who called upon the sons of Israel to bless Jehovah and his glorious name and then reviewed God’s dealings with Israel before the attestation by seal to the confession contract made during Nehemiah’s governorship. (Neh. 9:5, 38) Perhaps, as suggested by the Syriac reading, he is identical with one of the Levites named Hashabiah, such as the one mentioned at Ezra 8:19 or at Nehemiah 10:11.

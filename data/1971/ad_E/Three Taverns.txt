THREE TAVERNS
A resting-place on the Appian Way, the well-known highway that ran from Rome to the port of Puteoli on what is now known as the Bay of Naples. The place perhaps got its name from three inns where travelers could stop to rest and refresh themselves. Three Taverns, according to ancient writings, was thirty-three Roman miles (c. 30 statute miles or 49 kilometers) from Rome and thus about three-fourths of the distance from Rome to the Market Place of Appius. Having heard about Paul’s coming, some Christians from Rome traveled as far as the Market Place of Appius, whereas others met him at Three Taverns.—Acts 28:13-15.

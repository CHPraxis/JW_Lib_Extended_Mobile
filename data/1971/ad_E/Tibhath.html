<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Tibʹhath) [slaughter].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city N of Palestine from which David took a great quantity of copper after striking down Hadadezer, king of Zobah, at Hamath, some 140 miles (225 kilometers) N of Dan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:3-13:18:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 18:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:8-13:18:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>) In the parallel description of David’s campaign at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:8-10:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:8</a> Tibhath is apparently called Betah. (See BETAH.) Some suggest that Tibhath may have been named for Nahor’s son Tebah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:24-1:22:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 22:24</a>) In harmony with its being part of the Aramaean kingdom of Zobah, the location of Tibhath was probably in the valley lying between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains. Traces of ancient copperworks have been found in Lebanon, in harmony with the Biblical account.</p>

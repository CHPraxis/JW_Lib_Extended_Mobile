<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One who makes or repairs tents. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:3-44:18:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 18:3</a> designates the trade of Paul, Aquila and Priscilla by the Greek term <em>ske·no·poi·osʹ.</em> Various opinions have been offered as to the exact type of craftsman indicated by this word (whether a tentmaker, weaver of tapestry or ropemaker); however, numerous scholars acknowledge that “there seems no reason to depart from the translation ‘tent-makers.’”—<em>The Expositor’s Greek Testament,</em> Vol. II, p. 385.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Paul first visited Corinth he stayed with Aquila and Priscilla “on account of being of the same trade.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:1-44:18:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 18:1-3</a>) The apostle Paul was from Tarsus in Cilicia, an area famous for its goat-hair cloth named <em>cilicium</em> from which tents were made. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:39-44:21:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 21:39</a>) Among the Jews of the first century C.E. it was considered honorable to teach a lad a trade even if he was to receive a higher education. So Paul likely gained experience in the manufacture of tents while still a youth. Tentmaking may also have been the type of work the apostle did in Thessalonica (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:9-52:2:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:8-53:3:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 3:8</a>) and other places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:34-44:20:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 20:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:11-46:4:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 4:11, 12</a>) The work was not easy, for it is reported that the <em>cilicium</em> tended to be stiff and rough, consequently being difficult to cut and sew.</p>

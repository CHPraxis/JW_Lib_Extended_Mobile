EGLAIM
(E·glaʹim).
Evidently one of the geographical extremities of Moab, that, according to Isaiah 15:1, 8, was due to ‘howl’ over that nation’s despoiling. The exact location of the ancient site is unknown. However, Eglaim and a similar name, Agallim, mentioned by Eusebius as seven and four-tenths miles (11.9 kilometers) S of Rabba, may be preserved at Rujm el-Jilimeh in that area or at Khirbet Jeljul, a location dating from Nabataean-Roman times, a little farther S.

MESHULLAM
(Me·shulʹlam [recompensed, requited].
1. A family head in the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Jerusalem; son of Elpaal.—1 Chron. 8:1, 17, 18, 28.
2. A leading Gadite resident of Bashan enrolled genealogically as a son of Abihail during the reigns of Jotham and Jeroboam II (apparently two different enrollments, for the reigns of these kings did not overlap).—1 Chron. 5:11, 13, 14, 16, 17.
3. Grandfather or ancestor of King Josiah’s secretary Shaphan.—2 Ki. 22:3.
4. Father or ancestor of High Priest Hilkiah of King Josiah’s reign. (1 Chron. 9:11; Neh. 11:11) Meshullam himself had perhaps acted as high priest. Some of his descendants lived in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. He is apparently called Shallum at 1 Chronicles 6:12, 13 and Ezra 7:2; see SHALLUM No. 7.
5. A Kohathite Levite, one of several in charge of repairing the temple under King Josiah.—2 Chron. 34:1, 8, 12.
6. A priest whose descendants (at least three generations after him) lived in Jerusalem after the exile in Babylon.—1 Chron. 9:2, 3, 10, 12.
7. A Benjamite whose son Sallu was a family head in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. (1 Chron. 9:3, 7, 9) Presumably the same as the Meshullam listed in Nehemiah 11:7.
8. A Benjamite family head who himself lived in Jerusalem after the exile.—1 Chron. 9:3, 7-9.
9. The first-listed son of Governor Zerubbabel; descendant of King David.—1 Chron. 3:1, 19.
10. Head of the priestly paternal house of Ezra in the days of Jeshua’s successor Joiakim. (Neh. 12:12, 13) Possibly the same as Nos. 18 and/or 19.
11. Head of the paternal house of priests founded by Ginnethon; during the officiate of Joiakim. (Neh. 12:12, 16) Possibly the same as Nos. 18 and/or 19.
12. A gatekeeper in the days of Joiakim, Ezra and Nehemiah.—Neh. 12:25, 26.
13. A head one among the people assembled at the river Ahava for the trip to Jerusalem with Ezra in 468 B.C.E. Meshullam was one of several whom Ezra assigned to help gather a number of Levites and Nethinim to make the journey also. (Ezra 8:15-20) Possibly the same as Nos. 16 and/or 17, 20, 21.
14. A Levite who apparently supported Ezra’s admonition to send away the foreign wives he found among the Israelites on Ezra’s return to Jerusalem. However, the text may be read to mean that he opposed Ezra’s proposal.—Ezra 10:10-15; see JAHZEIAH; SHABBETHAI.
15. One of the “sons” or descendants of Bani who responded favorably to Ezra’s admonition by sending away their foreign wives and sons.—Ezra 10:29, 44.
16. Son of Berechiah who, under direction of Governor Nehemiah repaired two sections of Jerusalem’s wall. (Neh. 3:4, 30) Meshullam also gave his daughter in marriage to Jehohanan the son of Tobiah the Ammonite, a marriage union that caused division among the restored Israelites.—Neh. 6:17-19; 4:3; see No. 13 above.
17. Co-rebuilder of the Gate of the Old City in Nehemiah’s wall-repair project; son of Besodeiah.—Neh. 3:6; see No. 13.
18. One of those who stood at Ezra’s left when he read from the Law to the assembled crowd in the seventh month of 455 B.C.E. Meshullam was probably a priest.—Neh. 8:2, 4; see Nos. 10 and 11.
19. A priest (or forefather of a priest) who subscribed to the covenant of faithfulness proposed by the Levites.—Neh. 9:5, 38; 10:1, 7, 8; see Nos. 10 and 11.
20. A headman of the people whose descendant, if not himself, also attested to the same contract.—Neh. 10:1, 14, 20; see No. 13.
21. Apparently a prince of Judah who marched in one of the processional groups when Jerusalem’s rebuilt wall was inaugurated.—Neh. 12:32, 33; see No. 13.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A measure that, according to rabbinical sources, was one-eighteenth of an ephah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:6:25-12:6:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Â Ki. 6:25</a>), and hence also one eighteenth of a bath measure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:45:11-26:45:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 45:11</a>) If the bath measure is to be viewed as having a capacity of 5.81 gallons (22 liters), as archaeological evidence seems to indicate, then the cab measure would have a capacity of 2.58 pints (2.2 dry pints, 1.22 liters).</p>

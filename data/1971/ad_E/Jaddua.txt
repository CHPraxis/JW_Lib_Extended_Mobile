JADDUA
(Jadʹdu·a) [known].
1. One of the headmen of Israel whose descendant, if not himself, sealed the resolution of faithfulness during Nehemiah’s governorship.—Neh. 10:1, 14, 21.
2. The last of the Aaronic high-priestly line listed in the Hebrew Scriptures. Jaddua’s being the fifth generation after Jeshua allows for him to have lived during “the kingship of Darius the Persian.”—Neh. 12:10, 11, 22; see DARIUS No. 3.

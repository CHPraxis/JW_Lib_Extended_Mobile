ENAIM
(E·naʹim) [two springs].
A site near which Tamar, disguised as a prostitute, cohabited with Judah, resulting in the birth of Perez and Zerah. (Gen. 38:14-16, 21, 29, 30) Enaim was apparently situated between Adullam and Timnah. (Vs. 12) While considered by some geographers to be the same as Enam in the Shephelah (Josh. 15:34), its exact location is today unknown.

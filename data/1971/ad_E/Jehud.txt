JEHUD
(Jeʹhud) [praise].
A site in the territory of Dan (Josh. 19:40, 45) usually identified with modern el-Yahudiyeh, some eight miles (c. 13 kilometers) E of Jaffa (Joppa). The Greek Septuagint, though, uses “Azor” instead of Jehud. (Josh. 19:45, Bagster’s) Therefore some scholars link Jehud with modern Yazur, about three miles (c. 5 kilometers) E-SE of Jaffa. It is believed that this is the place called “Azuru” in Sennacherib’s annals.

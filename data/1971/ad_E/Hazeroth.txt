HAZEROTH
(Ha·zeʹroth) [enclosure, settlement].
Israel’s last camping site before entering the Wilderness of Paran. (Num. 11:35; 12:16; 33:17, 18; Deut. 1:1) At Hazeroth Miriam was stricken with leprosy after she and Aaron questioned Moses’ authority and his taking of a Cushite wife. (Num. 11:35; 12:1-16) Most scholars connect Biblical Hazeroth with the oasis ʽAin Khadra, NE of the traditional site of Mount Sinai.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The absorbent, tough, elastic skeleton of certain aquatic animals found in abundance in the waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere. Sponges were probably obtained (in the past as today) by divers who removed them by hand from underwater rocks. After the living animal died and decayed within its skeleton, the sponge was washed thoroughly until only the skeleton remained.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The sponge’s ability to absorb and release liquids made it commercially important in ancient times for bathing and cleaning purposes. Sponges are not mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures. A sponge soaked with sour wine was offered to Jesus Christ at the end of a reed while he was on the torture stake.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:48-40:27:48" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 27:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:36-41:15:36" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mark 15:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:29-43:19:29" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> John 19:29</a>.</p>

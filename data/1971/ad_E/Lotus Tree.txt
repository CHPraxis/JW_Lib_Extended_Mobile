LOTUS TREE
[Heb., tse·ʼelimʹ].
The thorny lotus (Zizyphus lotus) is a thickly branched shrub or low tree, often growing to a height of only five feet (1.5 meters). The leaves are small, oval and leathery, and at the base of each leaf is a pair of thorns. The only reference to it is at Job 40:21, 22, which speaks of Behemoth (the hippopotamus) as lying in the shade cast by the tree. While this tree is found in dry places in Palestine and Anti-Lebanon, Corswant’s Dictionary of Life in Bible Times (p. 177) speaks of it as “flourishing in the hot and humid marshland” of N Africa.

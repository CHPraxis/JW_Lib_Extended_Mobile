GOD OF GOOD LUCK; GOD OF DESTINY
In Isaiah’s time the worship of these deities evidently involved setting a table of food and drink before them. (Isa. 65:11) Arabic tradition identifies the planet Jupiter with the “greater [good] luck” and the planet Venus with the “lesser [good] luck.” Hence, it has been suggested that the god of Good Luck (Gad) may be identified with Jupiter, and the god of Destiny (Meni) with Venus.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The exact identification of the musical instrument termed in Hebrew <em>ʽu·ghavʹ</em> is uncertain, since the Bible does not describe it; however, modern Bible translations generally render it “pipe.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:21:12-18:21:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 21:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:30:31-18:30:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:150:4-19:150:4" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ps. 150:4</a>; <em>AS, Da, NW, RS</em>) The pipe, if this is indeed the correct rendering, is the first wind instrument (likely, woodwind) mentioned in the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:21-1:4:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:21</a>) Jubal, the seventh generation from Adam, is identified as “the founder [literally, father] of all those who handle . . . the pipe.” This possibly indicates the establishment of a profession, either of craftsmen making the instruments or of those playing them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although the <em>ʽu·ghavʹ</em> was never listed as one of the temple instruments, some scholars believe that this name became a general term, designating any woodwind. Originally, though, it may have been a specific instrument, perhaps a series of multitoned pipes all closed at one end and blown across the open ends. The instrument in Nebuchadnezzar’s orchestra specified by the Aramaic expression <em>mash·roh·qi·thaʼʹ</em> (“pipe,” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:5-27:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 3:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:7-27:3:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:10-27:3:10" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:15-27:3:15" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 15</a>; <em>AT, Da, Mo, NW, RS</em>) appears to correspond to the Hebrew <em>ʽu·ghavʹ.</em></p>

AMRAM
(Amʹram) [people exalted].
1. A grandson of Levi through Kohath. (Ex. 6:16, 18; Num. 3:19; 26:58; 1 Chron. 6:18) He is stated to have married “his father’s sister,” Jochebed, an act then allowable but later prohibited in the Mosaic law. (Lev. 18:12) Some translations, however, endeavor to show her as his cousin. (See JOCHEBED.) His children were Aaron, Miriam and Moses.—Ex. 6:20; Num. 26:59; 1 Chron. 6:2, 3; 23:12, 13.
2. One of the “sons of Bani,” who, along with other returned exiles, responded to the call to put away foreign wives in 468-467 B.C.E.—Ezra 10:34, 44.
3. Name given to a Seirite, a son of Dishon, in the Authorized Version rendering of 1 Chronicles 1:38, 41.—See HEMDAN.

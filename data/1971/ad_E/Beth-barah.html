<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Gideon’s forces were pursuing the fleeing Midianites, Gideon sent word to the men of Ephraim to capture “the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:24-7:7:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 7:24</a>), evidently to prevent the enemy from crossing the Jordan. Since the battle took place in the low plain of Jezreel (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:33-7:6:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 6:33</a>), this would indicate a site W of the Jordan. The identification is uncertain, but a location near the mouth of the Wadi Farʽah is suggested as a likely and strategic site. A similar tactic was employed by Ehud in the fight against the Moabites and they “got to capture the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:27-7:3:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 3:27, 28</a>.</p>

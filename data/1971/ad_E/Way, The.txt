WAY, THE
This expression can be applied to a road, street, track or path; a mode of action or conduct, or a normal course, manner or method. In the Scriptures it is often used with reference to a course of conduct and action that is either approved or disapproved by Jehovah God. (Judg. 2:22; 2 Ki. 21:22; Ps. 27:11; 32:8; 86:11; Isa. 30:21; Jer. 7:23; 10:23; 21:8) With the coming of Jesus Christ, an individual’s enjoying a proper relationship with God and approaching him acceptably in prayer depended on acceptance of Jesus Christ. As the Son of God stated: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6; Heb. 10:19-22) Those who became followers of Jesus Christ were spoken of as belonging to “The Way,” that is, they adhered to a way or manner of life that centered around faith in Jesus Christ, following his example.—Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22.

HOLY CONTRIBUTION
A portion of land in Ezekielʼs vision of the division of the Promised Land. Each of the twelve tribes with the exception of Levi (Ephraim and Manasseh standing for Joseph, thus making up the twelve) was given an allotment running E and W across the land. South of the portion for Judah, which was the seventh allotment from the northern extremity, was the “holy contribution.” (Ezek. 48:1-8) The northern border of this strip ran along the southern border of Judah’s allotment; it was bounded on the S by Benjamin’s portion, which was the fifth allotment from the southern extremity. (48:23-28) The holy contribution was 25,000 cubits (6.9 miles or 11.1 kilometers) wide from N to S. It was to be given by the people for governmental use. In the midst of the holy contribution was the sanctuary of Jehovah.—48:8.
The sanctuary was located in the midst of a 25,000-cubit-square section. The remainder of the strip to the E and W of this square section consisted of two portions (25,000 cubits wide) for the chieftain. (Ezek. 48:20-22) The square section was divided as follows: a strip along the N boundary, 10,000 cubits (c. 2.8 miles or c. 4.4 kilometers) wide, for the Levites. It could not be sold or exchanged. (48:13, 14) Bordering the Levite portion on the S was a 10,000-cubit strip, a contribution to Jehovah for the priests, “a contribution from the contribution.” In this portion the sanctuary was located. (48:9-12) This left a strip 5,000 cubits (c. 1.4 miles or 2.2 kilometers) wide on the S. In the middle of this portion the city called “‘Jehovah Himself Is There” was located. The city was 4,500 cubits (c. 1.2 miles or 2 kilometers) square, having twelve gates, with a pasture ground 250 cubits (c. 365 feet or 111 meters) wide all around it. The remaining portion of the 25,000-cubit square, namely 10,000 cubits to the E of the city and 10,000 cubits to the W (5,000 cubits wide) was considered as profane, and was to be cultivated by the tribes of Israel to provide food for the city.—48:15-19, 30-35.

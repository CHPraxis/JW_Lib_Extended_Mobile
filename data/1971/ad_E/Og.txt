OG
The powerful Amorite king of Bashan (1 Ki. 4:19) whom the Israelites defeated before crossing into the Promised Land. Og was one of the giant Rephaim. In fact, his immense iron bier (perhaps a sarcophagus, or possibly a bed frame) measured some 13 feet by 6 feet (3.9 by 1.8 meters). He and Sihon ruled the Amorites E of the Jordan. (Deut. 3:11, 13; 4:46, 47) The domain of Og extended from Mount Hermon to the Jabbok River, territory E of the Jordan that included sixty fortified cities and numerous rural towns. (Deut. 3:3-5, 8-10; Josh. 12:4, 5; compare Numbers 21:23, 24.) His two principal cities were Edrei and Ashtaroth.—Deut. 1:4; Josh. 13:12.
The defeat of Og at the hands of Israel came toward the end of Israel’s forty-year wandering, just before they encamped on the plains of Moab. After defeating Sihon, Israel clashed with Og’s forces at Edrei and, in an overwhelming God-given victory, killed off Og and all his army and took possession of his cities and towns. (Num. 21:33–22:1; Deut. 3:1-13) Og’s territory became part of Manasseh’s inheritance. (Num. 32:33; Deut. 3:13; Josh. 13:29-31) The victory brought fright to the inhabitants of Canaan and was a contributing factor prompting Rahab and the Gibeonites to seek peace with Israel so that they too were not exterminated. (Josh. 2:10, 11; 9:9, 10) The victory was a great encouragement to Israel and was remembered even many centuries later.—Deut. 31:4; Neh. 9:22; Ps. 135:10-12; 136:17-22.

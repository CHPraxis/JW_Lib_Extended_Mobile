FOOD POUCH
A bag, usually made of leather, carried over the shoulder by travelers, shepherds, farmers and others. It was used for food, clothing and other provisions, but was not the same as the smaller girdle purse used for gold, silver and copper coins. (Matt. 10:9; Mark 6:8) David’s “shepherds’ bag” was doubtless such a pouch. (1 Sam. 17:40) Jesus Christ, when sending out first the twelve apostles and then the seventy disciples, told them not to carry a food pouch. (Matt. 10:5, 9, 10; Luke 9:3; 10:1, 4; 22:35, 36) Thereby they would be depending upon Jehovah God to care for them in the ministry rather than being anxious for material things, what they would eat or be clothed with tomorrow.—Matt. 6:25-34.

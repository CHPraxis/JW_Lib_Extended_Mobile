SYRACUSE
(Syrʹa·cuse).
A city with a fine harbor, on the SE coast of the island of Sicily. According to Thucydides, a Greek colony was established at Syracuse in the eighth century B.C.E.
The apostle Paul stayed at Syracuse for three days toward the close of his trip to Rome in 59 C.E. The layover there may have been necessary because of having to wait for suitable sailing wind. (Acts 28:12) From Syracuse Paul’s ship went “around” and came to Rhegium, on the southern tip of Italy. The exact meaning of this expression is not known. Possibly the vessel took a somewhat curved route, away from the coast, in order to get sufficient wind to fill its sails. Or, maybe it “made a circuit—following the coast—” to reach Rhegium.—Acts 28:13, The Amplified New Testament.

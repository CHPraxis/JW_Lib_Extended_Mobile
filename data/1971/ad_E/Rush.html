<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">[Heb., <em>ʼagh·monʹ</em>].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Any of a variety of grass-like plants commonly growing in marshes. The true rushes have round, frequently hollow, stems with three rows of grasslike leaves, and small brownish or greenish flowers. The designation <em>ʼagh·monʹ</em> may have included the various kinds of true rushes as well as the rushlike plants of the sedge family. Anciently, rushes were employed in starting the fire in a furnace.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:41:20-18:41:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 41:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:41:2-18:41:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 41:2</a> “rush” may refer to a cord of twisted rushes or one spun from their fibers. The other Scriptural references to <em>ʼagh·monʹ</em> are illustrative. Jehovah took no delight in renegade Israel’s fasting, attended by bowing their heads ceremonially like a rush. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:58:5-23:58:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 58:5</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:14-23:9:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:14</a>, “rush” seems to refer to the false prophets (the “tail”) who merely spoke what the leaders of the nation of Israel (the “head” or “shoot”) wanted to hear.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:15-23:9:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 9:15</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:19:15-23:19:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 19:15</a>, where “rush” appears to denote the Egyptians in general.</p>

GIZONITE
(Giʹzo·nite).
A designation referring either to the family or to the place of origin of Hashem, whose “sons” were among the mighty men of David’s military forces. (1 Chron. 11:26, 34) However, the derivation of “Gizonite” cannot be ascertained with any certainty, as “Gizon” and “Gizo” are not mentioned anywhere in the Scriptures.

ZEBEDEE
(Zebʹe·dee) [gift of Jah].
Father of Jesus’ apostles James and John. (Matt. 4:21, 22; 10:2; 26:37; Mark 3:17; 10:35; Luke 5:10; John 21:2) Zebedee’s wife Salome is generally believed to have been the sister of Jesus’ mother Mary. This would make Zebedee Jesus’ uncle by marriage, and James and John, Jesus’ cousins.—Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40; John 19:25; see SALOME No. 1.
Zebedee was in the fishing business on the Sea of Galilee and apparently did quite well with it, for there were hired men working with him. (Mark 1:16, 19, 20) His wife Salome was able to render material services to Jesus. (Mark 15:40, 41) So while there is no indication that Zebedee himself followed Christ, his family freely did so.—Matt. 20:20.

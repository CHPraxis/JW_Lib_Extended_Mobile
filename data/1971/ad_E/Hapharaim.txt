HAPHARAIM
(Haphʹa·raʹim).
A site on the territorial boundary of the tribe of Issachar. (Josh. 19:17-19) It cannot be identified with certainty. However, most modern geographers tentatively locate it at et-Taiyibeh, about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) NW of Beth-shean. Hapharaim also appears in a list of the Palestinian cities conquered by Egypt’s King Shishak.

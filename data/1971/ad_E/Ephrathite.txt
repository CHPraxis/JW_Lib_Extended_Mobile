EPHRATHITE
(Ephʹrath·ite).
1. An inhabitant of Bethlehem or Ephrathah.—Ruth 1:2; 1 Sam. 17:12.
2. In Hebrew the same term is applied as referring to a member of the tribe of Ephraim (Judg. 12:5; 1 Ki. 11:26) or to one residing in Ephraim, as in the genealogy of the Levite Elkanah, (1 Sam. 1:1) The Authorized Version renders the Hebrew term as “Ephrathite” in two of these texts.

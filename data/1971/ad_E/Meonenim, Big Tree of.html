<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A tree within sight of Shechem, passed by a band of King Abimelech’s men before their fight with the landowners of that city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:34-7:9:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 9:34-37</a>) “Big tree of Meonenim” translates the Hebrew words <em>ʼe·lohnʹ m<sup>e</sup>ʽoh·n<sup>e</sup>nimʹ. ʼE·lohnʹ</em> means big trees in general and <em>m<sup>e</sup>ʽoh-n<sup>e</sup>nimʹ</em> is a participle signifying “those practicing magic.” The tree may have been so named because Canaanites or apostate Israelites engaged in magical practices there. Some scholars also link the “big tree of Meonenim” with the “big trees of Moreh” that are similarly described as being in the vicinity of Shechem.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:6-1:12:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 12:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:4-1:35:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 35:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:9:6-7:9:6" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Judges 9:6</a>.</p>

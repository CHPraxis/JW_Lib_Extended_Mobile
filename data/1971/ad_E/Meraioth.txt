MERAIOTH
(Me·raʹioth) [rebellious].
1. A priestly descendant of Aaron through Eleazar; called “the son of Zerahiah.”—1 Chron. 6:3-7, 52; Ezra 7:3, 4.
2. A priest identified as “the son of Ahitub, a leader of the house of the true God” and who appears to be the father of Zadok.—1 Chron. 9:10, 11; Neh. 11:11.
3. Founder of a priestly paternal house, the head of which was Helkai in the days of Joiakim. (Neh. 12:12, 15) “Meraioth,” the name of this house of a generation following the Jews’ return from Babylonian exile, may be a variation of “Meremoth,” the name of one of the priests accompanying Zerubbabel to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E.—Neh. 12:3.

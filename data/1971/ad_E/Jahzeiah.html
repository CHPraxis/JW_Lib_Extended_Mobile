<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One who apparently opposed Ezra’s proposal that the sons of Israel send away their foreign wives and the children born to them; son of Tikvah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:3-15:10:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 10:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:10-15:10:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:10:15-15:10:15" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 15</a>) One commentary contends that this opposition of Jahzeiah and Jonathan was not against Ezra’s suggestion but against the procedure adopted for carrying it out. According to the <em>Septuagint</em> and <em>Vulgate,</em> Jahzeiah and the others assisted rather than opposed Ezra. Hence, an alternate rendering of verse 15 says that Jonathan and Jahzeiah “were the ones that acted representatively in this behalf.”—<em>NW,</em> 1955 ed., ftn. a; <em>AV; AS,</em> margin; <em>Dy; Knox</em>.</p>

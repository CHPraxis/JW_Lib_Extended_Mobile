<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A boundary site in Ezekiel’s vision of Israel’s inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:13-26:47:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 47:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:15-26:47:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15, 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:47:18-26:47:18" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 18</a>) According to some scholars it embraced approximately the same area earlier covered by the term “Bashan.” (See BASHAN.) Hauran is apparently the district referred to in ancient Egyptian texts (<em>Huruna</em>), and Assyrian documents of Shalmaneser III (<em>Hauranu</em>). It also appears to correspond to the smaller region called “Auranitis” in Graeco-Roman times. The name el-Hauran is applied today to the rolling prairie of rich red soil between Damascus and the Yarmuk River.</p>

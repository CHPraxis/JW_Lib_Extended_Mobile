RAAMAH
(Raʹa·mah).
A son of Ham’s firstborn, Cush, and brother of Nimrod. Raamah and his two sons Sheba and Dedan founded three of the seventy post-Flood families. (Gen. 10:6-8; 1 Chron. 1:9) Many centuries later the tribal descendants of Raamah, Dedan and Sheba all carried on trade with Tyre. (Ezek. 27:20, 22) Just where the tribe springing from Raamah resided is uncertain, but the city of Raamah near Maʽin in SW Arabia mentioned in a Minaean inscription is likely.

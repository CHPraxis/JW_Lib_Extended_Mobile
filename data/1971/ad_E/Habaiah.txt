HABAIAH
(Ha·baiʹah) [Jah has concealed].
A priest whose descendants returned from exile in Babylon. But as his “sons” were unable to establish their genealogy, they were barred from the priesthood and were not permitted to “eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.”—Ezra 2:1, 2, 61-63; Neh. 7:63-65.

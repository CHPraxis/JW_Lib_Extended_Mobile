LION’S PIT
The place of execution into which the prophet Daniel was thrown but from which he was later removed unharmed, having enjoyed angelic protection. (Dan. 6:7, 12, 13, 16-24) This pit had an opening that could be covered with a stone. (Dan. 6:17) It was evidently a sunken or underground place, for Daniel was “lifted up out of the pit.”—Dan. 6.23.

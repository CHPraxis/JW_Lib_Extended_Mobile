<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Je·rubʹbe·sheth) [let the shameful thing make a legal defense against him].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of Judge Gideon found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:11:21-10:11:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:21</a>. Evidently this is a form of Jerubbaal, the name given to Gideon by his father Joash when Gideon pulled down the altar of Baal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:30-7:6:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 6:30-32</a>) Some scholars believe that the writer of Second Samuel replaced <em>baʹʽal</em> with the Hebrew word for “shame” (<em>boʹsheth</em>) in order not to use the name of the false god Baal as part of a proper name.—See GIDEON.</p>

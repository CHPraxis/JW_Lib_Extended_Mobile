CHIMHAM
(Chim’ham) [pale].
Presumably a son of Barzillai. When the aged Barzillai declined the invitation to become part of King David’s court and recommended that Chimham go in his place, David replied: “With me Chimham will go across [the Jordan], and I myself shall do to him what is good in your eyes; and all that you may choose to lay upon me I shall do for you.” (2 Sam. 19:33, 37-40) Apparently Chimham remained in the royal court, as indicated by David’s final instructions to Solomon. (1 Ki 2:7) Reference is made at Jeremiah 41:17 to the “lodging place of Chimham” near Bethlehem. It is not known whether this refers to the Chimham of David’s time or to a later man by the same name. Some commentators say that Chimham may have been given a tract of land for his services to David, or that it was a place where Chimham had built a lodging place for travelers.

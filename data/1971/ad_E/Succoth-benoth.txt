SUCCOTH-BENOTH
(Sucʹcoth-beʹnoth) [booths of daughters].
A deity worshiped by the Babylonians whom the king of Assyria brought into the cities of Samaria after his taking the Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom into exile. (2 Ki. 17:30) Some authorities suggest that the name “Succoth-benoth” is a Hebraized form of Sarpanitu, the consort of Merodach (Marduk). Others favor an identification with Merodach or Marduk on the basis that the name “Succoth-benoth” may be Sakut(h)banʼwat(h), meaning “the Counselor, creator of the land.” This title is understood to apply to Merodach, who was viewed by the Babylonians as the creator of the world.

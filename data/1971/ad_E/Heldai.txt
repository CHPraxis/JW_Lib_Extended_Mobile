HELDAI
(Helʹdai) [possibly, mole rat].
1. The head of the twelfth monthly service group that David organized; a descendant of Othniel. (1 Chron. 27:1, 15) Being a Netophathite, he is likely the mighty man called Heleb and Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite.—2 Sam. 23:8, 29; 1 Chron. 11:26, 30.
2. A man who returned from Babylon and whose silver and gold went into the making of a crown for High Priest Joshua. (Zech. 6:10, 11) This Heldai is called Helem in verse 14.

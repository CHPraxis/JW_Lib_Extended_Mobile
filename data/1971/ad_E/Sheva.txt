SHEVA
(Sheʹva) [vanity].
1. Father of Machbenah and Gibea. As these are names of towns, however, Sheva was perhaps the father of those who settled there or was himself the founder of these towns. Sheva’s father Caleb (Chelubai) headed one of the three major divisions of Judah’s descendants through Hezron.—1 Chron. 2:9, 48-50.
2. David’s secretary.—2 Sam. 20:25; see SERAIAH No. 2.

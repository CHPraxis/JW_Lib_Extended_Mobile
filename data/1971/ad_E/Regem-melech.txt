REGEM-MELECH
(Regʹem-melʹech) [perhaps, friend of the king].
One of two leading men sent by the people of postexilic Bethel to “soften the face of Jehovah” and to inquire about continuing the customary fasting. This was more than two years before the rebuilt temple was completed.—Zech. 7:1-3; Ezra 6:15.

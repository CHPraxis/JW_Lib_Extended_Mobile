STONING
Under the Law, a wrongdoer deserving capital punishment usually was pelted to death with stones. (Lev. 20:2) This was to ‘clear out what was bad from their midst.’ All Israel would hear of the punishment, and fear of such wrongdoing would be instilled in their hearts. (Deut. 13:5, 10, 11; 22:22, 23) In stoning an evildoer, they showed that they were zealous for true worship, anxious to see that no reproach came upon God’s name and desirous of maintaining a clean congregation.
Before stoning, at least two witnesses had to give harmonious testimony against the wrongdoer, and thereafter they cast the first stones. (Lev. 24:14; Deut. 17:6, 7) The prospect of being the executioner made a person think searchingly in giving evidence and doubtless was a deterrent against false testimony, which, if discovered, would cost the lying witness his own life.—Deut. 19:18-20.
Stoning no doubt usually took place outside the city. (Num. 15:34, 35; 1 Ki. 21:13; contrast Deuteronomy 22:21.) Thereafter, as a warning, the corpse might be impaled on a stake, but not beyond sunset. It was buried that same day.—Deut. 21:21-23.
Jesus spoke of Jerusalem as “the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her.” (Matt. 23:37; compare Hebrews 11:37.) Christ himself was threatened with stoning. (John 8:59; 10:31-39; 11:8) Stephen was killed in this manner. (Acts 7:58-60) At Lystra fanatical Jews “stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining he was dead.”—Acts 14:19; compare 2 Corinthians 11:25.

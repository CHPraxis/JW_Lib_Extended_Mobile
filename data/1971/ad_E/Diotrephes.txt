DIOTREPHES
(Di·otʹre·phes) [nurtured by Zeus].
A man mentioned by the apostle John in his letter to Gaius. In addition to being ambitious, proud, disrespectful of apostolic authority, rebellious and inhospitable, Diotrephes tried to hinder those desiring to show hospitality to the brothers and to expel these from the congregation.—3 John 9, 10.

SIRION
(Sirʹi·on) [cuirass, coat of mail].
The old Sidonian name for Mount Hermon, called Senir by the Amorites. (Deut. 3:9) The names “Sirion” and “Senir” appear in the Ugaritic texts found at Ras Shamra in northern Syria, and in the documents from the Turkish village Boghazkevi, thus corroborating the Bible’s exactness. Like Senir, Sirion perhaps also designates a particular part of Mount Hermon. (Compare 1 Chronicles 5:23.) At Psalm 29:6 Sirion and Lebanon are mentioned together. For this reason it has been suggested that Sirion perhaps refers to the Anti-Lebanon range.—See HERMON.

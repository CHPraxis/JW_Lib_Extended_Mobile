QUART
After the opening of the “third seal,” as referred to at Revelation 6:5, 6, both a khoiʹnix of wheat and three khoiʹni·kes of barley are said to sell for a denarius. Estimates as to the size of the khoiʹnix range from one and a half pints to about one quart. Generally, however, scholars believe it to be slightly more than a liter or a little less than a U.S. dry quart. Since a denarius was a day’s wage in John’s time (Matt. 20:1-12), grains selling at such prices would indicate famine conditions.

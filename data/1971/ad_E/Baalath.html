<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Baʹal·ath) [mistress].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A border town of the original territory of Dan, mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:44-6:19:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 19:44, 45</a> as being between Gibbethon and Jehud. It is evidently the same place that Solomon later included in his rebuilding program. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:5-14:8:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 8:5, 6</a>) Its identification geographically is uncertain; Josephus (<em>Antiquities of the Jews</em>, Book VIII, chap. VI, par. 1) refers to it along with Beth-horon as not far from Gezer, another fortified city.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:9:17-11:9:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:17, 18</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Taʹmar) [palm tree].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">1. Daughter-in-law of Jacob’s son Judah. Tamar married Judah’s first son Er, but Jehovah put Er to death for his wickedness, leaving Tamar a widow. She was then given Onan, but Jehovah put him to death for failure to perform brother-in-law marriage, and Tamar still remained a childless widow. Judah procrastinated in giving her his third son; so as to conceal her identity she disguised herself as a prostitute in order to get Judah himself to have relations with her, cleverly taking his seal ring, cord and rod as security. When Judah learned that Tamar was pregnant, he at first wanted her (stoned and then) burned. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:15-6:7:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 7:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:25-6:7:25" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 25</a>.) But on learning that through her maneuvering to get an heir he had become the father, Judah exclaimed, “She is more righteous than I am.” In the difficult birth that followed, Tamar produced twins, Perez and Zerah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:38:6-1:38:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 38:6-30</a>) The Messianic lineage is traced through her son Perez.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:12-8:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ruth 4:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:18-8:4:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:4-13:2:4" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:3-40:1:3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Matt. 1:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. A beautiful daughter of King David and full sister of Absalom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:3:9-13:3:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 3:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:1-10:13:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 13:1</a>) Her oldest half-brother Amnon became infatuated with her and through craftiness succeeded in violating her, though she resisted him. Absalom consoled her, kept her in his house, and two years later avenged Tamar by having Amnon murdered.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:1-10:13:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 13:1-33</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">3. Daughter of Absalom, likely named after her aunt (No. 2 above). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:27-10:14:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Sam. 14:27</a>) Like her father, she was very attractive in appearance. She may have married Uriel, which would have made her the mother of Rehoboam’s favored wife Maacah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:11:20-14:11:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:13:1-14:13:2" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13:1, 2</a>.</p>

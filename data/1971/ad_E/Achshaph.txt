ACHSHAPH
(Achʹshaph) [sorcery or place of magic].
A royal city of Canaan whose king responded to the call of Jabin, king of Hazor, and joined the encampment of kings at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel. (Josh. 11:1, 5) He was killed in the battle that followed. (Josh. 12:7, 20) The city of Achshaph was later included in the territory assigned as an inheritance to the tribe of Asher.—Josh. 19:25.
Achshaph may possibly be identified with Tell Kisan, a site about six miles (9.7 kilometers) SE of Acco (present-day Acre). Its name appears in the Karnak list of towns that were conquered by Thutmose III, as well as among the Tell el-Amarna Letters.

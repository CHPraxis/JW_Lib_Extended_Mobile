<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The cessation of all functions of life, hence, the opposite of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:15-5:30:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 30:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19</a>) In the Bible the same original-language words for ‘death’ or ‘dying’ are applied to humans, animals and plants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:19-21:3:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:24-43:12:24" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> John 12:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:12-65:1:12" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Jude 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:3-66:16:3" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Rev. 16:3</a>) However, for humans and animals the Bible shows the vital function of the blood in maintaining life, stating that the “soul of the flesh is in the blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:11-3:17:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 17:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:14-3:17:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:8-1:4:11" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Gen. 4:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:3-1:9:4" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 9:3, 4</a>) Both humans and animals are spoken of as ‘expiring,’ that is, ‘breathing out’ the breath of life (Heb., <em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em>). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:21-1:7:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 7:21, 22</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a>.) And the Scriptures show that death in humans and animals follows the loss of the “force of life” or “spirit” (Heb., <em>ru’ahh;</em> Gr., <em>pneu’ma</em>).—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:17-1:6:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:15-1:7:15" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:22-1:7:22" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:19-21:3:19" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Eccl. 3:19</a>; see SPIRIT.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is of interest to note the correspondency of these Biblical points with what is known scientifically of the death process. In humans, for example, when the heart stops beating, the blood ceases to circulate the nourishment and the oxygen (obtained by breathing) to the billions of body cells. However, as is pointed out in <em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em> (1966 <span id="page431" class="pageNum" data-no="431" data-before-text="431"></span>ed., Vol. 5, p. 53): “. . . all the cells of the human body do not die at once. The hair may continue to grow for several hours after death. The cells of the cortex of the brain are very susceptible to lack of oxygen. They usually die first when the blood ceases to circulate. If the cells of the brain are completely deprived of oxygen for 5 or 10 minutes they can no longer completely regain their ability to function.” Thus while the vital importance of breathing and of the blood in maintaining the life force (<em>ruʹahh; pneuʹm</em>a) in the body cells is evident, at the same time it is also clear that it is the cessation of neither breathing nor the heartbeat alone that brings death, but the disappearance of the life force or spirit from the body cells.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:29-19:104:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 104:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:4-19:146:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 146:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:8-21:8:8" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Eccl. 8:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>CAUSE OF DEATH IN HUMANS</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The first reference to death in the Scriptures occurs at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a> in God’s command to the first man concerning the eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, violation of which command would result in death. However, death among animals as a natural process was evidently already in effect, since they are passed over completely in the Biblical presentation of the introduction of death into the human family. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:12-61:2:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:12</a>.) The gravity of God’s warning about the death penalty for disobedience would therefore be understandable to his human son, Adam. Adam’s disobedience to his Creator brought death to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:19-1:3:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:14, 15</a>) Thereafter, Adam’s sin and its consequence, death, spread to all men.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Certain texts are, at times, brought forth as supposed evidence that physical death was intended as a natural eventuality for humans, even as for the animals; for example, the references to man’s life-span as being ‘seventy or eighty years’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>) and the apostle’s statement that “it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this a judgment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:27-58:9:27" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 9:27</a>) Nevertheless, all such texts were written <em>after</em> the introduction of death among mankind, and are applied to imperfect, sinful humans. The tremendous longevity of the men living prior to the Flood must at least be considered as reflecting a remarkable potential in the human body, surpassing that found in any animal even under the most ideal conditions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:5:1-1:5:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 5:1-31</a>) The Bible unmistakably relates the entrance of death into the human family to Adam’s sin, as already shown.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Alienated from God by sin, mankind in general is said to be in “enslavement to corruption.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 8:21</a>) This enslavement is due to the workings of sin in their bodies, bringing forth its corrupting fruit, and all persons not obedient to God are under the rule of sin as its slaves “with death in view.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rom. 6:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:16-45:6:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:19-45:6:21" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 19-21</a>) Satan is stated to have “the means to cause death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:14-58:2:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 2:14, 15</a>) He is called a “manslayer” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>), not in the sense of directly killing, but, by deceit and seduction to sin, inducing or stimulating wrongdoing that leads to corruption and death (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:3-47:11:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3</a>), and also by fathering murderous attitudes in the minds and hearts of men. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:40-43:8:44" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 8:40-44,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:59-43:8:59" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 59;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:2-43:13:2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 13:2</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:14-59:3:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">James 3:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:1-59:4:2" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 4:1, 2</a>.) Death is therefore presented, not as the friend of man, but as man’s “enemy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:26</a>) It is generally those in extreme or unbearable pain who are shown as desiring death.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:3:21-18:3:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 3:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:7:15-18:7:15" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 7:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:9:6-66:9:6" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Rev. 9:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>CONDITION OF HUMAN DEAD</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The dead are shown to be “conscious of nothing at all” and the death state to be one of complete inactivity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:4-19:146:4" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Ps. 146:4</a>) In both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures death is likened to sleep, a fitting comparison, not only due to the unconscious condition of the dead, but also because of the hope of an awakening through the resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:13:3-19:13:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 13:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:14" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> John 11:11-14</a>) The resurrected Jesus is spoken of as “the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep in death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:20-46:15:21" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:20, 21</a>) It is interesting to note that the English word “cemetery” comes from the Greek word <em>koi·me·teʹri·on,</em> meaning “a sleeping room, burial place cemetery.”—Liddell and Scott’s <em>A Greek-English Lexicon,</em> p. 777; see HADES; SHEOL.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:13-45:7:13" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Rom. 7:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:23-45:7:24" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>) The abolition of death, therefore, would require the abolition of that which produces death: sin. By the removal of the last trace of sin from obedient mankind, the authority of death will be abolished and death itself destroyed, and this is to be accomplished during the reign of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:26" data-bid="60-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:24-26</a>) Thereby death, brought upon the human race by Adam’s transgression, “will be no more.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:3, 4</a>) Its destruction is figuratively likened to its being hurled into a “lake of fire.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:14-66:20:14" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Rev. 20:14</a>; see LAKE OF FIRE.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>SECOND DEATH</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The “lake of fire” into which death, Hades, the symbolic “wild beast” and “false prophet,” and Satan, his demons, and the persistent practicers of wickedness on earth are cast is shown to mean “the second death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:10-66:20:10" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Rev. 20:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:14-66:20:15" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:8-66:21:8" data-bid="63-3" class="b"> 21:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:41-40:25:41" data-bid="63-4" class="b"> Matt. 25:41</a>) Initially death resulted and was passed on to mankind by Adam’s transgression; hence the “second death” must be distinct from this inherited death. It is evident from the cited texts that there is no release possible from the “second death.” The situation of those in the “second death” corresponds to the outcome warned of in such texts as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:4-58:6:8" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:4-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:26-58:10:27" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 10:26, 27</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:32-40:12:32" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Matthew 12:32</a>. On the other hand, those represented as gaining the “crown of life” and having part in the “first resurrection” are free from any possibility of harm by the second death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:10-66:2:11" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Rev. 2:10, 11</a>) These, who are to reign with Christ, receive immortality (deathlessness) and incorruption and hence are beyond the “authority” of the second death.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:50-46:15:54" data-bid="67-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:50-54;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:6</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:51-43:8:51" data-bid="68-1" class="b">John 8:51</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>ILLUSTRATIVE USE</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Death is personified as a “king” ruling over mankind from the time of Adam (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Rom. 5:14</a>), along with the rule of “King Sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:12-45:6:12" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Rom. 6:12</a>) Thus, these kings are spoken of as exercising their “law” over those subject to their dominion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:2-45:8:2" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Rom. 8:2</a>) With Christ’s coming and the provision of the ransom, undeserved kindness began exercising a superior kingship over those accepting God’s gift, “with everlasting life in view.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:15-45:5:17" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Rom. 5:15-17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:21-45:5:21" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Though men, disregarding God’s purposes, may try to make their own nonaggression pact or covenant with King Death, it will fail.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong><em>The “pangs of death”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:24-44:2:24" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Acts 2:24</a> the apostle Peter spoke of Jesus as being ‘loosed from the pangs of death, for it was not possible for him to continue to be held fast by it.’ The Greek word (<em>o·din</em>ʹ) here translated “pangs” is elsewhere used to mean the pains of childbirth (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:3-52:5:3" data-bid="84-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:3</a>) but may also mean travail, pain, calamity, or distress generally. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:8-40:24:8" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Matt. 24:8</a>) Additionally, it was used by the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> in rendering the Hebrew word <em>hheʹvel</em> in texts where the evident meaning is “rope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:5-10:22:6" data-bid="86-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:4-19:18:5" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:4, 5</a>) A related Hebrew word means “birth pangs,” leading some commentators and lexicographers to suggest that the Greek term (<em>o·dinʹ</em>) used by Luke at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:24-44:2:24" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Acts 2:24</a> also had this double meaning, at least in Hellenistic Greek of apostolic times. Thus some translations render the phrase in this verse as “the bands [or bonds] of death.” (<em>NC</em> Spanish]; <em>Segond, Ostervald</em> [French]) In numerous texts the danger of death is represented as reaching out to snare the threatened one (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:14-20:13:14" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Prov. 13:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:27-20:14:27" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 14:27</a>) with ropes that encircle him and bring him down into “the distressing circumstances of Sheol.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:3-19:116:3" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Ps. 116:3</a>) Whereas other texts, already considered, show that there is no consciousness in death, and it is obvious that Jesus was not in any literal pain while dead, nonetheless death is presented as a bitter and distressing experience (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:32-9:15:32" data-bid="90-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:4-19:55:4" data-bid="90-2" class="b"> Ps. 55:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:26-21:7:26" data-bid="90-3" class="b"> Eccl. 7:26</a>), not only in the pain usually preceding it (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:4-19:73:5" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Ps. 73:4, 5</a>), but in the loss of all activity and freedom that its paralyzing grip brings. So, it may be that it is in this sense that Jesus’ resurrection ‘loosed’ him from the “pangs of death,” being freed from its distressing grip.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Change in spiritual state or condition</em></strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The death state is used to illustrate the spiritually dead condition of the world in general, so that Jesus could speak of the ‘dead burying the dead,’ and the apostle could refer to the woman living for sensual gratification as “dead though she is living.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:60-42:9:60" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Luke 9:60;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:6-54:5:6" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:1" data-bid="92-3" class="b"> Eph. 2:1</a>) And since physical death discharges one from any debts or obligations existing up to that time (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:7-45:6:7" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rom. 6:7</a>), a Christian’s being freed or liberated from sin (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:2-45:6:2" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Rom. 6:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:11-45:6:11" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> 11</a>) and from the condemnation of the Mosaic law (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:2-45:7:6" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Rom. 7:2-6</a>) is also likened to death, such one having ‘died’ to his former situation and obligations. The one figuratively dying in such a way, of course, is still alive physically and is now free to follow Christ as a slave to righteousness.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:18-45:6:20" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Rom. 6:18-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:1-48:5:1" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The use of death to represent a change in one’s state or condition throws light on prophetic visions, such as that in the book of Ezekiel wherein God’s people in exile in Babylon are likened to dried-out bones and to persons dead and buried. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:37:1-26:37:12" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:1-12</a>) They were to “come to life” again and be settled on their own soil once more.

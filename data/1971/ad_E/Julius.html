<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Juʹli·us).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A Roman army officer or centurion of the band of Augustus in whose custody Paul traveled to Rome. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:1-44:27:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 27:1</a>; see AUGUSTUS, BAND OF; CENTURION [Army Officer].) From the beginning of the voyage, Julius apparently appreciated that Paul was not an ordinary prisoner and showed him kindness, for example, letting him go ashore to visit friends at Sidon. However, when Paul later suggested that for the time being their continuing on would be perilous, Julius listened to the contrary opinion of the pilot and the shipowner. Later Julius’ soldiers prevented the escape of the sailors, in keeping with Paul’s words: “Unless these men remain in the boat, you cannot be saved.” When shipwreck occurred, Julius, by not letting the soldiers kill the prisoners, saved Paul’s life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:1-44:27:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 27:1-44</a>.</p>

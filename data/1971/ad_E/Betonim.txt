BETONIM
(Betʹo·nim) [pistachios].
A city E of the Jordan that Moses gave as “a gift” to the tribe of Gad. (Josh. 13:24-27) Betonim is generally held to be the present-day Khirbet Batneh in the mountainous country some seventeen miles (27 kilometers) NE of the point where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea. The name may originally have derived from there having been a large number of pistachio trees in that vicinity.

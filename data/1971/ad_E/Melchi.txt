MELCHI
(Melʹchi) [Gr. form of Heb., Mal·kiʹ, my king; or, perhaps, a contraction of “Malchijah,” meaning “Jehovah is king”].
In the Westcott and Hort and other Greek texts the name is spelled “Melchei,” but in the Received Text, Griesbach’s, Nestle’s and others it is “Melchi,” the spelling most translators use for the name of these two maternal ancestors of Jesus Christ.
1. The “son” (or descendant) of Addi and father (or ancestor) of Neri.—Luke 3:27, 28.
2. The “son” (or descendant) of Jannai and father (or ancestor) of Levi.—Luke 3:23, 24.

BORASHAN
(Borʹa·shan) [well of smoke].
One of the places that David and his men frequented during his time as a fugitive. (1 Sam. 30:30, 31) Some authorities consider it to be the same as Ashan (Josh. 19:7), a Simeonite enclave city in the southern part of Judah’s territory, a short distance NW of Beer-sheba.—See ASHAN.

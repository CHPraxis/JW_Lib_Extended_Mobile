TELAIM
(Te·laʹim) [lambs].
A site, apparently in Judah, where Saul numbered his forces before striking the Amalekites. (1 Sam. 15:1-4) Telaim appears to be the same as Telem, listed with southern Judean cities, and is usually believed to have been located about twenty-six miles (c. 42 kilometers) W-SW of the southern end of the Dead Sea. (Josh. 15:21, 24) It is also probably to be connected with “Telam.”—1 Sam. 27:8; see TELAM; TELEM No. 2.

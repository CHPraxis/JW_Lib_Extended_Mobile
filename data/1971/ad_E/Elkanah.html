<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">2. The second of four Levite Kohathites named Elkanah and listed in Chronicles.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">4. The son of Jeroham and the father of Samuel the prophet, as well as of other sons and daughters. Elkanah was a resident of Ramah of the mountainous region of Ephraim. Hence he is called an Ephraimite, although genealogically he was a Levite. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:1-9:1:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:27-13:6:27" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:33-13:6:34" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 33, 34</a>) It was Elkanah’s practice to go from year to year to Shiloh “to prostrate himself and to sacrifice to Jehovah.” He had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Although Hannah continued barren, Elkanah loved her and tried to console her for being barren. Later, in answer to Hannah’s prayer, Jehovah blessed them with the birth of Samuel, and still later with three sons and two daughters.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:2-9:1:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:5-9:1:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:8-9:1:8" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:19-9:1:19" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:21-9:2:21" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 2:21</a>.</p>

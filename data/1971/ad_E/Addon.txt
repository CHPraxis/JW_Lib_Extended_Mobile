ADDON
(Adʹdon).
Apparently an unidentified location in Babylonia, from which some returning to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E., at the end of the seventy-year desolation of Judah, were unable to establish their genealogy from the public records. As a consequence, they were disqualified from serving in the priesthood. Other authorities think Addon was an individual who was unable to prove his ancestry.—Ezra 2:59-62; Neh. 7:61-64.

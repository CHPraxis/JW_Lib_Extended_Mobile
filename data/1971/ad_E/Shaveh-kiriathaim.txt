SHAVEH-KIRIATHAIM
(Shaʹveh-kir·i·a·thaʹim) [level (plain) of Kiriathaim (twin cities)].
Scene of Chedorlaomer’s victory over the Emim. (Gen. 14:5) It was apparently the plain near or surrounding the city of Kiriathaim, E of the Jordan and later built or rebuilt by the Reubenites. (Num. 32:37; Josh. 13:15, 19) Geographers usually place Kiriathaim at el-Qereiyat, about six miles (10 kilometers) NW of the suggested location of Dibon.

SITNAH
(Sitʹnah) [accusation].
A well that Isaac’s servants dug in the vicinity of Gerar and Rehoboth. It was named Sitnah because of their dispute over it with the shepherds of Gerar. Sitnah’s exact location is not known. (Gen. 26:19-22) However, perhaps it was somewhere in Wadi Shutnet er-Ruheibeh, about eighteen miles (29 kilometers) SW of Beer-sheba. This wadi’s name bears a similarity to both Sitnah and Rehoboth.

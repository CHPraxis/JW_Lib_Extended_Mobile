<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The wife of Heber the Kenite and slayer of Canaanite army chief Sisera. Though living at Kedesh, the point where Barak and Deborah rallied to fight against Sisera, Heber was at peace with the Canaanite oppressors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:10-7:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 4:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:17-7:4:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:21-7:4:21" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 21</a>) After Sisera was defeated at Israel’s hand, he fled to Heber’s neutral encampment, where Jael invited him into her tent. She then covered him with a blanket. When he asked for water she gave him a banquet bowl of curdled milk to drink. After she again covered him up, he asked her to stand guard at the entrance of the tent. Thinking himself secure as her guest, the tired and weary Sisera soon fell fast asleep. Jael then quietly came in to him armed with a hammer and a tent pin that she drove through his head into the earth. When the pursuer Barak arrived, she showed him the army chief, dead at “the hand of a woman,” as Deborah foretold.

EPHAH, I
(eʹphah).
A dry measure equal to ten omers (Ex. 16:36) or to one-tenth of a homer. The ephah corresponded to the liquid bath measure and is therefore reckoned at .62 bushel (22 liters). (Ezek. 45:11) In the Scriptures, “ephah” is used with reference to an amount of flour (Lev. 5:11), barley (Ruth 2:17), roasted grain (1 Sam. 17:17) and wheat (Ezek. 45:13), and also to the container used for measuring an ephah. (Lev. 19:36; Amos 8:5) Zechariah 5:6-11 tells of an ephah measure that was covered with a circular lid of lead, and in which the woman “Wickedness” was confined.

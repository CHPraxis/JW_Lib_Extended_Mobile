<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The campsite E of the Jordan from which the remaining forces of Midianite Kings Zebah and Zalmunna were routed by Judge Gideon’s surprise military maneuver. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:10-7:8:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 8:10, 11</a>) Karkor’s exact location is today unknown. Some geographers, however, tentatively identify it with Qarqar, located over a hundred miles (161 kilometers) E of the Dead Sea. Whether Gideon’s tired foot soldiers traveled that distance in pursuit of the enemy may be subject to doubt.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:4-7:8:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judges 8:4, 5</a>.</p>

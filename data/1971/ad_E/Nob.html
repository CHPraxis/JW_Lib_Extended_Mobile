<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A city evidently in the territory of Benjamin and close to Jerusalem. While there is some question as to the precise location of Nob, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:11:31-16:11:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nehemiah 11:31, 32 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:10:28-23:10:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isaiah 10:28-32</a> indicate that it was near Anathoth and possibly close to a hill from which one could see Jerusalem. A number of geographical authorities believe that Nob was at modern Ras Umm et-Tala, on the E slope of Mount Scopus, about one mile (1.6 kilometers) N-NE of where the temple was located in Jerusalem. That would place it just N of the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When David fled from Saul, he went to High Priest Ahimelech, who was at Nob, “the city of the priests,” and received from Ahimelech some showbread as food for his men, and Goliath’s sword, which was being kept there. Perhaps the tabernacle had been moved to Nob when Shiloh experienced God’s adverse judgment. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:3-9:14:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 14:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:60-19:78:60" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Psalm 78:60;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:12-24:7:14" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Jeremiah 7:12-14</a>.) Later, Saul accused Ahimelech of conspiracy, in that he gave assistance to David. At Saul’s command, Doeg the Edomite put to death the high priest and eighty-four other priests. Then Doeg slaughtered the men, women, children and animals of Nob. Only Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, escaped.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:21:1-9:21:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:1-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:22:6-9:22:23" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22:6-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Nob was one of the places mentioned in connection with the Assyrians’ move toward Jerusalem.

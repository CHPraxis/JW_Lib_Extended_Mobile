SACRED PRONOUNCEMENTS
This expression occurs only four times in the Christian Greek Scriptures, and translates the Greek word loʹgi·on (meaning “little word”), a diminutive of loʹgos (“word”). Originally loʹgi·on meant only a brief sacred utterance, but in time came to signify any divine communication or oracle. Certain English versions render loʹgi·on simply as ‘oracle.’ (AS, AV, RS) Wuest’s translation uses “divine utterances” at Acts 7:38 and Romans 3:2.
Stephen spoke of the Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai as “living sacred pronouncements.” (Acts 7:38) The apostle Paul referred to the entire Hebrew Scriptures and evidently also to all the inspired Christian Scriptures written up to that time, saying: “What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the benefit of the circumcision? A great deal in every way. First of all, because they were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.” (Rom. 3:1, 2) Therefore, the writing of this body of inspired Scriptures was committed to Jews, writing “as they were borne along by holy spirit.”—2 Pet. 1:20, 21.
In the letter to the Hebrews the writer includes as “sacred pronouncements” the teachings delivered to mankind by the Lord Jesus Christ, his apostles and other inspired Christian writers. (Heb. 5:12; compare Hebrews 6:1, 2.) Peter also reflects this broad scope in speaking to the followers of Christ, at 1 Peter 4:11: “If anyone speaks, let him speak as it were the sacred pronouncements of God.” He also classifies writings of the apostle Paul as of equal authority with “the rest of the Scriptures.”—2 Pet. 3:15, 16.
The Septuagint Version frequently uses the word loʹgi·on, as in translating Psalm 12:6 (11:6, LXX): “The sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings.” Bagster’s English translation of the Septuagint reads, at this verse: “The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles.”

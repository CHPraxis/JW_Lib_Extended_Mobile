ZAPHENATH-PANEAH
(Zaphʹe·nath-pa·neʹah).
The name that Pharaoh gave to Joseph when elevating him in authority to a position next to himself. (Gen. 41:45) To those who spoke Hebrew, the pronunciation of the name would mean “revealer of hidden things,” but to the Egyptians it perhaps meant “this living one is the sustenance of the land.”

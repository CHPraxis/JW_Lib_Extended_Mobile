ASHPENAZ
(Ashʹpe·naz).
The chief court official, or, more literally, the master of the eunuchs, in Babylon during Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. (Dan. 1:3) The title in time came to designate a high official in the royal court who doubtless headed the corps of eunuchs but who himself may not have been a eunuch. Such official had as one of his duties the training of youths to serve as pages of the monarch.

JEGAR-SAHADUTHA
(Jeʹgar-sa·ha·duʹtha) [witness heap].
The Aramaic (Syrian) expression that Laban used to designate the heap of stones on which he and Jacob ate a covenant meal. This stone heap called Jegar-sahadutha was to serve as a “witness” that neither of them would pass it to harm the other. Jacob called it by the Hebrew equivalent “Galeed.”—Gen. 31:25, 46-53; see GALEED.

BETH-DIBLATHAIM
(Beth-dib·la·thaʹim) [house of fig cakes].
A city in Moab (Jer. 48:22) the location of which is unknown. However, it may be the place called Almon-diblathaim mentioned at Numbers 33:46. This has been identified with Deleilat el-Gharbiyeh, some fourteen miles (22.5 kilometers) E of the Dead Sea. A city called Beth-diblathen is mentioned in the inscription of the Moabite Stone as having been built by Mesha king of Moab.—See ALMON-DIBLATHAIM.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An Arabian, who, along with Sanballat and Tobiah, opposed Nehemiah in the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s wall. These enemies first derided Nehemiah and his co-workers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:19-16:2:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Neh. 2:19</a>) Then they conspired and plotted against Nehemiah, to no avail. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:1-16:6:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Neh. 6:1-4</a>) Finally these opposers sent a letter to Nehemiah quoting Geshem’s accusation that Nehemiah and the Jews were scheming to rebel and that he was becoming a king to them. In this, too, these enemies failed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:6:5-16:6:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 6:5-7</a>) Their quoting of Geshem in the letter seems to indicate that he was a man of influence. It may be noted that relations between the Persian court and the Arab tribes were reportedly good following Persia’s invasion of Egypt.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A dialect form of Geshem, the name Jasm, is mentioned in an inscription found in ancient Dedan, in the northern part of Arabia. The name Geshem appears in an Aramaic inscription on a silver bowl found in Egypt. The text reads: “What Qaynu son of Geshem, king of Kedar, brought (as offering) to (the goddess) Han-ʼIlat.”</p>

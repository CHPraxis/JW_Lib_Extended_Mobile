MACHIR
(Maʹchir) [sold].
1. The first-named son of Manasseh by his Syrian concubine Machir founded the family of Machirites and is called “the father of Gilead.” His wife was Maacah, and he had sons within Joseph’s lifetime. (Gen. 50:23; Num. 26:29; Josh. 17:1; 1 Chron. 2:21, 23; 7:14-17) The “sons of Machir” captured the region of Gilead, drove out the Amorites, and were given that district as an inheritance. (Num. 32:39, 40; Deut. 3:15; Josh. 13:31) Zelophehad and his daughters were of the Manassite family of Machir. (Num. 27:1; 36:1, 2; Josh. 17:3) In the victory song of Deborah and Barak “Machir” seems to be used poetically for the entire tribe of Manasseh.—Judg. 5:1, 14.
2. Son of Ammiel (and resident of Lo-debar) with whom Jonathan’s son Mephibosheth resided until David sent for him and made provision for his care. (2 Sam. 9:4-7, 13) Later, during Absalom’s rebellion, Machir was among the persons who supplied King David and his associates with food and other provisions.—2 Sam. 17:27-29.

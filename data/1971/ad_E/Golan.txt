GOLAN
(Goʹlan).
A city of Bashan in the territory of Manasseh, selected as a city of refuge. (Deut. 4:41-43; Josh. 20:2, 8) The Gershonite Levites were given the city for their dwelling. (Josh. 21:27; 1 Chron. 6:71) Most geographers consider its probable modern location to be Jaulan, a little more than seventeen miles (27 kilometers) E of the Sea of Galilee. A district of the same name is somewhat closer to the Sea of Galilee.

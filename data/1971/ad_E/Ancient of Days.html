<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A translation of the Aramaic expression <em>ʽat·tiqʹ yoh·minʹ,</em> which literally means “one advanced or aged in days.” This title of Jehovah appears only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>, and 22, and alternates with the title “Supreme One” (verses 18, 22, 25, 27). The scene is a courtroom where the Ancient of Days <span id="page77" class="pageNum" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>sits to judge the world powers, described under the symbolism of huge beasts. Their lease of rulership over the earth is taken away and the “rulership and dignity and kingdom” are given to one “like a son of man” to whom all peoples are commanded to render obedience.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The title “Ancient of Days” appropriately contrasts the Everlasting God with the successive world powers that rise and fall, and portrays Jehovah in his role as the Majestic and Venerable Judge of all.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:2-19:90:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 90:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:75:7-19:75:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 75:7</a>.</p>

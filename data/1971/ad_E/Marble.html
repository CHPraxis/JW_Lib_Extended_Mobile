<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A crystalline limestone (calcium carbonate) of close grain that varies in color, texture and crystal structure, and which is capable of taking a high polish. Its color ranges from snow-white to numerous shades of gray, brown, yellow, red, green and black. Streaks or veins are due to impurities of metal oxides and carbonaceous matter.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is uncertain whether Solomon made use of marble in his building program. Josephus says “white stone” was used, but the Hebrew word usually translated “marble” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:2-13:29:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> probably denotes “alabaster” and is thus rendered in some translations. (<em>JB, NW</em>) This is in agreement with <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament</em> by Brown, Driver and Briggs, 1952, page 1010, and <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> by Koehler &amp; Baumgartner, 1953, page 966.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Marble apparently was not found in Palestine. Lebanon, however, produced a variety of marbles; but the choicest specimens were found in the Aegean island of Paros and in Arabia. The Shulammite maiden, in describing her beloved shepherd companion to the ladies-in-waiting at the court of King Solomon, <span id="page1111" class="pageNum" data-no="1111" data-before-text="1111"></span>said: “His legs are pillars of marble based on socket pedestals of refined gold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:5:15-22:5:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 5:15</a>) The Persian palace at Shushan in the days of Queen Esther had marble Pillars, and its pavement in part was made of black marble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:1:6-17:1:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 1:6</a>) Marble is also listed as one of the precious commodities of “the traveling merchants of the earth” who weep over the downfall of Babylon the Great.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:11-66:18:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 18:11, 12</a>.</p>

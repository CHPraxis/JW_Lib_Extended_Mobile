<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Daniel used this Aramaic word when interpreting the handwriting on the wall, “MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PARSIN.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:25-27:5:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 5:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:28-27:5:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Dr. Judah Slotki (<em>Soncino</em> commentary on Daniel) and <span id="page1286" class="pageNum" data-no="1286" data-before-text="1286"></span>Prof. J. Barr (<em>Peake’s Commentary on the Bible,</em> 1962) point out that the handwriting means “a mina, a shekel, and divisions of a shekel [or ‘and half shekels’].” Since “Peres” is the singular number of “Parsin,” it would mean “a half shekel.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the prophet’s interpretation of “Peres” he employed two other Aramaic words spelled with the same three consonants but vocalized differently. “PERES [<em>P<sup>e</sup>res</em>ʹ], your kingdom has been divided [<em>p<sup>e</sup>ri·sath</em>ʹ] and given to the Medes and Persians [<em>Pa·ras</em>ʹ].” Thus the inspired explanation included a double play on the word “Peres” and the root meaning “to divide.” The subsequent events of that night proved the accuracy of the interpretation.</p>

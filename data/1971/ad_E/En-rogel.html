<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(En-roʹgel) [fuller’s spring].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A spring or well near Jerusalem that marked the boundary between Judah and Benjamin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:15:7-6:15:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 15:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:18:16-6:18:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18:16</a>) David’s spies Jonathan and Ahimaaz waited at En-rogel for intelligence concerning Absalom’s rebellion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:17:17-10:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:17</a>) Near here David’s other rebellious son Adonijah later held a feast to enlist support for his usurpation of the throne.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:9-11:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">En-rogel is generally agreed to correspond with the modern Bir Ayyub, or Job’s well. It is located S of the SE corner of Jerusalem’s wall, at the foot of the eastern bank of the Kidron valley about 200 yards (183 meters) S of the junction with the Valley of Hinnom. The well is about 125 feet (38 meters) deep, the bottom half of which is in solid rock and the upper portion lined with stone. It reaches an underground stream or spring, which, after a rain, sometimes flows so abundantly as to raise the level of water to the surface.</p>

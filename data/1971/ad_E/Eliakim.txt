ELIAKIM
(E·liʹa·kim) [God raises up].
1. Son of Hilkiah; chief administrator of the affairs of the house of Hezekiah the king of Judah at the time the Assyrian king Sennacherib invaded Judah in 732 B.C.E.
While Shebna was still “over the house,” the prophet Isaiah foretold that he would be ripped from this position and replaced by Eliakim, whom Jehovah calls “my servant.” The transfer was to be made by clothing Eliakim with Shebna’s official robe and sash. Also, “the key of the house of David” was to be placed upon Eliakim’s shoulder, suggesting that he would be entrusted with the oversight of the king’s chambers and the authority to decide who might be accepted into the service of the king.—Isa. 22:15-24.
Acting in this official capacity, Eliakim, Shebna the secretary and Joah, apparently the recorder, came out to speak with Rabshakeh, who had come to Jerusalem with a heavy military force to demand the surrender of the city. Then, with garments ripped apart, the three of them reported the words of Sennacherib’s spokesmen to King Hezekiah, who, in turn, proceeded to send Eliakim, Shebna and the older men of the priests to Isaiah to make inquiry of Jehovah.—Isa. 36:11, 22; 37:1, 2; 2 Ki. 18:17, 18, 26, 36, 37; 19:1, 2.
2. King of Judah (628-618 B.C.E.) whom Pharaoh Nechoh placed upon the throne, changing his name to Jehoiakim. Eliakim was King Josiah’s son.—2 Ki. 23:34; see JEHOIAKIM.
3. One of the Levite priests with the trumpets who was in the procession arranged by Nehemiah at the inauguration of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem.—Neh. 12:31, 41.
4. An ancestor of Jesus’ foster father Joseph.—Matt. 1:13.
5. An ancestor of Jesus’ earthly mother Mary.—Luke 3:30.

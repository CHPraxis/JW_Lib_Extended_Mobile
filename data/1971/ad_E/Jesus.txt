JESUS
(Jeʹsus) [Latin form of the Greek I·e·sousʹ, which corresponds to the Hebrew Ye·shuʹaʽ or Yeho·hsuʹaʽ and means Salvation (or, Help) of Jehovah].
Jewish historian Josephus of the first century C.E. mentions some twelve persons, other than those in the Bible record, bearing that name. It also appears in the Apocryphal writings of the last centuries of the B.C.E. period. It therefore appears to have been a not uncommon name during that period.
1. The name I·e·sousʹ appears in the Greek text of Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8 and applies to Joshua, the leader of Israel following Moses, death.—See JOSHUA No. 1.
2. An ancestor of Jesus Christ, evidently in his mother’s line. (Luke 3:29) Some ancient manuscripts here read “Jose (s).”—See GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST.
3. A Christian, evidently Jewish, and fellow worker of Paul. He was also called Justus.—Col. 4:11.
4. See JESUS CHRIST.

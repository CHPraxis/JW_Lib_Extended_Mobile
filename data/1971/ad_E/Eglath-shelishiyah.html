<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah) [third Eglath, or, third young cow (heifer)].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A term used by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:15:5-23:15:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah (15:5</a>) and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:48:34-24:48:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah (48:34</a>) in their pronouncements of doom against Moab, apparently referring to a site in that nation. Some hold that there were three towns in one vicinity with the same name, and that the third (the “third Eglath,” <em>AT</em>), is here the target of the prophets’ utterances. A precise identification of such sites has never been made.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many scholars, however, are of the opinion that the Hebrew (ʽ<em>egh·lathʹ sh<sup>e</sup>li·shi·yah</em>ʹ) should not be transliterated as a proper noun. They view it as a symbolic expression and would translate it as “a heifer of three years old.” (<em>Dy, JP;</em> see <em>AV, Ro</em>.) In this case, the prophets might be likening vanquished Moab to a sturdy, young, though full-grown cow, but from which are heard only pitiful ‘cries’ of anguish.</p>

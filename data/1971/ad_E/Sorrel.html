<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Any of a number of plants having a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in their juicy leaves and stems. The radical leaves of common sorrel grow in a cluster. Shaped like an arrow at the base, the somewhat oval leaves measure about four inches (10 centimeters) in length. The flower stalks may attain a height of about two feet (.6 meter) or more. Anciently, the Israelites mixed sorrel with the fodder for their cattle and asses.â€”<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:24-23:30:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 30:24</a>.</p>

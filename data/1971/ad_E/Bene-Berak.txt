BENE-BERAK
(Benʹe-beʹrak) [sons of lightning].
A city of Dan, presently identified with Ibn Ibraq, now a suburb in the NE of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (Joppa). (Josh. 19:45) The Arabic name Ibn Ibraq corresponds to the Hebrew Bene-berak. In the Taylor Prism of Sennacherib that emperor’s account of the Assyrian campaign against Hezekiah states that he “sacked Beth-dagon, Joppa, Banai-barqa [Bene-berak], Azuru. . . .”

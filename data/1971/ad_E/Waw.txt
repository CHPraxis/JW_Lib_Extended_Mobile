WAW
[ו].
The sixth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and also later used, outside the Hebrew Scriptures, to denote the number six. The name of the letter means “hook” or “peg.”
In pronunciation this letter corresponds generally to the English “w,” as in “wine”; at times, however, in modern Hebrew it is given the sound of English “v.” In this work it is transliterated as “w” (ו), “u” (וּ) and “oh” (וֹ). It is rarely used as an initial letter, usually being substituted for by the letter yohdh (י). In the Hebrew, it appears at the beginning of each of the eight verses of Psalm 119:41-48.

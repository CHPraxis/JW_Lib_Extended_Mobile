JECONIAH
(Jec·o·niʹah) [Jehovah firmly establishes].
King of Judah for only three months and ten days before being taken captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar in 617 B.C.E.; son of Jehoiakim and grandson of good King Josiah. (1 Chron. 3:15-17; Esther 2:6; Jer. 24:1) His name is occasionally contracted to Coniah. (Jer. 22:24; 37:1) In certain translations it is sometimes spelled Jechoniah (Matt. 1:11, 12, JB; Mo; NW, 1950 ed.; RS), but most often it occurs as Jehoiachin.—2 Ki. 24:6, 8-15; see JEHOIACHIN.

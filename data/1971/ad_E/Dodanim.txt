DODANIM
(Doʹda·nim).
At Genesis 10:4 this name appears as the fourth-listed son of Javan. The Septuagint Version and the Samaritan Pentateuch here read “Rodanim.” “Rodanim” is also found in the Hebrew Masoretic text at 1 Chronicles 1:7, although a number of Hebrew manuscripts, and also the Latin Vulgate, there read “Dodanim.”—See RODANIM.

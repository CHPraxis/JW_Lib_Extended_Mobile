LASHA
(Laʹsha).
A place mentioned in the earliest Canaanite boundary description. (Gen. 10:19) Its exact location is uncertain. Lasha was either “near Zeboiim” (NW; JP [1962 ed.]) or else the Canaanite boundary extended from the area around Zeboiim “as far as” Lasha. (AT; JB; RS) On the basis of Jerome’s identification and Jewish tradition, many place Lasha at Callirhoe, near the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. Others link Lasha with Laish (Dan), some twelve miles (19 kilometers) N of the Huleh Basin.

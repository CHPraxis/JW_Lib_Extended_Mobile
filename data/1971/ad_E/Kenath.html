<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Keʹnath) [possibly, possession].</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A site E of the Jordan captured by Nobah, probably a Manassite, who thereafter called it by his own name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:32:42-4:32:42" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 32:42</a>) But the designation “Nobah” perhaps did not stick, for later “Kenath” is reported to have been taken by Geshur and Syria. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:2:23-13:2:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 2:23</a>) Most geographers today link Kenath with the ruins at Qanawat (or Canatha, about fifty miles [80 kilometers] SE of Damascus), one of the original ten cities of the Decapolis.</p>

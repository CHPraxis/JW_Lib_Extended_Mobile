From its position on the hills a view can be had of the Jordan valley and the northern part of the Salt Sea. Anathoth was the home of two of David’s mighty men.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jeremiah was from Anathoth, but became a ‘prophet without honor’ among his own people, as they threatened his life for speaking Jehovah’s message of truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:1:1-24:1:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:21-24:11:23" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:27-24:29:27" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 29:27</a>) As a result, Jehovah foretold calamity for the city, and this came in due course of time when Babylon overran the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:11:21-24:11:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 11:21-23</a>) Prior to Jerusalem’s fall, Jeremiah exercised his legal rights to purchase his cousin’s tract of land at Anathoth as a sign that there would be a restoration from exile.

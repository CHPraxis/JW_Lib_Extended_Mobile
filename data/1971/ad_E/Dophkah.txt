DOPHKAH
(Doph πkah).
The first stopping place for the Israelites after leaving the wilderness of Sin on their way to the Promised Land. (Num. 33:12, 13) The Bible does not indicate its exact geographical location. However, many scholars associate Dophkah with the Egyptian mafkat, a district named for the turquoise mined since ancient times around Serabit el-Khadim, about twenty miles (32.2 kilometers) E of modern-day Abu Zenima on the Sinai Peninsula.

NUN, II
[נ; final, ן].
The fourteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, also later when used outside the Hebrew Scriptures, as a number to denote fifty. It is one of the five Hebrew letters that have a different form when used as the final letter of a word. The name assigned to the letter means “fish.”
Nun corresponds to the English “n.” In the Hebrew, it is the initial letter in each of the eight verses in Psalm 119:105-112.—See ALPHABET.

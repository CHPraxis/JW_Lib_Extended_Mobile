MANDRAKE
A perennial herb of the potato family, with large, dark-green leaves that measure about a foot (.3 meter) in length and four inches (10 centimeters) in width. The leaves appear to grow directly from the taproot, fan out in a circle and lie close to the ground. From the center of this circle the flower stalks grow, each bearing only one white, bluish or purple flower. The fruit, about the size of a plum and ranging in color from orange to red, ripens about the time of the Palestinian wheat harvest. (Gen. 30:14) It has been described as smelling sweet and fresh like an apple. (See Song of Solomon 7:13.) The thick, frequently forked, taproot of the mandrake bears some resemblance to a man’s lower limbs. This has given rise to numerous superstitious beliefs and the ascribing of magical powers to the plant.
In ancient times the fruit of the mandrake was used in medicine as a narcotic and antispasmodic. Also, it was, and still is in some parts of the East, considered an aphrodisiac and able to increase human fertility or aid in conception. The Genesis record reports that Rachel agreed to exchange with her sister Leah an opportunity to have the marital due from her husband Jacob for some mandrakes. (Gen. 30:14, 15) While the Bible does not reveal her motive, possibly Rachel felt that these would help her conceive, thus ending the reproach of her barrenness. It was, however, not until some years after this incident that she actually became pregnant.—Gen. 30:22-24.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of this tree in Hebrew means “white” and the related Arabic word <em>lubna</em> is applied to the storax tree (<em>Styrax officinalis</em>). The storax grows as a tall shrub or small tree, seldom exceeding twenty feet (6 meters) in height. It is plentiful in Syria, where Jacob made use of its staffs (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:30:37-1:30:37" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 30:37</a>), and throughout Palestine, often growing on dry hillsides and rocky places, where its shade would be appreciated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:13-28:4:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hos. 4:13</a>) Its oval-shaped leaves, growing on long flexible twigs, are green on top but woolly white underneath. The showy flowers with their white petals and delightful fragrance are very similar to orange blossoms. When incisions are made in the branches and stem, a balsamic resin with vanillalike flavor is exuded, and this is used in perfumes. Some believe this gum provided the “stacte drops” (Heb., <em>na·taphʹ,</em> meaning “a drop” [compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:27-18:36:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 36:27</a>]), used in the sacred incense of the tabernacle.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:34-2:30:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 30:34</a>.</p>

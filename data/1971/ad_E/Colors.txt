COLORS
Bible words and expressions denoting color do not use the scores of precise terms found in modern color charts. Sometimes a root word is used for different shades of the same color family. This is not because Bible writers were insensible to color differences or were handicapped by a limited vocabulary. Rather, they had a remarkable ability to convey ideas of color simply by relying on the subject under consideration, or by comparing unfamiliar objects with well-known things. (Ex. 16:31; Rev. 1:14) The appearance of such common things as blood, snow, certain birds, fire, precious stones, and so forth, were used as color references. (2 Ki. 3:22; Ps. 51:7; Song of Sol. 5:11; Matt. 16:2, 3; Rev. 9:17) Colors may also be employed with figurative meaning, and definite ideas are sometimes associated with specific colors.
Black is mentioned in describing hair (Lev. 13:31; Matt. 5:36), horses (Zech. 6:2, 6), marble (Esther 1:6) and eye-shadow paint. (Jer. 4:30) At Revelation 6:5, 6, the black horse represents famine.
Blue describes dyed materials in various forms, such as thread, string, cloth and apparel. (Ex. 26:4, 31, 36; 39:22; Num. 4:7) A blue string was to be put above the fringed edges of every Israelite’s garment. (Num. 15:38, 39) Hyacinth blue is one of the beautiful colors decorating the breastplates of the heavenly armies.—Rev. 9:17.
Brown is found only in a description of sheep.—Gen. 30:32, 33, 35, 40.
Crimson was one of the colors of costly dyed material. (2 Chron. 2:7, 14; 3:14; Nah. 2:3) Sins are also likened to the deep color of crimson.—Isa. 1:18.
Fiery-colored symbolically describes the appearance of the great dragon, Satan the Devil. (Rev. 12:3) A horse of this color symbolizes warfare between nations, as depicted at Revelation 6:4.
Gold is not mentioned as a color, but always with reference to the metal itself.
Gray is usually employed with reference to the gray hair of aging persons. (Gen. 42:38; Lev. 19:32; Prov. 20:29) Costly wool was sometimes reddish gray.—Ezek. 27:18.
Green is frequently found in the Scriptures, but seldom refers strictly to color. Rather, it brings to mind the freshness and vigor of growing vegetation, or denotes a healthy and prosperous condition of things. (Gen. 1:30; 9:3; Ex. 10:15; 2 Ki. 19:26; Rev. 8:7) Yellowish green is used with reference to the color of such things as leprous spots in cloth and in stone-and-mortar houses, or to refined gold.—Lev. 13:49; 14:37; Ps. 68:13.
Purple and reddish purple are often referred to in the Scriptures, although there are no distinctions drawn between the many varieties of purple shades produced by the different dyes or dye methods used. (Ex. 25:4; Num. 4:13; Ezek. 27:7, 16; Dan. 5:7, 29; Mark 15:17, 20; Luke 16:19; Rev. 17:4) Because of its costliness this color was often associated with or symbolized riches, honor and royal majesty.
Red, fire-red and yellowish-red are terms used to describe various articles, as hair (Gen. 25:25), dyed ram skins (Ex. 25:5), animals (Num. 19:2; Judg. 5:10; Zech. 1:8), and clothing (Isa. 63:2), and as a weather indicator.—Matt. 16:2, 3.
Scarlet, a red of brilliant hue, is found in many references, most of which are to cord or thread, cloth and apparel; also to sin. (Gen. 38:28, 30; Num. 4:8; Josh. 2:18; Jer. 4:30; Matt. 27:28; Isa. 1:18) The “wild beast” described at Revelation, chapter 17, is scarlet-colored (vs. 3), distinguishing it from the “wild beast” of chapter 13. The harlot sitting on the scarlet beast is arrayed in purple and scarlet. (Rev. 17:3-5) The vision thus pictorially symbolizes the royal claims of the “beast” and the luxury and royalty enjoyed by the woman riding it.
Vermilion (Jer. 22:14; Ezek. 23:14) has reference to a reddish type of paint made from oxides of iron or lead. It seems to have been first introduced by the Phoenicians, who imported it from natural deposits found in North Africa. At a later time similar deposits in the Middle East were developed.
White is the color most often mentioned in the Scriptures. Besides its descriptive use, it also serves as a symbol of righteousness and spiritual cleanness. (Rev. 3:4; 7:9, 13, 14) The white horse, as portrayed at Revelation 6:2 and 19:11, symbolizes clean, righteous warfare under Jesus Christ’s direction.
White garments were worn by the poor and also by those of superior rank. Where their attire is mentioned, angels are usually depicted as being clothed in white. (Mark 16:5; John 20:12; Rev. 19:14) A few of the other things described as white are hair (Lev. 13:3; Matt. 5:36), flesh (Lev. 13:16), fields of grain ready for harvest (John 4:35), and God’s throne of righteous judgment. (Rev. 20:11) Jesus likened the scribes and Pharisees to whitewashed graves. (Matt. 23:27) He drew this illustration from the custom of whitewashing the graves in the vicinity of Jerusalem before the Passover to protect people coming to celebrate the Passover from becoming unclean by touching them. Degrees of whiteness are distinguished in the Bible, as, for example, reddish-white (Lev. 13:19, 24) and dull white.—Lev. 13:39.
Yellow and sulphur yellow are also mentioned.—Lev. 13:30, 32, 36; Rev. 9:17.
Mixed colors. Besides the more specific colors there are a number of expressions in the Bible that describe objects having rather indefinite colors or having a mixture of colors. For example: color-patched (Gen. 30:32, 33), glowing colors (Isa. 63:1), many-colored (Jer. 12:9), parti-colored (Zech. 6:3, 7), ruddy (1 Sam. 16:12; Song of Sol. 5:10), speckled (Zech. 6:3, 6), spotty (Gen. 31:10, 12), striped (Gen. 37:3; 2 Sam. 13:19), swarthy (Song of Sol. 1:6), two-colored (Ezek. 27:24), “of varied colors” (Ezek. 16:16), having “color variety” (Ezek. 17:3), and in “various colors.”—Ezek. 27:7, 16, 24.
CHRIST’S CLOAK
The color of the cloak with which Jesus Christ was clothed on the day of his execution has caused some persons to argue that a discrepancy exists in the Bible record with reference to this garment. Matthew said that the soldiers “draped him with a scarlet cloak” (27:28), while Mark and John say that it was purple. (Mark 15:17; John 19:2) However, rather than being a discrepancy, such a variation in describing the garment’s color merely gives evidence of the individuality of the Gospel writers and the fact that they were not in collusion. Matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him, that is, according to his evaluation of color, and he emphasized the garment’s red hue. John and Mark subdued the red tint, calling it purple. “Purple” can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red. So, Mark and John agree with Matthew that the garment was red to some extent. Of course, background and light reflection could have given it different casts. The Gospel writers merely recorded what seemed to be the strongest color to them or to those from whom they obtained their information. A body of water varies in color at different times, depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time. So, when such factors are considered, it is seen that the Gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak with which Christ was clothed by mocking Roman soldiers on the last day of his human life.—See DYES, DYEING.

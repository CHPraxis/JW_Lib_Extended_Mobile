TALMAI
(Talʹmai) [furrows, plowman].
1. Son of Anak, and brother to Ahiman and Sheshai, who dwelt in Hebron when the land was spied out by the Israelites in 1512 B.C.E. (Num. 13:22, 28, 33; see ANAKIM.) Upon entering the land forty-five years later, Caleb, one of the original twelve spies, drove Talmai and his brothers out of Hebron. (Josh. 14:10-15; 15:13, 14; Judg. 1:10) Some authorities think that the name Tanmahu, found in a hieroglyphic inscription depicting a tall, light-complexioned man, is the Egyptian equivalent for Talmai. This Canaanite name also occurs in the Ras Shamra Tablets of the period of the Judges.
2. A son of Ammihud; king of Geshur. (2 Sam. 13:37) Talmai’s daughter Maacah bore Absalom to David. (2 Sam. 3:3; 1 Chron. 3:2) After having Amnon killed for violating his sister Tamar, Absalom fled to his grandfather Talmai.—2 Sam. 13:28, 29, 37, 38.

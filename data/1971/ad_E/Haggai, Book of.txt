HAGGAI, BOOK OF
An inspired book of the Hebrew Scriptures listed among the so-called “Minor Prophets.” It consists of four messages from Jehovah to Jews that had returned from Babylonian exile, urging them to finish rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem. Also being prophetic, the book foretold such things as the filling of Jehovah’s house with glory and the overthrow of human kingdoms.—Hag. 2:6, 7, 21, 22; compare Isaiah 2:2-4.
WRITERSHIP AND CANONICITY
Haggai the prophet was the writer, he first having personally delivered each message found in the book. (Hag. 1:1; 2:1, 10, 20; see HAGGAI.) While most of the ancient Scripture catalogues do not list the book of Haggai by name, it is evidently included in their references to the ‘twelve minor prophets,’ the number twelve thus being complete. The Jews have never questioned its right to a place among the Hebrew Scriptures, and the canonicity of the book is definitely established by the quotation from Haggai 2:6 appearing at Hebrews 12:26.—Compare Haggai 2:21.
STYLE
The language is simple and the meaning is made abundantly clear. Thought-provoking questions are sometimes posed. (Hag. 1:4, 9; 2:3, 12, 13, 19) The book of Haggai contains strong reproof, encouragement and hope-inspiring prophecy. The divine name, Jehovah, appears thirty-five times in its thirty-eight verses, and it is clearly shown that the messages were from God, Haggai serving as His commissioned messenger.—Hag. 1:13.
DATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES
The four messages recorded by Haggai were delivered at Jerusalem within about a four-month period in the second year of Persian King Darius Hystaspis (520/519 B.C.E.), the book apparently being completed in 520 B.C.E. (Hag. 1:1; 2:1, 10, 20) Zechariah was prophesying for the same purpose during Haggai’s prophetic activity.—Ezra 5:1, 2; 6:14.
MESSAGES OF LASTING BENEFIT
Among other things, the book of Haggai engenders faith in Jehovah, essential to God’s servants. It shows that God is with his people (Hag. 1:13; 2:4, 5), and also urges them to put his interests first in life. (Hag. 1:2-8; Matt. 6:33) The book makes clear the fact that mere formalistic worship does not please Jehovah (Hag. 2:10-17; compare Isaiah 29:13, 14; Matthew 15:7-9), but that faithful actions harmonizing with the divine will result in blessing. (Hag. 2:18, 19; compare Proverbs 10:22.) The writer of the Bible book of Hebrews applies Haggai 2:6 as having a greater fulfillment in connection with God’s kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ.—Heb. 12:26-29.

CLEMENT
(Clemʹent) [mild, merciful].
A faithful Christian who fought side by side with the apostle Paul, presumably at Philippi, for the sake of the “good news.” (Phil. 4:3) The name “Clement” was quite common and therefore provides no valid basis for connecting him with Clement of Rome, as is done by Origen.

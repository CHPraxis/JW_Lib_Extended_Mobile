<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Unforeseen occurrences resulting from ignorance, carelessness or unavoidable events causing loss or injury are commonly called accidents. Jacob feared that unforeseen circumstances might overtake his beloved son Benjamin if allowed to go to Egypt with his brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:4-1:42:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 42:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:42:38-1:42:38" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 38</a>) The Philistines returned the ark of Jehovah to prove whether the plague of piles they suffered really was from Jehovah, or just “an accident.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:6:9-9:6:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 6:9</a>) Solomon recognized that anyone may become a victim of unforeseen occurrences.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Scriptures draw a sharp distinction between committing sins in ignorance, and doing so willfully with full knowledge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:30-44:17:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 17:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:15-45:4:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rom. 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:13-45:5:13" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 5:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:18-49:4:18" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Eph. 4:18</a>) The Mosaic law made a difference between an accident that proved fatal and one that was not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:22-2:21:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 21:22-25</a>) It also distinguished between killing intentionally and unintentionally. For deliberate murder, capital punishment was mandatory; for those guilty of accidental homicide, cities of refuge were set up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:11-4:35:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 35:11-25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:35:31-4:35:31" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 31</a>; see CITIES OF REFUGE.) The law applied equally to native Israelite and alien resident, and instructions for the necessary sacrifices to atone for accidental or unintentional sins were provided.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:4:1-3:4:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 4:1-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:5:14-3:5:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 5:14-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:22-4:15:29" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Num. 15:22-29</a>.</p>

DRUSILLA
(Dru·silʹla).
The third and youngest daughter of Herod Agrippa I, born about 38 C.E.; sister of Agrippa II and Bernice. Her mother’s name was Cypros. (See HEROD.) Before she was six years old her marriage to prince Epiphanes of Commagene was arranged, but it never materialized due to refusal of the groom-to-be to embrace Judaism. A Syrian king, Azizus of Emesa, met the terms of circumcision, and Drusilla became his bride at the age of fourteen. Aggravated by his cruelty, and nettled by the envy of her less attractive sister Bernice, Drusilla was easily induced to divorce Azizus, contrary to Jewish law, and marry Governor Felix about 54 C.E. Perhaps she was present when prisoner Paul “talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come,” which proved to be most disquieting subjects for Governor Felix. After two years, when Felix turned the governorship over to Festus, he left Paul in chains “to gain favor with the Jews,” which some think was done to please his youthful wife “who was a Jewess.” (Acts 24:24-27) Drusilla’s son by Felix was another Agrippa, reportedly killed in the great eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E.

EZER
(Eʹzer) [help].
1. One of the Horite sheiks in the land of Seir. (Gen. 36:20, 21, 30) The Horites were later dispossessed and annihilated by the sons of Esau. (Deut. 2:22) The name Ezer in this case means “treasure,” due to a difference in the spelling in the original Hebrew. At 1 Chronicles 1:38 it has been misprinted “Ezar” in many modern editions of the Authorized Version, although it was correct in the edition of 1611 as well as other early editions.
2. Likely a son of Ephraim who was killed along with his brother Elead by the men of Gath “because they came down to take their livestock.”—1 Chron. 7:20, 21; see EPHRAIM No. 1.
3. The “father” of Hushah, which was perhaps a town of Judah, and a son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.—1 Chron. 4:1, 4.
4. The chief one of the eleven valiant Gadites who separated themselves to David in the wilderness while he was still under restriction because of Saul. Being the head, Ezer was evidently the greatest and therefore ‘equal to a thousand.’—1 Chron. 12:1, 8, 9, 14.
5. The son of Jeshua, a prince of Mizpah, who shared in repairing a section of the wall of Jerusalem under Nehemiah in 455 B.C.E.—Neh. 3:19.
6. One of the priests in the procession arranged by Nehemiah at the inauguration of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem in 455 B.C.E.—Neh. 12:31, 41, 42.

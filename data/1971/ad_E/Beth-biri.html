<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Beth-birʹi).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town in the Negeb region of Judah but assigned to the sons of Simeon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:24-13:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:31-13:4:31" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 31</a>) In the parallel list of towns at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:6-6:19:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 19:6</a> it appears as Beth-lebaoth, and some suggest that Beth-biri may be a postexilic name for the same place, used by Ezra as the writer of the Chronicles. Some evidence of the name may remain in that of Jebel el-Biri, about twenty-five miles (40 kilometers) SW of Beer-sheba.—See BETH-LEBAOTH.</p>

ARM
A limb of the human body, often used figuratively in the Bible to represent the ability to exert strength or power. The “arm” of Jehovah God is immeasurably powerful, able to do marvelous creative works. (Jer. 27:5; 32:17) By his “arm” Jehovah also rules (Isa. 40:10; Ezek. 20:33); saves those in distress (Ps. 44:3; Isa. 52:10); delivers his people (Ex. 6:6; Isa. 63:12; Acts 13:17); supports and cares for them (Deut. 33:27; Isa. 40:11; Hos. 11:3); judges (Isa. 51:5); and scatters his enemies. (Ps. 89:10; Luke 1:51) Breaking the arm represents shattering one’s might. (Job 38:15; Ps. 10:15; Jer. 48:25) Through Jesus Christ, clothed with authority and power, and acting as Judge and Executioner, Jehovah manifests His might, represented by His “arm.”—Isa. 53:1; John 12:37, 38.
The arm of flesh, representing human power, is described in the Bible as unreliable and failing the one trusting in it. Jehovah warns his people of the fallacy and disaster of trusting in the human arm. (2 Chron. 32:8; Jer. 17:5) He will break the arm of the wicked, which is described as resting oppressively on their victims.—Job 35:9; 38:15; Ps. 10:15.
In King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image, the breast and arms of silver represent Medo-Persia, the kingdom succeeding Babylon, the head of gold, as world power.—Dan. 2:32, 39.

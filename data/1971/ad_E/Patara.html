<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Patʹa·ra).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Lycian seaport where the apostle Paul and his associates, likely in 56 C.E., transferred to a boat sailing for Phoenicia. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:1-44:21:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 21:1, 2</a>) Patara is today represented by ancient ruins at the village of Gelemish on the mountainous SW coast of Asia Minor and lies several miles E of the mouth of the Xanthos (Koca) River. It served as a port of call for ships from Italy, Egypt, Syria and other places, and was the primary harbor for cities along the Xanthos river valley.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:1-44:21:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 21:1</a> certain ancient manuscripts add “and Myra” after Patara. If this addition is correct, then the ship on which Paul sailed from Miletus either passed Patara or put into port there, with the actual transfer to another boat taking place at Myra, not Patara.</p>

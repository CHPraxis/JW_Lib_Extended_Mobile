<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Shamʹgar).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A deliverer of Israel between the judgeships of Ehud and Barak. Only one heroic deed of Shamgar is recorded, the slaying of six hundred Philistines with a cattle goad, but he is accredited thereby with ‘saving Israel.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:3:31-7:3:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judg. 3:31</a>) According to Josephus, Shamgar died in his first year of judgeship. (<em>Antiquites of the Jews,</em> Book V, chap. IV, par. 3) His being a “son of Anath” may refer to the Naphtalite city of Beth-anath.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:33-7:1:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 1:33</a>.</p>

MERARI
(Me·rarʹi) [bitter, unhappy].
Son of Levi and brother of Gershon (Gershom) and Kohath. (Gen. 46:11; 1 Chron. 6:1, 16) Since Merari is mentioned in third place among Levi’s sons, he may have been the youngest. He was one of the seventy members of Jacob’s household “who came into Egypt.” (Gen. 46:8, 11, 26, 27) Merari had two sons, Mahli and Mushi (Ex. 6:19; 1 Chron. 6:19), and was the founder of the Merarites, one of the three main Levite families.—Num. 26:57.

SEPHARAD
(Se·pharʹad).
A site from which Jerusalem’s exiles were due to return. (Obad. 20) Its exact location is unknown, but of several suggestions a likely possibility is Saparda, mentioned in certain Assyrian annals as a district of Media. The Assyrians once exiled people of Israel’s northern kingdom to “cities of the Medes.”—2 Ki. 17:5, 6.

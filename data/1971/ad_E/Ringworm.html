<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A contagious skin disease characterized by ring-shaped patches. The word occurs in the <em>New World Translation</em> at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:20-3:21:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Leviticus 21:20 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:22-3:22:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22:22</a>, translating the Hebrew word <em>yal·leʹpheth.</em> Caused by fungi, ringworms are found on animals and man. In humans ringworm may attack not only the body’s hairy parts, especially the scalp of children and the beard of adults, but also the nonhairy sections of the body. The latter form develops as a round rose-colored spot usually having very small blisters around its edge. As the patch expands, the center clears up, giving the afflicted area its usual ringlike appearance.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Though <em>yal·leʹpheth</em> has been rendered by other skin disease terms, Jewish tradition connects it with “Egyptian herpes.” For <em>yal·leʹpheth</em> the <em>Septuagint</em> translators used <em>lei·khenʹ,</em> which can refer to ringworm or scurvy. Thus Hebrew scholar Ludwig Koehler (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> 1953, p. 383), suggests “ringworm, herpes.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A man of priestly descent who had ringworm was disqualified from presenting offerings to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:21:20-3:21:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 21:20, 21</a>) And animals afflicted with it were not to be offered in sacrifice to God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:22-3:22:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 22:22</a>.</p>

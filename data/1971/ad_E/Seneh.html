<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A “toothlike crag” facing Geba and lying to the S of another crag called by the name Bozez, both crags being situated between the towns of Michmash and Geba and figuring in the account of Jonathan’s attack on the Philistines. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:4-9:14:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 14:4, 5</a>) No positive location can now be assigned to these crags, but they are generally considered to have been in the vicinity of the Wadi Suweinit, which runs between Michmash and Geba.—See BOZEZ.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An adult male deer. The red deer, the fallow deer and the roe deer, still encountered in the northern part of the Middle East, are the varieties of deer thought to have formerly inhabited Palestine. Although none of these animals are now known to exist there, as late as 1890 the roe deer was not uncommon in southern Lebanon and Carmel. Being a chewer of the cud and a splitter of the hoof, the stag, according to the Law, was acceptable for food if, as in the case of other creatures, its blood was poured out upon the ground.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Other Scriptural references to the stag are illustrative. The Shulammite compared her shepherd lover to a young stag and made allusion to the swiftness of this animal.

When faced with the Babylonian siege, Zion’s princes were like stags too weak from lack of food to run.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:1:6-25:1:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lam. 1:6</a>.</p>

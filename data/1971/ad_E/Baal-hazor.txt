BAAL-HAZOR
(Baʹal-haʹzor) [lord of the enclosure, or, owner of a village].
A place near “Ephraim” (perhaps the city of Ephrain(m) mentioned at 2 Chronicles 13:19; compare John 11:54) that served as the site of Absalom’s sheepshearing festival in which he maneuvered the death of his brother Amnon. (2 Sam. 13:23, 28) It is identified with the 3,333-foot (1,016-meter) high mountain Jebel ʽAsur, about four and a half miles (7.2 kilometers) NE of Bethel. There may have been a village by the same name at the base of the mountain. From Baal-hazor Absalom fled to the small kingdom of Geshur, E of the Sea of Galilee.

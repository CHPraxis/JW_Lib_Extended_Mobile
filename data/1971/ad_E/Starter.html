The Tyrian tetradrachma, approximately the size of the United States half-dollar, bore the head of the god Melkarth on the obverse side, an eagle perched on a ship’s rudder on the reverse side, and an inscription reading “Tyre the Holy and Invincible.” A likeness of Emperor Augustus appeared on the tetradrachma of Antioch.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In quadrupeds the hamstrings are the back tendons above the hock of the hind legs. Hamstringing, the act of cutting these tendons, cripples the animal, rendering it unfit for work or warfare The arbitrariness of Jacob’s sons Simeon and Levi found expression in their hamstringing bulls, likely when executing vengeance on the Hivites of Shechem.

By not appropriating to themselves the horses of their enemies and then using them in warfare, the Israelites would be safeguarded from being ensnared into relying on horses instead of on Jehovah for protection.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:16-5:17:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:1-23:31:1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isaiah 31:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:31:3-23:31:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 3</a>.</p>

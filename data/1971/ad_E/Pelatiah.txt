PELATIAH
(Pel·a·tiʹah) [Jehovah has provided escape].
1. One of four Simeonite chieftains who led 500 men against Mount Seir and struck down the remnant of the Amalekites, likely during Hezekiah’s reign.—1 Chron. 4:41-43.
2. Son of Benaiah; a prince of Israel whom Ezekiel saw in vision. Pelatiah, along with Jaazaniah, was “scheming hurtfulness and advising bad counsel” against Jerusalem. Ezekiel was inspired to utter a prophecy against the people of Israel, after which Pelatiah died.—Ezek. 11:1-13.
3. A distant descendant of David and grandson of Zerubbabel. (1 Chron. 3:19-21) Possibly the same as No. 4 below.
4. A family head represented in the signatures to the covenant promising not to take foreign wives.—Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 14, 22; see No. 3 above.

SHELAH
(Sheʹlah).
1. [Heb., Sheʹlahh, missile]. Son of Arpachshad and grandson of Shem, who was born in 2333 B.C.E. and died in 1900 B.C.E., at the age of 433. Shelah and one of his sons, Eber, each founded one of the seventy post-Flood families; through Eber ran the genealogical line that led from Shem to Abraham and finally to Jesus.—Gen. 10:22, 24; 11:12-15; 1 Chron. 1:18, 24; Luke 3:35.
2. [Heb., She·lahʹ]. The third son of Judah by his Canaanite wife. (1 Chron. 2:3) Tamar should have been given in levirate marriage to Shelah, but was not. (Gen. 38:1-5, 11-14, 26) Shelah’s descendants, some of whom, with their places of settlement, are listed by name, formed the tribal family of Shelanites. Some of these returned from Babylonian exile.—Num. 26:20; 1 Chron. 4:21-23; 9:5; Neh. 11:5; see SHELANITES.

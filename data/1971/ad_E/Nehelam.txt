NEHELAM
(Ne·helʹam).
Perhaps the home of the false prophet Shemaiah. (Jer. 29:24, 31, 32) But a location by this name is unknown. Therefore some have suggested that “of Nehelam” may be a family designation. Others believe that Jeremiah’s use of Nehelam (Ne·hhela·miʹ) was perhaps a play on the Hebrew word hha·lamʹ meaning “to dream.”—Compare Jeremiah 23:25.

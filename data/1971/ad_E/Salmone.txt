SALMONE
(Sal·moʹne).
A promontory of Crete, generally identified with Cape Sidero at the eastern extremity of the island. Paul sailed past Salmone in 58 C.E. on his way to Rome for trial. However, strong winds apparently did not permit the vessel, en route from Cnidus, to sail N of Crete past the southern tip of Greece and on to Rome. Forced southward, the craft passed Salmone and thereafter had some protection from the wind while sailing along Crete’s southern shores.—Acts 27:7.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Ahaziah, king of Judah, was riding “on the way up to Gur, which is by Ibleam,” when he was struck down at Jehu’s orders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:27-12:9:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:27</a>) The location of Gur is now unknown.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The wounding of Ahaziah at Gur is not mentioned in the parallel account of his death at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:22:8-14:22:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 22:8, 9</a>, but it appears that the two accounts complement each other and must be combined to gain the full picture of the events.—See AHAZIAH No. 2.</p>

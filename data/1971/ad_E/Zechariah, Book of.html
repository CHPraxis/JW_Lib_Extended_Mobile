<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page1684" class="pageNum" data-no="1684" data-before-text="1684"></span><strong>ZECHARIAH, BOOK OF</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This book of the Hebrew Scriptures identifies its writer as “Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:1-38:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zech. 1:1</a>) It also provides a basis for establishing the time period covered and an approximate date for the composition. The last time indicator found in the book of Zechariah is the fourth day of Chislev in the fourth year of Darius’ reign (about November 29, 518 B.C.E.). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:1-38:7:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zech. 7:1</a>) Accordingly, this book could not have been committed to writing before the close of 518 B.C.E. Since it was in the “eighth month in the second year of Darius” (October/November 520 B.C.E.) that the “word of Jehovah occurred to Zechariah” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:1-38:1:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Zech. 1:1</a>), the book covers a period of at least two years.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From chapter nine onward the subject matter found in the book of Zechariah appears to differ considerably from the earlier section. No further reference is made to angels and visions nor to Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua. There is no mention of the temple rebuilding work, and not even the name of Zechariah appears. In view of this and the nature of the prophecies contained in the latter chapters of the book, a number of critics maintain that this section could not have been written by Zechariah. However, it should be noted that Zechariah, like other prophets, wrote according to divine inspiration and did not receive all revelations at the same time nor in the same manner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:20-61:1:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:20, 21</a>) Also, prophecies did not have to fit within a particular framework of existing circumstances and incorporate the name of the prophet or of some of his contemporaries for an entire book to be the work of the prophet. That <span id="page1685" class="pageNum" data-no="1685" data-before-text="1685"></span>the book of Zechariah forms one harmonious whole, rather than consisting of separate and unrelated parts recorded by different writers, is evident from the thoughts expressed therein. Throughout, the book highlights that Jerusalem would be restored and that Jehovah would come to the defense of the city.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:13-38:1:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zech. 1:13-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:4-38:2:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:14-38:8:23" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 8:14-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:11-38:9:17" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 9:11-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:12:2-38:12:6" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 12:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:3-38:14:21" data-bid="5-6" class="b"> 14:3-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">About February 15, 519 B.C.E., the prophet Zechariah heard the words: “The whole earth is sitting still and having no disturbance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:7-38:1:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Zech. 1:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:11-38:1:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11</a>) So it appears that by then King Darius had succeeded in subduing the rebellious elements throughout his realm, and peace had been restored. The situation at Jerusalem, however, made it appear that Jehovah had forsaken the city. Although the temple’s foundation was laid in 536 B.C.E., the rebuilding work made slow progress on account of enemy opposition and finally, about 522 B.C.E., came under an official ban. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:4-15:4:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 4:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:4:24-15:4:24" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 24</a>) Additionally, plagued by droughts and crop failures because of having neglected the temple rebuilding work, the repatriated Jews found themselves in very difficult circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:6-37:1:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hag. 1:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:1:10-37:1:11" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) They needed encouragement to continue the construction work despite mountainous obstacles.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s words, through Zechariah, must therefore have been a real source of comfort and inspiration to them. The visions seen by Zechariah clearly showed that it was the divine will for Jerusalem and its temple to be rebuilt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:16-38:1:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Zech. 1:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:1-38:2:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> chap. 2</a>) The power of the nations that had dispersed Judah would be shattered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:18-38:1:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Zech. 1:18-21</a>) High Priest Joshua would gain an acceptable appearance before Jehovah (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:3:3-38:3:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Zech. 3:3-7</a>) and Governor Zerubbabel would, with the help of God’s spirit, finish rebuilding the temple.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:6-38:4:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Zech. 4:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>AGREEMENT WITH OTHER BIBLE BOOKS</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The book of Zechariah is in complete harmony with the rest of the Scriptures in identifying Jehovah as the Protector of his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:2:5-38:2:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Zech. 2:5</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:27-5:33:27" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 33:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:11-19:46:11" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Psalm 46:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:125:2-19:125:2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 125:2</a>.) He rewards or punishes individuals or nations according to their dealings and returns to those who repentantly return to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:1:2-38:1:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Zech. 1:2-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:11-38:7:14" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 7:11-14</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:6-23:55:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:4-24:25:11" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 25:4-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:11-26:33:11" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 33:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:7-39:3:7" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Malachi 3:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:9</a>.) Of those who desire his favor, Jehovah requires that they speak truth and manifest obedience, justice, loving-kindness and mercy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:7-38:7:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Zech. 7:7-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:16-38:8:17" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 8:16, 17</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:24:17-5:24:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 24:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Psalm 15:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:82:3-19:82:4" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 82:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:19-20:12:19" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Proverbs 12:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:7:5-24:7:6" data-bid="18-5" class="b"> Jeremiah 7:5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="18-6" class="b"> Ephesians 4:25</a>.) He does not respond to calls for aid from those who do not obey him.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:7:13-38:7:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Zech. 7:13</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:15-23:1:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/25:3:42-25:3:44" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Lamentations 3:42-44</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Also, noteworthy similarities are readily apparent by comparing passages in Zechariah with other scriptures.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:3:2-38:3:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Zechariah 3:2</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jude 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:3-38:4:3" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Zechariah 4:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:11-38:4:14" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 11-14</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:4-66:11:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:4:10-38:4:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Zechariah 4:10</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:6-66:5:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 5:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:8-38:8:8" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Zechariah 8:8</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:5-38:14:5" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Zechariah 14:5</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:14-65:1:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jude 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:7-38:14:7" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Zechariah 14:7</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:25-66:21:25" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 21:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:14:8-38:14:8" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Zechariah 14:8</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:1" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 22:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The fulfillment of prophecies recorded in the book of Zechariah testifies to its authenticity. What is known about Alexander the Great’s campaign in Syria, Phoenicia and Philistia, including the conquest of Tyre and Gaza, fits the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:1-38:9:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:1-8</a> and, therefore, can be understood as a fulfillment of this prophecy. Numerous other prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah find their fulfillment in Christ Jesus—his entry into Jerusalem as king, “humble, and riding upon an ass” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:9-38:9:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Zech. 9:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:5-40:21:5" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Matt. 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:15-43:12:15" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> John 12:15</a>), his betrayal for “thirty silver pieces” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:13" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Zech. 11:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:15-40:26:15" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:9-40:27:9" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 27:9</a>), the subsequent scattering of his disciples (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:13:7-38:13:7" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Zech. 13:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:31-40:26:31" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:27-41:14:27" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Mark 14:27</a>), Jesus’ being pierced with a spear while on the stake (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:12:10-38:12:10" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Zech. 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:34-43:19:34" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> John 19:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:37-43:19:37" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 37</a>) and his role as king-priest.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:6:12-38:6:13" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Zech. 6:12, 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:20-58:6:20" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:1-58:8:1" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:21-58:10:21" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 10:21</a>.</p>

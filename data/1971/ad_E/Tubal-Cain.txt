TUBAL-CAIN
(Tuʹbal-Cain).
Son of Lamech by his second wife Zillah; therefore, a descendant of Cain and half brother of Jabal and Jubal. He had a sister named Naamah. (Gen. 4:17-22) Tubal-cain was “the forger of every sort of tool of copper and iron,” which can be taken to mean that he either invented, founded or was prominent in the occupation.

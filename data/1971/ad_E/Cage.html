<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An enclosure used for confining birds or other animals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:27-24:5:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 5:27</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:2-30:8:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Amos 8:2</a>, where the same Hebrew word, <em>K<sup>e</sup>luv</em>ʹ<em>,</em> is rendered “basket.”) The prophet Ezekiel evidently alluded to King Jehoiachin of Judah under the figure of a lion that was put in a cage (Heb., <em>su·ghar</em>ʹ) and brought to the king of Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:19:9-26:19:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 19:9</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:24:12-12:24:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Kings 24:12-15</a>.) As illustrated on Assyrian bas-reliefs, lions were caged and then released for the hunt. The wooden cages had stout, wide horizontal bars and were topped by a smaller barred cabin, in which stood the man that raised the door to release the lion.</p>

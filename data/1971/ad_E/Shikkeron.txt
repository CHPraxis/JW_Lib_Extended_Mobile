SHIKKERON
(Shikʹke·ron) [drunkenness].
A site on the boundary of Judah. (Josh. 15:1, 11) Shikkeron’s modern location is uncertain. However, some tentatively identify it with Tell el-Ful, some three miles (5 kilometers) NW of the suggested site of Ekron (Khirbet el-Muqanna), with which it is mentioned in the Joshua account.

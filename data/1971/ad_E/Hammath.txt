HAMMATH
(Hamʹmath) [hot spring].
1. The “father” of the house of Rechab and an ancestor of certain Kenites.—1 Chron. 2:55.
2. A fortified city of Naphtali. (Josh. 19:32, 35) It is generally identified with Hammam Tabariyeh, about a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) S of Tiberias on the W side of the Sea of Galilee. The sulphurous spring there apparently gave Hammath its name (meaning “hot spring”). If, as most scholars believe, Hammoth-dor (Josh. 21:32) and Hammon (1 Chron. 6:76) are alternate names for the same location, Hammath also functioned as a Levite city.

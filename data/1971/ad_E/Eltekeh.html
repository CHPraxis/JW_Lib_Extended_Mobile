<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A city of Dan (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:44-6:19:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 19:44</a>) given, with its pasture ground, to the Kohathite, Levites.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Most authorities formerly placed Eltekeh at Khirbet el-Muqanna, about twenty-five miles (40.2 kilometers) W of Jerusalem. However, as a result of recent excavations, that site has since been connected with <span id="page515" class="pageNum" data-no="515" data-before-text="515"></span>Biblical Ekron. Thus, while no certain identification is now possible, some tentatively locate Eltekeh at el-Mughar, a few miles NW of the above suggested site of Ekron.</p>

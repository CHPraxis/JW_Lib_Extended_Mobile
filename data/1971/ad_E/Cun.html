<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the cities of King Hadadezer of Zobah from which David took large amounts of copper, later used in the temple construction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:18:8-13:18:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 18:8</a>) In the parallel account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:8:8-10:8:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:8</a> the name Berothai appears in its place and may refer to the same place. Others suggest that modern Kuna, some distance N of Bereitan, the suggested location of Berothai, is possibly to be identified with the Biblical Cun.—See BEROTHAH, BEROTHAI.</p>

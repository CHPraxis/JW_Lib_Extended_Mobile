<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Any of a great variety of two-winged insects having a round head and long, slender five-jointed legs. Female mosquitoes are equipped with a strong proboscis that enables them to pierce the skin of man and animals, and to suck their blood. The Hebrew word <em>qeʹrets,</em> rendered “mosquito” (<em>NW</em>), appears as a noun only at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:20-24:46:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 46:20</a>, where it is used to represent the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar, the enemy to the north that would come against Egypt, the “pretty heifer.”</p>

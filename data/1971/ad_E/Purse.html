<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A bag or pouch used by both men and women to carry gold, silver, copper, coined money or other items. Women sometimes had ornamental purses or handbags, possibly of a long, round shape. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:3:16-23:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:3:22-23:3:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:6-23:46:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 46:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:9-40:10:9" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Matt. 10:9</a>) Early purses were made of leather or of woven rushes or cotton. Since they were in the form of bags, they were drawn together and secured at the neck by means of leather straps or other cords.—See BAG.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Also in use was the “girdle purse” (literally, Gr., <em>zoʹne,</em> ‘girdle’ [<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:9-40:10:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 10:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:8-41:6:8" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mark 6:8</a>]), perhaps a type of money belt. The girdle either had a hollow space in which money could be carried, or, if made of cloth and worn in folds, the money was kept in its folds.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jesus, when sending out his seventy disciples in preaching work, told them not to provide themselves with purses, indicating that they should trust in Jehovah God’s provision for them and implying that interested persons would respond with some material aid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:1-42:10:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:4-42:10:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:7-42:10:7" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 7</a>) Shortly before his death, however, Jesus advised the apostles to carry purses, for he knew that his disciples would soon be scattered and persecuted. Even persons favoring their message might be afraid to assist them, requiring that Jesus’ followers be prepared to care for themselves materially.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:35-42:22:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 22:35, 36</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Highlighting the excelling value of spiritual things, Jesus urged his followers to make lasting purses for themselves, acquiring heavenly treasure.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:33-42:12:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 12:33</a>.</p>

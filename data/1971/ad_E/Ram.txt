RAM
[high].
1. A descendant of Judah through Perez and Hezron who lived while Israel was in Egypt. Though Ram was apparently not the first son of Hezron, Ram’s genealogy, leading to the Davidic line, is listed first among the three sons of Hezron. (1 Chron. 2:4, 5, 9-17, 25) Having Nahshon, Boaz and David among his descendants, Ram was an ancestor of Jesus. (Num. 1:7; Ruth 4:18-22; Matt. 1:3, 4) His name is spelled Arni (Aram in some manuscripts) in Luke’s ancestry of Jesus.—Luke 3:33.
2. The firstborn son of Jerahmeel and nephew of No. 1 above. He fathered three sons.—1 Chron. 2:9, 25, 27.
3. Founder of Elihu’s family.—Job 32:2.

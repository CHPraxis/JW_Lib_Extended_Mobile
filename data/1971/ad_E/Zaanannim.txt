ZAANANNIM
(Za·a·nanʹnim) [possibly, removals].
The “big tree in Zaanannim” was a point apparently at the S boundary of Naphtali’s tribal territory. (Josh. 19:32, 33) Sisera met death in the tent of Heber the Kenite, “near the big tree in Zaanannim, which is at [“by” (JP) or “near” (AT, RS)] Kedesh,” perhaps the Kedesh SE of Megiddo in Issachar. (Judg. 4:11, 17, 21; 5:19) However, Zaanannim’s actual site remains unidentified.

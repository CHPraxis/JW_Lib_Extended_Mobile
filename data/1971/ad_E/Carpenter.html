<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The carpenter in Israel would be employed in building houses and buildings such as synagogues.

The things constructed by the carpenter in Bible times included furniture, such as tables, stools and benches. In the construction of the tabernacle and its furnishings, Bezalel and Oholiab were especially guided by Jehovah God.

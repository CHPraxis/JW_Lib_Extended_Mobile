BEROTHAH
(Be·roʹthah) [wells]; BEROTHAI (Beroʹthai) [my wells].
In Ezekiel’s vision concerning the territorial inheritance of Israel Berothah is listed as on the northern boundary in the area between Hamath and Damascus. (Ezek. 47:16) It appears to be the same as Berothai of 2 Samuel 8:8, a city belonging to Hadadezer king of Zobah, from which David carried away “copper in very great quantity.” In the parallel record at 1 Chronicles 18:8 the name Cun appears in its place. Berothah (or Berothai) is generally identified with modern Bereitan, about seven miles (11 kilometers) S of Baalbek in the valley known as the Beqa, lying between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains.—See CUN.

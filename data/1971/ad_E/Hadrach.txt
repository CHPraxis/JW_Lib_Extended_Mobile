HADRACH
(Ha πdrach).
A land against which Jehovah expressed a pronouncement through his prophet Zechariah (9:1). A consideration of the pronouncement suggests that it is directed against Damascus, Hamath, Tyre, Sidon and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod. (Zech. 9:1-8) Hence, although various identifications have been suggested and many would link Hadrach with the Hatarikka mentioned in Assyrian texts, it may well be a symbolic name designating the territory in which these many cities were located.

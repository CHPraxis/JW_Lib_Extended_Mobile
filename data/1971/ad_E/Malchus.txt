MALCHUS
(Malʹchus) [Gr., Malʹkhos, from Heb., meʹlekh, king, or mal·lukhʹ, counselor].
The high priest’s slave who accompanied Judas Iscariot and the crowd to Gethsemane, where Christ was arrested. Peter struck off Malchus’ right ear with a sword (John 18:10; Matt. 26:51; Mark 14:47), but Jesus miraculously healed it. (Luke 22:50, 51) Another slave of the high priest Caiaphas, a relative of Malchus, later recognized Peter, and this led to the apostle’s third denial of Christ.—John 18:26, 27.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Reʹphan).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An astral deity mentioned by Stephen in his defense before the Sanhedrin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:43-44:7:43" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 7:43</a>) Stephen likely quoted from the <em>Septuagint Version</em> the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:26-30:5:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Amos 5:26, 27</a>, to show that Israel’s captivity resulted from their idolatry with foreign deities, such as Rephan (Kaiwan). The translators of the <em>Septuagint</em> rendered “Kaiwan” as <em>Hrai·phanʹ,</em> but in Stephen’s quotation the designation <em>Hrom·phaʹ</em> appears in the Westcott and Hort Greek text. <em>Hrai·phanʹ,</em> as well as its variant <em>Hrom·phaʹ,</em> is considered to be the Egyptian designation for Saturn.—See ASTROLOGERS; KAIWAN.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Under the Law, a wrongdoer deserving capital punishment usually was pelted to death with stones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:2-3:20:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 20:2</a>) This was to ‘clear out what was bad from their midst.’ All Israel would hear of the punishment, and fear of such wrongdoing would be instilled in their hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:5-5:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 13:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:13:10-5:13:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:22-5:22:23" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 22:22, 23</a>) In stoning an evildoer, they showed that they were zealous for true worship, anxious to see that no reproach came upon God’s name and desirous of maintaining a clean congregation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Before stoning, at least two witnesses had to give harmonious testimony against the wrongdoer, and thereafter they cast the first stones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:24:14-3:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:6-5:17:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Deut. 17:6, 7</a>) The prospect of being the executioner made a person think searchingly in giving evidence and doubtless was a deterrent against false testimony, which, if discovered, would cost the lying witness his own life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:19:18-5:19:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 19:18-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Stoning no doubt usually took place outside the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:15:34-4:15:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Num. 15:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:13-11:21:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 21:13</a>; contrast <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:21-5:22:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>.) Thereafter, as a warning, the corpse might be impaled on a stake, but not beyond sunset. It was buried that same day.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:21-5:21:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 21:21-23</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus spoke of Jerusalem as “the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:37-40:23:37" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 23:37</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:37-58:11:37" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:37</a>.) Christ himself was threatened with stoning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:59-43:8:59" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 8:59;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:31-43:10:39" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 10:31-39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:8-43:11:8" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 11:8</a>) Stephen was killed in this manner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:58-44:7:60" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 7:58-60</a>) At Lystra fanatical Jews “stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining he was dead.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 14:19</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:25-47:11:25" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>.</p>

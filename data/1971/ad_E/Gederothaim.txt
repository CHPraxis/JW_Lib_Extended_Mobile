GEDEROTHAIM
(Ged·eʹro·thaʹim) [two sheepfolds].
A name appearing among cities of Judah in the Shephelah. Its location is today unknown. (Josh. 15:20, 33, 36) Many scholars consider that Gederothaim is a scribal error for a similar Hebrew term meaning “and her sheepfolds,” that is, ‘the sheepfolds’ of the previously listed site, Gederah. This alteration would drop the total number of cities in the list from fifteen to the stated fourteen. (Vss. 33-36) Since such an expression would be unusual in such lists, others suggest that the text originally read “Gederah or Gederothaim” rather than “Gederah and Gederothaim.”

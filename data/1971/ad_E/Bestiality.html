<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Unnatural sexual intercourse of a man or a woman with an animal. The Mosaic law emphatically condemned this perverted practice, sentencing the guilty person and the beast to death. “Where a man gives his seminal emission to a beast, he should be put to death without fail, and they should kill the beast. And where a woman approaches any beast to have a connection with it, you must kill the woman and the beast.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:15-3:20:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 20:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:23-3:18:23" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:19-2:22:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ex. 22:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:27:21-5:27:21" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Deut. 27:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This prohibition, together with the rest of God’s laws governing sex relations, lifted the Israelites to a much higher moral level than their neighbors. In Egypt, bestiality constituted a part of idolatrous animal worship; historians attest to the cohabitation of women with goats, for example. Similar practices were also prevalent among the Canaanites (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:23-3:18:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 18:23-30</a>), and reportedly in Rome.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Despite its depravity, bestiality is not the same as adultery or fornication, and hence does not constitute Scriptural grounds for divorce. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 19:9</a>) However, anyone indulging in such filthy practice is morally unclean, and, if a member of the Christian congregation were to indulge in such a practice, that one would be subject to disfellowshiping.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 5:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Col. 3:5</a>.</p>

ABIMAEL
(A·bimʹa·el) [my father is God; God is father].
A descendant of Shem through Arpachshad. His father was Joktan, whose brother, Peleg, was an ancestor of Abraham. (Gen. 10:28; 1 Chron. 1:17-27) It is likely that Abimael and his twelve brothers were the sources from which thirteen different Arabian tribes developed, settling in the Arabian peninsula.

TABBATH
(Tabʹbath) [possibly, celebrated].
After being attacked by Gideon’s forces, the enemy Midianites fled “as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah by Tabbath.” (Judg. 7:12, 19-22) Tabbath is usually identified with Ras Abu Tabat, about three miles (c. 5 kilometers) E of the Jordan River and six miles (c. 10 kilometers) N of the suggested site of Succoth. Abel-meholah apparently was W of the Jordan and is spoken of as “by [opposite, JB] Tabbath.”—See ABEL-MEHOLAH.

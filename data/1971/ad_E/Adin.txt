ADIN
(Aʹdin) [pleasure-given, voluptuous].
One of the paternal heads of Israel, several hundred of whose descendants returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel. (Ezra 2:15; Neh. 7:20) Later, fifty-one more of his lineage returned with Ezra in 468 B.C.E. (Ezra 8:6) A princely representative of Adin’s paternal house was among those who attested to the “trustworthy arrangement” drawn up in the days of Nehemiah.—Neh. 9:38; 10:1, 16.

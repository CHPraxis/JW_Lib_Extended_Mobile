<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A structure designed principally for (1) smelting ores, (2) melting previously smelted metals for casting, or heating them for forging, and (3) firing pottery and other ceramic items. Furnaces in Bible times were constructed of brick or stone. Circular copper furnaces believed to date from the period of the judges were found at Tell Qasile on the northern outskirts of Tel Aviv and at Tell Jemmeh, S of Gaza. These furnaces were equipped with large mud-brick flues designed to lead air into the fire chamber. Clay crucibles containing copper were set on top of the stone tiles that were placed on the ashes of the fire inside the furnace.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The seventeenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, also later used outside of the Hebrew Scriptures as a number to denote eighty. It is one of five Hebrew letters that have a different form when used as the final letter of a word. The name assigned to the letter means “mouth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From the Hebrew <em>peʼ</em> comes the Greek <em>pi,</em> from which the Latin and English “p” is derived. The Hebrew sound corresponds to our English “p,” when it has the point (dagesh lene) in it; but without this point it is pronounced like “ph,” as in “philosophy.” This letter initiates each of the eight verses in the Hebrew text of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:129-19:119:136" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:129-136</a>.</p>

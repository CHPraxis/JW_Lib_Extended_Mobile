<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">(Helʹkath-haz·zuʹrim) [possibly, field of flints or, by a slight textual emendation, field of sides]. A field near the “pool of Gibeon.” Twenty-four young men, twelve representing the armies of Ish-bosheth and twelve from the servants of David, died there while ‘putting on a combat.’ The place was subsequently named from this incident.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:12-10:2:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 2:12-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A son of Shem, born two years after the global Flood (about 2368 B.C.E.) and died 438 years later. He was an ancestor of the Hebrews through his grandson Eber. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:22-1:10:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:24-1:10:24" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:10-1:11:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 11:10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:17-13:1:27" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:17-27</a>) He is shown to be the father of Shelah, although Luke’s account (3:35, 36), by the inclusion of Cainan, apparently would make him Shelah’s grandfather; but see CAINAN No. 2.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:24-1:10:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 10:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:12-1:11:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:24-13:1:24" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The meaning of the name Arpachshad has been the subject of much discussion, but it is generally conceded to have some relation to the early Chaldeans. <em>The Soncino Books of the Bible</em> (Chronicles) in commenting on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:18-13:1:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 1:18</a> states: “It may be noted that the Hebrew for <em>chshad</em> (the second half of the noun) represents the first part of <em>Casdim,</em> ‘the Chaldeans,’ and Arpachshad may be intended as the originator of that people who are not otherwise mentioned in the list.” Lexicographers Koehler and Baumgartner (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> p. 89) relate the name to the country referred to as “Arrapachitis” in the writings of Ptolemy, a land situated between Urmia and Lake Van, hence in the region of Armenia.</p>

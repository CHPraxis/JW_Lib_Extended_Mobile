MAACATHITE
(Ma·acʹa·thite).
Inhabitant of the Aramaean kingdom of Maacah (Deut. 3:14; Josh. 12:5; 13:13), one of these being Eshtemoa. (1 Chron. 4:19) It is suggested that Abel-beth-maacah (meaning “meadow of the house of Maacah”), a town in N Palestine, may have been so named because of its proximity to the region occupied by the Maacathites.—1 Ki. 15:20; see MAACAH No. 10.

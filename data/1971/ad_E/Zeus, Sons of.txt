ZEUS, SONS OF
[Gr., Di·oʹskou·roi, Sons of Zeus].
According to Greek and Roman mythology, Castor and Pollux were the twin sons of Leda and the offspring of the god Zeus (Jupiter), thus being called Dioscuri or “Sons of Zeus.” Among other things, they were regarded as protectors of mariners, able to save sailors imperiled at sea. The Alexandrian boat on which the prisoner Paul sailed from Malta to Puteoli when en route to Rome bore the figurehead “Sons of Zeus,” perhaps having the image or symbol and possibly the name of Castor on one side of the bow and those of Pollux on the other.—Acts 28:11; see CASTOR AND POLLUX.

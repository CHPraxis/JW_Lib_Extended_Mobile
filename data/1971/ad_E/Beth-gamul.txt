BETH-GAMUL
(Beth-gaʹmul) [house of recompense].
A city mentioned in connection with Jehovah’s pronouncements against Moab. It is listed together with Dibon and other cities of “the land of level country” of Moab. (Jer. 48:21, 23) It is generally identified with Khirbet el-Jemeil, on the tableland region of Moab about eight miles (13 kilometers) E of Dibon. This region just N of the river Arnon shows evidence of intense cultivation in ancient times.

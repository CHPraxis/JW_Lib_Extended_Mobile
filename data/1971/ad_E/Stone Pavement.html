<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A paved place at Jerusalem where Roman Governor Pontius Pilate sat on the judgment seat when Jesus Christ was before him for trial. The site was called, in Hebrew, <em>“Gabʹba·tha,”</em> a word of uncertain derivation and possibly meaning “hill,” “height” or “open space.” Another name for it, <em>Li·thoʹstro·ton</em> in Greek, may indicate a tessellated pavement, one of ornamental mosaic work. However, some suggest that “The Stone Pavement” was an elevated marble platform. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:13-43:19:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 19:13</a>) Suetonius, Roman historian and biographer of the second century C.E., says that Julius Caesar had pre-fitted pieces of marble carried along on military expeditions so that these might be laid down as a platform where he gave judicial decisions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, citing a certain disturbance, said that “Pilate sat upon his tribunal, in the open market-place.” (<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book II, chap. IX, par. 3) “The Stone Pavement” where Jesus appeared before Pilate may have been an open area in front of the palace of Herod the Great; many scholars favor identification with a site near or once occupied by the Castle of Antonia, NW of the temple grounds. But the exact site of The Stone Pavement remains unknown.—See ANTONIA, CASTLE OF.</p>

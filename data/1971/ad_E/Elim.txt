ELIM
(Eʹlim) [perhaps, place of big trees].
The second encampment location of the Israelites after crossing the Red Sea. (Ex. 15:27; 16:1; Num. 33:9, 10) Although its exact location is not certain, it is traditionally identified with Wadi Gharandel on the Sinai Peninsula, about fifty-two miles (83.7 kilometers) S-SE of Suez. Like the Biblical Elim, which had “twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees,” this modern site is well known as a watering place with vegetation and palms. A source of water at the site discharges about 1,260 gallons (4,769 liters) per minute.

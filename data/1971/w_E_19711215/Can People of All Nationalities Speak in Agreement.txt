Can People of All Nationalities Speak in Agreement?
It is being done now among Jehovah’s Witnesses. They live in more than 200 lands and are unitedly preaching the same message.
Read the fascinating report of their worldwide activities in the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It contains major stories featuring the modern-day development of their work in Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Taiwan and Zambia.
Benefit also from the Scripture text and comment provided for each day of 1972. Send only 50 cents. There is no calendar this year.
Please send me the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, for which I enclose 50c.

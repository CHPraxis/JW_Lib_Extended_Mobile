Wars Will Cease, Weapons Will Be Made into Farm Implements
Would you like to see these promises fulfilled? They are not empty promises by someone incapable of fulfilling them. They have been made by God and can be found in the Bible.
By reading the Bible regularly learn to appreciate these reliable promises that are soon to be realized. You will find it easy to read if you use the large-print edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. Its type and page size are the same as in the main part of this magazine, and it is in modern English. This splendid version of the Bible can be had for $5.
Please send me the large-print edition of the “New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,” for which I enclose $5. Send also the gift booklet “The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years.”

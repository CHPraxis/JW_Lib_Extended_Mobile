Insects​—Large and Small
The Atlas moth of India has a wingspread of ten to twelve inches. On the other hand, some insects are smaller than single-celled protozoa. One type of North American beetle could easily crawl through the eye of the smallest needle, for it is only about one hundredth of an inch long. Thus, scientists conclude that insects have a range in size that is probably greater than that of any other animal group.

Proclaiming Good News Worldwide
In more than 200 lands Jehovah’s witnesses have been proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom, which will bring peace and righteous rule to our earth.
Read the fascinating report on this work in the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. You will find something new this year​—major feature stories on the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Taiwan, and Zambia. These cover the thrilling history of the work of the Witnesses in these countries from its beginning.
For spiritual encouragement the 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses has a Scripture text for each day of the year with a brief comment. Reading this text is a fine way to begin a day.

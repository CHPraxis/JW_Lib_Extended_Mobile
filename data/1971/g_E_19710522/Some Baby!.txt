Some Baby!
● Human young are carried inside the mother nine months before birth and usually weigh less than ten pounds when born. However, elephant mothers carry their young from twenty to twenty-two months before giving birth, the record for any animal. And what a baby! A newborn elephant weighs about 200 pounds and is about three feet tall!

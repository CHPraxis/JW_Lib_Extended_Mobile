Are The Miracles of the Bible True?
Consider the reasons why you can believe they are. You will find them in the book:
Is the Bible really the Word of God?
This hard-covered book of 192 pages considers not only the truthfulness of Biblical miracles but also such things as the Bibleâ€™s agreement with ancient history, the consistency of its moral standards, supposed contradictions and other subjects over which the Bible has been criticized. You can get this faith-strengthening, pocket-size book for only 25c.
Please send me the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? for which I am enclosing 25c.

Listening to The Universe
Giant radio telescopes pick up radio signals from distant stars and help man to learn about the marvels of creation. Since man learns from the things God has created, is it unreasonable to expect instruction from God himself? Can we not expect the One whose wisdom is so manifest in the universe to give us information about himself and his purposes for the earth?
The Bible contains that information. There are many reasons for recognizing it as the inspired Word of God. Consider some of these convincing reasons by reading the book “Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” It will be sent to you for only 25 cents.
I am enclosing 25c for the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God?

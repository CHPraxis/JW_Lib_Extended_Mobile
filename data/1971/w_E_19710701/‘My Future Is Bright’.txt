‘My Future Is Bright’
● The London, England, branch office of the Watch Tower Society received a letter addressed “Dear fellow Christians.” It said: “I am writing this letter to your office to express my gratitude to your people who called on me at my home and brought the wonderful message about Jehovah’s kingdom. Though I have been associated with the Salvation Army for forty years, I have to admit that I was blind and ignorant about God and his true faith. But now, less than four months since I started to study the Bible with your publications, I have learned many truths about Jehovah God and his purposes. . . . I am 78 years of age, but the future for me is very bright. I am going every Saturday and Sunday in the preaching work and am looking forward to being baptized at the next assembly.”
Having a bright future depends upon one’s willingness to learn about and do God’s will.

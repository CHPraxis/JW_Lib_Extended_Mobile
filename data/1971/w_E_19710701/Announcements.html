<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Usually people think of heaven as a peaceful place. But did you know that there was a war in heaven? It is mentioned in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7</a>. Would you like to know when it occurred and how mankind has been affected by the results of it? Would you like to know what it indicates for our future? If you would, you will enjoy reading the book <em>“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God.” </em>This hard<em>-</em>covered book of 384 pages contains a detailed consideration of this heavenly war. It also discusses in detail the first thirteen chapters of the highly symbolic Bible book of Revelation. You may obtain a copy of this book from Jehovah’s witnesses when they call at your home. During the months of July and August they will be offering this book, along with a booklet on a Bible topic, to the people in your area for a contribution of only 50 cents. Or, if you prefer, you may send your order, with 50 cents, to the publishers of this magazine.</p>

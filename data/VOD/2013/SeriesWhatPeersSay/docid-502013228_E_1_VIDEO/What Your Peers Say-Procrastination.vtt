00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:05.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
I wait until the last minute

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:06.989 line:10% position:50% align:center
to do everything.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:08.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
I know what has to be done,

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.743 line:10% position:50% align:center
but I say, “Oh, oh,

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.162 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’ll just do it after I finish this,”

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:14.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “I’ll just do it after I finish
watching this program on TV.”

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:20.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes if I try
to start early on an assignment,

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:23.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t have the motivation to get it done.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think, mainly, the big one for me is TV.

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:27.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you watch it—

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:30.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be watching
a pointless reality TV thing,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it takes up so much of your time.

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:34.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then you think after it, you think,

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:36.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That wasn’t even very good.’

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people don’t like to rely on a person
who is a procrastinator

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they know that they are going to wait
until the last second to do something,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they may not even do it right.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
I find that procrastinating
does affect my stress levels.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve actually gotten a bit of eczema from it

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:55.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it brings it out in my skin
because I get so stressed.

00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:03.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past, I’ve worked on assignments

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve started early on them

00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:07.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve started late on other assignments.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
The assignments I’ve spent more time on

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:13.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
—taking the time to start on them early—
I’ve done so much better on them.

00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:16.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s definitely—
It’s much better to be organized, I think,

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:19.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in the long run,
you get so many more things done.

00:01:19.094 --> 00:01:22.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then at the end of the year
or the end of the week, or something,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can look back and think,
‘I’ve accomplished so much.’

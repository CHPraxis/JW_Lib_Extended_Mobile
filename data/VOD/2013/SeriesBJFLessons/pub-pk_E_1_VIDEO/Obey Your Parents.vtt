I just cleaned the house.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So remember, take your shoes off!

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Mom!

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re clear for landing!

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb!

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Mommy tell you to take off your shoes?

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mmmmmm.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom worked very hard to clean the house today.

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will she feel when she sees this?

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:31.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, Daddy.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know, I know.

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s clean this up together.

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was a lot of work, right?

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:48.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, if you had listened to Mommy,

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you wouldn’t have had to do all that work.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son, when we tell you to do something,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s because we love you.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:59.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want the best for you.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what we learned in family worship?

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is here in Ephesians.

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:07.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What chapter is that?

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Six?

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right!
Very good.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah wants you to do.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Children,”

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s you, Caleb,

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be obedient to your parents . . .

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it may go well with you.”

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:28.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why you should always listen
to Mommy and Daddy.

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dinner’s ready!
Come and eat!

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:37.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on, let’s go get some food!

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Dad!

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move it over here!

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK!

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beep, beep, beep.

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:49.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, stop!

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beep, beep, beep.

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:54.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, you almost hit me!

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry!

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Release the marbles!

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a mess!

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:08.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, it is time for family worship.

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:10.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get your book.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And pick up all these marbles.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone could get hurt.

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always listen to Mommy and Daddy.”

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:37.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you!

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:40.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so proud of you for obeying.

00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:42.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

what do you see in this picture?

00:05:47.618 --> 00:05:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh good, now everybody’s here!

What’s wrong, Caleb?

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:20.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t find my airplane.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, I can see why.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what will help you
to find your things?

00:00:26.187 --> 00:00:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping your room neat and clean.

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:33.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know Jehovah has
a place for all his things?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Huh?

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:37.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the planets, they’re always moving,

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah makes them stay in their orbits

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they don’t crash into each other.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the same with people.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all look different on the outside,

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:50.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inside Jehovah put all our

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bones and organs in the same place.

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:57.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine if your eyes
were on the bottom on your feet!

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah even keeps the animals clean.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at these fish.

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re cleaning the hippo.

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:10.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These birds help too.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I had some animals
to help me clean my room.

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:18.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do I, sometimes,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that is why Jehovah
gave you these to pick things up with.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you keep your room clean,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are making Jehovah happy.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who knows,

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once your room is clean,
maybe you’ll find your airplane.

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found my airplane!

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK!

00:01:56.312 --> 00:01:58.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go outside and play!

Heh, heh.
It looks like Caleb is getting hungry.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how Caleb asks his mom for food.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, I need food now!

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:41.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m hungry!

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:43.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb!

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmmmm, do you think
that was the best way to ask for food?

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noooooooo!

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:51.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give Caleb a second chance

00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:55.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to what special word he uses this time.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom, can you please make me something to eat?

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awwwh, yes, sweetie.

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:06.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m gonna make you the best sandwich ever.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s much better.

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That word “please” makes all the difference.

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:13.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Jehovah uses the word “please.”

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:17.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that you got what you asked for Caleb,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you say?

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Mommy.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good!

00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:26.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always remember to say “please” and “thank you”!

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:30.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget to thank Jehovah.

Giving makes you happy,
and that’s what Jesus taught;

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:19.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to give to others
whether they give back or not.

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to see how happy
it makes them when I do;

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:31.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see happy faces,
it makes me happy too.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like getting presents,
but just like Jesus said,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m happier, I know,
if I can give a gift instead.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:45.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I give a present
of something that I bought,

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or giving help to others—
it doesn’t take a lot.

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving makes me happy,
I know it’s really true.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:03.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A gift can be a small thing,
even things I say or do.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:07.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, giving makes me happy,
I know it’s really true,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
’Cause giving is a nice way of saying,
“I love you.”

00:00:11 Giving makes you happy, and that’s what Jesus taught;
00:00:15 I like to give to others whether they give back or not.
00:00:19 I like to see how happy it makes them when I do;
00:00:23 When I see happy faces, it makes me happy too.
00:00:32 I like getting presents, but just like Jesus said,
00:00:36 I’m happier, I know, if I can give a gift instead.
00:00:41 Sometimes I give a present of something that I bought,
00:00:45 Or giving help to others— it doesn’t take a lot.
00:00:54 Giving makes me happy, I know it’s really true.
00:00:58 A gift can be a small thing, even things I say or do.
00:01:03 Yes, giving makes me happy, I know it’s really true,
00:01:07 ’Cause giving is a nice way of saying, “I love you.”

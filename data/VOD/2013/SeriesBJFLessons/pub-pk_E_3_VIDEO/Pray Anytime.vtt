And Jehovah will hear what I say.

When each morning I wake,
I remember to take

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:27.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a moment
to thank him for this day.

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:36.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the wonders I find on the way,
In my mind, in my heart, I can pray.

Even when there’s a crowd
And I can’t pray out loud,

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:46.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still Jehovah
will hear me anyway.

And Jehovah will hear what I say.

In the night, he will hear;
When I call, he is near.

00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:06.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anytime, anywhere,
I can pray.

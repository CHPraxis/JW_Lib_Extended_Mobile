00:00:09 Anytime, anywhere, I can pray, And Jehovah will hear what I say.
00:00:18 When each morning I wake, I remember to take
00:00:23 Just a moment to thank him for this day.
00:00:27 For the wonders I find on the way, In my mind, in my heart, I can pray.
00:00:36 Even when there’s a crowd And I can’t pray out loud,
00:00:41 Still Jehovah will hear me anyway.
00:00:46 Anytime, anywhere, I can pray, And Jehovah will hear what I say.
00:00:55 In the night, he will hear; When I call, he is near.
00:01:00 Anytime, anywhere, I can pray.

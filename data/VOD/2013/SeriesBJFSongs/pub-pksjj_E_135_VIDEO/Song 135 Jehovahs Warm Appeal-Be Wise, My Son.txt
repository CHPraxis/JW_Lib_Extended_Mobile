00:00:07 Young man and young woman, do give your heart to me.
00:00:14 My foe who now taunts me will then be made to see.
00:00:21 Your youth and devotion to me you freely give;
00:00:28 You show all the world that for me you really live.
00:00:37 Beloved son and precious daughter,
00:00:44 Be wise and make my heart rejoice.
00:00:51 That out of your own heart you serve me,
00:00:57 And furnish praise by your own choice.
00:01:12 Rejoice and take pleasure in giving me your all,
00:01:20 And though you may stumble, I’ll raise you if you fall.
00:01:27 No matter who fails you or proves to be untrue,
00:01:34 Take comfort in knowing I’ll always cherish you.
00:01:42 Beloved son and precious daughter,
00:01:50 Be wise and make my heart rejoice.
00:01:57 That out of your own heart you serve me,
00:02:03 And furnish praise by your own choice.

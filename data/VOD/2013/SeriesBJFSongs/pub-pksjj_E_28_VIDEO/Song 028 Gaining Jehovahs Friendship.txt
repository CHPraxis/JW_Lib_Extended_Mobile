00:00:09 Who is your friend, O God? Who in your tent may dwell?
00:00:19 Who gains your friendship? Who gains your trust?
00:00:24 Who really knows you well? All who embrace your Word,
00:00:33 All who have faith in you, All who are loyal, all who are just,
00:00:43 Living the truth for you.
00:00:55 Who is your friend, O God? Who may approach your throne?
00:01:05 Who brings delight and Makes you rejoice? Whose name to you is known?
00:01:15 All who exalt your name, All who your Word obey,
00:01:24 All who are faithful, honest in heart, Truthful in all they say.
00:01:36 Rolling our cares on you, Baring our hearts in prayer,
00:01:46 Drawing us closer, bonding in love, Feeling your daily care,
00:01:56 We yearn to be your friend. Long may our friendship grow.
00:02:06 No greater Friend could we ever gain, No greater Friend we’ll know.
00:02:15 No greater Friend could we ever gain, No greater Friend we’ll know.

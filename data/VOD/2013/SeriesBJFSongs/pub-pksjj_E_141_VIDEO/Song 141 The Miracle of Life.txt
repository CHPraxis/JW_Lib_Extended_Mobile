00:00:07 Ev’ry newborn child, Ev’ry drop of rain,
00:00:14 Ev’ry golden ray of sun, Each head of grain—
00:00:21 All are gifts from God; They reveal his way.
00:00:28 Miracles performed by him sustain us each day.
00:00:35 So, what are we to do with a gift so rare
00:00:43 But to love the One who gave it and show him we care.
00:00:50 No matter what we do, We never can earn it.
00:00:57 This gift is still a gift— The miracle of life.
00:01:12 Others may give up, Lose their will to try,
00:01:19 Echoing the wife of Job: “Curse God and die.”
00:01:26 We are not that way; Praise to God we give,
00:01:33 Thanking him for ev’ry precious moment we live.
00:01:40 So, what are we to do with a gift so rare
00:01:47 But to love the ones around us and show them we care.
00:01:55 No matter what we do, We never can earn it.
00:02:02 This gift is still a gift— The miracle of life.
00:02:13 This gift is still a gift— The miracle of life.

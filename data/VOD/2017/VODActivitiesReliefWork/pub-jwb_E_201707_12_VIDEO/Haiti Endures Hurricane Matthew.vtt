00:35.138 --> 00:37.390
About every two or three minutes, 


00:37.390 --> 00:41.000
we prayed because the hurricane 
was so terrifying.


00:42.103 --> 00:46.233
Imagine that your house 
just lifted up into the air and flew away. 


00:46.233 --> 00:49.528
At that time, 
we were standing in water, 


00:49.528 --> 00:53.000
so we just ran.


00:55.533 --> 00:57.995
This is our Kingdom Hall. 


00:57.995 --> 01:00.372
When we saw that it was damaged, 


01:00.372 --> 01:03.000
we were deeply affected 
because we realized 


01:03.000 --> 01:06.795
we could not meet here anymore 
with our brothers and sisters 


01:06.795 --> 01:08.797
to sympathize with them. 


01:08.797 --> 01:12.000
That was very hard for us.


01:16.555 --> 01:20.392
Even in this situation, 
I know we’re not alone


01:20.392 --> 01:22.687
—even though our town was destroyed. 


01:22.687 --> 01:25.772
I know our brothers, 
no matter where they are, 


01:25.772 --> 01:28.000
will come to help us.


01:33.988 --> 01:35.991
The priority of disaster relief 


01:35.992 --> 01:38.619
is for the Branch Committee 
to quickly appoint 


01:38.618 --> 01:40.786
qualified local brothers to respond 


01:40.787 --> 01:43.832
to the first immediate needs 
of our brothers and sisters. 


01:43.832 --> 01:45.792
Of course, 


01:45.792 --> 01:49.000
giving support to our brothers and sisters 
oftentimes means funds. 


01:50.213 --> 01:54.258
So it’s the worldwide brotherhood, 
the “Matthew 24:14 contributions,” 


01:54.258 --> 01:58.305
that really does help.


01:58.305 --> 02:00.723
Here in Haiti, 
many brothers are overjoyed 


02:00.723 --> 02:04.185
that they can send something 
to help their brothers. 


02:04.185 --> 02:07.000
There are brothers 
who have even donated beyond their means.


02:13.820 --> 02:15.780
In our brotherhood, 


02:15.780 --> 02:18.283
no matter where a brother is, 


02:18.283 --> 02:21.786
if he’s suffering from a disaster 
or he has a problem, 


02:21.787 --> 02:23.789
all the brothers feel 


02:23.788 --> 02:25.915
as if they’re also facing that problem. 


02:25.915 --> 02:29.000
We all do our best to support and help them.


02:37.510 --> 02:40.722
We didn’t have any way 
to make a bed to lie down. 


02:40.722 --> 02:44.000
Eventually, our sisters 
in the Paillant Congregation helped us out. 


02:45.102 --> 02:47.104
They ran up 
and made beds for us out of plywood 


02:47.103 --> 02:49.146
that they would put on top of eight blocks. 


02:49.147 --> 02:52.192
And they brought sheets and pillows 
so that we could lie down. 


02:52.192 --> 02:54.362
That was very touching, 


02:54.362 --> 02:57.000
that kind deed our brothers did for us. 


02:58.282 --> 03:01.285
We truly felt that it was Jehovah 
who was coming


03:01.285 --> 03:05.000
to our aid at that moment.


03:07.082 --> 03:11.002
They brought boxes of Bibles, 
medical kits, food stuffs. 


03:11.002 --> 03:15.507
Besides that, they brought several tents. 


03:15.507 --> 03:18.969
That helped the brothers 
that lost all that they had, 


03:18.968 --> 03:20.970
even their houses, 


03:20.970 --> 03:24.000
so that they could have 
shelter from the rain.


03:29.353 --> 03:32.733
In one of the talks given 
by a Governing Body member, 


03:32.733 --> 03:35.568
he showed that we have 
more difficult situations ahead. 


03:35.568 --> 03:37.570
The only thing we can do 


03:37.570 --> 03:40.000
is continue to rely on Jehovah.


03:43.202 --> 03:45.912
A way we can help our brothers cope 
when they’re in such a circumstance 


03:45.912 --> 03:48.000
is to make them realize 
that it is the Kingdom hope


03:49.123 --> 03:53.878
—to refresh their memory, 
to make them really believe 


03:53.878 --> 03:57.000
and feel that it’s the Kingdom hope—
that’s going to change all of this.


03:59.342 --> 04:02.972
They shared encouraging words and read 
Bible verses that really helped us 


04:02.972 --> 04:05.390
to see the power of God’s Word. 


04:05.390 --> 04:08.352
That boosted our faith in the promises 


04:08.352 --> 04:13.000
Jehovah made to remove all causes 
of suffering that afflict us today.


04:17.152 --> 04:19.362
It’s like the Bible says: 


04:19.362 --> 04:23.075
“A righteous man’s supplication 
has a powerful effect.” 


04:23.075 --> 04:25.702
So the strength I regained makes me feel 


04:25.702 --> 04:28.705
that the entire worldwide brotherhood 
is praying for me. 


04:28.705 --> 04:31.333
I feel that it’s that strength 
that has allowed me 


04:31.333 --> 04:35.000
to resume my theocratic activities with zeal.


04:36.003 --> 04:38.673
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
not only do we know 


04:38.673 --> 04:41.801
that these things must take place
—since we are deep in the last days—


04:41.802 --> 04:44.000
but we also know 
that our deliverance is closer.


04:45.597 --> 04:48.184
I lost my livelihood; 


04:48.183 --> 04:51.000
it’s all completely gone. 


04:52.145 --> 04:54.188
But I have been so encouraged; 


04:54.188 --> 04:56.775
it’s as if the hurricane never even happened. 


04:56.775 --> 05:00.000
That’s how I feel, 
like it never even happened.


05:01.655 --> 05:04.575
Many people say it would have been better 
if they had died in the hurricane. 


05:04.575 --> 05:07.618
But no matter what sufferings we endure, 


05:07.618 --> 05:08.703
we have hope. 


05:08.703 --> 05:11.790
We see beyond the suffering 
and see God’s Kingdom is coming. 


05:11.790 --> 05:13.732
This is extraordinary. 


05:13.732 --> 05:16.420
No matter what form suffering may take, 


05:16.420 --> 05:18.922
we are able to patiently endure 


05:18.922 --> 05:29.997
because we know 
that suffering will not last forever.

00:08 My name is Maska Mahamba.
00:11 I love the preaching work.
00:13 However, my various illnesses
00:15 prevent me from giving  my all in the ministry.
00:20 My first wife died,  and we had six children.
00:26 I was alone with the six children,
00:29 and then I married Beatrice,  who has five children.
00:36 Since we are living in the last days  of this system, it is not easy.
00:43 I like the example of Jesus,
00:45 who was passionate about preaching  the message that he shared.
00:49 At the same time,
00:51 he took into account  the suffering of the people of his time.
00:54 He would take time to show kindness,
00:56 to encourage, and to heal.
01:01 The branch sees where there is a need
01:03 and then organizes a humanitarian mission.
01:09 I believe I can use my medical skills
01:12 to help our brothers.
01:14 It is love,
01:17 not just in writing,
01:19 but in action.
01:21 It’s a real joy
01:23 to help these brothers who need us
01:24 in remote locations far from towns.
01:27 It is always a pleasure.
02:04 Well, the two are the same;  both eardrums are completely perforated.
02:31 Well, we are here
02:33 in the village of Walikale in the middle
02:35 of the forest on the main road
02:37 —well, the only road in the village.
02:39 It serves as our runway.
02:41 I can’t bear to see anyone suffer,
02:46 so I use all my skills to try
02:48 to find a solution.
02:51 What moves me to help the brothers
02:53 is what Jesus said,
02:55 that “there is more happiness in giving than
02:57 . . . in receiving.”
02:59 A long day —really very tiring—
03:02 but at the same time,
03:04 there was an encouraging case:
03:05 Brother Munyakaragwe, 68 years old,
03:09 10 years in the regular pioneer service,  and he has 15 Bible studies.
03:13 This brother came  from the territory on a motorcycle.
03:16 It took him two and a half hours  on a very rough road
03:20 instead of an hour and a half
03:22 because he has a paralyzed leg.
03:25 And he was able to go  back to his field service,
03:27 well, with some medication.
03:29 So it was really encouraging to see him
03:31 getting on the motorcycle  with a smile on his face.
03:45 These are mosquito nets for those in need,
03:47 and there’s a big need here.
03:49 So we give them to each family.
03:53 You know, to protect your baby,  one of the best things is for him
03:57 to sleep under a mosquito net.
04:01 Jehovah has done well because he has gone
04:03 through you to provide us with care.
04:05 We are very grateful.
04:07 We thank the many brothers
04:09 who have volunteered to serve us.
04:11 I thank Jehovah because without him
04:13 our identifying mark of unity wouldn’t exist.
04:18 You have helped me.
04:20 I had this problem for two years.
04:22 Now I’m so happy.
04:23 I will be able to hear at the meetings again.
04:26 Thank you.
04:27 The brothers are aware  that they must thank Jehovah,
04:30 and we ourselves are aware
04:32 that all of this is possible
04:34 thanks to Jehovah’s holy spirit
04:35 and his organization.

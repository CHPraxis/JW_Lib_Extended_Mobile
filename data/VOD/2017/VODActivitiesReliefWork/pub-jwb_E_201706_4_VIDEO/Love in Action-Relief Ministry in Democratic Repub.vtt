00:08.362 --> 00:11.740
My name is Maska Mahamba. 


00:11.740 --> 00:13.742
I love the preaching work. 


00:13.742 --> 00:15.744
However, my various illnesses 


00:15.743 --> 00:18.000
prevent me from giving 
my all in the ministry.


00:20.540 --> 00:24.000
My first wife died, 
and we had six children. 


00:26.880 --> 00:29.383
I was alone with the six children, 


00:29.383 --> 00:33.000
and then I married Beatrice, 
who has five children. 


00:36.723 --> 00:41.000
Since we are living in the last days 
of this system, it is not easy.


00:43.313 --> 00:45.315
I like the example of Jesus, 


00:45.315 --> 00:49.695
who was passionate about preaching 
the message that he shared. 


00:49.695 --> 00:51.322
At the same time, 


00:51.322 --> 00:54.534
he took into account 
the suffering of the people of his time. 


00:54.533 --> 00:56.826
He would take time to show kindness, 


00:56.827 --> 00:59.000
to encourage, and to heal.


01:01.540 --> 01:03.667
The branch sees where there is a need 


01:03.667 --> 01:07.000
and then organizes a humanitarian mission.


01:09.590 --> 01:12.383
I believe I can use my medical skills 


01:12.383 --> 01:14.845
to help our brothers. 


01:14.845 --> 01:17.055
It is love, 


01:17.055 --> 01:19.392
not just in writing, 


01:19.392 --> 01:21.727
but in action.


01:21.727 --> 01:23.145
It’s a real joy 


01:23.145 --> 01:24.563
to help these brothers who need us 


01:24.563 --> 01:27.273
in remote locations far from towns. 


01:27.273 --> 01:32.000
It is always a pleasure.


02:04.895 --> 02:08.000
Well, the two are the same; 
both eardrums are completely perforated.


02:31.047 --> 02:33.049
Well, we are here 


02:33.048 --> 02:35.050
in the village of Walikale in the middle 


02:35.050 --> 02:37.093
of the forest on the main road


02:37.093 --> 02:39.178
—well, the only road in the village. 


02:39.178 --> 02:41.515
It serves as our runway. 


02:41.515 --> 02:46.103
I can’t bear to see anyone suffer, 


02:46.103 --> 02:48.271
so I use all my skills to try 


02:48.272 --> 02:51.192
to find a solution.


02:51.192 --> 02:53.485
What moves me to help the brothers 


02:53.485 --> 02:55.487
is what Jesus said, 


02:55.487 --> 02:57.782
that “there is more happiness in giving than


02:57.782 --> 02:59.784
. . . in receiving.”


02:59.783 --> 03:02.118
A long day
—really very tiring—


03:02.118 --> 03:04.161
but at the same time, 


03:04.162 --> 03:05.372
there was an encouraging case: 


03:05.372 --> 03:09.125
Brother Munyakaragwe, 68 years old, 


03:09.125 --> 03:13.213
10 years in the regular pioneer service, 
and he has 15 Bible studies. 


03:13.213 --> 03:16.508
This brother came 
from the territory on a motorcycle. 


03:16.508 --> 03:20.428
It took him two and a half hours 
on a very rough road 


03:20.428 --> 03:22.680
instead of an hour and a half 


03:22.680 --> 03:25.392
because he has a paralyzed leg. 


03:25.392 --> 03:27.394
And he was able to go 
back to his field service, 


03:27.393 --> 03:29.311
well, with some medication. 


03:29.312 --> 03:31.482
So it was really encouraging to see him 


03:31.482 --> 03:34.000
getting on the motorcycle 
with a smile on his face.


03:45.662 --> 03:47.999
These are mosquito nets for those in need, 


03:47.998 --> 03:49.625
and there’s a big need here. 


03:49.625 --> 03:52.000
So we give them to each family.


03:53.962 --> 03:57.340
You know, to protect your baby, 
one of the best things is for him  


03:57.340 --> 04:01.178
to sleep under a mosquito net.


04:01.178 --> 04:03.555
Jehovah has done well because he has gone 


04:03.555 --> 04:05.598
through you to provide us with care.


04:05.598 --> 04:07.558
We are very grateful. 


04:07.558 --> 04:09.018
We thank the many brothers 


04:09.018 --> 04:11.271
who have volunteered to serve us.


04:11.272 --> 04:13.899
I thank Jehovah because without him 


04:13.898 --> 04:17.000
our identifying mark of unity wouldn’t exist.


04:18.695 --> 04:20.238
You have helped me. 


04:20.238 --> 04:22.240
I had this problem for two years. 


04:22.240 --> 04:23.575
Now I’m so happy. 


04:23.575 --> 04:26.162
I will be able to hear at the meetings again. 


04:26.162 --> 04:27.620
Thank you.


04:27.620 --> 04:30.582
The brothers are aware 
that they must thank Jehovah, 


04:30.582 --> 04:32.584
and we ourselves are aware 


04:32.583 --> 04:34.043
that all of this is possible 


04:34.043 --> 04:35.711
thanks to Jehovah’s holy spirit 


04:35.712 --> 05:14.732
and his organization.

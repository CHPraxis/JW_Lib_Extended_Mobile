00:22.522 --> 00:24.524
My name is Miki. 


00:24.523 --> 00:27.193
I moved here one year ago. 


00:27.193 --> 00:30.000
Everyone was so nice and friendly.


00:38.532 --> 00:43.000
Well, that’s how I felt in the beginning.


00:56.680 --> 00:59.000
I am not your babysitter!


01:06.490 --> 01:09.000
Didn’t you see we were talking?


01:20.182 --> 01:24.000
Come on! 
This is not a park!


01:25.165 --> 01:28.505
And the elders are always busy. 


01:28.505 --> 01:32.000
I’m not sure if they really want me here.


01:42.352 --> 01:47.000
Yoko, a pioneer sister
from my former congregation, visited me. 


01:48.315 --> 01:51.000
She asked me how I was doing. 


01:52.195 --> 01:56.000
I told her how I felt
about my congregation. 


01:57.398 --> 02:01.913
Then she told me that she
had a similar experience. 


02:01.913 --> 02:05.000
And she shared with me
a Watchtower article that helped her. 


02:07.148 --> 02:11.000
I made this my next personal study project.


02:13.715 --> 02:17.637
“What do you see when you look at others? 


02:17.637 --> 02:20.474
“Do you have the tendency
to view what they say or do


02:20.473 --> 02:23.100
“as either black or white, 


02:23.100 --> 02:27.000
as if no other colors or shades existed?”


02:28.248 --> 02:29.961
“Having that viewpoint


02:29.962 --> 02:34.049
“would be like a photographer
who ignores the large variety


02:34.048 --> 02:37.678
“of brilliant hues and shades
in an autumn landscape, 


02:37.678 --> 02:41.000
as if only black and white images existed.”


02:47.932 --> 02:52.000
Maybe I’ve been viewing
the congregation as “black and white.” 


02:53.665 --> 02:58.000
The article then turned
my attention to Jesus’ example.


02:59.498 --> 03:02.000
“The spirit, of course, is eager,


03:03.252 --> 03:06.000
but the flesh is weak.”


03:09.498 --> 03:12.585
Why was Jesus able to say such kind words 


03:12.585 --> 03:14.000
to his disciples?


03:24.642 --> 03:27.060
Insight is the ability to put yourself


03:27.060 --> 03:28.792
in the other’s place. 


03:28.792 --> 03:31.419
Jesus did that with his disciples. 


03:31.418 --> 03:34.000
OK, I need to do the same.


03:35.190 --> 03:38.008
She always looks after the children at home. 


03:38.008 --> 03:40.636
She also needs time to be refreshed


03:40.637 --> 03:43.640
by association with friends
at the Kingdom Hall.


03:43.640 --> 03:46.000
She probably didn’t mean to be rude. 


03:47.490 --> 03:50.813
Since we looked like we were
having an enjoyable conversation, 


03:50.813 --> 03:53.000
she may have just wanted to join us.


03:55.108 --> 03:57.861
The elders are so busy caring for the needs


03:57.862 --> 03:59.364
of the congregation. 


03:59.363 --> 04:01.950
I know they’re doing the best they can. 


04:01.950 --> 04:05.000
I want to do what
I can to make their job easier.


04:31.228 --> 04:32.646
Miki,


04:32.647 --> 04:35.749
you are such a beautiful Christian. 


04:35.748 --> 04:39.000
We’re so glad to have you 
in our congregation.


04:45.465 --> 04:47.975
“The insight of a man certainly


04:47.975 --> 04:52.882
“slows down his anger,
and it is beauty on his part


04:52.882 --> 05:10.852
to overlook an offense.”

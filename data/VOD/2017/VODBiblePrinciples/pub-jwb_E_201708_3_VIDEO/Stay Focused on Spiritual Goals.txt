00:12 When I started learning sign language,
00:14 it just seemed to come natural for me.
00:24 After I transferred to the congregation,
00:26 I remember feeling so happy.
00:39 I was pioneering and really enjoying
00:42 this new way of communicating.
00:48 It’s funny how  the thing you love can also be
00:52 the thing that tests you.
00:57 Soon, I took the test  for a sign-language interpreter.
01:00 I couldn’t believe I passed!
01:06 I loved my new job.
01:11 My hope was  that it would support my pioneering
01:15 and maybe
01:17 allow me to travel one day to a country
01:19 and preach where there was  a need for sign language.
01:23 My boss was very happy with my work,
01:26 so much so that he began to give me more.
01:34 Everyone seemed appreciative,
01:38 and the extra money didn’t hurt.
01:56 I was handling it all fine.
02:00 Ahh, OK, for a while.
02:46 My boss asked me to work full-time
02:48 for a few months  to get some extra training.
02:53 The raise could help me
02:55 with planning my trip abroad.
03:03 I knew my parents would be concerned.
03:05 I knew because I felt it too.
03:10 I was already dragging physically.
03:13 But then again,  it would only be for a few months.
03:17 I was really torn.
03:20 Dad kindly commended me
03:22 for having good goals  and trying my best to work toward them.
03:25 Then he showed me  a scripture that really helped me,
03:30 1 Timothy 4:16:
03:33 “Pay constant attention  to yourself and to your teaching.
03:37 “Persevere in these things,
03:40 “for by doing this  you will save both yourself
03:42 and those who listen to you.”
03:45 He helped me
03:47 to see that Timothy set spiritual goals  for himself while growing up.
03:52 But Paul was now telling him,
03:55 “Don’t stop!”
03:59 Even though Timothy  was a grown spiritual man,
04:02 Paul encouraged him  to continue setting new spiritual goals,
04:06 in fact, to ‘persevere in them.’
04:11 What was I persevering in?
04:25 I kindly turned down the offer
04:28 and explained to my boss  that I’d like to keep my hours
04:31 to a minimum
04:39 so I could support  my number one job.
04:44 It might take me longer to save my money,
04:48 but I’ll make that trip one day
04:51 with Jehovah’s help
04:54 and a little perseverance.

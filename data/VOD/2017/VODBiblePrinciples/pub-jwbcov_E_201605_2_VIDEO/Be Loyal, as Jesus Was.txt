00:13 I hope you weren’t planning  on sleeping all day.
00:17 Actually, I was thinking about it.
00:19 Come on, Papa,  look how beautiful it is outside!
00:23 OK. OK.
00:27 Hmm.
00:29 Oh, I found this picture while cleaning the attic.
00:39 I didn’t know you played the violin.
00:53 Sergei.
00:55 Sergei, it’s getting late.
00:56 It’s time to put the violin down.
00:57 A little longer, please?
00:59 My teacher says I’m really good.
01:01 It’s true.  You’re playing better than I do now.
01:06 A man from the music conservatory  came to our class,
01:09 and my teacher told me  to play for him.
01:11 Oh, and how did that go?
01:13 Well, first I was nervous.
01:14 After I was done,  he asked me if I can attend
01:17 a program for young, gifted musicians.
01:20 Hmm.  And, uh, what did you tell him?
01:22 I told him I’d ask you first.
01:24 So, can I, please?
01:27 I don’t think it’s a good idea.
01:28 What?  But why?
01:30 It’s just playing the violin!
01:32 You and I play together.
01:33 What’s the difference?
01:36 The difference is we play violin  for our enjoyment.
01:40 It’s different with the world.
01:43 The pressure to be  the very best is so strong.
01:47 And the spirit of competition
01:50 —it can become so great  that it will consume you.
01:54 I can handle it.
01:55 Sergei, a conservatory exists  to convince young people
02:00 to make music their life,
02:02 their career.
02:04 You will be surrounded  by people who don’t love Jehovah.
02:07 Can you handle that?
02:10 I don’t know.
02:11 But I really love it.
02:12 And I’m not good at anything else,
02:14 but I’m good at this.
02:15 Couldn’t I just try for a little bit?
02:18 I think it will only make  it harder for you.
02:21 And, Sergei,
02:23 you don’t have to give up playing.
02:26 We still can enjoy playing  beautiful music together,
02:29 like we always do.
02:30 Just not at the conservatory.
02:32 That’s right.
02:34 We must show Jehovah that we love him first.
02:37 I just don’t understand.
02:41 One day you will understand.
02:43 For now,
02:45 I really appreciate you being obedient.
03:03 I really appreciate you being obedient.
03:24 Good answer, Alexi!
03:27 Natalia and I have really enjoyed  our studies, Sergei.
03:29 But we missed your father tonight.
03:31 We really hope he’s feeling better soon.
03:32 Thank you.
03:43 Who is it?
03:44 Alexi, it’s me, Daniel.
03:46 Let me in.
03:48 Sorry, I’m late.
03:50 It’s OK, Daniel.
03:51 We’re glad you could join us.
03:52 You are sure you weren’t followed?
03:53 Yes.  I’m sure.
03:55 I passed a group of police  on the way.
03:57 But they did not see me.
03:59 They were busy arresting a man.
04:00 It is getting more and more dangerous.
04:02 I’m so scared.
04:03 It’s true.
04:04 These are dangerous times.
04:06 What helps me is to think of the ones  like Jeremiah and the apostle Paul.
04:10 They were ordinary people just like us.
04:13 But Jehovah granted them  “the power beyond what is normal”
04:16 so that they were able to endure.
04:18 When we meditate on examples like these,
04:20 it gives us courage.
04:33 Father?
04:37 Father!
04:38 Sergei. Sergei Alexandrov.
04:40 We have been looking for you.
04:42 What have you done with him?
04:44 I will ask the questions!
04:45 Where is it?
04:46 Let him go.  Please!
04:48 He’s sick!
04:50 I will ask again!
04:52 Where is it?
04:53 Where is what?
04:55 The seditious literature  your religion produces.
05:00 We know you are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
05:02 Why are you doing this?
05:04 We’ve done nothing!
05:05 You know the law,  and yet you chose to disobey it.
05:09 You believe this is nothing, Sergei?
05:12 Now tell us where to find your literature.
05:16 Perhaps, then,
05:18 I will extend some consideration.
05:21 You won’t find anything here.
05:22 We’ll see.
05:32 You play?
05:42 Play something.
05:59 No, no, no, no, no.  Not that.
06:01 Play the anthem for us.
06:03 No.  I will not.
06:06 We are loyal to our God, Jehovah.
06:16 Why do you play  for the wrong side
06:19 when you know  there is only one outcome?
06:38 “For I am convinced  that neither death
06:44 “nor life
06:47 “nor angels
06:49 “nor governments . . .
06:52 “will be able
06:54 to separate us from God’s love.”
06:59 “For I am convinced.”
07:08 Up early this morning.
07:10 Come with me.
07:23 We have news about your father.
07:26 How is he?
07:28 He’s dying, Sergei.
07:32 Please,
07:34 can I see him?
07:36 You can do even more than that.
07:39 You can take him home.
07:41 We—we can leave?
07:43 Yes.
07:45 You can leave and never have to come back.
07:48 Just sign this.
07:52 What is—  What is it?
07:53 Read it. Read it.
08:01 No.
08:03 This opportunity will not come again.
08:05 I assure you.
08:08 Renounce your religion,
08:10 and you both can leave.
08:13 No.
08:22 No one has to know.
08:25 My God will know.
08:28 Your God.
08:31 Where is your God, Sergei?
08:34 Can he rescue you from this place?
08:37 Can he give you back your life?  your father?
08:41 You’ve been here for five months.
08:45 Would you prefer
08:46 to make it five more years?
08:49 Look at me.
08:51 If not for yourself,
08:54 do it for your father.
08:56 You love him, right?
08:59 Right?
09:02 Then prove your love for him.
09:07 I love my father very much.
09:11 We must show Jehovah  that we love him first.
09:16 But I love Jehovah first.
09:19 And whatever happens,
09:22 I will serve him.
09:25 OK.
09:28 You want to serve him?
09:30 Serve him.
09:33 Enjoy your five years!
09:35 Guard,
09:36 take him!
09:43 Psst.  Hey.
09:48 Who is Jehovah?
09:59 Thank you so much for that talk.  That was wonderful.
10:01 Thank you.
10:02 Sergei!
10:05 Alexi?  Natalia?
10:07 Yes, it’s us!
10:09 Ahh.
10:12 I haven’t seen you both since . . .
10:14 I know!
10:15 It’s been 17 years!
10:17 We prayed for your release  every night, Sergei.
10:19 Thank you so much.
10:21 When they announced your name
10:22 as our substitute circuit overseer,  I couldn’t believe it!
10:25 Oh, I still cannot believe it.
10:30 I’m sorry.
10:34 I want you to meet my wife.
10:36 This is Anya.
10:37 Nice meeting you.
10:38 Natalia, Alexi.
10:39 Pleasure to meet you.
10:40 Nice meeting you too.
10:41 Your husband studied with us.
10:43 Ahh.
10:44 It’s wonderful to meet up again  after all these years!
10:46 Would you both come  to my home for dinner tonight?
10:49 It would mean so much to us.
10:51 Sounds wonderful!
10:53 We would be happy to come!
10:54 Thank you! Thank you!
10:59 We’ve been waiting for you.
11:01 All right.
11:15 Well, that was excellent!
11:18 Like your talk, Sergei, today.
11:20 Ahh.
11:21 Yes, it’s rare for someone  so young to teach as you do.
11:25 No, I don’t.
11:26 Feodor is right.
11:28 You are wise beyond your years.
11:31 Do you think your time  in prison prepared you?
11:33 I definitely had a lot of time to meditate.
11:36 So I guess  it might have matured me a little.
11:40 You were there nearly twice  as long as most of us.
11:43 We can only imagine
11:45 how difficult those years were for you.
11:48 Is it true you never saw
11:50 your father again?
11:52 It’s true.
11:53 You must be very strong  to withstand that kind of pressure.
11:58 Yeah.
11:58 Yeah, I suppose so.
12:00 I wish you could be  our real circuit overseer.
12:05 We heard good things about Brother Elin.
12:08 Many good things.
12:09 We hope to meet him soon.
12:11 He’s OK.
12:13 But he’s not the man of the people.
12:15 You have suffered like us.
12:18 You understand us.
12:21 We need someone like you.
12:24 Brothers,  I—I appreciate the praise.
12:26 But I really don’t deserve it.
12:28 Yes, you do.
12:29 No!
12:30 The praise should go to Jehovah.
12:32 It is only because of his power  that any of us can serve him the way we do.
12:36 That’s true.  It’s only because of Jehovah’s spirit.
12:39 He deserves the praise.
12:42 And remember:
12:44 Jehovah is the one who chooses  those who serve in the congregations.
12:49 Each of us has strengths  that others don’t have.
12:53 But Jehovah sees them all,
12:56 and he knows how to use them  to advance his will.
12:59 So we must trust Jehovah
13:01 and be determined to appreciate  the ones he has chosen to use.
13:13 Sergei! Sergei!
13:17 What is it?
13:18 Viktor wants to see you.
13:21 Right away.
13:23 Sergei.
13:24 Yes, Viktor.
13:25 I called you in because I need your help.
13:27 Dimitri is sick,
13:28 and I have no one else to cover for him.
13:30 Who is Dimitri?
13:31 He works at our sister plant.
13:33 And I need you  to start working there beginning tomorrow.
13:36 Where is this other plant?
13:38 About an hour away.
13:39 An hour away!
13:42 Look, Viktor, with all due respect,  I really appreciate this job.
13:46 Really.
13:48 But I’ve been covering for several people  in the last few months.
13:50 And I already feel very exhausted.
13:52 Do you think you can find somebody else?
13:54 Not with your skill.
13:56 But I have a family now  and other responsibilities.
13:58 Other responsibilities?
13:59 My congregation.
14:01 Oh, your religious beliefs again.
14:06 Well, I give you time for your meetings,  don’t I?
14:08 Yes.
14:09 Remember,
14:10 I do this not because I value your religion,
14:13 but because I value your work.
14:16 You’re welcome to look for another job.
14:18 But I doubt that you’re going  to find an employer
14:20 as understanding  as I am concerning your religious beliefs.
14:24 Well, as I said, Viktor,
14:25 I really appreciate this job
14:27 and all the extra consideration  you’ve been showing me.
14:29 So I guess I’ll just cover for Dimitri.
14:44 Have a good day.
14:45 We’ll be ready for our family study  when you get home.
15:03 “Just as it is written:
15:06 “‘For your sake we are being  put to death all day long;
15:11 “‘we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.’
15:19 “On the contrary,
15:22 “in all these things
15:24 “we are coming off completely victorious
15:28 through the one who loved us.”
15:32 We can be victorious.
15:40 So how are my girls doing?
15:43 Ah.
15:45 Papa, we’ve have been practicing  for the study tonight.
15:48 Mhm.
15:48 I’m going to be Mary,  and Mama is going to be Martha.
15:51 I guess that makes me Jesus.
15:53 Yeah.
15:53 Yes.
15:54 I hope you are ready for tonight.
15:56 Yes, are you ready?
15:58 I’m ready, Sweetheart.
16:00 I wouldn’t miss it for anything.
16:01 Ah.  Come, come, come.
16:02 Yeah.
16:03 All right.
16:23 Irina.
16:25 I’m sorry.
16:28 I would like you to meet  a very dear friend of ours, Natalia.
16:31 Hello.
16:32 I knew your father  when he was close to your age.
16:34 He helped me learn the truth.
16:37 Yeah.
16:37 You did?
16:38 He was a good teacher, too.
16:40 Very patient.
16:42 Where is Alexi?  Because we were hoping to see him too.
16:44 Yeah.
16:45 He’s not here.
16:47 Hmm.
16:48 Maybe we could stop by  and see him tomorrow before we leave?
16:50 Yeah.
16:51 You can’t.
16:52 Why not?
16:53 What’s wrong, Natalia?  Is he sick?
16:57 Um.
16:58 Go.
16:59 What is it?
17:01 What is it? Tell us!
17:04 A few months ago,
17:06 Alexi left the truth.
17:09 Oh, no!
17:11 We haven’t heard.
17:13 We’re so sorry, Natalia!
17:18 What happened?
17:22 A workmate began feeding
17:24 his mind with doubts about the organization.
17:27 Pretty soon,  those doubts turned into belief,
17:35 and he left.
17:39 Everyone’s been so supportive
17:41 in the congregation.
17:43 And Jehovah —he has never left me.
17:46 Yeah.
17:48 I remember your words about courage  all those years ago.
17:50 I just didn’t want to tell you
17:52 because I knew  how much it would hurt you.
17:54 No.  Don’t worry.
18:05 I just can’t believe it.
18:20 I’m so sorry.
18:25 He’s been like a second father to me.
18:32 Now it feels like I’ve lost two,  you know?
18:36 I know.
18:37 But he may still come back.
18:42 It’s been my earnest wish that he does.
18:45 Mine too.
18:49 I love you so much.
18:58 People may leave,
19:02 but Jehovah never will.
19:07 He will never abandon his loyal ones.
19:10 “For I am convinced.”
19:12 Remember?
19:14 Yeah, I remember.
19:17 Mhm.
19:27 Oh, I found this picture  while cleaning the attic.
19:35 I didn’t know you played the violin.
19:39 I lost interest in it, I guess.
19:46 Sergei, Irina.
19:48 Good afternoon.
19:49 Is it?
19:52 We have received your test results.
19:54 I wish I had better news.
19:56 It’s OK, go ahead.
19:58 We have to operate.
19:59 All right.
20:01 But remember,
20:02 no blood!
20:04 I will do my best.
20:06 But your best option  is a blood transfusion.
20:09 Without it,  your chances are much lower.
20:12 Do you understand  what I’m trying to say?
20:17 Yeah, I understand.
20:21 And thank you, Doctor,  for doing your best
20:24 and leaving this choice to me.
20:28 My stand is the same.
20:31 Very well.
20:33 We’ll schedule the surgery  for the end of this week.
20:35 And we have to run  a few more tests this afternoon,
20:39 but I will give you  a few minutes first.
20:42 Thank you.
20:48 I love you, Papa.
20:54 I know you’ll make it through.
20:56 Mama always said you were strong.
20:59 I love you too, Sweetheart.
21:06 And should something happen,
21:14 keep your hope anchored  on that wonderful day.
21:18 The day when your mom
21:21 and I will be reunited
21:24 with you in the new world.
21:27 Promise me?
21:38 I promise.
21:42 I will see you outside.
21:59 We must show Jehovah that we love him first.
22:12 “For I am convinced
22:14 “that neither death
22:17 “nor life
22:19 “nor angels
22:20 “nor governments
22:22 “nor things now here
22:24 “nor things to come
22:25 “nor powers
22:27 “nor height
22:28 “nor depth
22:30 “nor any other creation
22:31 “will be able to separate us from God’s love
22:36 that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
22:43 “For I am convinced.”

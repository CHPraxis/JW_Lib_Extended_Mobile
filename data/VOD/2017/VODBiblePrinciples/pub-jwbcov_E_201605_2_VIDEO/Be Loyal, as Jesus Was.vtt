00:13.658 --> 00:16.000
I hope you weren’t planning 
on sleeping all day.


00:17.328 --> 00:19.665
Actually, I was thinking about it.


00:19.665 --> 00:22.000
Come on, Papa, 
look how beautiful it is outside!


00:23.752 --> 00:26.000
OK. OK. 


00:27.882 --> 00:29.634
Hmm.


00:29.633 --> 00:32.000
Oh, I found this picture
while cleaning the attic.


00:39.017 --> 00:42.000
I didn’t know you played the violin.


00:53.990 --> 00:55.117
Sergei. 


00:55.117 --> 00:56.244
Sergei, it’s getting late. 


00:56.243 --> 00:57.620
It’s time to put the violin down.


00:57.620 --> 00:59.497
A little longer, please? 


00:59.497 --> 01:01.290
My teacher says I’m really good.


01:01.290 --> 01:04.000
It’s true. 
You’re playing better than I do now.


01:06.420 --> 01:09.257
A man from the music conservatory 
came to our class, 


01:09.257 --> 01:11.300
and my teacher told me 
to play for him.


01:11.300 --> 01:13.302
Oh, and how did that go?


01:13.302 --> 01:14.637
Well, first I was nervous. 


01:14.637 --> 01:17.807
After I was done, 
he asked me if I can attend 


01:17.807 --> 01:20.350
a program for young, gifted musicians.


01:20.350 --> 01:22.728
Hmm. 
And, uh, what did you tell him?


01:22.728 --> 01:24.145
I told him I’d ask you first. 


01:24.145 --> 01:26.000
So, can I, please?


01:27.232 --> 01:28.942
I don’t think it’s a good idea.


01:28.942 --> 01:30.569
What? 
But why? 


01:30.568 --> 01:32.445
It’s just playing the violin! 


01:32.445 --> 01:33.738
You and I play together. 


01:33.738 --> 01:36.283
What’s the difference?


01:36.283 --> 01:40.786
The difference is we play violin 
for our enjoyment. 


01:40.787 --> 01:43.624
It’s different with the world. 


01:43.623 --> 01:47.418
The pressure to be 
the very best is so strong. 


01:47.418 --> 01:50.380
And the spirit of competition


01:50.380 --> 01:54.385
—it can become so great 
that it will consume you.


01:54.385 --> 01:55.843
I can handle it.


01:55.843 --> 02:00.556
Sergei, a conservatory exists 
to convince young people 


02:00.557 --> 02:02.769
to make music their life, 


02:02.768 --> 02:04.811
their career. 


02:04.812 --> 02:07.982
You will be surrounded 
by people who don’t love Jehovah. 


02:07.982 --> 02:10.275
Can you handle that?


02:10.275 --> 02:11.318
I don’t know. 


02:11.318 --> 02:12.568
But I really love it. 


02:12.568 --> 02:14.321
And I’m not good at anything else, 


02:14.322 --> 02:15.864
but I’m good at this. 


02:15.863 --> 02:18.075
Couldn’t I just try for a little bit?


02:18.075 --> 02:21.495
I think it will only make 
it harder for you. 


02:21.495 --> 02:23.497
And, Sergei, 


02:23.497 --> 02:26.209
you don’t have to give up playing. 


02:26.208 --> 02:29.043
We still can enjoy playing 
beautiful music together, 


02:29.043 --> 02:30.586
like we always do.


02:30.587 --> 02:32.924
Just not at the conservatory.


02:32.923 --> 02:34.508
That’s right. 


02:34.508 --> 02:37.845
We must show Jehovah that we love him first.


02:37.845 --> 02:40.000
I just don’t understand.


02:41.015 --> 02:43.392
One day you will understand. 


02:43.392 --> 02:45.644
For now, 


02:45.643 --> 02:49.000
I really appreciate you being obedient.


03:03.037 --> 03:06.000
I really appreciate you being obedient.


03:24.975 --> 03:27.060
Good answer, Alexi!


03:27.060 --> 03:29.312
Natalia and I have really enjoyed 
our studies, Sergei.


03:29.312 --> 03:31.315
But we missed your father tonight. 


03:31.315 --> 03:32.523
We really hope he’s feeling better soon.


03:32.523 --> 03:34.000
Thank you.


03:43.077 --> 03:44.285
Who is it?


03:44.285 --> 03:46.037
Alexi, it’s me, Daniel. 


03:46.037 --> 03:48.040
Let me in. 


03:48.040 --> 03:50.042
Sorry, I’m late.


03:50.042 --> 03:51.085
It’s OK, Daniel. 


03:51.085 --> 03:52.418
We’re glad you could join us.


03:52.418 --> 03:53.795
You are sure you weren’t followed?


03:53.795 --> 03:54.000
Yes. 
I’m sure. 


03:55.047 --> 03:57.049
I passed a group of police 
on the way. 


03:57.048 --> 03:59.133
But they did not see me. 


03:59.133 --> 04:00.843
They were busy arresting a man.


04:00.843 --> 04:02.846
It is getting more and more dangerous. 


04:02.847 --> 04:03.805
I’m so scared.


04:03.805 --> 04:04.557
It’s true. 


04:04.557 --> 04:06.725
These are dangerous times. 


04:06.725 --> 04:09.000
What helps me is to think of the ones 
like Jeremiah and the apostle Paul. 


04:10.520 --> 04:13.190
They were ordinary people just like us. 


04:13.190 --> 04:16.443
But Jehovah granted them 
“the power beyond what is normal” 


04:16.443 --> 04:18.445
so that they were able to endure. 


04:18.445 --> 04:20.447
When we meditate on examples like these, 


04:20.447 --> 04:23.000
it gives us courage.


04:33.168 --> 04:35.000
Father? 


04:37.798 --> 04:38.840
Father!


04:38.840 --> 04:40.925
Sergei.
Sergei Alexandrov. 


04:40.925 --> 04:42.343
We have been looking for you.


04:42.343 --> 04:44.095
What have you done with him?


04:44.095 --> 04:45.638
I will ask the questions! 


04:45.638 --> 04:46.681
Where is it?


04:46.682 --> 04:48.684
Let him go. 
Please! 


04:48.683 --> 04:50.393
He’s sick!


04:50.393 --> 04:52.395
I will ask again! 


04:52.395 --> 04:53.438
Where is it?


04:53.438 --> 04:55.481
Where is what?


04:55.482 --> 05:00.320
The seditious literature 
your religion produces. 


05:00.320 --> 05:02.865
We know you are Jehovah’s Witnesses.


05:02.865 --> 05:04.908
Why are you doing this? 


05:04.908 --> 05:05.825
We’ve done nothing!


05:05.825 --> 05:09.120
You know the law, 
and yet you chose to disobey it. 


05:09.120 --> 05:12.665
You believe this is nothing, Sergei? 


05:12.665 --> 05:16.462
Now tell us where to find your literature. 


05:16.462 --> 05:18.964
Perhaps, then, 


05:18.963 --> 05:21.383
I will extend some consideration.


05:21.383 --> 05:22.926
You won’t find anything here.


05:22.927 --> 05:25.000
We’ll see.


05:32.185 --> 05:34.000
You play?


05:42.153 --> 05:44.000
Play something.


05:59.045 --> 06:01.088
No, no, no, no, no. 
Not that. 


06:01.088 --> 06:03.883
Play the anthem for us.


06:03.883 --> 06:06.511
No. 
I will not. 


06:06.512 --> 06:08.000
We are loyal to our God, Jehovah.


06:16.313 --> 06:19.816
Why do you play 
for the wrong side 


06:19.817 --> 06:23.000
when you know 
there is only one outcome?


06:38.127 --> 06:42.000
“For I am convinced 
that neither death 


06:44.717 --> 06:47.510
“nor life 


06:47.510 --> 06:49.512
“nor angels 


06:49.512 --> 06:52.140
“nor governments . . . 


06:52.140 --> 06:54.350
“will be able 


06:54.350 --> 06:58.000
to separate us from God’s love.” 


06:59.732 --> 07:03.000
“For I am convinced.”


07:08.323 --> 07:10.283
Up early this morning. 


07:10.283 --> 07:13.000
Come with me.


07:23.130 --> 07:26.633
We have news about your father.


07:26.633 --> 07:27.000
How is he?


07:28.135 --> 07:30.000
He’s dying, Sergei.


07:32.347 --> 07:34.642
Please, 


07:34.642 --> 07:36.727
can I see him?


07:36.727 --> 07:39.187
You can do even more than that. 


07:39.187 --> 07:41.315
You can take him home.


07:41.315 --> 07:43.192
We—we can leave?


07:43.192 --> 07:45.360
Yes. 


07:45.360 --> 07:48.947
You can leave and never have to come back. 


07:48.947 --> 07:52.284
Just sign this.


07:52.283 --> 07:53.785
What is— 
What is it?


07:53.785 --> 07:57.000
Read it.
Read it.


08:01.418 --> 08:03.503
No.


08:03.503 --> 08:05.630
This opportunity will not come again. 


08:05.630 --> 08:07.000
I assure you. 


08:08.508 --> 08:10.635
Renounce your religion, 


08:10.635 --> 08:13.930
and you both can leave.


08:13.930 --> 08:16.000
No.


08:22.897 --> 08:25.984
No one has to know.


08:25.983 --> 08:28.695
My God will know.


08:28.695 --> 08:31.407
Your God. 


08:31.407 --> 08:34.994
Where is your God, Sergei? 


08:34.993 --> 08:37.911
Can he rescue you from this place? 


08:37.912 --> 08:41.875
Can he give you back your life? 
your father? 


08:41.875 --> 08:44.000
You’ve been here for five months. 


08:45.378 --> 08:46.380
Would you prefer 


08:46.380 --> 08:49.132
to make it five more years? 


08:49.132 --> 08:51.802
Look at me. 


08:51.802 --> 08:54.054
If not for yourself, 


08:54.053 --> 08:56.890
do it for your father. 


08:56.890 --> 08:59.142
You love him, right? 


08:59.142 --> 09:02.854
Right? 


09:02.853 --> 09:05.000
Then prove your love for him.


09:07.358 --> 09:11.946
I love my father very much.


09:11.947 --> 09:15.000
We must show Jehovah 
that we love him first.


09:16.743 --> 09:19.495
But I love Jehovah first. 


09:19.495 --> 09:22.290
And whatever happens, 


09:22.290 --> 09:25.335
I will serve him.


09:25.335 --> 09:28.172
OK. 


09:28.172 --> 09:30.840
You want to serve him? 


09:30.840 --> 09:33.427
Serve him. 


09:33.427 --> 09:35.762
Enjoy your five years! 


09:35.762 --> 09:36.847
Guard, 


09:36.847 --> 09:38.000
take him!


09:43.937 --> 09:46.000
Psst. 
Hey. 


09:48.692 --> 09:51.000
Who is Jehovah?


09:59.828 --> 10:01.871
Thank you so much for that talk. 
That was wonderful.


10:01.872 --> 10:02.789
Thank you.


10:02.788 --> 10:04.000
Sergei!


10:05.458 --> 10:07.668
Alexi? 
Natalia?


10:07.668 --> 10:09.711
Yes, it’s us!


10:09.712 --> 10:11.000
Ahh.


10:12.548 --> 10:14.758
I haven’t seen you both since . . .


10:14.758 --> 10:15.843
I know! 


10:15.843 --> 10:17.720
It’s been 17 years! 


10:17.720 --> 10:19.722
We prayed for your release 
every night, Sergei.


10:19.722 --> 10:21.349
Thank you so much.


10:21.348 --> 10:22.516
When they announced your name


10:22.517 --> 10:25.770
as our substitute circuit overseer, 
I couldn’t believe it!


10:25.770 --> 10:28.000
Oh, I still cannot believe it.


10:30.358 --> 10:33.000
I’m sorry.


10:34.237 --> 10:36.239
I want you to meet my wife. 


10:36.238 --> 10:37.531
This is Anya.


10:37.532 --> 10:38.409
Nice meeting you.


10:38.408 --> 10:39.616
Natalia, Alexi.


10:39.617 --> 10:40.619
Pleasure to meet you.


10:40.618 --> 10:41.620
Nice meeting you too.


10:41.620 --> 10:43.037
Your husband studied with us.


10:43.037 --> 10:44.080
Ahh.


10:44.080 --> 10:46.833
It’s wonderful to meet up again 
after all these years!


10:46.833 --> 10:49.001
Would you both come 
to my home for dinner tonight? 


10:49.002 --> 10:51.129
It would mean so much to us.


10:51.128 --> 10:53.673
Sounds wonderful!


10:53.673 --> 10:54.966
We would be happy to come!


10:54.967 --> 10:56.000
Thank you!
Thank you!


10:59.803 --> 11:01.806
We’ve been waiting for you.


11:01.807 --> 11:03.000
All right.


11:15.320 --> 11:18.323
Well, that was excellent!


11:18.323 --> 11:20.325
Like your talk, Sergei, today.


11:20.325 --> 11:21.492
Ahh.


11:21.492 --> 11:25.372
Yes, it’s rare for someone 
so young to teach as you do.


11:25.372 --> 11:26.497
No, I don’t.


11:26.497 --> 11:28.334
Feodor is right. 


11:28.333 --> 11:31.376
You are wise beyond your years. 


11:31.377 --> 11:33.922
Do you think your time 
in prison prepared you?


11:33.922 --> 11:36.257
I definitely had a lot of time to meditate. 


11:36.257 --> 11:40.220
So I guess 
it might have matured me a little.


11:40.220 --> 11:43.598
You were there nearly twice 
as long as most of us. 


11:43.598 --> 11:45.600
We can only imagine 


11:45.600 --> 11:48.812
how difficult those years were for you.


11:48.812 --> 11:50.939
Is it true you never saw 


11:50.938 --> 11:52.481
your father again?


11:52.482 --> 11:53.900
It’s true.


11:53.900 --> 11:58.112
You must be very strong 
to withstand that kind of pressure.


11:58.112 --> 11:58.905
Yeah.


11:58.905 --> 12:00.407
Yeah, I suppose so.


12:00.407 --> 12:05.870
I wish you could be 
our real circuit overseer.


12:05.870 --> 12:08.373
We heard good things about Brother Elin.


12:08.373 --> 12:09.581
Many good things. 


12:09.582 --> 12:11.167
We hope to meet him soon.


12:11.167 --> 12:13.337
He’s OK. 


12:13.337 --> 12:15.880
But he’s not the man of the people. 


12:15.880 --> 12:18.800
You have suffered like us. 


12:18.800 --> 12:21.302
You understand us. 


12:21.302 --> 12:24.305
We need someone like you.


12:24.305 --> 12:26.557
Brothers, 
I—I appreciate the praise. 


12:26.557 --> 12:28.602
But I really don’t deserve it.


12:28.602 --> 12:29.602
Yes, you do.


12:29.602 --> 12:30.312
No! 


12:30.312 --> 12:32.355
The praise should go to Jehovah. 


12:32.355 --> 12:36.275
It is only because of his power 
that any of us can serve him the way we do.


12:36.275 --> 12:39.820
That’s true. 
It’s only because of Jehovah’s spirit. 


12:39.820 --> 12:42.157
He deserves the praise.


12:42.157 --> 12:44.742
And remember: 


12:44.742 --> 12:49.539
Jehovah is the one who chooses 
those who serve in the congregations. 


12:49.538 --> 12:52.000
Each of us has strengths 
that others don’t have. 


12:53.250 --> 12:56.003
But Jehovah sees them all, 


12:56.003 --> 12:59.756
and he knows how to use them 
to advance his will. 


12:59.757 --> 13:01.844
So we must trust Jehovah 


13:01.843 --> 13:05.000
and be determined to appreciate 
the ones he has chosen to use.


13:13.228 --> 13:17.733
Sergei!
Sergei!


13:17.733 --> 13:18.735
What is it?


13:18.735 --> 13:21.697
Viktor wants to see you.


13:21.697 --> 13:23.740
Right away. 


13:23.740 --> 13:24.823
Sergei.


13:24.823 --> 13:25.658
Yes, Viktor.


13:25.658 --> 13:27.576
I called you in because I need your help. 


13:27.577 --> 13:28.495
Dimitri is sick, 


13:28.495 --> 13:30.538
and I have no one else to cover for him.


13:30.538 --> 13:31.873
Who is Dimitri?


13:31.873 --> 13:33.875
He works at our sister plant. 


13:33.875 --> 13:36.043
And I need you 
to start working there beginning tomorrow.


13:36.043 --> 13:38.086
Where is this other plant?


13:38.087 --> 13:39.297
About an hour away.


13:39.297 --> 13:41.000
An hour away! 


13:42.342 --> 13:46.722
Look, Viktor, with all due respect, 
I really appreciate this job. 


13:46.722 --> 13:48.139
Really. 


13:48.138 --> 13:50.975
But I’ve been covering for several people 
in the last few months. 


13:50.975 --> 13:52.977
And I already feel very exhausted. 


13:52.977 --> 13:54.687
Do you think you can find somebody else?


13:54.687 --> 13:56.355
Not with your skill.


13:56.355 --> 13:58.567
But I have a family now 
and other responsibilities.


13:58.567 --> 13:59.859
Other responsibilities?


13:59.858 --> 14:01.903
My congregation.


14:01.903 --> 14:05.000
Oh, your religious beliefs again. 


14:06.115 --> 14:08.242
Well, I give you time for your meetings, 
don’t I?


14:08.242 --> 14:09.702
Yes.


14:09.702 --> 14:10.829
Remember, 


14:10.828 --> 14:13.956
I do this not because I value your religion, 


14:13.957 --> 14:16.042
but because I value your work. 


14:16.042 --> 14:18.420
You’re welcome to look for another job. 


14:18.420 --> 14:20.797
But I doubt that you’re going 
to find an employer 


14:20.797 --> 14:24.259
as understanding 
as I am concerning your religious beliefs.


14:24.258 --> 14:25.301
Well, as I said, Viktor, 


14:25.302 --> 14:27.387
I really appreciate this job 


14:27.387 --> 14:29.764
and all the extra consideration 
you’ve been showing me. 


14:29.763 --> 14:34.000
So I guess I’ll just cover for Dimitri.


14:44.320 --> 14:45.863
Have a good day. 


14:45.863 --> 14:48.000
We’ll be ready for our family study 
when you get home.


15:03.338 --> 15:06.675
“Just as it is written: 


15:06.675 --> 15:11.555
“‘For your sake we are being 
put to death all day long; 


15:11.555 --> 15:15.000
“‘we have been accounted
as sheep for slaughtering.’


15:19.980 --> 15:22.067
“On the contrary, 


15:22.067 --> 15:24.694
“in all these things 


15:24.693 --> 15:28.280
“we are coming off completely victorious 


15:28.280 --> 15:31.000
through the one who loved us.” 


15:32.743 --> 15:35.000
We can be victorious.


15:40.418 --> 15:43.588
So how are my girls doing? 


15:43.588 --> 15:45.088
Ah.


15:45.088 --> 15:48.091
Papa, we’ve have been practicing 
for the study tonight.


15:48.092 --> 15:48.677
Mhm.


15:48.677 --> 15:51.345
I’m going to be Mary, 
and Mama is going to be Martha.


15:51.345 --> 15:53.388
I guess that makes me Jesus.


15:53.388 --> 15:53.973
Yeah.


15:53.973 --> 15:54.640
Yes.


15:54.640 --> 15:56.642
I hope you are ready for tonight. 


15:56.642 --> 15:58.394
Yes, are you ready?


15:58.393 --> 16:00.103
I’m ready, Sweetheart. 


16:00.103 --> 16:01.146
I wouldn’t miss it for anything. 


16:01.147 --> 16:02.149
Ah. 
Come, come, come.


16:02.148 --> 16:03.440
Yeah.


16:03.440 --> 16:05.000
All right. 


16:23.293 --> 16:25.171
Irina.


16:25.172 --> 16:28.634
I’m sorry.


16:28.633 --> 16:31.970
I would like you to meet 
a very dear friend of ours, Natalia.


16:31.970 --> 16:32.678
Hello.


16:32.678 --> 16:34.971
I knew your father 
when he was close to your age. 


16:34.972 --> 16:37.017
He helped me learn the truth.


16:37.017 --> 16:37.600
Yeah.


16:37.600 --> 16:38.560
You did?


16:38.560 --> 16:40.562
He was a good teacher, too. 


16:40.562 --> 16:42.355
Very patient.


16:42.355 --> 16:44.357
Where is Alexi? 
Because we were hoping to see him too.


16:44.357 --> 16:45.775
Yeah.


16:45.775 --> 16:47.068
He’s not here.


16:47.068 --> 16:48.276
Hmm. 


16:48.277 --> 16:50.112
Maybe we could stop by 
and see him tomorrow before we leave?


16:50.112 --> 16:51.322
Yeah.


16:51.322 --> 16:52.449
You can’t.


16:52.448 --> 16:53.866
Why not? 


16:53.867 --> 16:56.000
What’s wrong, Natalia? 
Is he sick?


16:57.453 --> 16:58.453
Um.


16:58.453 --> 16:59.871
Go. 


16:59.872 --> 17:01.457
What is it?


17:01.457 --> 17:03.000
What is it?
Tell us!


17:04.293 --> 17:06.295
A few months ago, 


17:06.295 --> 17:09.048
Alexi left the truth.


17:09.048 --> 17:11.216
Oh, no! 


17:11.217 --> 17:13.720
We haven’t heard. 


17:13.720 --> 17:16.000
We’re so sorry, Natalia! 


17:18.182 --> 17:21.000
What happened?


17:22.187 --> 17:24.230
A workmate began feeding 


17:24.230 --> 17:27.983
his mind with doubts about the organization. 


17:27.983 --> 17:32.000
Pretty soon, 
those doubts turned into belief, 


17:35.783 --> 17:38.000
and he left. 


17:39.745 --> 17:41.915
Everyone’s been so supportive 


17:41.915 --> 17:43.917
in the congregation. 


17:43.917 --> 17:46.585
And Jehovah
—he has never left me.


17:46.585 --> 17:48.003
Yeah.


17:48.003 --> 17:50.673
I remember your words about courage 
all those years ago. 


17:50.673 --> 17:52.675
I just didn’t want to tell you 


17:52.675 --> 17:54.677
because I knew 
how much it would hurt you.


17:54.677 --> 17:57.000
No. 
Don’t worry.


18:05.605 --> 18:09.000
I just can’t believe it.


18:20.912 --> 18:23.000
I’m so sorry.


18:25.792 --> 18:28.000
He’s been like a second father to me. 


18:32.590 --> 18:36.510
Now it feels like I’ve lost two, 
you know?


18:36.510 --> 18:37.512
I know. 


18:37.512 --> 18:40.000
But he may still come back.


18:42.850 --> 18:45.437
It’s been my earnest wish that he does.


18:45.437 --> 18:48.000
Mine too. 


18:49.148 --> 18:52.000
I love you so much. 


18:58.573 --> 19:02.578
People may leave, 


19:02.578 --> 19:07.041
but Jehovah never will. 


19:07.042 --> 19:10.127
He will never abandon his loyal ones.


19:10.127 --> 19:12.172
“For I am convinced.” 


19:12.172 --> 19:14.674
Remember?


19:14.673 --> 19:17.051
Yeah, I remember.


19:17.052 --> 19:20.000
Mhm. 


19:27.145 --> 19:30.000
Oh, I found this picture 
while cleaning the attic. 


19:35.487 --> 19:38.000
I didn’t know you played the violin.


19:39.198 --> 19:43.000
I lost interest in it, I guess.


19:46.205 --> 19:48.833
Sergei, Irina. 


19:48.833 --> 19:49.833
Good afternoon.


19:49.833 --> 19:50.000
Is it?


19:52.253 --> 19:54.338
We have received your test results. 


19:54.338 --> 19:56.381
I wish I had better news.


19:56.382 --> 19:58.217
It’s OK, go ahead.


19:58.217 --> 19:59.802
We have to operate.


19:59.802 --> 20:01.470
All right. 


20:01.470 --> 20:02.680
But remember, 


20:02.680 --> 20:04.682
no blood!


20:04.682 --> 20:06.475
I will do my best. 


20:06.475 --> 20:09.478
But your best option 
is a blood transfusion. 


20:09.478 --> 20:12.898
Without it, 
your chances are much lower. 


20:12.898 --> 20:14.000
Do you understand 
what I’m trying to say?


20:17.820 --> 20:20.000
Yeah, I understand. 


20:21.573 --> 20:24.576
And thank you, Doctor, 
for doing your best 


20:24.577 --> 20:28.999
and leaving this choice to me. 


20:28.998 --> 20:31.000
My stand is the same.


20:31.000 --> 20:33.002
Very well. 


20:33.002 --> 20:35.672
We’ll schedule the surgery 
for the end of this week. 


20:35.672 --> 20:39.925
And we have to run 
a few more tests this afternoon, 


20:39.925 --> 20:42.637
but I will give you 
a few minutes first.


20:42.637 --> 20:44.000
Thank you.


20:48.935 --> 20:51.000
I love you, Papa.


20:54.232 --> 20:56.692
I know you’ll make it through. 


20:56.692 --> 20:59.695
Mama always said you were strong. 


20:59.695 --> 21:02.000
I love you too, Sweetheart. 


21:06.785 --> 21:11.000
And should something happen, 


21:14.335 --> 21:18.713
keep your hope anchored 
on that wonderful day. 


21:18.713 --> 21:21.550
The day when your mom 


21:21.550 --> 21:24.595
and I will be reunited 


21:24.595 --> 21:27.890
with you in the new world. 


21:27.890 --> 21:30.000
Promise me?


21:38.067 --> 21:41.000
I promise. 


21:42.530 --> 21:45.000
I will see you outside.


21:59.547 --> 22:03.000
We must show Jehovah that we love him first.


22:12.017 --> 22:14.937
“For I am convinced 


22:14.937 --> 22:17.440
“that neither death 


22:17.440 --> 22:19.108
“nor life 


22:19.108 --> 22:20.901
“nor angels 


22:20.902 --> 22:22.487
“nor governments 


22:22.487 --> 22:24.280
“nor things now here 


22:24.280 --> 22:25.657
“nor things to come 


22:25.657 --> 22:27.450
“nor powers 


22:27.450 --> 22:28.910
“nor height 


22:28.910 --> 22:30.368
“nor depth 


22:30.368 --> 22:31.870
“nor any other creation 


22:31.870 --> 22:36.167
“will be able to separate us from God’s love 


22:36.167 --> 22:41.000
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” 


22:43.798 --> 22:55.916
“For I am convinced.”

00:02.898 --> 00:06.000
Darren, 
could you read Psalm 116:12?


00:07.987 --> 00:10.447
It says: 
“With what will I repay Jehovah 


00:10.447 --> 00:12.867
for all the good 
he has done for me?”


00:12.867 --> 00:15.535
How can Psalm 116:12 


00:15.535 --> 00:18.000
give us courage right now? 


00:19.457 --> 00:21.459
Elaine.


00:21.458 --> 00:24.503
Well, Jehovah has always 
done well for us in the past, 


00:24.503 --> 00:28.048
so we can trust he’ll do the same 
for us now and in the future.


00:28.048 --> 00:30.091
Thank you. 


00:30.092 --> 00:32.720
Josh.


00:32.720 --> 00:34.722
That’s so true 


00:34.722 --> 00:37.140
that he has always done 
good things for us. 


00:37.140 --> 00:40.643
But from what I’ve seen, 
what really makes a difference 


00:40.643 --> 00:43.146
is how we respond 
to that goodness. 


00:43.147 --> 00:45.649
For some 
in the congregation, 


00:45.648 --> 00:49.820
those good things 
became a test of their loyalty.


00:49.820 --> 00:51.322
. . . continue with our meeting. 


00:51.322 --> 00:53.157
We have a letter to read. 


00:53.157 --> 00:56.160
“To all congregations 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses: 


00:56.160 --> 00:58.453
“Dear Brothers and Sisters, 


00:58.453 --> 01:01.665
If we are to have Jehovah’s favor 
and blessing as individuals, . . . ”


01:01.665 --> 01:03.458
They found fault 


01:03.458 --> 01:07.755
with what the organization 
was doing or not doing.


01:07.755 --> 01:09.923
“. . .  as we work together 
with you shoulder to shoulder. 


01:09.923 --> 01:11.000
Your brothers, 
The Christian . . . ”


01:17.472 --> 01:19.767
Now, paragraph 12 
gives more detail 


01:19.767 --> 01:22.729
on our adjusted understanding 
of this exciting account. 


01:22.728 --> 01:23.561
Let’s read it. 


01:23.562 --> 01:26.524
Brother Perez, 
please read paragraph 12 for us.


01:26.523 --> 01:27.983
“Soon . . . ”


01:27.983 --> 01:31.986
They criticized any teaching 
or arrangement they didn’t agree with. 


01:31.987 --> 01:34.155
And whether 
they realized it or not, 


01:34.155 --> 01:36.783
their critical attitude 


01:36.783 --> 01:39.160
was eroding their own loyalty, 


01:39.160 --> 01:42.247
and it was affecting others.


01:42.247 --> 01:45.542
Now, before we ask the question 
for that paragraph, 


01:45.542 --> 01:48.000
who would like to read 
Psalm 116:12? 


01:49.922 --> 01:51.924
Kyle, please.


01:51.923 --> 01:54.133
Eventually, 


01:54.133 --> 01:57.386
some were 
no longer our brothers. 


01:57.387 --> 01:59.807
But the more grateful 
our family was 


01:59.807 --> 02:01.809
for what Jehovah gave us, 


02:01.808 --> 02:04.000
the stronger our attachment 
to him became.


02:16.823 --> 02:20.000
So I’ve learned 
to have appreciation for everything, 


02:21.828 --> 02:24.246
everything Jehovah 
has done for us 


02:24.247 --> 02:27.000
and for his organization. 


02:28.127 --> 02:30.254
It’s helped us all 
make it to this point, 


02:30.253 --> 02:32.630
and I’m sure 
it will help us stay loyal 


02:32.630 --> 02:34.000
through the rest 
of the great tribulation.


02:46.853 --> 02:48.855
I know that look. 


02:48.855 --> 02:51.000
You have an experience, 
don’t you?


02:52.608 --> 02:54.653
I do, 
but it’s. . .


02:54.653 --> 02:56.488
It can’t be anything 
I don’t already know!


02:56.488 --> 02:59.031
Well, it’s not exactly 
on my list of things 


02:59.032 --> 03:01.035
to share 
with my little brother.


03:01.035 --> 03:03.037
There’s no pressure, 
Elaine. 


03:03.037 --> 03:06.290
Only tell it if you want to.


03:06.290 --> 03:09.083
It’s OK. 


03:09.083 --> 03:12.253
For me, 


03:12.253 --> 03:14.423
I struggled 
with negative thinking.


03:14.423 --> 03:16.175
No way!


03:16.175 --> 03:19.720
Yeah. 


03:19.720 --> 03:21.763
But I had 
a good friend 


03:21.763 --> 03:24.223
who always helped 
and listened 


03:24.223 --> 03:26.726
and helped me 
learn how to fight it, 


03:26.727 --> 03:29.605
and I’ll always 
be grateful.


03:29.605 --> 03:31.273
I would pray, 


03:31.273 --> 03:35.235
but at times the feelings 
were so strong, 


03:35.235 --> 03:37.000
I didn’t know what to do.


03:40.573 --> 03:42.033
I know. 
I know. 


03:42.033 --> 03:45.161
That must be 
so hard for you.


03:45.162 --> 03:47.790
Will I ever stop 
feeling like this?


03:47.790 --> 03:50.208
Don’t worry 
about if it’s going to stop. 


03:50.208 --> 03:53.545
Let’s talk about ways 
you can take control 


03:53.545 --> 03:54.880
when it happens.


03:54.880 --> 03:56.632
Take control? 


03:56.632 --> 03:57.674
Uh-huh. 


03:57.673 --> 04:00.510
You know, the Scriptures 
tell us as Christians 


04:00.510 --> 04:04.097
that we pray 
for self-control in our actions. 


04:04.097 --> 04:07.017
But do you know, we need 
that same self-control 


04:07.017 --> 04:08.894
for our thoughts?


04:08.893 --> 04:10.978
I never thought about it 
that way before.


04:10.978 --> 04:12.438
Uh-huh. 


04:12.438 --> 04:14.148
The Scriptures tell us how. 


04:14.148 --> 04:15.941
Can we read one together?


04:15.942 --> 04:17.402
Yeah. 
I’d really like that. 


04:17.402 --> 04:20.280
It’s in 2 Corinthians chapter 10, 


04:20.280 --> 04:23.283
in verse number 5. 


04:23.283 --> 04:25.660
You’re going 
to like this scripture, 


04:25.660 --> 04:27.620
chapter 10 and verse 5. 


04:27.620 --> 04:29.665
Do you feel like reading it?


04:29.665 --> 04:31.667
OK.


04:31.667 --> 04:34.629
“For we are overturning 


04:34.628 --> 04:39.131
“reasonings 
and every lofty thing 


04:39.132 --> 04:43.554
“raised up 
against the knowledge of God, 


04:43.553 --> 04:46.931
“and we are bringing 
every thought into captivity 


04:46.932 --> 04:49.350
to make it 
obedient to the Christ.”


04:49.350 --> 04:51.770
Karen showed me 
what it meant 


04:51.770 --> 04:54.523
to bring my negative thoughts 
into captivity 


04:54.523 --> 04:57.191
and then make them 
obedient to the Christ. 


04:57.192 --> 04:59.904
I had to know 
what my negative thoughts were, 


04:59.903 --> 05:03.323
all of them, 
and write them down.


05:03.323 --> 05:05.325
And for each one, 


05:05.325 --> 05:07.368
find what Jehovah thinks, 


05:07.368 --> 05:09.663
and then find scriptures 


05:09.663 --> 05:13.916
that I could remember each time 
that negative thought returned. 


05:13.917 --> 05:17.712
I kept that list with me 
at all times. 


05:17.712 --> 05:20.174
It was a slow process, 


05:20.173 --> 05:24.595
but with Jehovah’s help, 
and with Karen’s, 


05:24.595 --> 05:28.557
I’ve learned how to fight 
the battle against negative thoughts.


05:28.557 --> 05:31.000
Elaine, that was 
so brave of you to share.


05:32.685 --> 05:37.440
Well, just listening 
to everyone else’s stories about loyalty, 


05:37.440 --> 05:41.000
it made me think 
about what I needed to do to stay loyal.


05:42.070 --> 05:44.238
Now, Elaine, 
if you don’t mind me asking, 


05:44.238 --> 05:46.866
how did you see 
that as a test of loyalty?


05:46.867 --> 05:49.160
Well, 
one scripture I memorized, 


05:49.160 --> 05:51.830
1 Corinthians 9:25, says: 


05:51.830 --> 05:54.415
“Now everyone 
competing in a contest 


05:54.415 --> 05:57.335
exercises self-control 
in all things.” 


05:57.335 --> 05:59.547
So if Jehovah is telling me 


05:59.547 --> 06:02.382
I need to exercise self-control 
in all things, 


06:02.382 --> 06:04.384
even my thinking, 


06:04.383 --> 06:06.553
then I’m loyal 
to Jehovah when I try.


06:06.553 --> 06:10.723
Elaine, you are to be commended 
for what you did 


06:10.723 --> 06:13.000
and for seeing the need. . .


06:24.403 --> 06:25.780
Hey.


06:25.780 --> 06:27.073
Shelly!


06:27.073 --> 06:29.000
Hey.


06:31.202 --> 06:32.454
Shelly!


06:32.453 --> 06:34.000
Hey.


06:37.960 --> 06:40.045
I’m so glad 
you guys made it safely.


06:40.045 --> 06:42.463
It’s getting bad 
out there now.


06:42.463 --> 06:45.800
Chris, were you able 
to check on all of the other groups?


06:45.800 --> 06:46.802
Yes, Brother Brown. 


06:46.802 --> 06:49.639
I took a count of each group.


06:49.638 --> 06:52.000
Thank you.


06:53.683 --> 06:55.726
So you’ve been visiting 
each group, 


06:55.727 --> 06:57.729
even with all 
that’s going on out there?


06:57.728 --> 07:00.315
Yes, but there have been 
some scary moments. 


07:00.315 --> 07:01.733
Still, we’re going to shepherd 


07:01.733 --> 07:04.000
all the groups 
for as long as we still can.


07:06.697 --> 07:10.950
The brothers really appreciate 
you making the sacrifice to do this, 


07:10.950 --> 07:14.000
and you too, Shelly, 
for supporting Chris. 


07:18.250 --> 07:20.543
Is everybody OK?


07:20.543 --> 07:21.920
Everyone’s fine. 


07:21.920 --> 07:24.130
They’re getting used 
to doing without, 


07:24.130 --> 07:25.673
some for the first time.


07:25.673 --> 07:29.468
You and Shelly set a good example 
for keeping your life simple.


07:29.468 --> 07:32.638
Thanks, but honestly, 


07:32.638 --> 07:34.766
that wasn’t always the case.


07:34.767 --> 07:36.769
What do you mean?


07:36.768 --> 07:39.020
Well, one day, 


07:39.020 --> 07:42.000
we were watching 
the video We Live a Simple Life, 


07:43.150 --> 07:48.613
and it really helped us 
to take a good look at our lives. 


07:48.613 --> 07:53.000
We were both pioneering 
but still living a comfortable life.


08:00.625 --> 08:02.710
And we started wondering. 


08:02.710 --> 08:06.757
Our love for Jehovah 
moved us to pioneer, 


08:06.757 --> 08:10.000
but could it move us 
to take the next step? 


08:11.177 --> 08:14.264
After meditating 
and praying about it, 


08:14.263 --> 08:16.475
the answer 
became obvious. 


08:16.475 --> 08:18.560
We sold our house, 


08:18.560 --> 08:21.563
found a little apartment 
in the territory, 


08:21.563 --> 08:24.983
took some time to adjust, 


08:24.983 --> 08:28.611
but what it did 
for our relationship with Jehovah 


08:28.612 --> 08:31.407
was so worth it.


08:31.407 --> 08:33.742
With nothing to tie us down, 


08:33.742 --> 08:37.329
we were blessed to go 
to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, 


08:37.328 --> 08:41.000
and then 
that’s when you all met us.


08:42.417 --> 08:44.460
I remember 
when you guys moved here, 


08:44.460 --> 08:47.130
everything you owned 
fit into your car and trailer. 


08:47.130 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.


08:53.345 --> 08:56.013
How much longer 
will this keep up?


08:56.013 --> 08:58.933
Chris, please say 
another prayer for us. 


08:58.933 --> 09:00.935
Then I think we should look 
at some more scriptures 


09:00.935 --> 09:03.000
that will help us.


09:14.992 --> 09:16.452
Do you see anything? 


09:16.452 --> 09:19.454
Do you see any Witnesses? 


09:19.453 --> 09:22.665
Where are they?


09:22.665 --> 09:27.000
Psalm 27 
is really going to help us: 


09:28.172 --> 09:30.882
“Jehovah is my light 
and my salvation. 


09:30.882 --> 09:32.467
“Whom should I fear? 


09:32.467 --> 09:36.054
“Jehovah is the stronghold 
of my life. 


09:36.053 --> 09:37.888
“Whom should I dread? 


09:37.888 --> 09:40.808
“When evil men attacked me 
to devour my flesh, 


09:40.808 --> 09:42.893
“my adversaries and my enemies 


09:42.893 --> 09:45.230
“were the ones 
who stumbled and fell. 


09:45.230 --> 09:48.192
“Though an army 
should set up camp against me, 


09:48.192 --> 09:50.652
“my heart will not fear. 


09:50.652 --> 09:53.989
“Though war 
should break out against me, 


09:53.988 --> 09:57.700
“even then 
I will remain confident. 


09:57.700 --> 09:59.912
“One thing I have asked 
from Jehovah . . . 


09:59.912 --> 10:02.455
“Where would I be 
if I did not have faith 


10:02.455 --> 10:05.708
“that I would see Jehovah’s goodness 
in the land of the living? 


10:05.708 --> 10:07.418
“Hope in Jehovah; 


10:07.418 --> 10:10.046
“be courageous and strong of heart. 


10:10.047 --> 10:11.507
“Yes, 


10:11.507 --> 10:13.717
hope in Jehovah.”


10:13.717 --> 10:15.719
Thank you, 
Brother Brown. 


10:15.718 --> 10:17.886
That psalm is 
very faith-strengthening.


10:17.887 --> 10:19.180
It is, Chris. 


10:19.180 --> 10:21.892
Especially the question 
at verse 13: 


10:21.892 --> 10:25.979
“Where would I be 
if I did not have faith?” 


10:25.978 --> 10:28.648
I think all of us can identify 
with that question.


10:28.648 --> 10:30.191
Absolutely! 


10:30.192 --> 10:32.277
Without faith, 
none of us would be here.


10:32.277 --> 10:34.695
All of us here 


10:34.695 --> 10:37.907
and all of our brothers everywhere 


10:37.907 --> 10:40.160
at this hour, 


10:40.160 --> 10:42.620
we can all feel good 
that we’ve worked hard 


10:42.620 --> 10:46.708
to build faith 
in Jehovah’s promises. 


10:46.708 --> 10:50.420
We’ve all resisted temptations 


10:50.420 --> 10:53.507
to serve God halfheartedly, 


10:53.507 --> 10:57.000
with a date in mind 
or for some selfish reason. 


10:59.678 --> 11:02.056
Instead of just going 
through the motions 


11:02.057 --> 11:04.600
of being a disciple, 


11:04.600 --> 11:06.853
our faith is real. 


11:06.853 --> 11:08.813
It’s genuine. 


11:08.813 --> 11:13.860
Paul called that faith, 
“faith without hypocrisy.” 


11:13.860 --> 11:18.000
And to have seen you build 
that kind of faith 


11:19.407 --> 11:21.785
just warms my heart. 


11:21.785 --> 11:25.163
You studied God’s Word 


11:25.163 --> 11:27.165
to better understand his ways 


11:27.165 --> 11:30.502
and his promises. 


11:30.502 --> 11:33.589
That has made your faith strong today. 


11:33.588 --> 11:35.965
You reasoned 


11:35.965 --> 11:38.343
on Jehovah’s past dealings with you, 


11:38.343 --> 11:40.886
and that has given you strength 


11:40.887 --> 11:44.474
to remain loyal under test. 


11:44.473 --> 11:46.560
And your faith 


11:46.560 --> 11:48.853
has led you here 


11:48.853 --> 11:52.481
as loyal servants of Jehovah, 


11:52.482 --> 11:56.444
confident that Psalm 97:10 


11:56.443 --> 11:59.906
applies to you personally: 


11:59.907 --> 12:04.000
“[Jehovah] is guarding 
the lives of his loyal ones.” 


12:14.545 --> 12:16.000
Where are they? 


12:18.592 --> 12:21.000
Check the basement!


12:25.348 --> 13:11.165
Check that door!

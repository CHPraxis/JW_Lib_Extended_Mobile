00:01 It feels so good
00:03 to be with my family  and friends.
00:06 When I’m with the brothers and sisters  in our congregation,
00:09 it’s the best place  I could be.
00:12 My children and I  are so happy now.
00:15 But it hasn’t always been  this way.
00:23 My parents were missionaries  when my mom got pregnant with me.
00:28 Mom and Dad were very zealous,
00:30 and people just assumed  that I would follow in their footsteps.
00:36 And for a while,  I did.
00:39 I was the model child
00:41 who was always  held up as an example.
00:44 Sure, the attention  boosted my self-confidence,
00:49 but it also put me  under enormous pressure.
00:53 It was like everyone  was watching me,
00:56 and I couldn’t make  a mistake.
01:02 In my mid-teens,
01:04 I began to feel torn.
01:08 I liked the truth,
01:10 but I felt so confined.
01:15 I didn’t tell  anyone how I felt.
01:18 I just pretended  that everything was all right
01:20 and went  through the motions.
01:27 I envied kids  who didn’t have to live
01:30 under so many restrictions.
01:35 And if they got  the truth later in life,
01:37 they got to experience
01:39 the best of both worlds.
01:47 I thought maybe  things would improve
01:49 after I graduated high school.
01:56 But then,  at my new job,
01:59 I met Eric.
02:02 He truly understood me.
02:08 He made me feel special,
02:12 and I loved him.
02:16 I loved him.
02:20 In many ways,
02:22 I felt free.
02:26 For the first time  in my life,
02:28 I could just do  what I wanted.
02:34 It wasn’t long  before our relationship became
02:38 intimate.
02:39 I felt guilt at first,
02:43 but after a while  it just seemed
02:46 that this is what two people  who love each other do.
02:50 And I was willing  to give up everything for him
02:54 —everything.
03:04 Looking back,
03:06 my parents tried hard  to do the right thing
03:09 —to do things Jehovah’s way.
03:14 But because I didn’t have  a hatred for what’s bad,
03:17 I couldn’t see anything wrong
03:19 with my choices.
03:23 This eventually led me  to do things I later regretted.
03:27 I ended up  getting disfellowshipped.
03:30 Sonja Ericsson  has been disfellowshipped.
03:35 It crushed my whole family.
03:48 Later,  my father explained to me
03:50 that I couldn’t remain  in the home
03:52 because I refused  to change my lifestyle.
03:55 He told me I was having
03:57 a negative effect  on my younger brother and sister.
04:00 Then I’m out of this house.
04:07 I was determined  to do what I wanted.
04:11 When I left  home that day,
04:14 all I could think  about was Eric.
04:17 I didn’t even care
04:20 that my parents’ hearts  were breaking.
04:29 I didn’t think  about the devastation
04:31 and disappointment  that I had caused them.
04:38 I blamed my parents  for my situation.
04:42 I even blamed Jehovah.
04:47 My family missed me so much
04:51 even after all I had done.
04:55 What helped them  to remain loyal to Jehovah
04:58 for the many years  that I was disfellowshipped?
05:01 It was the Bible account of Aaron.
05:04 Jehovah directly judged  two of Aaron’s sons
05:08 and put them to death.
05:09 In this case,
05:11 Jehovah asked Aaron  and his family not to mourn
05:14 in order to show  the entire nation
05:16 that they supported  Jehovah’s judgment.
05:20 Mom and Dad saw  that they needed to be loyal
05:22 just like Aaron.
05:25 They loved me
05:28 and wanted me  to come back to Jehovah.
05:30 I tried to contact them.
05:32 I just wanted to talk  and to hear their voice.
05:38 I missed being with my family.
05:41 And they thought  about reaching out to me.
05:45 But they knew that if they  had associated with me
05:48 even a little,  just to check on me,
05:50 that small dose of association
05:53 might have satisfied me.
05:55 It could have made me think
05:58 that there was no need  to return to Jehovah.
06:06 I was disfellowshipped  for more than 15 years.
06:10 I had two children now,
06:12 and as time went by,
06:14 I thought about their future.
06:17 I thought more and more  about returning to Jehovah
06:21 and the congregation.
06:23 But I didn’t feel worthy.
06:26 One day, two elders stopped by  and kindly reminded me
06:31 that Jehovah wants me  to return to him.
06:33 They showed me  Psalm 86:5,
06:37 where it says  that Jehovah is “ready to forgive.”
06:42 I thought about that verse  the rest of the day:
06:45 Jehovah is “ready to forgive.”
06:49 So I decided  to go to the Kingdom Hall
06:52 for the first time in many years.
06:54 . . . a feeling of remorse is healthy.
06:56 It can move us to take positive steps  to correct our mistakes.
06:59 It made me realize
07:01 just how far off track I had gotten.
07:05 I was determined
07:07 to qualify for reinstatement.
07:10 Nearly a year later,
07:12 my reinstatement
07:14 was announced  to the congregation.
07:17 Sonja Ericsson is reinstated
07:19 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
07:25 I was so happy.
07:32 The brothers and sisters  welcomed me very warmly.
07:38 Being back together again
07:40 with my family and Jehovah
07:43 made me feel so good.
07:46 I knew this is  where I needed to be,
07:49 and I didn’t ever want  to leave again.
07:55 But when I’m alone,
07:57 I struggle with whether Jehovah  has really forgiven me.
08:02 One time,  I was so distraught
08:05 that I called my father for help.
08:09 He comforted me  with the words of Isaiah 1:18,
08:13 where Jehovah  says that our sins,
08:16 which are like scarlet  or crimson cloth,
08:18 can become white  like snow.
08:24 Then my father related  the Bible account of Manasseh.
08:27 Manasseh “did on a grand scale
08:31 what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes,  to offend him.”
08:34 He even sacrificed  his sons in false worship.
08:38 Eventually,  Manasseh genuinely repented
08:43 and Jehovah forgave him.
08:47 This Bible account  touched me deeply.
08:52 Now, I have to be willing  to forgive myself.
08:56 If Jehovah was willing
08:59 to forgive  the sins of Manasseh,
09:01 as bad as they were,
09:03 surely he has forgiven me.
09:07 What a blessing  to understand
09:10 that Jehovah forgives  in a large way,
09:14 and now  I’m truly happy!

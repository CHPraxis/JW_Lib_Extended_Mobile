00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must know Jehovah well.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means knowing his thinking on matters.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should welcome such an examination

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make any necessary changes.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read 1 Corinthians 15:33 together.

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:24.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we read:

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As familiar as that principle is,

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you think of an area in your life

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it’s difficult to apply?

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, John.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s not your usual,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:45.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there’s no one
to entertain those clients tonight.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So can you do it?
Thanks.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I have . . .

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great.

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until then,
it wasn’t my usual thing.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I need to support my family.

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these aren’t really my friends.

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can handle it.

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think.

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . we’re faced with bad associations

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in subtle ways.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This may require us to ask additional questions

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ourselves.

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:36.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we letting in bad association

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through social media?

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we can think
of another way bad association . . .

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think so

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:50.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except for some friends
from my old congregation.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not doing so well spiritually.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I stay connected
and see what they’re doing,

00:01:58.847 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe I can help them.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . can affect us.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s something very specific.

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:08.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bad association is coming from a place

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we never expected.

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only join games with Witness friends I know.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:28.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they connect with people I don’t know

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who pick games I’m not sure we should play.

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe my friends know them,

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they’re probably OK.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is vital that we avoid bad associations.

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:52.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we resume in Psalm 26 . . .

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that talk didn’t apply to me.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can I really handle bad association?

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:05.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I take a stand, I may lose my job.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:10.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s being anxious about tomorrow.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So never be anxious and say,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What are we to eat?’ or,

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What are we to drink?’ or,

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What are we to wear?’”

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows I need a job.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:31.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I need to set a good example

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for when my children face bad association.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians 15:33.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friends’ posts are getting worse

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:50.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—their pictures and comments.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, 2 Timothy 2:16.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:59.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But reject empty speeches

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that violate what is holy,

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:06.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for they will lead to more and more ungodliness.”

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:10.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m letting them share 
“empty speeches” with me online.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will try to help them while I still can,

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:18.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but following their posts is not the way to do it.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Mom what’s been happening when I game

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my friends.

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave me good ideas on what to look for

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:31.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Research Guide.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christian Life.”

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Association.”

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:40.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is Your Recreation Beneficial?”

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who Are My Companions?”

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who are the ones I want
to share my leisure time with?”

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does he have the same Bible-based
values and morals that I have?”

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good question.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t even know who they are sometimes.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 119:63 says:

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:08.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am a friend of all who fear you

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of those who keep your orders.”

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I only know them online,

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:17.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t know if they fear Jehovah.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn in our Bibles to the book

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:27.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1 Timothy 1:5

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice how it reads:

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:34.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Really, the objective of this instruction

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is love out of a clean heart

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and out of a good conscience

00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and out of faith without hypocrisy.”

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We train our conscience

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:50.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Bible principles
that reveal Jehovah’s thinking.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There may be several principles needed

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:55.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our unique problem.

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:57.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we find

00:05:57.815 --> 00:05:59.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply them,

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:04.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll enjoy a clean heart and a good conscience.

00:01 Seriously?  You’re going?
00:05 Come on, Nadia.  It’s just a party.
00:07 It’ll be fun!
00:08 I don’t know, Phoebe.
00:10 Look, I’ve been  at Jessica’s parties before.
00:12 It was totally fine.
00:14 Shh!
00:16 Wait, you’ve been  to her house before?
00:18 Yeah, for another party.  It was great.
00:21 Nothing bad happened.
00:23 And guess who’s going  to be there?
00:27 Who?
00:27 Hey, Nadia.
00:29 Hey, Jonah.
00:30 Hmm,
00:31 come for a little bit,  and if you feel uncomfortable,
00:33 you can leave.
00:36 Even if I said yes,
00:38 my parents  would never go for it.
00:40 They don’t have to know.  Just sneak out.
00:42 That’s what I do.  So how about it?
00:44 Have a little fun!
00:46 . . . how 1 Timothy 2:14  describes Adam:
00:52 “Also, Adam was not deceived,
00:56 “but the woman  was thoroughly deceived
01:00 and became a transgressor.”
01:05 Adam just accepted Eve’s offer.
01:07 He didn’t think it through.
01:10 If I go to this party, what could happen?
01:19 Hey, Nadia.
01:22 I can’t go to this party.
01:24 The scripture says  that Adam wasn’t deceived,
01:28 but Eve was.
01:31 Adam didn’t even try  to help readjust Eve’s thinking.
01:35 So excited!
01:37 It’s not enough for me to not go.
01:40 I need to talk to Phoebe
01:42 and help her see  why she shouldn’t go either.
01:50 I know you’re disappointed.
01:53 I’m sure the elders  must have their reasons.
01:55 I’m sure they do.
01:57 What does that mean?
01:59 Nothing.  Just forget it, OK?
02:08 Carl?
02:09 Why would the elders  decide that about your case?
02:12 It doesn’t make any sense!
02:15 Not that I’m surprised.
02:21 Uh, sure, I’ll see you tomorrow,
02:24 and we’ll sort this thing out together.
02:27 Don’t worry.  I’ll help you fix this.
02:35 If I were an elder,  I would never treat people like this.
02:44 What were they thinking?
02:48 “. . . and 50 men to run before him.”
02:51 What was Absalom thinking?
02:55 Wait.  What am I thinking?
03:00 Absalom turned people away from the king,
03:03 telling them he was more just,
03:06 more understanding.
03:09 If I take sides with Carl tomorrow,  what could happen?
03:12 They don’t even belong!  They call themselves Christians and elders?
03:15 And they want to control everybody!
03:17 . . . what’s wrong with the elders too.
03:18 They need to be out.
03:19 Really?
03:19 ...because they’re always being judgemental.
03:20 Why would they do that?  Why?
03:22 Oh, my goodness!
03:25 I don’t know all the facts.
03:27 And even if I did, it doesn’t matter.
03:30 I can’t let my pride
03:32 get in the way of my loyalty to Jehovah.
03:35 Absalom could have avoided  all those bad things
03:38 if he only stayed content.
03:41 I need to ask Jehovah’s help
03:43 to root out those bad things in my heart
03:46 so I can stay content.
03:52 Brother Elliott, my ex-husband  won’t stop calling me.
03:56 And every time he does call,
03:58 he just brings up  all of these emotions . . .
04:02 You got a text message, Honey.
04:04 Oh, can you see who it’s from?
04:06 Yeah.  It’s Kaitlin.
04:08 She’s just thanking you  for listening to her today.
04:11 She seems to be talking  with you a lot lately.
04:13 Is everything OK?
04:14 Oh, yeah.  She’s just going through some issues.
04:17 Being newly baptized and all,  she likes to bounce things off the elders.
04:21 But does it  always have to be with you?
04:24 Of course not,
04:26 for some reason she  feels comfortable talking to me.
04:32 Have I ever given you any reason  to be concerned over the way
04:35 I shepherd sisters?
04:37 No, never.
04:38 So don’t worry.
04:40 I’m just giving her time to get familiar  with the other elders on the body.
04:44 OK,
04:45 I’m going to get ready for bed.
04:47 OK, I’m going to stay up for a bit  and work on my talk.
04:49 OK.
04:52 Avoiding the trap of overconfidence.
04:55 Solomon had served Jehovah his whole life,
04:58 but with time,  he started relying on his own thinking.
05:02 It’s Kaitlin again.
05:05 “Can you talk?”
05:07 Sure I can.
05:09 Wait a minute.
05:10 I do want to help Kaitlin,  but if I’m not careful . . .
05:23 How did I not see this?
05:25 I guess I just thought . . .
05:27 and that’s the problem:
05:30 relying on my own thinking.
05:39 Hey, Mike, it’s Terrance.
05:41 Sorry to call you so late,  but Kaitlin just texted.
05:45 Yeah.
05:47 She’s been having a rough time lately.
05:49 Do you think you and I  can have a conference call with her
05:52 and plan a shepherding visit?
05:55 Great.  Thanks a lot.
06:01 Sweet!
06:03 Yeah, it’s fresh, ain’t it?
06:05 I can make calls.  I can send texts.
06:08 I can do anything, all from right here.
06:11 Whoa! Cool!  But how did you get the money?
06:14 You know, last time I checked,  you didn’t have a job.
06:17 There are other ways  of making money, Son.
06:19 Like what?
06:20 Like online betting.
06:22 What?  You serious?
06:24 Yeah, I’m serious.
06:26 I bet on sports teams.
06:28 It’s easy.  It’s instant money,
06:30 but best of all—private.
06:32 No one ever has to know.
06:44 Here’s the link.
06:47 I wasn’t even thinking about this stuff
06:49 until I saw Julian’s new watch.
06:51 Now it’s all I think about.
06:55 Let me check something first.
06:59 Gambling.
07:01 Gambling is a form of greed?
07:04 Whoa!
07:05 Judas Iscariot?
07:08 Started off good, gave in to greed,
07:11 consumed him,
07:13 betrayed Jesus.
07:16 If I sign up for online gambling,  what could happen?
07:22 Yes!
07:26 “Flee from these things.
07:28 But pursue righteousness,  godly devotion . . .”
07:37 If I sign up for this,
07:39 I could lose a lot of money,
07:41 or worse yet,
07:43 I could win, and the love of money
07:46 could easily consume me,
07:48 like it did Judas.
07:50 I could fall right out of the truth!
07:52 Judas could have sought help from others.
07:55 I’m going to talk to my parents  about this whole thing.

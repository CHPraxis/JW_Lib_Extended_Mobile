00:06.565 --> 00:09.315
My name is Akil. 


00:09.315 --> 00:13.000
When I was 18, 
my family moved to a new city. 


00:14.993 --> 00:18.398
It was bad enough 
leaving my friends behind. 


00:18.398 --> 00:19.998
But now, 


00:19.998 --> 00:23.000
I wasn’t sure 
if I could make new ones.


00:27.782 --> 00:30.000
My parents seemed really happy. 


00:32.198 --> 00:34.971
I didn’t want 
to make them feel bad 


00:34.972 --> 00:38.000
by telling them how I really felt.


00:39.782 --> 00:43.000
The new school 
wasn’t much better 


00:49.298 --> 00:52.000
until I met Cameron. 


00:53.425 --> 00:56.000
He seemed 
like a pretty cool guy. 


00:59.580 --> 01:04.000
Soon, his friends 
became my friends.


01:07.117 --> 01:09.130
. . . something that David 
believed was true, 


01:09.130 --> 01:12.865
he actually proved it 
by the association that he kept.


01:12.865 --> 01:14.928
We think about one 
of the closest friendships 


01:14.928 --> 01:16.471
recorded in the Scriptures, 


01:16.472 --> 01:19.975
and it was 
that of David and Jonathan. 


01:19.975 --> 01:22.185
What was it that David and Jonathan 
shared in common? 


01:22.185 --> 01:24.688
It wasn’t their age.


01:24.688 --> 01:26.856
Akil, 
you were texting in the meeting.


01:26.857 --> 01:29.109
I shouldn’t have sent the text. 


01:29.108 --> 01:30.756
I’m sorry. 


01:30.757 --> 01:34.155
But Cameron is a good person. 


01:34.155 --> 01:36.742
He might even study one day.


01:36.742 --> 01:38.332
I understand that, Akil. 


01:38.332 --> 01:41.299
But we all have to be careful 
with how much time 


01:41.298 --> 01:43.790
we spend with people 
that don’t love Jehovah. 


01:43.790 --> 01:46.252
See, 
their values are just different. 


01:46.252 --> 01:49.129
You know 
what Proverbs 13:20 says: 


01:49.128 --> 01:51.173
‘Walk with those who are wise.’ 


01:51.173 --> 01:54.216
So why don’t you seek out 
friends who love Jehovah? 


01:54.217 --> 01:57.095
And you will make friends 
that last a lifetime.


01:57.095 --> 01:58.597
How am I supposed to do that? 


01:58.597 --> 02:01.000
There’s no one my age 
in the congregation.


02:02.142 --> 02:04.899
Akil, good friends 
can come from unexpected places.


02:04.898 --> 02:07.000
Mom, 
I had good friends


02:08.565 --> 02:11.000
—back home.


02:15.697 --> 02:18.000
We all felt bad that night.


02:26.708 --> 02:28.798
The next day, 


02:28.798 --> 02:31.000
Cameron posted pictures 
of a party he had. 


02:32.998 --> 02:36.000
My parents were right. 


02:38.348 --> 02:41.515
I broke off my association 
with Cameron 


02:41.515 --> 02:43.392
and his friends, 


02:43.392 --> 02:45.394
but I still felt 


02:45.393 --> 02:48.406
lost.


02:48.407 --> 02:50.440
Hi, Akil? 


02:50.440 --> 02:52.865
Do you have 
field service plans for Saturday?


02:52.865 --> 02:54.632
Ah, no.


02:54.632 --> 02:55.862
Good. 
Now you do. 


02:55.862 --> 02:58.000
I’ll see you 
at the 9:30 a.m. meeting, OK?


03:17.968 --> 03:20.428
After service, 


03:20.428 --> 03:23.000
Max had the group 
over for refreshments.


03:25.183 --> 03:27.936
Did you take these?


03:27.937 --> 03:29.015
Do you like them?


03:29.015 --> 03:30.147
Yeah.


03:30.147 --> 03:32.690
My wife, 
she was always the photographer. 


03:32.690 --> 03:34.777
She loved photography. 


03:34.777 --> 03:37.362
And then one anniversary 
she went out and bought me a camera, 


03:37.362 --> 03:41.790
and from that moment on, 
I was hooked too.


03:41.790 --> 03:43.910
Time flies so quickly. 


03:43.910 --> 03:48.498
It’s hard to believe 
she passed away 12 years ago now.


03:48.498 --> 03:49.541
I’m sorry.


03:49.542 --> 03:51.000
It’s OK.


03:51.000 --> 03:52.878
But you still take pictures?


03:52.878 --> 03:55.648
I do. 
I really enjoy photography. 


03:55.648 --> 03:57.673
There’s something about being close 


03:57.673 --> 04:00.165
to Jehovah’s creation. 


04:00.165 --> 04:02.332
It reminds me 


04:02.332 --> 04:06.000
that we’re never really alone, 
you know?


04:10.465 --> 04:14.858
Good friends can come 
from unexpected places 


04:14.858 --> 04:17.318
and unexpected ages. 


04:17.318 --> 04:19.946
As I spent more time with Max, 


04:19.947 --> 04:24.000
I realized it was 
just like David and Jonathan. 


04:25.598 --> 04:27.703
Their friendship was based, 


04:27.703 --> 04:31.000
not on age, 
but on their love for Jehovah. 


04:32.723 --> 04:35.000
And they helped each other.


04:41.040 --> 04:42.677
And with Max’s help, 


04:42.677 --> 04:45.264
I was able to keep 
a good spiritual routine 


04:45.263 --> 04:47.265
without interruption. 


04:47.265 --> 04:49.768
Although we weren’t the same age, 


04:49.768 --> 04:52.781
Max became my good friend. 


04:52.782 --> 04:55.994
I just needed to see 
what was right 


04:55.993 --> 05:06.473
in front of me.

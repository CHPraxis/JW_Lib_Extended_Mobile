00:11.573 --> 00:13.408
Mom, something’s burning.


00:13.408 --> 00:15.118
Got it! 


00:15.118 --> 00:16.411
Did you brush your teeth yet?


00:16.412 --> 00:17.914
Ah, Mom.


00:17.913 --> 00:19.498
No “ah, Mom.” 
We’re running late. 


00:19.498 --> 00:20.498
Come on, 
go brush your teeth. 


00:20.498 --> 00:22.166
Aiden, 
are you dressed? 


00:22.167 --> 00:23.127
Come here, Baby. 


00:23.127 --> 00:25.587
Your shirt is inside out, 
Aiden. 


00:25.587 --> 00:26.755
OK. 


00:26.755 --> 00:31.000
Madison, we have to be 
out the door in five minutes. 


00:34.012 --> 00:36.057
And your other arm. 


00:36.057 --> 00:37.559
Are we good?


00:37.558 --> 00:38.183
Uh-huh.


00:38.183 --> 00:39.000
Let’s go!


00:40.643 --> 00:41.770
OK. 


00:41.770 --> 00:43.813
Now, one more time, 
what did we learn 


00:43.813 --> 00:45.690
from what we read today 
in the daily text?


00:45.690 --> 00:46.983
It was about Asaph, 
right?


00:46.983 --> 00:48.818
Very good. 
And?


00:48.818 --> 00:51.655
We don’t want to envy people 
that don’t love Jehovah.


00:51.655 --> 00:52.530
Very good. 


00:52.530 --> 00:56.160
So question, 
when kids at school do things 


00:56.160 --> 00:59.580
that look like fun but we know 
that Jehovah doesn’t like, 


00:59.580 --> 01:01.165
what should we do?


01:01.165 --> 01:02.123
Pray.


01:02.123 --> 01:03.458
Perfect. 
You’re so smart! 


01:03.458 --> 01:06.000
OK, come on. 
Let’s go to the train.


01:10.215 --> 01:11.675
There are 
five more rooms to clean. 


01:11.675 --> 01:12.760
The ones that are circled.


01:12.760 --> 01:14.052
Oh, OK. 
All right, thanks.


01:14.052 --> 01:17.000
Sure.


01:36.992 --> 01:37.827
Hey, Heather.


01:37.827 --> 01:39.620
Hey, Simmone, I just made some tea. 
Would you like some?


01:39.620 --> 01:41.247
Yes, thank you.


01:41.247 --> 01:42.000
Sure.


01:44.417 --> 01:45.542
How’s your day going?


01:45.542 --> 01:46.044
Good.


01:46.043 --> 01:46.418
Good.


01:46.418 --> 01:47.711
Did you see Laura’s pictures?


01:47.712 --> 01:49.087
No. 
Pictures of what?


01:49.087 --> 01:51.174
Her vacation. 
It looks so nice!


01:51.173 --> 01:52.048
That’s great.


01:52.048 --> 01:54.175
Oh, did I tell you? 
I’m going away too.


01:54.175 --> 01:55.135
Where are you going?


01:55.135 --> 01:57.387
My boyfriend bought me 
an all-inclusive vacation package.


01:57.387 --> 02:00.682
An island retreat sounds 
really great right now.


02:00.682 --> 02:02.852
Yeah. Are you going anywhere, 
taking any trips?


02:02.852 --> 02:05.854
No, you know, with the kids, 
I can’t really afford to do much.


02:05.853 --> 02:06.771
Sorry, just excuse me.


02:06.772 --> 02:09.000
Yeah, sure.


02:10.192 --> 02:14.405
Sometimes, 
I just feel so trapped. 


02:14.405 --> 02:16.907
I know I need 
to keep my life simple 


02:16.907 --> 02:20.327
and stay focused 
on spiritual things, 


02:20.327 --> 02:22.747
but it just seems like 


02:22.747 --> 02:25.207
I’m constantly seeing
others around me 


02:25.207 --> 02:28.460
being rewarded with nice things, 


02:28.460 --> 02:31.255
and I just feel forgotten. 


02:31.255 --> 02:33.298
Hmm, 


02:33.298 --> 02:36.301
when we discussed 
the text this morning on envy, 


02:36.302 --> 02:39.722
I never thought 
I’d be applying it to myself. 


02:39.722 --> 02:42.557
“For I became envious


02:42.557 --> 02:46.437
. . . when I would see 
the peace of the wicked.” 


02:46.437 --> 02:49.399
What did Aiden say Asaph did 


02:49.398 --> 02:51.483
to overcome his envy? 


02:51.483 --> 02:56.113
“But as for me, 
drawing near to God is good for me. 


02:56.113 --> 03:00.158
I have made 
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge.” 


03:00.158 --> 03:02.201
That’s right. 


03:02.202 --> 03:03.704
He prayed. 


03:03.703 --> 03:06.000
And that’s exactly 
what I need to do.


03:20.012 --> 03:24.517
“Since even the most loyal 
and devoted Christians are imperfect, 


03:24.517 --> 03:26.560
“when an appointed servant 
makes a mistake,


03:26.560 --> 03:29.772
“let us continue to do 
‘all things free from murmurings.’ 


03:29.772 --> 03:31.399
(Philippians 2:14)”


03:31.398 --> 03:32.900
Due to unforeseen 
track maintenance, 


03:32.900 --> 03:35.818
there will be delays 
on trains 5, 6, and 7. 


03:35.818 --> 03:38.946
All uptown stops can expect 
30- to 35-minute delays.


03:38.947 --> 03:40.449
Does that mean 
we’re going to be late?


03:40.448 --> 03:42.951
Yes. 
Yes, we are. 


03:42.952 --> 03:45.000
Finish that.


03:51.293 --> 03:53.295
I really appreciate 


03:53.295 --> 03:55.422
the scripture 
because it helps us to guard 


03:55.422 --> 03:57.800
against the spirit of the world.


03:57.800 --> 04:00.635
And how might 
these scriptures help us 


04:00.635 --> 04:02.000
in choosing our entertainment? 


04:03.555 --> 04:06.000
Sister Edwards?


04:09.937 --> 04:12.730
Vampires, 
werewolves, witches 


04:12.730 --> 04:15.233
are all associated 
with the spirit world, 


04:15.233 --> 04:18.320
so if our entertainment 
involves any of these, 


04:18.320 --> 04:22.698
we might meditate 
on Psalm 97:10 and ask ourselves, 


04:22.698 --> 04:25.000
‘Do I really hate what Jehovah hates?’


04:28.080 --> 04:31.375
Sister Thorne. 


04:31.375 --> 04:34.000
And let’s hear 
from young Sister Winkler. 


04:35.503 --> 04:38.048
Any other thoughts 
before we move on? 


04:38.048 --> 04:41.000
Ah, Sister Perez.


04:43.803 --> 04:45.096
Excuse me. 


04:45.097 --> 04:46.849
Hey, Simmone, 
how are you doing?


04:46.848 --> 04:47.933
Good. 
How are you, Mattias?


04:47.933 --> 04:48.516
Good. 


04:48.517 --> 04:50.477
You know, we have 
the congregation cleaning tonight. 


04:50.477 --> 04:52.479
Any chance you might be able 
to take care of the bathrooms?


04:52.478 --> 04:54.146
Uh.


04:54.147 --> 04:58.819
Sure, Mattias, 
there’s nothing I’d love to do more.


04:58.818 --> 05:02.488
It’s not like I don’t do enough 
of this all day, every day.


05:02.488 --> 05:04.825
Oh, and did I mention 
how much I appreciate 


05:04.825 --> 05:07.995
all the brothers 
not calling on me tonight?


05:07.995 --> 05:10.122
Oh, Honey.
I’m so sorry.


05:10.122 --> 05:12.124
Mommy didn’t mean that.


05:12.123 --> 05:13.083
It’s OK, Mom. 


05:13.083 --> 05:14.458
I know you’re tired.


05:14.458 --> 05:16.461
That’s no excuse. 


05:16.462 --> 05:19.000
Here, let’s go sit together.


05:21.633 --> 05:25.595
I was just frustrated; 
I never should have said that. 


05:25.595 --> 05:28.015
You know, on the train, 
I was actually listening 


05:28.015 --> 05:30.517
to an article about not murmuring 
against the elders, 


05:30.517 --> 05:32.519
even if they make mistakes. 


05:32.518 --> 05:36.146
I guess I should’ve meditated 
on that a little more. 


05:36.147 --> 05:37.607
Hmm. 


05:37.607 --> 05:40.277
Madison, 
I want you to know 


05:40.277 --> 05:43.030
that our elders 
work very, very hard. 


05:43.030 --> 05:44.532
Do you remember last week 


05:44.532 --> 05:46.867
when they came 
for that shepherding visit?


05:46.867 --> 05:50.245
Yeah, Mattias and his wife 
brought groceries the next day.


05:50.245 --> 05:53.748
That’s right, 
they brought us groceries. 


05:53.748 --> 05:56.460
The elders care about us so much, 


05:56.460 --> 05:58.503
and they truly deserve our respect. 


05:58.503 --> 06:00.713
I never should have said that. 


06:00.713 --> 06:02.715
You understand?


06:02.715 --> 06:03.467
I understand.


06:03.467 --> 06:04.677
OK, good girl. 


06:04.677 --> 06:05.844
All right, 
you know what, 


06:05.843 --> 06:07.678
why don’t we finish up 
the mirrors together? 


06:07.678 --> 06:08.555
Sound good?


06:08.555 --> 06:09.138
All right.


06:09.138 --> 06:11.000
OK.


06:12.392 --> 06:15.000
I’ll get it for you.


06:35.040 --> 06:37.208
Love you, Baby. 
Have a good night.


06:37.208 --> 06:39.000
Good night. 


06:40.253 --> 06:42.000
See you in the morning.


07:06.028 --> 07:09.490
There’s nothing on. 


07:09.490 --> 07:10.533
Wait! 


07:10.533 --> 07:14.370
This is the show everyone 
at work has been talking about. 


07:14.370 --> 07:17.000
It’s supposed to be great, 


07:20.168 --> 07:24.000
but it looks really spiritistic.


07:25.590 --> 07:28.093
Vampires, 
werewolves, witches 


07:28.093 --> 07:30.636
are all associated 
with the spirit world, 


07:30.637 --> 07:34.224
so if our entertainment 
involves any of these, 


07:34.223 --> 07:38.395
we might meditate 
on Psalm 97:10 and ask ourselves, 


07:38.395 --> 07:41.940
‘Do I really hate what Jehovah hates?’


07:41.940 --> 07:43.858
Hmm. 


07:43.858 --> 07:46.110
It doesn’t look that bad, 


07:46.110 --> 07:49.657
but I know Jehovah 
hates spiritism, 


07:49.657 --> 07:52.242
and I want to hate 
what Jehovah hates. 


07:52.242 --> 07:54.494
That verse also says, 


07:54.493 --> 07:57.121
‘Jehovah will guard his loyal ones.’ 


07:57.122 --> 08:00.375
I want to show him that I’m 


08:00.375 --> 08:15.703
one of “his loyal ones.”

00:10 Hey, Buddy!
00:11 How was school?
00:16 That’s my Dad, Grayson,
00:18 and my older brother, Dylan.
00:22 Hey, Bro!
00:23 We’re going to play ball.  You want to come?
00:25 No thanks.
00:28 Is he OK?
00:29 He normally loves to talk about school.
00:32 He didn’t want to talk about school today.
00:37 It wasn’t my worst day at school —but pretty close.
00:42 It all started first thing this morning.
00:47 Everyone was signing a birthday card  for one of our classmates, Lucas.
00:51 Do you want to sign  the birthday card for Lucas?
00:53 He just got home from being  at the hospital for cancer treatments.
00:55 No thanks.
00:56 I’m a Jehovah’s Witness,  and I don’t celebrate birthdays.
00:59 What?
01:00 Hum?
01:01 That’s rude.
01:02 Come on, sign it!
01:06 You guys, you guys, Aiden—
01:09 My teacher said that Lucas  may not come back to school for a long time.
01:13 I felt so bad he was sick.
01:24 Aiden, Aiden, can you think about it?
01:34 The thing is, I did want to sign the card.
01:40 Lucas was one of the nicest people  in my class.
01:45 Maybe I can just sign it.
01:49 I mean, it’s not like I’m going to a birthday party.
01:58 Hey, little man.  How are you doing?
02:01 Yeah?
02:02 Mom said you had a rough day today.
02:04 When Dad came in,  I told him everything that happened.
02:09 I know from the Bible  that it’s wrong to celebrate birthdays.
02:14 But is signing the card really a big deal?
02:19 Dad said my question was a good one.
02:22 Then he showed me a scripture.
02:24 Do you want to get your Bible for me?
02:25 Let’s look in Ephesians 5.
02:27 Ephesians 5:10:
02:29 “Keep on making sure  of what is acceptable to the Lord.”
02:35 He said,  “We all have to keep making sure
02:38 “of what’s acceptable to Jehovah
02:40 because Satan is a master at tricking us.”
02:45 Then he used the example of Aaron.
02:52 The Israelites asked Aaron  to make them a god.
03:00 So Aaron made a golden calf,
03:03 thinking that it could represent Jehovah.
03:06 He told the people:
03:08 “There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.”
03:13 But true worship  was being mixed with false worship,
03:17 and Jehovah was not happy.
03:21 And many were punished.
03:26 That example helped me a lot.
03:30 I know birthdays are wrong  because the Bible teaches
03:34 that they are not approved by Jehovah.
03:38 But we don’t want to be confused like Aaron
03:40 and try to mix true and false worship.
03:43 All right, let’s go talk to Mom.
03:45 We want to make Jehovah happy.
03:51 So Dad said,  “It’s always good to ask,
03:55 How would Jehovah feel if I did this?”
03:57 I still didn’t sign the card,  but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.
04:24 Can I go see Lucas?
04:26 Yeah.  Go ahead, Buddy.
04:26 He’s right over there.
04:38 How have you been feeling?
04:40 A little better.
04:42 And then I realized something:
04:45 Instead of celebrating one day,
04:48 I could share with Lucas our hope
04:50 of living forever  on a beautiful paradise earth.
04:54 So there will be no sickness ever again.
04:59 They will build houses and have food.

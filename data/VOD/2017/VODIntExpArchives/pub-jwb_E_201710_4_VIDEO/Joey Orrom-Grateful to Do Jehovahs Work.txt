00:05 I had the privilege for two years
00:07 of sitting at the same table as Sister Orrom for morning worship.
00:10 She expected nothing and appreciated
00:13 everything that you did for her.
00:14 Sister Orrom was affectionately known as Joey.
00:18 And if you take the “e” out of Joey,
00:20 you’re left with the English word “joy,”
00:23 and that summed her up.
00:25 My impression of Joey when I first met her
00:27 was here is this frail old lady.
00:30 But then when you started to speak to Joey,
00:33 you were tapping into a tremendous depth.
00:36 About the age of 20,
00:38 round about that time,
00:39 I had the heavenly calling.
00:41 That was a big battle.
00:42 I couldn’t understand why Jehovah would use a person like me.
00:46 And when I was 21,
00:49 I got into pioneering, in 1939.
00:51 But the police were after me
00:54 because I wouldn’t join the armed forces, and I was tried under a new act.
00:57 And they kept taking me into a side room and saying,
01:00 “If you will say you are not connected with Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:03 not connected with the Watch Tower, you’ll have a walk away.”
01:06 I said: “I am connected with the Watch Tower.
01:08 I’m proud to be connected with the Watch Tower.”
01:10 And they said, “Then they are directing you.”
01:14 I said, “No, my stand of not doing as you wish is my own personal stand.”
01:19 So this went on.
01:20 In the end, they sent me to prison just for two months
01:23 and then let me out.
01:24 I partnered with another sister,
01:26 and she and I went to Northern Ireland
01:29 and pioneered there for 18 months.
01:31 And it was in Northern Ireland that we had our call to Gilead.
01:33 In 1948, Joey was invited to Gilead,
01:36 and that was the 11th class.
01:39 It left an impression on me,  which I will never ever, ever forget.
01:42 You pick up that spirit  of good behavior, of love.
01:46 It’s something that leaves its mark, or it should.
01:48 It has left its mark on me —very, very much so.
01:52 One thing Brother Knorr impressed on us:
01:54 “You’ll be three years on your assignment before you really love it.”
01:58 And it was true  because it was a hard assignment.
02:01 After Gilead,  she was assigned to be a missionary
02:05 in Dublin, in the Irish Republic.
02:07 That was the time when Catholic priests
02:09 used to organize mobs against the pioneers.
02:12 She was full of joy,  but that didn’t mean to say
02:15 that she’d had an easy life.
02:16 We never went out from door to door without being mobbed
02:19 and attacked and beaten up and thrown around.
02:22 And you could only do a few houses in a row,
02:25 and you’d have to get away very quickly.
02:27 But we made a very good name.
02:28 People got to know we were completely neutral.
02:31 They chose four of us to work the business property,
02:34 and I got some studies going in their offices.
02:37 But one place I went into, I walked the length of this draper shop,
02:41 and I asked if I could go into the manager’s office.
02:44 As I went in, I didn’t say a word.
02:46 I didn’t open my mouth and even say good morning,
02:49 but this man stood up, and he said, “Russellite!”
02:52 And he took hold of me by the scruff of my neck
02:55 and the seat of my pants, and he lifted me up
02:57 and he carried me the length of the store.
03:00 Well, like a silly one, I should’ve gone heavy on him, you see.
03:05 But instead of that,  I let my legs paddle
03:07 and I was hanging onto my book bag, not wanting to lose it.
03:10 And when he got  to the front door, the staff,
03:13 their eyes were absolutely aghast at what was happening.
03:15 He opened his front door and threw me out, literally.
03:18 And I went zoom! just managed to go zoom!
03:21 And one of the brothers was passing,
03:24 and he caught me —caught me steady—
03:26 and said,  “Whatever is going on?”
03:28 And I couldn’t stop laughing.
03:30 To me it was very, very funny.
03:32 The rest were so cross about it, but I wasn’t at all cross.
03:35 I thought it was quite hilarious.
03:37 I could see myself being carried through this shop sky-high.
03:40 Things like that happened.
03:42 These experiences  did not dampen her zeal.
03:45 She always retained that missionary spirit.
03:48 I first met Joey
03:50 when I was commuting to Bethel
03:51 in the infirmary.
03:53 She was sitting on that old-fashioned chair with this huge Bible,
03:57 and she stayed there hours reading the Bible,
04:01 praying to Jehovah.
04:02 Often, when you came in,  she’d be in the middle of Bible reading.
04:05 And she’d be saying something like,
04:07 “Daniel has just been thrown into the lion’s den!”
04:09 or “Oh, Jehovah is really angry.
04:11 He’s thundering from the heavens!”
04:13 And it made me think, ‘Wow!
04:14 ‘She must have read the Bible so many times,
04:16 but every time it was as if it was happening right in front of her.’
04:19 Right up until she became incapacitated,
04:23 she was conducting Bible studies
04:25 and helping people to come to know Jehovah.
04:28 She was looking forward to her heavenly reward.
04:31 And for her that was the culmination
04:34 of a life of joy in Jehovah’s service
04:36 and that she was just transferring to her next assignment.
04:40 I’m very, very grateful for work.
04:42 In fact, often in my prayers,
04:44 I’ll pray to Jehovah that I’ll have some good work to do today.
04:47 I’m very grateful to have work to do.

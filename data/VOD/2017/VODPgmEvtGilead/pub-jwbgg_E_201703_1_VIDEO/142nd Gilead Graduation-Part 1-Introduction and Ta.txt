00:01 Well, dear brothers and sisters,  it is my very great pleasure
00:05 to welcome you all  to this graduation program
00:08 of the 142nd class
00:11 of the Watchtower Bible School  of Gilead.
00:21 We have satellite locations  tied in
00:23 across the United States  branch territory,
00:26 as well as our dear brothers  in Canada and, of course, in time,
00:29 we expect that this will also be shown
00:31 to our brothers  via JW Broadcasting.
00:34 So, what a large audience  will benefit
00:36 from our program today!
00:38 Well, you students  are truly loved.
00:41 I checked with the Bethel Office  just yesterday
00:43 and found out  that guests have come
00:46 from 40 different countries
00:48 to be a part  of this graduation program.
00:50 Isn’t that wonderful?
00:58 So we’re very much looking forward
01:01 to this spiritual feast  that’s about to take place.
01:03 So now, if you’re able,  let’s stand
01:05 and sing  song number 54,
01:08 “This Is the Way,” and then  following the song,
01:11 Brother Robert Butler,  a helper
01:13 to the Publishing Committee  of the Governing Body,
01:16 will offer our opening prayer,  song 54.
03:52 Our marvelous God, Jehovah,
03:54 has the greatest  and most far-reaching vision.
03:59 At Job 28:24,
04:03 we read: “For he looks  to the ends of the earth,
04:08 and he sees everything  under the heavens.”
04:12 Well, recognizing  Jehovah’s almighty power
04:15 and his perfect penetrating vision,
04:19 it’s not surprising  that the psalmist
04:22 prayed to Jehovah  and expressed this
04:24 at Psalm 119:18.
04:29 Now, notice this very beautiful  and heartfelt request
04:32 that the psalmist made.
04:34 He said: “Open my eyes
04:38 “so that I may see clearly
04:40 the wonderful things  from your law.”
04:44 Well now, Jehovah
04:46 has truly fulfilled
04:48 this prayerful request.
04:50 In our day,
04:52 even though
2 Corinthians 4:4
04:55 tells us that Satan the Devil  “has blinded
04:58 the minds of the unbelievers,”
05:00 Jehovah is opening up
05:03 the spiritual eyes  of honesthearted ones
05:06 so that they  can see the truth
05:09 that’s coming  from his Word.
05:11 And it is truly amazing
05:13 to see how honesthearted ones
05:15 around this earth  are receiving
05:17 spiritual sight from God.
05:19 Just take  this one experience.
05:22 In May 2015,
05:25 a Lutheran priest visited
05:27 the Finland branch office  with a pioneer couple.
05:31 At Bethel,  she was deeply impressed
05:34 with the warm,  loving atmosphere that she saw.
05:37 After a month, she attended
05:40 the “Imitate Jesus!”  Convention from Friday to Sunday.
05:43 Her workmates at the church
05:46 asked her to take good notes  of the program
05:48 and to share them —which she did.
05:51 In December 2015,
05:54 she visited the bishop
05:56 and resigned from her office
05:58 after 27 years
06:01 of service  as an active priest.
06:04 The bishop started to cry
06:07 when she closed the door.
06:09 After resigning,  she sent out this message:
06:12 “I have just resigned  from the church.
06:15 “Now it is time  for a new life
06:18 under Jehovah’s wise protection.”
06:21 In January of 2016,
06:24 she started serving  as an unbaptized publisher,
06:27 and last year  at the regional convention,
06:30 she was baptized.
06:32 She is now serving  as an auxiliary pioneer
06:35 on a continuous basis,
06:37 and she says that she wants  to have a share in public witnessing
06:40 with carts  close to the church
06:43 where she served  for decades.
06:46 Well now,  isn’t this interesting though?
06:48 This is the last comment  this dear sister made.
06:51 She said,  “As a young girl,
06:54 “I made a promise  to serve God,
06:56 “but it wasn’t until now
06:58 “that I actually realized  how God
07:01 wanted to be served.”
07:03 Aren’t we glad  to welcome this sister
07:05 into our worldwide brotherhood?
07:15 But going back  to that Scriptural thought
07:17 in Psalm 119:18,
07:20 this is not simply the prayer
07:22 of honesthearted ones  who are in the world.
07:25 Really, brothers,  this is our prayer.
07:27 You see,  we all want Jehovah
07:30 to open up our eyes
07:32 and help us  to see his Word clearly.
07:36 Now, why is that  so necessary for all of us?
07:39 Well, let’s just take  one simple example from the Scriptures
07:43 of the faithful man Samuel.
07:46 Now, Samuel  was obviously a very spiritual man;
07:49 he was a person  who was used
07:52 throughout his life  in Jehovah’s service.
07:54 But if you look  at this account in 1 Samuel
07:56 chapter 16,
07:59 you’ll remember that here
08:01 Jehovah was sending  Samuel to anoint
08:04 one of the sons of Jesse  to become king.
08:07 Now, if you look at verse 7,
08:09 look at what Jehovah  says to Samuel:
08:12 “Do not pay attention
08:14 “to his appearance
08:16 “and how tall he is,
08:18 “for I have rejected him.
08:21 “For the way man sees
08:24 “is not the way God sees,
08:26 “because mere man sees  what appears to the eyes,
08:29 but Jehovah sees  into the heart.”
08:33 Well now,  do you see the point?
08:35 Do you see why we need  to beg Jehovah to open our eyes
08:38 and help us  to see clearly his Word?
08:41 You see,  our imperfection
08:43 affects our vision,  doesn’t it?
08:45 Our culture,  the way we were raised,
08:48 our fleshly inclinations
08:50 can all distort our vision.
08:54 We so much need Jehovah God
08:57 to open our eyes and help us
09:00 so that we can see matters clearly.
09:03 Well, for the past 74 years,
09:06 Gilead School has been a wonderful tool
09:08 to help fine spiritual men and women
09:12 to focus and sharpen
09:14 their spiritual vision.
09:16 Now, during your five and a half months  of schooling,
09:19 you’ve had the pleasure  to study God’s Word.
09:22 Now, this has not been  just a dry academic exercise.
09:27 But really, what you’ve done
09:29 is you’ve focused a light
09:31 upon God’s Word, the Bible.
09:33 Now, we’re not talking  about a little flashlight;
09:36 we’re talking about a floodlight.
09:39 And what has happened  as a result?
09:41 Well, Jehovah has helped
09:44 you to see yourself;
09:46 he’s helped you  to see the Scriptures;
09:48 he’s helped you  to see your brothers;
09:51 he’s helped you  to see your assignments
09:54 much more clearly
09:56 through the enlightening influence
09:59 of his precious Word, the Bible.
10:01 Well, as a result of all of that,
10:03 you are no longer  the people you were
10:06 when you arrived at Gilead.
10:08 You have changed.
10:10 But now,  what are you going to do
10:14 with this wonderful gift
10:16 that you have been given  by Jehovah,
10:18 this expanded spiritual vision
10:21 which has been extended to you?
10:23 Well, when you think about Gilead,
10:25 this school is something  that is very close
10:29 to our hearts  as Jehovah’s people.
10:32 It’s tied up  with our spiritual parents,
10:35 our spiritual grandparents,
10:37 with the foundation  of the work
10:41 in so many countries  of this earth.
10:44 There is  a wonderful spiritual legacy
10:47 associated with Gilead.
10:50 Well, what do you  want to do?
10:52 You want to become  a part of that legacy.
10:55 You want to take the gift that you have been given
10:58 by Jehovah and use it  to strengthen
11:01 and stabilize  the congregations, the fields,
11:04 the branch offices  where you are going to serve.
11:08 And what a group  you’re going to join!
11:10 Let me just give you  some statistics.
11:12 At the present time,
11:14 Gilead graduates are serving  in many fields of service.
11:17 For example,
915 are serving as Bethelites,
11:22 880 serve  as field missionaries,
11:26 496 serve  as circuit overseers
11:30 or wives  of circuit overseers,
11:33 244 serve  as members of Branch
11:37 or Country Committees,
11:39 4 serve as Governing Body helpers,
11:42 and 2 are members  of the Governing Body.
11:46 Well, when you think  of all of these individuals
11:50 who are working hard to advance  Kingdom interests around the world,
11:54 how much we want to praise
11:57 our magnificent,  our wonderful God, Jehovah,
12:00 for what he’s done by means of the Gilead School
12:03 and by means of his organization  to open our eyes
12:07 and help us  to see his Word clearly.
12:09 Don’t you agree, brothers?
12:20 Well, I’m sure that all of us  are looking forward to hearing
12:23 where our students  are going to be going.
12:25 But before we reach  that part in our program,
12:28 it’s appropriate  that we hear a number of talks
12:31 that are going to give  words of counsel,
12:35 words of encouragement,  even words of comfort
12:38 that will build up  not only the students
12:41 but all of us  who will hear this program.
12:43 First of all, we’re privileged to hear  from a member of the Governing Body
12:47 Brother Stephen Lett.
12:49 He is going to speak to us  this morning on the theme
12:53 “Imitate Jehovah’s Use of Memory,”  Brother Lett.
13:06 As you know,  Ephesians 5:1
13:10 tells us
13:12 to “become imitators of God,
13:15 as beloved children.”
13:17 And if we think about it,
13:19 absolutely everything
13:22 we can learn about Jehovah  is worthy of imitation,
13:25 and that includes his use of memory,
13:28 as we will discuss  during this talk.
13:32 But now first, we ask,  What do we mean by memory?
13:36 Well, one encyclopedia says this:
13:39 “Memory is the faculty  of the mind
13:43 “by which information  is encoded,
13:46 stored, and retrieved.”
13:49 But, unfortunately,  most of us struggle
13:53 with remembering  things we want to remember
13:56 and not remembering  things we would like to forget.
14:00 We remember  what we want to forget;
14:04 we don’t remember  what we want to remember.
14:07 It’s a struggle, isn’t it?
14:09 But if you think about it,  to illustrate this:
14:13 I can’t remember  where I left my glasses.
14:17 Where did I  leave my glasses?
14:19 But I do remember  in detail
14:22 how you offended me
20 years ago.
14:30 By the way, when someone  comes up to me at a convention
14:33 or an assembly and says:  “Do you remember my name?”
14:37 I say: “Well, Brother,
14:39 “I remember  your first name,
14:44 “but I don’t remember  your last name.
14:46 Your first name  is Brother, right?”
14:54 Well, feel free to use  that little trick if you want to.
15:00 But even though it is  a real challenge for us
15:03 as imperfect humans  with imperfect memories
15:07 to imitate Jehovah’s perfect use
15:09 of his perfect memory,
15:11 we should work hard  to try to do so.
15:13 In fact,  we’re going to discuss four ways
15:16 in which Jehovah  uses his memory
15:20 that we would do well  to imitate.
15:22 Now the first one,  let’s identify what it is.
15:26 And you dear Gilead students,  if you really work
15:29 in these four areas,  it will help you in your assignments.
15:33 But now,  go to Hebrews chapter 6, please,
15:38 and let’s read  verse number 10.
15:41 It says:  “For God is not unrighteous
15:44 “so as to forget your work
15:49 “and the love you showed  for his name by ministering
15:53 and continuing to minister  to the holy ones.”
15:57 So you notice according to this scripture,  Jehovah does not forget.
16:01 He always remembers  our love for him
16:05 and our hard work  in behalf of Kingdom interests.
16:09 In fact,  the Insight book said:
16:11 ‘An individual’s record  of fine works
16:14 ‘are like riches deposited
16:17 with the Creator in heaven.’
16:19 So if you think about it,
16:22 every time that you  go out in the ministry,
16:25 attend a meeting,  help build a Kingdom Hall,
16:28 unselfishly help  someone in need,
16:30 it’s like you make a deposit
16:32 in that great heavenly bank
16:34 —Jehovah’s memory.
16:37 And he never forgets it.
16:39 And he shows  his appreciation.
16:41 How so?
16:43 Well, he remembers  to hear our prayers.
16:45 He remembers  to give us holy spirit.
16:47 He remembers  to rescue us
16:49 from anything  that could harm us spiritually.
16:52 But now the question,  How we can imitate
16:56 this first example  of Jehovah’s use of memory?
16:59 Well, as Jehovah  doesn’t forget our love for him
17:03 —our hard work—
17:05 we don’t want to forget  Jehovah’s love for us
17:09 and his hard work  in our behalf.
17:12 He works so tirelessly,  you could say,
17:15 in our behalf, doesn’t he?
17:17 As we said,  remembering our prayers,
17:19 giving us holy spirit,  helping us.
17:21 We don’t want  to forget that; especially,
17:24 we want to remember all the times  Jehovah has helped us in the past.
17:27 And we know he’s not going  to abandon us now.
17:30 He’s going to help us now. We want to be like David.
17:34 He said: “Jehovah,  who rescued me
17:37 “from the claws  of the lion and the bear,
17:39 “he is the one  who will rescue me
17:43 from the hand  of this Philistine.”
17:45 He remembered how Jehovah  had always helped him.
17:48 He knew Jehovah  would help him now.
17:50 An extended application:
17:53 We don’t want to take for granted the hard work and the love
17:56 that others  are showing for Jehovah.
17:58 And we want to,  from time to time, commend them
18:01 and support them —the hardworking elders,
18:04 hardworking ministerial servants  and pioneers,
18:07 parents trying to raise  their children properly,
18:10 children trying to keep  their integrity to Jehovah.
18:14 See, take note of that,  remember that,
18:16 commend and support.
18:18 But now let’s get  a second way
18:20 that Jehovah  uses his memory.
18:23 Let’s go to Luke chapter 20,
18:25 and verse 38.
18:30 It says: “He is a God,
18:34 “not of the dead,
18:36 “but of the living,
18:38 for they are all  living to him.”
18:41 Now what do we learn?
18:43 Well, Jehovah  completely remembers
18:45 faithful ones  who have died.
18:48 They’re living in his memory,  and appropriately,
18:52 these ones are referred to  as being in the memorial tombs
18:55 because Jehovah’s memory  is involved.
18:58 Now, how can we  imitate this example
19:00 of Jehovah’s use  of memory?
19:02 Well, we don’t want  to forget these faithful ones
19:05 who have died either.
19:07 And we have a lot  of life stories, for example,
19:11 in our publications to help us remember  them and their good qualities.
19:15 They’re good examples  that we can keep learning from
19:18 —for example, former members  of the Governing Body,
19:21 such as Brother Klein;
19:24 other members  of the anointed,
19:27 or ones of the anointed —Sister Gertrud Pötzinger,
19:31 Georg Lindal,  Bennett Brickell;
19:34 ones that had the earthy hope, life stories about them
19:38 —Brothers George Couch,  Max Larson,
19:40 Robert Wallen.
19:42 And, of course, the Bible, as you know,  contains numerous examples, doesn’t it,
19:46 of ones who have died  that we don’t want to forget?
19:50 We want to keep reading about them,
19:52 meditating on their examples
19:54 and learning from them.
19:56 Well, let’s get a third way, now,
19:59 that Jehovah uses his memory.
20:02 Let’s go to Joshua chapter 21,
20:06 and we’ll read verse 45,
20:09 Joshua 21:45:
20:14 “Not a promise failed
20:16 “out of all the good promises  that Jehovah had made
20:20 “to the house of Israel;
20:22 all of them came true.”
20:25 Now, this scripture  and several others show
20:27 that Jehovah  never forgets his promises.
20:30 He remembers them,
20:32 and he fulfills all of his promises,  doesn’t he?
20:36 In contrast,
20:38 speaking of politicians,
20:40 one writer made a comment:
20:42 “They promise the moon,
20:45 “but once they get into office,
20:47 they do well to deliver  a moonbeam.”
20:52 Well, others have what has been labeled  as a selective memory,
20:56 or selective amnesia,  it’s been labeled,
20:59 regarding promises they’ve made,  but not Jehovah.
21:02 And, of course, as Jehovah’s children,  we want to imitate him;
21:05 remember our promises.
21:07 What promise especially?
21:09 Our dedication promise.
21:11 In our dedication vow,
21:14 we promised to do  Jehovah’s will
21:17 unreservedly.
21:19 We promised that we
21:21 would put Jehovah’s will  ahead of our own will.
21:23 That’s what we promised.
21:25 And what is the duration  of this promise,
21:29 this most important promise  we ever made?
21:31 Well, forever.
21:33 What if we die; we’re resurrected?
21:36 Well, are you  going to have to get rebaptized
21:39 when you are resurrected  or rededicate your life to Jehovah?
21:42 No.
21:43 Your dedication  and baptism
21:45 endure even death  and resurrection.
21:48 So he expects us
21:50 to fulfill that promise  we have made.
21:53 Now, those of us  who are married,
21:55 he expects us  to fulfill our marriage vows.
21:58 Maybe we’ve made  other promises to Jehovah.
22:01 For example,  here at Gilead School,
22:04 you may have made promises  to Jehovah.
22:07 Well, he expects us  to remember
22:09 and fulfill  those promises.
22:13 But now, let’s get one more way —a fourth way—Jehovah uses his memory.
22:17 Let’s go  to Isaiah 43, please,
22:20 and this scripture  will help us identify it,
22:23 Isaiah 43:25,  Jehovah says:
22:27 “I, I am the One
22:30 “who is blotting out  your transgressions
22:33 “for my own sake,
22:35 “and I will not remember
22:39 your sins.”
22:41 Now, very interestingly,
22:43 when Jehovah forgives a sin,
22:45 he refuses to remember
22:47 —to recall it—
22:49 to ever hold that sin  against the person.
22:52 He chooses  not to remember that sin.
22:56 The Watchtower some years ago  said that Jehovah
23:00 “will never call to mind
23:02 our forgiven sins.”
23:04 Now that’s amazing  use of memory, isn’t it?
23:07 Truly amazing.
23:09 Why does Jehovah choose,
23:12 you could say,  to delete our forgiven sins?
23:15 Well, is it because he wants  to make more room in his memory?
23:21 No.  Jehovah has unlimited memory, doesn’t he?
23:24 He calls all of the trillions
23:26 of stars by name.
23:29 I have a hard time calling by name  the some 20 commenters
23:32 at the Monday night  Bethel family Watchtower Study.
23:36 Jehovah remembers  in full detail
23:39 the billions
23:41 who are  in the memorial tombs.
23:44 So memory capacity  is not the problem, is it?
23:47 Jehovah forgives and forgets
23:51 because of his love and mercy.
23:53 But now, how can we
23:55 imitate Jehovah here?
23:58 Well, we want  to work hard
24:00 to freely forgive
24:02 as Jehovah does,  but then we want to work hard
24:05 to try to delete that forgiven sin  from our memories.
24:09 How do you delete something  from your memory?
24:12 Well, you refuse  to replay it, review it.
24:17 In contrast, if you want  to remember something,
24:20 you do review it,  don’t you?
24:22 If you want to remember  someone’s name,
24:24 you keep repeating that  to yourself
24:27 —you want to remember  a scripture,
24:30 a word in a language you’re trying to learn.
24:33 On the other hand, if you don’t want  to remember something,
24:36 you refuse to replay it —you dismiss that thought
24:39 like an immoral thought  as an example.
24:41 The same way  with forgiven sins,
24:44 we refuse to replay them.
24:46 We do our best,  as 2 Corinthians 10:5 says,
24:50 to bring  “every thought into captivity.”
24:53 “Make it obedient to the Christ.”
24:56 Well, we have four ways
24:58 Jehovah uses his memory there  that we’ve now discussed.
25:01 Did you get them?
25:03 (1) He remembers  our love for him and our hard work
25:07 in behalf of Kingdom interests.
25:09 We want to remember his love  and hard work on our behalf,
25:12 and by extension,  the love and hard work of others.
25:16 (2) He never forgets  faithful ones who have died.
25:20 Well, we don’t want  to forget them either.
25:22 By means of the Bible,  by means of life stories,
25:25 we can remember these ones  and learn from them.
25:28 (3) He always remembers
25:31 his promises and fulfills them.
25:34 We want to do the same.
25:36 (4) He chooses not to remember,
25:39 completely forgets,  our forgiven sins.
25:42 We want to work hard  to do the same thing.
25:45 May we remember to forget.
25:49 You have to think about that.
25:53 Well, likely you can think of other aspects  of Jehovah’s use of memory
25:56 that would be  worthy of imitation.
25:58 In fact, I’m going  to give you students
26:00 that as a homework assignment.
26:03 Come up with some other examples  of how Jehovah uses his memory
26:06 that we can imitate.
26:08 Now, I’ll get you started.
26:10 Psalm 103:14
26:12 says Jehovah remembers
26:15 that “we are dust.”
26:17 Now, how can we imitate  that aspect of Jehovah’s memory?
26:21 Now, you’re used  to homework assignments.
26:23 You’ve had them for five months.
26:25 Now you have another assignment.
26:28 But may Jehovah bless
26:30 each of you dear ones
26:33 as you strive,
26:35 with the help of holy spirit,
26:37 to imitate Jehovah’s use
26:40 of memory.
26:52 Well, we sincerely thank you,  Brother Lett,
26:55 for that fine talk,  and you can be certain
26:57 that we will remember it.
27:01 Well next, we’re privileged to hear  from Brother Saki Marais,
27:04 a helper to the Writing Committee  of the Governing Body.
27:07 Brother Marais is going to speak  to us on the subject
27:10 “With the Measure  That You Measure Out.”
27:19 We know that you as students
27:23 truly appreciated the privilege
27:27 to go through Gilead,  to learn so many things.
27:31 And during this time,
27:33 you have been given
27:35 many things,  many gifts, as it were.
27:39 And we know the scripture says
27:42 ‘every good
27:44 ‘and perfect gift
27:46 comes from Jehovah.’
27:49 But now,  how should we view this gift
27:53 that you have received?
27:55 The Bible helps us  in a very interesting way
27:58 in Ephesians chapter 4,
28:02 Ephesians chapter 4,
28:06 and it says here in verse 7:
28:09 “Now undeserved kindness
28:12 “was given to each one of us
28:15 “according to how the Christ
28:18 measured out the free gift.”
28:20 So it is a free gift.
28:23 We didn’t earn it.
28:25 We didn’t deserve it.
28:27 But nevertheless,
28:29 it came from the Christ,
28:31 and he measured it out to us
28:34 —very kindly measured it out to us.
28:39 Now, what is the purpose  of this gift?
28:43 Why did we get this gift?
28:46 He goes on to explain here
28:48 in chapter 4,
28:50 verse 8,
28:54 that he turns these individuals
28:59 who received these gifts
29:01 into gifts
29:03 —they become gifts of men.
29:06 And now, we look at verse 10.
29:09 What is the purpose?
29:11 It’s “so that he might give
29:14 fullness to all things.”
29:17 Now, Christ gives out this gift
29:20 in many different ways,
29:23 many different manifestations  of his gift.
29:28 For instance,  look at verse 11.
29:31 Some are apostles,  prophets, evangelizers,
29:34 shepherds, and teachers.
29:36 The purpose?
29:38 That each of these gifts
29:40 will share what they have  in order to help
29:45 every member  of the congregation.
29:48 If you look here  in verses 12 and 13,
29:51 we read from the last part of verse 12:
29:53 “To build up  the body of the Christ,
29:56 “until we all attain
30:00 “to the oneness of the faith
30:02 “and of the accurate knowledge  of the Son of God,
30:06 “to being a full-grown man,
30:09 “attaining the measure of stature
30:12 that belongs  to the fullness of the Christ.”
30:16 This is wonderful, isn’t it?
30:19 Just to think
30:21 that Christ Jesus  has given you
30:23 this wonderful gift,  this ability
30:27 to build up  the rest of the congregation
30:30 —that is your obligation  and your responsibility.
30:36 At 1 Peter 4:10,
30:40 an additional aspect  about this gift is given to us.
30:44 Let us read at 1 Peter 4:10,
30:49 it says:  “To the extent that each one
30:52 “has received a gift,
30:55 “use it in ministering  to one another
30:59 “as fine stewards  of God’s undeserved kindness
31:04 that is expressed  in various ways.”
31:08 So this is our opportunity
31:10 to use this gift
31:13 as a distributor,  an administrator,
31:16 of God’s undeserved kindness.
31:19 But this gift  is very different
31:21 from a normal gift  that we would receive.
31:24 Why would this gift  be different?
31:27 Normally, when you get a gift,  what do you do?
31:29 You look at this gift and you think:  ‘I wonder what’s in it.
31:34 ‘I wonder  if I’m going to like it.
31:38 I wonder  how I will use it.’
31:41 That’s normally the case,  but with this gift that we receive,
31:45 we receive the gift,
31:47 and we  just simply give it on
31:49 without opening the gift.
31:53 This is our obligation  with this gift that we’ve received.
31:57 Christ Jesus helps us  to understand
31:59 how to administer  this gift.
32:02 And we turn to Luke chapter 6,
32:04 verses 32-37,
32:08 Luke chapter 6,
32:21 starting with verse 32:
32:23 “If you love those loving you,
32:26 “of what credit is it to you?
32:28 “For even the sinners  love those loving them.
32:31 “And if you do good  to those doing good to you,
32:34 “of what credit is it to you?
32:36 “Even the sinners do the same.
32:39 “Also, if you lend to those
32:42 “from whom  you expect repayment,
32:45 “of what credit is it to you?
32:47 “Even sinners lend to sinners
32:49 “so that they  may get back as much.
32:53 “On the contrary,
32:55 “continue to love
32:57 “your enemies
33:00 “and to do good and to lend
33:03 “without hoping  for anything back;
33:06 “and your reward will be great,
33:09 “and you will be
33:11 “sons of the Most High,
33:14 “for he is kind
33:17 “toward the unthankful  and wicked.
33:21 “Continue being merciful,
33:24 “just as your Father is merciful.
33:26 “Moreover, stop judging,
33:30 “and you will  by no means be judged;
33:32 “and stop condemning,
33:34 “and you will by no means  be condemned.
33:36 “Keep on forgiving,
33:39 and you will be forgiven.”
33:45 So we cannot be judges
33:48 of those to whom  we give the gift.
33:52 We are not judges;  we are not condemning people.
33:56 Our whole purpose  of administering this gift
34:00 that we’ve received  is to do so without any prejudice.
34:06 We do not judge  the worthiness of the recipient.
34:11 We only take on our responsibility,
34:14 our dignity that we  have been given by Jehovah
34:17 —that of passing on the gift.
34:22 The second part,
34:24 apart  from being completely unprejudiced,
34:27 the second part is that we  must give freely and generously.
34:31 Now, we get to verse 37,
34:34 excuse me, verse 38:
34:36 “Practice giving,
34:39 “and people will give to you.
34:42 “They will pour  into your laps a fine measure,
34:45 “pressed down,  shaken together,
34:48 “and overflowing.
34:50 “For with the measure
34:53 “that you are measuring out,
34:56 “they will measure out
34:58 to you in return.”
35:00 So Jehovah God
35:02 is extremely generous.
35:05 He makes the sun shine
35:08 and the rain  come upon righteous
35:10 and the unrighteous.
35:12 And as Paul says:  “He himself
35:15 “gives . . . life
35:17 and breath and all things”
35:20 to everyone.
35:22 And Jehovah is very interested
35:25 in how we administer
35:27 the gifts given into our hands.
35:29 That’s why it says  ‘with the measure
35:31 you measure out.’
35:34 He is very interested  to see whether we
35:37 do so very carefully.
35:40 This is like the example  of parents
35:42 that train their children
35:45 to make a contribution  at the Kingdom Hall.
35:47 They give the child  a little bit of money and they
35:49 tell him to go put it  in the contribution box.
35:51 Now, they expect the child to go  and put it in the contribution box,
35:54 right, not to keep it for himself?
35:56 They also don’t expect the child  to collect all the contributions
36:01 over a long period of time  and then go make some big donation.
36:04 No, the parents  are actually giving the contribution,
36:09 and they expect the child  to do it the way they tell him.
36:11 Take it; go and put it  in the contribution box now.
36:15 And so it is with Jehovah.
36:18 He is giving us this gift,
36:20 but we need to pass it on.
36:22 It is not for us to look
36:25 and to hold on to this gift.
36:27 So here’s the lesson:  Be careful,
36:31 very careful,  that you do not control
36:35 the gift that Jehovah  gives you too closely.
36:39 Remember,  the gift has to be passed on;
36:43 otherwise,  we will lose Jehovah’s favor.
36:46 We cannot bury the talent
36:48 in the ground, as it were.
36:51 We receive it; we must spend it.
36:55 As much as we treasure it,  we cannot hold on to it.
36:59 And so now we come  to the key statement here:
37:02 “With the measure . . .  you are measuring out,”
37:07 makes us sons  of the Most High.
37:12 We cannot be more generous  than Jehovah.
37:15 But does your generosity
37:18 match the generosity  of Jehovah in your case?
37:23 Generosity has to become  a habit for us,
37:26 a way of life.
37:28 And here is  another very important aspect:
37:31 Jehovah is giving  not just anything;
37:34 he gives the very best.
37:39 He doesn’t hold back;  he gives us the very best.
37:43 Let us read  these most profound words
37:46 at Romans chapter 8,
37:51 and in verse 32:
37:54 “Since he did not even spare  his own Son
37:58 “but handed him over  for us all,
38:01 “will he not also,  along with him,
38:03 “kindly give us
38:05 all other things?”
38:09 So Jehovah gives it all.
38:11 The principle for us:
38:13 With the measure we measure out,
38:15 it will be measured out to us.
38:18 This is an eternal truth.
38:20 We can count on it.
38:22 You’ve been given much;  don’t hold back.
38:25 Give it all.  Give your best.
38:28 The benefit  is not in using the gift;
38:32 the benefit  is in giving the gift.
38:36 For with the measure
38:39 you measure out, it will be measured out to you.
38:54 And we thank you very much,  Brother Marais,
38:56 for the beautiful gift  that you gave us.
38:59 Now we’re looking forward  to hearing
39:01 from another helper to the Writing Committee,  Brother Robert Ciranko.
39:04 He’s going to speak  to us today on the theme
39:07 “Is It All About You?”
39:15 It is a rare privilege  to be invited to attend
39:18 the Watchtower Bible School  of Gilead.
39:21 And in its 74-year history,  only about 9,000 students
39:25 have graduated from this school.
39:28 Well, now at it’s current pace  of two classes a year,
39:31 how long do you think it would take  for all 67,000 special full-time servants
39:36 in the world to be able  to attend Gilead?
39:40 Over 600 years.
39:43 So we rejoice with you students
39:45 for having been able to enjoy
39:48 this excellent privilege.
39:50 But now,  we have to be cautious
39:53 when we think  about the word “privilege.”
39:56 One dictionary says  it is “a right
39:59 that is given to some people  and not to others.”
40:02 So if not careful,  we could wrongly assume that receiving this
40:06 or certain ther privileges  in Jehovah’s organization
40:09 somehow elevates  us above the rest
40:12 of Jehovah’s faithful servants.
40:15 And then by thinking that,  we could start
40:17 to believe that it  is all about us.
40:20 But is it?
40:22 The same dictionary says  that “privilege” can also mean
40:24 “a special opportunity  to do something,”
40:28 and that is what  we need to focus on
40:31 whenever we receive  a privilege in God’s service
40:34 —the opportunity  it gives us to serve.
40:38 There was an incident with Jesus’ apostles  that nicely illustrates this.
40:42 If you open your Bibles, please, to Matthew the 19th chapter,
40:46 Matthew chapter 19,  and keep your Bibles open there.
40:50 It was the year 33  of our Common Era,
40:52 just days before Jesus’ life  and ministry
40:55 would come  to an abrupt end.
40:57 He and his disciples were traveling  to Jerusalem for the Passover.
41:01 And a rich young ruler  runs up to Jesus
41:04 and asks what he has to do  to gain everlasting life,
41:07 and Jesus explained.
41:09 But the wealthy man  was dismayed when he found out
41:11 that he would have to sell his belongings,  give to the poor,
41:15 and follow Christ.
41:17 Well, taking this all in,  one of Jesus’ apostles
41:20 pointed out that they  had given up
41:23 their former vocations  to follow Christ.
41:26 This is Matthew 19:27:
41:29 “Then Peter said  in reply: ‘Look!
41:33 “‘We have left all things  and followed you;
41:36 what, then,  will there be for us?’”
41:40 In modern parlance,  Peter was asking,
41:43 “What’s in it for us?”
41:45 Well, Jesus doesn’t leave them wondering  because in verse 28,
41:49 he promises them that when he  gets into his Kingdom,
41:52 they eventually will sit  on thrones with him.
41:56 And you can be sure that  that prospect really stuck in their minds,
42:00 and they must have dwelled on it  as they continued on their journey
42:04 to Jerusalem.
42:06 But a short time later,  look at what happens
42:08 at Matthew 20:20:
42:12 “Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee  approached him with her sons,
42:16 “doing obeisance and asking  for something from him.
42:20 “He said to her:  ‘What do you want?’
42:23 “She replied to him:
42:25 “‘Give the word that these two sons  of mine may sit down,
42:29 one at your right hand and one at your left,  in your Kingdom.’”
42:33 Well, James and John  probably put their mother up to that,
42:37 and how clever they  must have thought they were
42:40 that they got to Jesus with their request  before Peter or the others did!
42:45 And what was  the reaction of the rest?
42:47 Look at verse 24:  “When the ten others heard about it,
42:50 they became indignant  at the two brothers.”
42:53 They were upset with James and John
42:55 for trying to reserve for themselves
42:57 the best thrones in the Kingdom,
43:00 and they probably also wished
43:02 they had thought of the idea first.
43:05 Well, even before this,  we know the apostles had argued
43:09 among themselves  as to which one was the greatest.
43:12 So do you see  what their problem was?
43:15 It was all about them.
43:18 These 12 men already enjoyed  the special privilege
43:21 of having been chosen  to be an apostle of Christ;
43:24 they were told  of a future amazing privilege
43:27 to sit on thrones  in the heavenly Kingdom;
43:30 and now they’re trying to secure  something even more for themselves.
43:34 And what must have made this  especially disheartening to Jesus
43:38 is what occurred  just moments before.
43:41 Look at verse 17:
43:43 “While going up to Jerusalem,  Jesus took the 12 disciples
43:47 “aside privately and said  to them on the road: ‘Look!
43:50 “‘We are going up to Jerusalem,  and the Son of man
43:53 “‘will be handed over  to the chief priests and the scribes.
43:56 “‘They will condemn him to death
43:59 “‘and hand him over to men  of the nations to be mocked
44:02 and scourged  and executed on a stake.’”
44:07 With all that Jesus  had on his mind
44:10 —preparing himself mentally  and emotionally for what lay ahead—
44:13 the last thing  he should have been troubled with
44:16 was the apostles  posturing themselves
44:19 for some sort of greatness.
44:22 But Jesus  patiently took them aside
44:25 to impress upon them  the right attitude.
44:28 Verse 25:
44:30 “But Jesus called them  to him and said:
44:33 “‘You know that the rulers  of the nations lord it over them
44:36 “‘and the great men  wield authority over them.
44:40 “‘This must not be  the way among you;
44:43 “‘but whoever  wants to become great
44:45 “‘among you  must be your minister,
44:47 “‘and whoever  wants to be first
44:49 “‘among you  must be your slave.
44:51 “‘Just as the Son of man came,
44:53 “‘not to be ministered to,
44:55 “‘but to minister  and to give his life as a ransom
44:59 in exchange for many.’”
45:02 Yes, when Jesus came to earth,  it was to minister
45:05 —it was to serve others.
45:07 He was not aspiring  to any positions
45:10 of honor or prestige,
45:12 and Jesus’ disciples  needed that same disposition.
45:15 They needed to appreciate  that the greatest person in the Kingdom
45:19 must be the one  who humbly serves others.
45:23 You see, Jehovah bestows  privileges on us,
45:27 not to give us  some sense of entitlement,
45:30 but to create  opportunities for us
45:33 to be more useful  in our service to God.
45:38 To show that Jesus  really meant what he said,
45:40 notice what happened next.
45:42 And by now, they are  within a day’s journey of Jerusalem.
45:45 Verse 29:
45:47 “As they were going out of Jericho,  a large crowd followed him.
45:50 “And look! two blind men  sitting beside the road
45:54 “heard that Jesus  was passing by and cried out:
45:57 “‘Lord, have mercy on us,  Son of David!’
46:01 “But the crowd rebuked them,
46:03 “telling them to keep silent;
46:06 “yet they cried all the louder,  saying:
46:08 “‘Lord, have mercy on us,  Son of David!’
46:11 “So Jesus stopped,  called them, and said:
46:15 “‘What do you want  me to do for you?’
46:18 “They said to him:  ‘Lord, let our eyes be opened.’
46:22 “Moved with pity,  Jesus touched their eyes,
46:25 “and immediately  they recovered their sight,
46:27 and they followed him.”
46:30 Imagine again how much
46:32 was weighing on Jesus’ heart  at that very moment.
46:35 You see, he knew  he was about to enter
46:38 the final week  of his earthly life
46:40 —that intense suffering
46:43 and a cruel death awaited him  and that his integrity
46:47 to God was going  to be put on the line.
46:49 And yet he does not ignore
46:51 the insistent cries  of these desperate men.
46:55 Did you notice  in verse 32 what Jesus
46:57 asked the two blind men?
46:59 He said: “What do you  want me
47:02 to do for you?”
47:04 Now, what might we  be tempted to say
47:08 if we see someone  approaching us
47:11 and wanting to ask a favor,
47:14 or our help, for something?
47:16 Well, if we suspect that their request  will be too distasteful
47:20 or time-consuming to fulfill,  we might want to reserve for ourselves
47:23 the opportunity to delegate  the task to someone else.
47:26 So we might just say,  “What do you want?”
47:29 But not Jesus.
47:31 And on ever so many occasions,  he was deeply moved
47:34 to serve the needs of others  because it was never all about him.
47:40 What a good lesson  for us always to imitate.
47:43 You see, we can approach life
47:45 expecting to be  a person of privilege
47:48 or, like Christ, we can use
47:50 the opportunities we are given
47:52 to serve  in whatever capacity
47:54 we are allowed to do  in Jehovah’s organization.
47:58 And for you dear members
48:00 of the 142nd class of Gilead,
48:03 we believe that you  were already manifesting
48:05 that Christlike spirit
48:07 in your assignment,  and that’s why you were chosen to attend
48:11 this 142nd class of Gilead.
48:13 Never lose that spirit.
48:15 Now soon, you’re going to go off  with diploma in hand, aren’t you,
48:19 maybe to take on  even more responsibility
48:21 than you had before?
48:23 And Jehovah has reserved  a place for you
48:26 to serve him  in his organization.
48:28 We are confident  that you will remember
48:30 that it has not been  all about you.
48:33 Rather, it has been about how you  will use the fine education
48:36 you have received now  at Gilead as an opportunity
48:40 to continually  and humbly serve others,
48:44 and for that,  Jehovah will richly bless you.
48:56 We thank you very much,  Brother Ciranko,
48:59 for those very heartwarming  and very meaningful thoughts.
49:03 Well, now we’re going to begin  to hear some comments
49:06 and thoughts from the instructors  of the Gilead School.
49:10 First, we’re going to hear  from Brother William Samuelson.
49:13 He’s going to speak to us  on the subject
49:15 “Perfected Into One.”
49:20 Some years ago,  back in the 1700’s,
49:24 Thomas Paine,  an American writer, said:
49:27 “It’s not in numbers
49:30 “but in unity
49:32 that great strength lies.”
49:34 Well, that reminded me
49:36 of a medical emergency  that arose
49:38 at a district convention  some years ago.
49:41 A brother leaving the stadium
49:44 got to the sidewalk and fell
49:46 to the ground,  or to the sidewalk,
49:49 apparently with a heart attack
49:51 or possibly a stroke.
49:53 Two ambulances  eventually arrived,
49:57 and the two drivers  got into a heated argument
50:00 over who had the authority,  or jurisdiction,
50:03 to transport our brother
50:05 to the nearest emergency ward.
50:08 Well, what was it that kept
50:10 these two drivers
50:12 from being effective  at their job?
50:15 It was a lack of unity.
50:17 So I was thinking,  ‘How can you
50:20 ‘promote unity  in your job,
50:23 in your assignment,  that you’ll be going to?’
50:26 Well, there are  any number of ways.
50:28 And the list that I’m going to give you,  is just three,
50:32 and it is  by no means exhaustive
50:35 —good communication;
50:37 avoid promoting  a personal agenda;
50:41 and if given oversight,
50:43 work within the boundaries
50:46 of the assignment  and work hard
50:49 to be skilled at it.
50:51 Good communication.
50:53 At the time of the emergency  that I just mentioned,
50:58 an unauthorized person
51:00 called 911.
51:02 Now, that lack of communication
51:05 —the unauthorized person
51:08 really should have communicated
51:10 with the attendants  already on duty
51:12 and assigned  to that particular job.
51:15 There were EMTs there,
51:17 but he saw what he thought  was a serious situation
51:20 and called 911.
51:22 Now, that resulted in 911
51:27 sending the second ambulance.
51:29 We’ll talk about that  a little later.
51:31 I got to thinking  about a Bible account
51:34 —a huge project
51:36 that failed because of lack  of communication.
51:40 Now, you probably can think  of any number,
51:44 and the one I’m going to talk about  we usually think of in a negative way.
51:48 But turn  to Genesis chapter 11,
51:50 and we’re going to look  at verses 6 through 8 in particular,
51:54 and we won’t read all of it,  but just a few little excerpts from it.
51:58 In verse 5: “Jehovah  went down to see the city
52:02 and the tower,”  the city and Tower of Babel.
52:05 They had a project. “Jehovah then said: ‘Look!
52:09 They are one people,’”  they’re united,
52:12 “‘with one language, and this  is what they have started to do.
52:16 “‘Now there is nothing  that they may have in mind to do
52:19 that will be impossible  for them.’”
52:21 Because they  had communication,
52:24 they were able  to understand each other.
52:26 So Jehovah confused  their languages.
52:29 But now,  notice in verse 8,
52:31 he ‘scattered them  over the entire face of the earth,
52:34 and they gradually left off  building the tower.’
52:39 Because they couldn’t communicate,
52:41 the project failed.
52:44 Well, when we examine
52:49 our own situation,
52:51 the Scriptures tell us—
52:53 Paul wrote to the Philippians:  “Look out
52:56 “not only  for your own interests,
52:59 but also for the interests  of others.”
53:01 How will you know
53:03 what is in the best interests  of others
53:06 if you don’t communicate  with them?
53:08 if you don’t talk to them?
53:10 if you don’t find out  what their preferences are?
53:12 their thinking? their abilities?
53:14 And once you find out  what these are,
53:17 then you act in harmony
53:20 with that and you look  for their interests
53:24 rather than your own.
53:26 The second point:
53:29 Avoid promoting  a personal agenda.
53:32 Personal agenda
53:34 was defined this way  in one publication:
53:37 “An ambitious scheme  or plan of action
53:41 “designed to make things  work out for your benefit
53:45 “or your convenience
53:47 or so that you  can gain control.”
53:52 Control seems to sometimes be  a dominant thing.
53:55 Well, in our initial illustration,
53:58 or example, our two drivers,
54:00 both had a personal agenda.
54:02 The first ambulance
54:04 had been radioed for  and was on-site
54:08 because it had been employed  by the convention.
54:11 It was there  for just such an emergency,
54:14 and obviously that driver  felt that he had jurisdiction.
54:18 But you remember  our unauthorized brother
54:21 called 911.
54:24 Now, 911 dispatched  an ambulance,
54:27 and our brother  had collapsed on the sidewalk.
54:30 So he felt because it  wasn’t inside the stadium,
54:33 it was on the sidewalk,  and because he
54:36 had been dispatched  by 911,
54:38 he had jurisdiction.
54:40 So the two of them  had their own agenda.
54:44 Of course, our poor brother  is laying here
54:46 not knowing  what’s happening to him.
54:48 Well, I got to thinking
54:50 about others in the Bible
54:52 that have gone out  for their own agenda.
54:55 Satan obviously tops the list.
54:56 He had an agenda.  He wanted worship.
54:58 But what about Korah,  Dathan, Abiram?
55:02 Turn to Numbers
55:04 chapter 16,
55:08 verses 8 through 11,  but we’re not going to read all of that.
55:12 You remember the account.
55:14 In fact,  I think you studied it in detail.
55:17 But in verse 8:
55:20 “Moses then said to Korah:  ‘Listen, please,
55:23 “‘you sons of Levi.
55:25 “‘Does it seem to you  such a little thing
55:28 “‘that the God of Israel
55:30 “‘has separated you  from the assembly of Israel
55:33 “‘and allowed you  to approach him in order to perform
55:37 “‘the service  of Jehovah’s tabernacle
55:39 and to stand  before the assembly?’”
55:41 In other words,  you’ve been given a special privilege.
55:44 Now, does that seem  like such a little thing to you?
55:48 In verse 10, he said:
55:50 “Must you also try  to secure the priesthood?”
55:54 Well, if you think about this matter  of a personal agenda,
55:57 in your assignments,  you can contribute much
56:01 to the unity  of the group you’re with,
56:04 the branch, the department.
56:06 But if you start thinking  about how this is going to give
56:09 honor and glory to you,
56:11 you could start thinking  about getting
56:13 as much responsibility  as you can
56:15 —working for your own interests
56:18 rather than  the interests of others,
56:20 getting or developing
56:22 a personal agenda.
56:24 So in addition  to the special privileges you have
56:27 in full-time service,  must you also
56:30 try to get something else?  try to get something greater?
56:34 Two others  that fell victim to this
56:38 were James and John.
56:40 Turn to the book of Mark,
56:44 and again we’re just going to glance
56:47 at a couple of the scriptures,  a couple of the verses.
56:49 Here, you remember —and Brother Ciranko
56:51 already commented on this account —James and John.
56:55 One account said  they got their mother to do it,
56:57 but they knew,  Jesus knew.
57:00 He answered them,  and they said: “Teacher,”
57:03 verse 35, chapter 10,  “Teacher,
57:06 we want you to do for us  whatever we ask of you.”
57:09 ‘We’ve got a personal agenda.
57:12 ‘We want to sit  on your right hand and your left.
57:14 ‘We want to have honor;  we want to have authority.
57:17 You see, we want this.’
57:19 Well, without doing all  of the details here,
57:22 verse 41,  what did it do to the unity
57:26 of the group of the 12?
57:29 Verse 41:  “When the ten others heard about it,
57:32 “they became indignant
57:35 at James and John.”
57:37 It didn’t help  the unity of the group
57:40 with a personal agenda.
57:42 And so it is with you.
57:45 If you promote  a personal agenda,
57:48 it’s not going to help  the unity of the department
57:52 or the branch  that you’re serving with.
57:56 We might think,  in conclusion,
58:00 of an illustration
58:02 of an orchestra.
58:04 Before a performance,
58:06 all of the instruments  in an orchestra
58:08 generally adjust
58:11 to a single pitch
58:13 —one generated sometimes
58:15 by an electronic tone generator.
58:18 Now, once they have been tuned  to a single tone,
58:21 all of the instruments  are automatically
58:24 tuned to each other.
58:26 And so it is if you listen  to the one tone,
58:30 you will all  be tuned together.
58:32 You remember Jesus  in his prayer
58:36 to his Father  in John 17 before his death.
58:40 He prayed that they  would be in union,
58:43 that they  would be together as one.
58:46 If you turn to John 17:21,
58:51 he said: “So that they may all be one,”  in his prayer to his Father,
58:55 “just as you, Father, are in union with me,”  in other words,
58:58 united, one,
59:01 “. . . that they also may be  in union with us,
59:04 so that the world may believe  that you sent me.”
59:07 But now,  drop down to verse 23:
59:12 “In union with them and you—”
59:14 “I in union with them  and you in union with me,
59:19 in order that they  may be perfected into one.”
59:23 Now, notice the footnote  on “perfected into one.”
59:28 It says:  “Or ‘be completely unified.’”
59:33 So for stability in the branch,  the department,
59:37 whatever your assignment is,
59:39 unity is a must;  it has to be.
59:43 Just as you’ve done  for the past 20 weeks,
59:46 we encourage you to continue
59:48 to work together, united
59:51 —perfectly, completely united—
59:53 perfected into one.
59:56 As Gilead graduates,  make sure you do your part
1:00:00 to help your brothers and sisters
1:00:02 become perfected into one.
1:00:15 We thank you very much,  Brother Samuelson,
1:00:17 for those  very practical comments.
1:00:20 I know the students  are going to benefit from them.
1:00:22 Well, now we’re looking forward  to hearing a talk
1:00:25 from another of our Gilead instructors,  Brother Mark Noumair.
1:00:29 His theme for us today  is “See the Cause.”
1:00:34 Well, this is a time  of great change
1:00:37 for Jehovah’s people,
1:00:39 and you students  have seen it firsthand
1:00:42 by being invited to Gilead.
1:00:44 In fact, some of you
1:00:46 will receive  a change of assignment
1:00:49 after Gilead.
1:00:51 And still others  might receive a change
1:00:54 in their circumstances once they get back
1:00:57 to their branch territory.
1:00:59 So change  will be a part of your life.
1:01:03 And although change can be good,
1:01:05 many find unexpected change
1:01:08 stressful or even unsettling.
1:01:10 We may find ourselves asking,
1:01:12 ‘Why me?’
1:01:14 And that question  is not a sign of weak faith.
1:01:18 Rather, it is healthy to ask why
1:01:21 because when you ask  the question why,
1:01:25 you usually  begin to explore the cause
1:01:30 behind the change.
1:01:33 Now, a careful study  of Bible history
1:01:36 reveals that Jehovah God  is a Master of change.
1:01:40 He loves change.
1:01:42 In fact, when we studied  the New World Translation,
1:01:45 Appendix A-4,  what did we learn?
1:01:48 We learned that Jehovah causes,
1:01:51 or sets in motion,
1:01:55 anything he wants to happen  in order to fulfill his purpose.
1:02:01 Now, we might accept  that Jehovah permits this or that
1:02:05 when it comes to problems
1:02:07 in this imperfect system of things
1:02:09 and, perhaps, situations
1:02:12 that one goes through  because of imperfection.
1:02:15 True.
1:02:16 But what about when  adjustments are made
1:02:20 within Jehovah’s theocratic organization?
1:02:24 Now what?
1:02:26 If we have a difficult time
1:02:28 adjusting to a change
1:02:30 because it doesn’t match  our thinking,
1:02:34 should we automatically conclude  that Jehovah
1:02:37 is simply permitting  this change?
1:02:41 Or is he, in fact,
1:02:43 causing it to happen?
1:02:47 Well, I want to consider  two Bible accounts with you
1:02:50 that are going to help  answer that question.
1:02:52 First one,
2 Chronicles chapter 11.
1:02:59 The setting is when  the ten tribes
1:03:02 withdrew their support  from Rehoboam.
1:03:05 They made  Jeroboam their king.
1:03:08 Rehoboam wanted  those ten tribes back,
1:03:12 no doubt thinking:  ‘They have no right to break away.
1:03:15 ‘Who do they think they are?
1:03:17 ‘In fact, breaking away,
1:03:19 ‘or splitting, the 12 tribes
1:03:21 ‘will only create  an abrupt change
1:03:24 ‘to a stable arrangement  which originated with God
1:03:28 ‘since the days of Moses.
1:03:30 I want them back.’
1:03:32 This was unexpected,  unsettling for Rehoboam.
1:03:35 And then Jehovah God
1:03:39 sends his prophet Shemaiah
1:03:41 to Rehoboam.
1:03:43 Second Chronicles 11,  let’s read verse 4:
1:03:48 “This is what Jehovah says:
1:03:50 “‘You must not go up
1:03:53 “‘and fight  against your [Rehoboam’s] brothers.
1:03:55 “‘Each of you return  to his house,
1:03:57 “‘for I [Jehovah]
1:04:00 “‘have caused this
1:04:02 to happen.’”
1:04:04 ‘I have caused
1:04:07 ‘this split  to happen, Rehoboam.
1:04:10 ‘I caused it.
1:04:11 ‘And anything that I cause  can only have good results.
1:04:15 ‘It’s going to be good.
1:04:17 I cause it;  it’s going to be good.’
1:04:19 And we too can discern
1:04:22 the possible benefits  of this split.
1:04:25 Think about it:
1:04:27 Individual Israelites  in either kingdom now
1:04:30 would have an opportunity  to demonstrate
1:04:32 if they would personally uphold  true worship
1:04:35 at the temple,  regardless of which king was ruling
1:04:38 and regardless of which territory  they lived in.
1:04:41 Jehovah’s patience,  his mercy,
1:04:45 his protection  would be magnified
1:04:48 as he now dealt  with two kingdoms
1:04:51 instead of one.
1:04:53 But we may wonder,
1:04:55 ‘Since Jehovah caused this,
1:04:58 why did the apostasy  occur afterwards?’
1:05:02 Well, Jehovah intended this split
1:05:06 to be a mere governmental division,
1:05:09 an organizational adjustment,
1:05:11 not a departure  from true worship
1:05:13 as centered  at the temple in Jerusalem.
1:05:16 If Jeroboam  had continued faithful,
1:05:20 that separate kingdom of Israel
1:05:23 would have continued  right alongside the kingdom of Judah.
1:05:27 They would have worked together  to honor and praise Jehovah God.
1:05:30 That would have been wonderful.  Jehovah would have made sure of that.
1:05:34 So Jehovah didn’t cause
1:05:37 the apostasy.
1:05:39 These problems,  or human flaws,
1:05:42 resulted when Rehoboam  and Jeroboam failed to see
1:05:47 that Jehovah expected obedience
1:05:49 no matter where they lived.
1:05:53 That’s the point:  They failed to cooperate
1:05:56 with the new reality  and reap the benefits
1:06:00 from what Jehovah  was causing to happen.
1:06:05 So, what first lesson  do we want you to think about,
1:06:08 to learn,  to have etched into your memory?
1:06:12 When Jehovah causes a change,  it can only be for the good.
1:06:18 All we need to do  is cooperate with the change
1:06:21 and see the cause, or see
1:06:25 what Jehovah  is setting in motion,
1:06:29 and then look to him  for a blessing on the outcome.
1:06:35 See, this divine precedent  teaches us
1:06:37 that it is vital
1:06:39 for you, for me,
1:06:42 vital to distinguish
1:06:44 the perfect cause
1:06:46 of Jehovah
1:06:49 from the imperfect flaws
1:06:51 of humans
1:06:53 who fail to cooperate
1:06:55 with what Jehovah God  is doing.
1:06:59 That’s point number one.
1:07:01 Let’s go on  to our second example.
1:07:03 This one has to do with Joseph.
1:07:06 The setting is when Joseph  was in Egypt,
1:07:10 and he’s making himself known  to his brothers.
1:07:13 Genesis chapter 45,  let’s open our Bibles there.
1:07:22 Chapter 45, verse 7,
1:07:26 notice what Joseph says  to his brothers, how he words this:
1:07:30 “But God sent me  ahead of you,”
1:07:35 sent me ahead of you,
1:07:37 “in order to preserve for you a remnant,”
1:07:39 there was a purpose,  “on the earth
1:07:42 and to keep you alive  by a great deliverance.”
1:07:45 Do we see that?
1:07:47 Jehovah didn’t merely permit  him to go to Egypt,
1:07:50 but he caused Joseph  to go to Egypt.
1:07:52 ‘I sent you;  I caused you to go ahead
1:07:55 to preserve a remnant.’
1:07:57 You see,  Joseph’s arrival in Egypt
1:08:00 was part  of Jehovah’s purpose
1:08:02 in creating the conditions
1:08:04 that would result  in preserving the offspring
1:08:07 that would lead to the Messiah.
1:08:09 However,
1:08:12 Jehovah causing a change,
1:08:15 at times,
1:08:17 the consequences  of that change
1:08:19 are not what we expect.
1:08:22 And that’s what we  have to think about.
1:08:24 He causes the change,  but the consequences
1:08:27 might not be  what we expect.
1:08:29 For example,  think about Joseph.
1:08:32 He becomes a slave.  He didn’t expect that.
1:08:35 He went to prison.  ‘I don’t expect this.
1:08:38 ‘I’m initially—  I’m treated severely.
1:08:41 I didn’t like that.’
1:08:43 See, Joseph suffered  many human injustices
1:08:46 or flaws  along the way.
1:08:51 He could have easily resisted,
1:08:53 proudly reasoned:  ‘Now, hold on here.
1:08:55 ‘Me? A slave?  A slave?
1:08:57 ‘The prophetic dreams  I received as a young man
1:09:01 ‘indicated that others  would bow down to me.
1:09:04 ‘I don’t see anyone  bowing down to me.
1:09:07 ‘I’m bowing down to others as a slave.  This doesn’t make sense.
1:09:10 ‘This is not turning out the way  I have expected
1:09:13 or preferred.’
1:09:15 In fact,  some 13 years would pass
1:09:18 before Joseph  would experience relief.
1:09:22 The changes in his life  were unexpected,
1:09:25 unclear, and unsettling.
1:09:28 But he didn’t ask: “Jehovah,
1:09:30 what are you doing to me?”
1:09:32 Rather, he humbly asked,
1:09:35 “What are you doing with me?”
1:09:38 See, unlike proud Rehoboam  and Jeroboam,
1:09:41 Joseph could see the cause
1:09:45 —what Jehovah  was setting in motion—
1:09:47 not the human flaws.
1:09:49 He could discern  the special work
1:09:52 to which he  had been appointed.
1:09:54 Why, he even reassured  his brothers
1:09:56 that Jehovah had directed
1:09:58 and caused  his relocation to Egypt,
1:10:01 and it served  for the preservation
1:10:03 of his family  and for all families of the earth.
1:10:05 He got that.
1:10:07 And what’s the lesson
1:10:09 that you really need  to think about?
1:10:12 Our personal response
1:10:15 —personal response— to what Jehovah causes
1:10:18 reveals a lot
1:10:20 about our humility  and our patience.
1:10:24 Our attitude, our response
1:10:27 can lead to a spiritual fall
1:10:30 or success.
1:10:32 Now, let’s  get specific with you.
1:10:35 How can you apply this?
1:10:39 There may be a time  when organizational adjustments
1:10:42 make it seem that Jehovah
1:10:44 has handcuffed your talents,
1:10:48 clipped your wings.
1:10:50 And maybe this adjustment  that you’re undergoing,
1:10:53 it just doesn’t match  your thinking.
1:10:56 What are you going to do then?  Now what happens?
1:10:59 Don’t let pride  get in the way.
1:11:01 If you let pride get in the way,  you could actually delay
1:11:05 the fruitage  of organizational decisions.
1:11:08 And that’s not what  you’ve been trained to do at Gilead.
1:11:11 It’s just the opposite.
1:11:13 We’ve talked for months  about how you need to get on board
1:11:16 with the organizational direction.
1:11:19 But now,  imagine if you begin to doubt
1:11:22 that instruction  from headquarters.
1:11:24 “It doesn’t really apply  to our country.
1:11:27 “Oh, these instructions,  they won’t work here.
1:11:30 “We’re different.  We do things differently.
1:11:33 “The brothers in New York,  they’re really not—
1:11:35 “They don’t understand  our circumstances.
1:11:37 We should apply it  in a different way.”
1:11:39 You see,  what have you just done?
1:11:42 If that type of thinking  begins to take root,
1:11:46 you will only hesitate  to implement
1:11:49 or halfheartedly support
1:11:52 the direction received.
1:11:54 And that’s not what  you’ve been trained to do.
1:11:59 So do you understand  how this might apply in the future?
1:12:02 And voicing such doubts  can only create
1:12:05 an unhealthy spirit  and weaken your brothers.
1:12:08 Instead, try to see  what Jehovah
1:12:12 is really causing to happen.
1:12:14 What is he causing to happen?
1:12:16 Jehovah God is training you  to better refine
1:12:20 such qualities as obedience  and patience and loyalty
1:12:23 so that you can be used  that much more
1:12:26 for Jehovah’s purpose,  honor, and glory.
1:12:31 For your spiritual health,
1:12:33 you want to view decisions  as from Jehovah,
1:12:36 causing his will to take place,
1:12:39 even if it is not convenient
1:12:41 or you don’t immediately discern  the real benefits.
1:12:44 There is no spiritual risk
1:12:48 in wholeheartedly supporting  decisions made
1:12:51 by Jehovah’s  spirit-directed organization.
1:12:55 See the cause,
1:12:58 not the flaws.
1:13:00 There are plenty of human flaws  to concentrate on.
1:13:03 Get away from that.
1:13:05 See what Jehovah  is setting in motion.
1:13:07 Once you see it,  help others to see it.
1:13:10 Like Joseph, use your words
1:13:12 to reassure and strengthen  your brothers.
1:13:14 And then do you know  what you will become part of?
1:13:16 What will you become a part of?
1:13:18 As Brother Sanderson said:
1:13:20 The Gilead legacy.
1:13:23 So stay  with that understanding.
1:13:26 Stay with that attitude.  Stay with that motive.
1:13:30 Let’s distill our discussion  down to three points:
1:13:34 (1)
1:13:36 Be careful not to assume  that Jehovah is permitting,
1:13:40 just permitting  an organizational adjustment,
1:13:42 when in reality he is far more likely causing it to happen.
1:13:47 (2) When Jehovah causes a change,
1:13:51 it can only be for good,
1:13:54 and (3) don’t be quick  to see the human flaws.
1:13:59 It takes patience and humility
1:14:02 to work along with Jehovah God  as he progressively causes
1:14:06 his purpose to go forward.
1:14:10 Your maturity,  your love for Jehovah God
1:14:14 and his way of doing things  has been clearly manifest
1:14:17 while you’ve attended Gilead School,  and that’s why Jehovah God loves you.
1:14:21 That’s why we love you.
1:14:23 So maintain this spirit as you work
1:14:26 along with God’s unfolding purpose.
1:14:31 For it is this attitude
1:14:33 that will lead  to your spiritual success.
1:14:36 It is this attitude  that will help you
1:14:39 to continue  to see the cause.
1:14:56 Well, we thank you very much,  Brother Noumair,
1:14:58 for that excellent discourse.
1:15:00 Well, now you have an opportunity  to participate in the program.
1:15:03 If you’d like to stand,  if you’re able,
1:15:05 we’re going to sing  song number 84
1:15:08 which is entitled  “Reaching Out,”
1:15:10 song 84.

00:01.017 --> 00:05.289
Well, dear brothers and sisters, 
it is my very great pleasure 


00:05.288 --> 00:08.758
to welcome you all 
to this graduation program 


00:08.758 --> 00:11.493
of the 142nd class 


00:11.493 --> 00:14.000
of the Watchtower Bible School 
of Gilead.


00:21.370 --> 00:23.840
We have satellite locations 
tied in 


00:23.840 --> 00:26.242
across the United States 
branch territory, 


00:26.242 --> 00:29.712
as well as our dear brothers 
in Canada and, of course, in time, 


00:29.712 --> 00:31.782
we expect that this will also be shown 


00:31.782 --> 00:34.317
to our brothers 
via JW Broadcasting. 


00:34.317 --> 00:36.585
So, what a large audience 
will benefit 


00:36.585 --> 00:38.588
from our program today! 


00:38.588 --> 00:41.090
Well, you students 
are truly loved. 


00:41.090 --> 00:43.760
I checked with the Bethel Office 
just yesterday 


00:43.760 --> 00:46.228
and found out 
that guests have come 


00:46.228 --> 00:48.565
from 40 different countries 


00:48.565 --> 00:50.767
to be a part 
of this graduation program. 


00:50.767 --> 00:52.000
Isn’t that wonderful?


00:58.575 --> 01:01.177
So we’re very much looking forward 


01:01.177 --> 01:03.747
to this spiritual feast 
that’s about to take place.


01:03.747 --> 01:05.949
So now, if you’re able, 
let’s stand 


01:05.948 --> 01:08.150
and sing 
song number 54, 


01:08.150 --> 01:11.587
“This Is the Way,” and then 
following the song, 


01:11.587 --> 01:13.924
Brother Robert Butler, 
a helper 


01:13.923 --> 01:16.258
to the Publishing Committee 
of the Governing Body, 


01:16.258 --> 01:20.000
will offer our opening prayer, 
song 54.


03:52.082 --> 03:54.950
Our marvelous God, Jehovah, 


03:54.950 --> 03:59.822
has the greatest 
and most far-reaching vision. 


03:59.822 --> 04:03.960
At Job 28:24, 


04:03.960 --> 04:08.563
we read: “For he looks 
to the ends of the earth, 


04:08.563 --> 04:12.201
and he sees everything 
under the heavens.” 


04:12.202 --> 04:15.839
Well, recognizing 
Jehovah’s almighty power 


04:15.838 --> 04:19.908
and his perfect penetrating vision, 


04:19.908 --> 04:22.711
it’s not surprising 
that the psalmist 


04:22.712 --> 04:24.847
prayed to Jehovah 
and expressed this 


04:24.847 --> 04:29.419
at Psalm 119:18. 


04:29.418 --> 04:32.555
Now, notice this very beautiful 
and heartfelt request 


04:32.555 --> 04:34.590
that the psalmist made. 


04:34.590 --> 04:38.327
He said: “Open my eyes 


04:38.327 --> 04:40.997
“so that I may see clearly 


04:40.997 --> 04:44.634
the wonderful things 
from your law.”


04:44.633 --> 04:46.635
Well now, Jehovah 


04:46.635 --> 04:48.638
has truly fulfilled 


04:48.638 --> 04:50.640
this prayerful request. 


04:50.640 --> 04:52.642
In our day, 


04:52.642 --> 04:55.312
even though 
2 Corinthians 4:4 


04:55.312 --> 04:58.247
tells us that Satan the Devil 
“has blinded 


04:58.247 --> 05:00.817
the minds of the unbelievers,” 


05:00.817 --> 05:03.485
Jehovah is opening up 


05:03.485 --> 05:06.622
the spiritual eyes 
of honesthearted ones 


05:06.622 --> 05:09.192
so that they 
can see the truth 


05:09.192 --> 05:11.194
that’s coming 
from his Word. 


05:11.193 --> 05:13.195
And it is truly amazing 


05:13.195 --> 05:15.197
to see how honesthearted ones 


05:15.197 --> 05:17.834
around this earth 
are receiving 


05:17.833 --> 05:19.835
spiritual sight from God.


05:19.835 --> 05:22.705
Just take 
this one experience. 


05:22.705 --> 05:25.375
In May 2015, 


05:25.375 --> 05:27.910
a Lutheran priest visited 


05:27.910 --> 05:31.513
the Finland branch office 
with a pioneer couple. 


05:31.513 --> 05:34.650
At Bethel, 
she was deeply impressed 


05:34.650 --> 05:37.920
with the warm, 
loving atmosphere that she saw. 


05:37.920 --> 05:40.188
After a month, she attended 


05:40.188 --> 05:43.860
the “Imitate Jesus!” 
Convention from Friday to Sunday. 


05:43.860 --> 05:46.062
Her workmates at the church 


05:46.062 --> 05:48.530
asked her to take good notes 
of the program 


05:48.530 --> 05:51.100
and to share them
—which she did. 


05:51.100 --> 05:54.170
In December 2015, 


05:54.170 --> 05:56.238
she visited the bishop 


05:56.238 --> 05:58.908
and resigned from her office 


05:58.908 --> 06:01.676
after 27 years 


06:01.677 --> 06:04.814
of service 
as an active priest. 


06:04.813 --> 06:07.483
The bishop started to cry 


06:07.483 --> 06:09.485
when she closed the door. 


06:09.485 --> 06:12.955
After resigning, 
she sent out this message: 


06:12.955 --> 06:15.892
“I have just resigned 
from the church. 


06:15.892 --> 06:18.694
“Now it is time 
for a new life 


06:18.693 --> 06:21.896
under Jehovah’s wise protection.” 


06:21.897 --> 06:24.634
In January of 2016, 


06:24.633 --> 06:27.703
she started serving 
as an unbaptized publisher, 


06:27.703 --> 06:30.138
and last year 
at the regional convention, 


06:30.138 --> 06:32.208
she was baptized. 


06:32.208 --> 06:35.010
She is now serving 
as an auxiliary pioneer 


06:35.010 --> 06:37.012
on a continuous basis, 


06:37.012 --> 06:40.750
and she says that she wants 
to have a share in public witnessing 


06:40.750 --> 06:43.085
with carts 
close to the church 


06:43.085 --> 06:46.822
where she served 
for decades. 


06:46.822 --> 06:48.825
Well now, 
isn’t this interesting though? 


06:48.825 --> 06:51.693
This is the last comment 
this dear sister made.


06:51.693 --> 06:54.196
She said, 
“As a young girl, 


06:54.197 --> 06:56.699
“I made a promise 
to serve God, 


06:56.698 --> 06:58.700
“but it wasn’t until now 


06:58.700 --> 07:01.237
“that I actually realized 
how God 


07:01.237 --> 07:03.239
wanted to be served.” 


07:03.238 --> 07:05.508
Aren’t we glad 
to welcome this sister 


07:05.508 --> 07:08.000
into our worldwide brotherhood?


07:15.685 --> 07:17.753
But going back 
to that Scriptural thought 


07:17.753 --> 07:20.355
in Psalm 119:18, 


07:20.355 --> 07:22.492
this is not simply the prayer 


07:22.492 --> 07:25.027
of honesthearted ones 
who are in the world. 


07:25.027 --> 07:27.964
Really, brothers, 
this is our prayer. 


07:27.963 --> 07:30.131
You see, 
we all want Jehovah 


07:30.132 --> 07:32.135
to open up our eyes 


07:32.135 --> 07:36.038
and help us 
to see his Word clearly. 


07:36.038 --> 07:39.775
Now, why is that 
so necessary for all of us? 


07:39.775 --> 07:43.512
Well, let’s just take 
one simple example from the Scriptures 


07:43.512 --> 07:46.315
of the faithful man Samuel. 


07:46.315 --> 07:49.918
Now, Samuel 
was obviously a very spiritual man; 


07:49.918 --> 07:52.155
he was a person 
who was used 


07:52.155 --> 07:54.423
throughout his life 
in Jehovah’s service. 


07:54.423 --> 07:56.958
But if you look 
at this account in 1 Samuel 


07:56.958 --> 07:59.061
chapter 16, 


07:59.062 --> 08:01.464
you’ll remember that here 


08:01.463 --> 08:04.133
Jehovah was sending 
Samuel to anoint 


08:04.133 --> 08:07.170
one of the sons of Jesse 
to become king. 


08:07.170 --> 08:09.172
Now, if you look at verse 7, 


08:09.172 --> 08:12.040
look at what Jehovah 
says to Samuel: 


08:12.040 --> 08:14.377
“Do not pay attention 


08:14.377 --> 08:16.412
“to his appearance 


08:16.412 --> 08:18.982
“and how tall he is, 


08:18.982 --> 08:21.750
“for I have rejected him. 


08:21.750 --> 08:24.020
“For the way man sees 


08:24.020 --> 08:26.555
“is not the way God sees, 


08:26.555 --> 08:29.825
“because mere man sees 
what appears to the eyes, 


08:29.825 --> 08:33.262
but Jehovah sees 
into the heart.”


08:33.262 --> 08:35.264
Well now, 
do you see the point? 


08:35.263 --> 08:38.800
Do you see why we need 
to beg Jehovah to open our eyes 


08:38.800 --> 08:41.270
and help us 
to see clearly his Word? 


08:41.270 --> 08:43.338
You see, 
our imperfection 


08:43.338 --> 08:45.641
affects our vision, 
doesn’t it? 


08:45.642 --> 08:48.979
Our culture, 
the way we were raised, 


08:48.978 --> 08:50.980
our fleshly inclinations 


08:50.980 --> 08:54.283
can all distort our vision. 


08:54.283 --> 08:57.620
We so much need Jehovah God 


08:57.620 --> 09:00.222
to open our eyes and help us 


09:00.222 --> 09:03.059
so that we can see matters clearly. 


09:03.058 --> 09:06.061
Well, for the past 74 years, 


09:06.062 --> 09:08.899
Gilead School has been a wonderful tool 


09:08.898 --> 09:12.100
to help fine spiritual men and women 


09:12.100 --> 09:14.303
to focus and sharpen 


09:14.303 --> 09:16.371
their spiritual vision. 


09:16.372 --> 09:19.909
Now, during your five and a half months 
of schooling, 


09:19.908 --> 09:22.978
you’ve had the pleasure 
to study God’s Word. 


09:22.978 --> 09:27.383
Now, this has not been 
just a dry academic exercise. 


09:27.383 --> 09:29.451
But really, what you’ve done 


09:29.452 --> 09:31.720
is you’ve focused a light 


09:31.720 --> 09:33.888
upon God’s Word, the Bible. 


09:33.888 --> 09:36.625
Now, we’re not talking 
about a little flashlight; 


09:36.625 --> 09:39.162
we’re talking about a floodlight. 


09:39.162 --> 09:41.964
And what has happened 
as a result? 


09:41.963 --> 09:44.066
Well, Jehovah has helped 


09:44.067 --> 09:46.069
you to see yourself; 


09:46.068 --> 09:48.803
he’s helped you 
to see the Scriptures; 


09:48.803 --> 09:51.540
he’s helped you 
to see your brothers; 


09:51.540 --> 09:54.443
he’s helped you 
to see your assignments 


09:54.443 --> 09:56.978
much more clearly 


09:56.978 --> 09:59.315
through the enlightening influence 


09:59.315 --> 10:01.517
of his precious Word, the Bible.


10:01.517 --> 10:03.954
Well, as a result of all of that, 


10:03.953 --> 10:06.888
you are no longer 
the people you were 


10:06.888 --> 10:08.890
when you arrived at Gilead. 


10:08.890 --> 10:10.927
You have changed. 


10:10.927 --> 10:14.030
But now, 
what are you going to do 


10:14.030 --> 10:16.098
with this wonderful gift 


10:16.098 --> 10:18.200
that you have been given 
by Jehovah, 


10:18.200 --> 10:21.003
this expanded spiritual vision 


10:21.003 --> 10:23.071
which has been extended to you? 


10:23.072 --> 10:25.675
Well, when you think about Gilead, 


10:25.675 --> 10:29.212
this school is something 
that is very close 


10:29.212 --> 10:32.114
to our hearts 
as Jehovah’s people. 


10:32.113 --> 10:35.616
It’s tied up 
with our spiritual parents, 


10:35.617 --> 10:37.954
our spiritual grandparents, 


10:37.953 --> 10:41.023
with the foundation 
of the work 


10:41.023 --> 10:44.093
in so many countries 
of this earth. 


10:44.093 --> 10:47.930
There is 
a wonderful spiritual legacy 


10:47.930 --> 10:50.065
associated with Gilead.


10:50.065 --> 10:52.702
Well, what do you 
want to do? 


10:52.702 --> 10:55.772
You want to become 
a part of that legacy. 


10:55.772 --> 10:58.574
You want to take the gift
that you have been given 


10:58.573 --> 11:01.576
by Jehovah and use it 
to strengthen 


11:01.577 --> 11:04.847
and stabilize 
the congregations, the fields, 


11:04.847 --> 11:08.150
the branch offices 
where you are going to serve. 


11:08.150 --> 11:10.318
And what a group 
you’re going to join! 


11:10.318 --> 11:12.588
Let me just give you 
some statistics. 


11:12.588 --> 11:14.590
At the present time, 


11:14.590 --> 11:17.727
Gilead graduates are serving 
in many fields of service. 


11:17.727 --> 11:22.665
For example, 
915 are serving as Bethelites, 


11:22.665 --> 11:26.968
880 serve 
as field missionaries, 


11:26.968 --> 11:30.840
496 serve 
as circuit overseers 


11:30.840 --> 11:33.108
or wives 
of circuit overseers, 


11:33.108 --> 11:37.045
244 serve 
as members of Branch 


11:37.045 --> 11:39.082
or Country Committees, 


11:39.082 --> 11:42.552
4 serve as Governing Body helpers, 


11:42.552 --> 11:46.222
and 2 are members 
of the Governing Body. 


11:46.222 --> 11:50.659
Well, when you think 
of all of these individuals 


11:50.658 --> 11:54.530
who are working hard to advance 
Kingdom interests around the world, 


11:54.530 --> 11:57.298
how much we want to praise 


11:57.298 --> 12:00.736
our magnificent, 
our wonderful God, Jehovah, 


12:00.737 --> 12:03.805
for what he’s done
by means of the Gilead School 


12:03.805 --> 12:07.208
and by means of his organization 
to open our eyes 


12:07.208 --> 12:09.878
and help us 
to see his Word clearly. 


12:09.878 --> 12:12.000
Don’t you agree, brothers?


12:20.722 --> 12:23.392
Well, I’m sure that all of us 
are looking forward to hearing 


12:23.392 --> 12:25.594
where our students 
are going to be going. 


12:25.593 --> 12:28.563
But before we reach 
that part in our program, 


12:28.563 --> 12:31.900
it’s appropriate 
that we hear a number of talks 


12:31.900 --> 12:35.070
that are going to give 
words of counsel, 


12:35.070 --> 12:38.407
words of encouragement, 
even words of comfort 


12:38.407 --> 12:41.144
that will build up 
not only the students 


12:41.143 --> 12:43.778
but all of us 
who will hear this program.


12:43.778 --> 12:47.916
First of all, we’re privileged to hear 
from a member of the Governing Body 


12:47.917 --> 12:49.919
Brother Stephen Lett. 


12:49.918 --> 12:53.055
He is going to speak to us 
this morning on the theme 


12:53.055 --> 12:58.000
“Imitate Jehovah’s Use of Memory,” 
Brother Lett.


13:06.702 --> 13:10.172
As you know, 
Ephesians 5:1 


13:10.172 --> 13:12.174
tells us 


13:12.173 --> 13:15.210
to “become imitators of God, 


13:15.210 --> 13:17.378
as beloved children.” 


13:17.378 --> 13:19.381
And if we think about it, 


13:19.382 --> 13:22.117
absolutely everything 


13:22.117 --> 13:25.687
we can learn about Jehovah 
is worthy of imitation, 


13:25.687 --> 13:28.557
and that includes
his use of memory, 


13:28.557 --> 13:32.394
as we will discuss 
during this talk. 


13:32.393 --> 13:36.331
But now first, we ask, 
What do we mean by memory? 


13:36.332 --> 13:39.535
Well, one encyclopedia says this: 


13:39.535 --> 13:43.472
“Memory is the faculty 
of the mind 


13:43.472 --> 13:46.142
“by which information 
is encoded, 


13:46.142 --> 13:49.445
stored, and retrieved.” 


13:49.445 --> 13:53.248
But, unfortunately, 
most of us struggle 


13:53.248 --> 13:56.651
with remembering 
things we want to remember 


13:56.652 --> 14:00.355
and not remembering 
things we would like to forget. 


14:00.355 --> 14:04.227
We remember 
what we want to forget; 


14:04.227 --> 14:07.395
we don’t remember 
what we want to remember. 


14:07.395 --> 14:09.865
It’s a struggle, isn’t it? 


14:09.865 --> 14:13.868
But if you think about it, 
to illustrate this: 


14:13.868 --> 14:17.540
I can’t remember 
where I left my glasses. 


14:17.540 --> 14:19.708
Where did I 
leave my glasses? 


14:19.708 --> 14:22.578
But I do remember 
in detail 


14:22.578 --> 14:25.000
how you offended me 
20 years ago.


14:30.685 --> 14:33.888
By the way, when someone 
comes up to me at a convention 


14:33.888 --> 14:37.358
or an assembly and says: 
“Do you remember my name?” 


14:37.358 --> 14:39.361
I say: “Well, Brother, 


14:39.362 --> 14:44.334
“I remember 
your first name, 


14:44.333 --> 14:46.935
“but I don’t remember 
your last name. 


14:46.935 --> 14:49.000
Your first name 
is Brother, right?” 


14:54.075 --> 14:57.000
Well, feel free to use 
that little trick if you want to.


15:00.248 --> 15:03.618
But even though it is 
a real challenge for us 


15:03.618 --> 15:07.021
as imperfect humans 
with imperfect memories 


15:07.022 --> 15:09.625
to imitate Jehovah’s perfect use 


15:09.625 --> 15:11.627
of his perfect memory, 


15:11.627 --> 15:13.929
we should work hard 
to try to do so. 


15:13.928 --> 15:16.965
In fact, 
we’re going to discuss four ways 


15:16.965 --> 15:20.102
in which Jehovah 
uses his memory 


15:20.102 --> 15:22.672
that we would do well 
to imitate.


15:22.672 --> 15:26.075
Now the first one, 
let’s identify what it is. 


15:26.075 --> 15:29.412
And you dear Gilead students, 
if you really work


15:29.412 --> 15:33.015
in these four areas, 
it will help you in your assignments. 


15:33.015 --> 15:37.000
But now, 
go to Hebrews chapter 6, please, 


15:38.520 --> 15:41.590
and let’s read 
verse number 10. 


15:41.590 --> 15:44.860
It says: 
“For God is not unrighteous 


15:44.860 --> 15:49.030
“so as to forget your work


15:49.030 --> 15:53.568
“and the love you showed 
for his name by ministering 


15:53.568 --> 15:57.706
and continuing to minister 
to the holy ones.”


15:57.707 --> 16:01.444
So you notice according to this scripture, 
Jehovah does not forget. 


16:01.443 --> 16:05.513
He always remembers 
our love for him 


16:05.513 --> 16:09.518
and our hard work 
in behalf of Kingdom interests. 


16:09.518 --> 16:11.520
In fact, 
the Insight book said: 


16:11.520 --> 16:14.757
‘An individual’s record 
of fine works 


16:14.757 --> 16:17.760
‘are like riches deposited 


16:17.760 --> 16:19.995
with the Creator in heaven.’ 


16:19.995 --> 16:22.097
So if you think about it, 


16:22.097 --> 16:25.000
every time that you 
go out in the ministry, 


16:25.000 --> 16:28.403
attend a meeting, 
help build a Kingdom Hall, 


16:28.403 --> 16:30.805
unselfishly help 
someone in need, 


16:30.805 --> 16:32.808
it’s like you make a deposit 


16:32.808 --> 16:34.910
in that great heavenly bank


16:34.910 --> 16:37.045
—Jehovah’s memory. 


16:37.045 --> 16:39.313
And he never forgets it. 


16:39.313 --> 16:41.316
And he shows 
his appreciation. 


16:41.317 --> 16:43.319
How so? 


16:43.318 --> 16:45.453
Well, he remembers 
to hear our prayers. 


16:45.453 --> 16:47.588
He remembers 
to give us holy spirit. 


16:47.588 --> 16:49.591
He remembers 
to rescue us 


16:49.592 --> 16:52.962
from anything 
that could harm us spiritually. 


16:52.962 --> 16:56.365
But now the question, 
How we can imitate 


16:56.365 --> 16:59.768
this first example 
of Jehovah’s use of memory?


16:59.768 --> 17:03.838
Well, as Jehovah 
doesn’t forget our love for him


17:03.838 --> 17:05.873
—our hard work—


17:05.873 --> 17:09.143
we don’t want to forget 
Jehovah’s love for us 


17:09.143 --> 17:12.013
and his hard work 
in our behalf. 


17:12.013 --> 17:15.083
He works so tirelessly, 
you could say, 


17:15.083 --> 17:17.118
in our behalf, doesn’t he? 


17:17.118 --> 17:19.253
As we said, 
remembering our prayers, 


17:19.253 --> 17:21.323
giving us holy spirit, 
helping us. 


17:21.323 --> 17:24.025
We don’t want 
to forget that; especially, 


17:24.025 --> 17:27.830
we want to remember all the times 
Jehovah has helped us in the past. 


17:27.830 --> 17:30.565
And we know he’s not going 
to abandon us now. 


17:30.565 --> 17:34.368
He’s going to help us now.
We want to be like David. 


17:34.368 --> 17:37.005
He said: “Jehovah, 
who rescued me 


17:37.005 --> 17:39.408
“from the claws 
of the lion and the bear, 


17:39.408 --> 17:43.345
“he is the one 
who will rescue me 


17:43.345 --> 17:45.480
from the hand 
of this Philistine.” 


17:45.480 --> 17:48.283
He remembered how Jehovah 
had always helped him. 


17:48.283 --> 17:50.818
He knew Jehovah 
would help him now. 


17:50.818 --> 17:53.055
An extended application: 


17:53.055 --> 17:56.057
We don’t want to take for granted
the hard work and the love 


17:56.057 --> 17:58.394
that others 
are showing for Jehovah. 


17:58.393 --> 18:01.330
And we want to, 
from time to time, commend them 


18:01.330 --> 18:04.165
and support them
—the hardworking elders, 


18:04.165 --> 18:07.135
hardworking ministerial servants 
and pioneers, 


18:07.135 --> 18:10.538
parents trying to raise 
their children properly, 


18:10.538 --> 18:14.408
children trying to keep 
their integrity to Jehovah. 


18:14.408 --> 18:16.811
See, take note of that, 
remember that, 


18:16.812 --> 18:18.814
commend and support.


18:18.813 --> 18:20.815
But now let’s get 
a second way 


18:20.815 --> 18:23.285
that Jehovah 
uses his memory. 


18:23.285 --> 18:25.853
Let’s go to Luke chapter 20, 


18:25.853 --> 18:30.791
and verse 38. 


18:30.792 --> 18:34.329
It says: “He is a God, 


18:34.328 --> 18:36.431
“not of the dead, 


18:36.432 --> 18:38.434
“but of the living, 


18:38.433 --> 18:41.035
for they are all 
living to him.” 


18:41.035 --> 18:43.038
Now what do we learn? 


18:43.038 --> 18:45.740
Well, Jehovah 
completely remembers 


18:45.740 --> 18:48.410
faithful ones 
who have died. 


18:48.410 --> 18:52.080
They’re living in his memory, 
and appropriately, 


18:52.080 --> 18:55.950
these ones are referred to 
as being in the memorial tombs 


18:55.950 --> 18:58.887
because Jehovah’s memory 
is involved. 


18:58.887 --> 19:00.989
Now, how can we 
imitate this example 


19:00.988 --> 19:02.991
of Jehovah’s use 
of memory? 


19:02.992 --> 19:05.860
Well, we don’t want 
to forget these faithful ones 


19:05.860 --> 19:07.863
who have died either. 


19:07.863 --> 19:11.733
And we have a lot 
of life stories, for example, 


19:11.733 --> 19:15.336
in our publications to help us remember 
them and their good qualities. 


19:15.337 --> 19:18.374
They’re good examples 
that we can keep learning from


19:18.373 --> 19:21.876
—for example, former members 
of the Governing Body, 


19:21.877 --> 19:24.479
such as Brother Klein; 


19:24.478 --> 19:27.950
other members 
of the anointed, 


19:27.950 --> 19:31.953
or ones of the anointed
—Sister Gertrud Pötzinger, 


19:31.953 --> 19:34.756
Georg Lindal, 
Bennett Brickell; 


19:34.757 --> 19:38.160
ones that had the earthy hope,
life stories about them


19:38.160 --> 19:40.695
—Brothers George Couch, 
Max Larson, 


19:40.695 --> 19:42.697
Robert Wallen. 


19:42.697 --> 19:46.702
And, of course, the Bible, as you know, 
contains numerous examples, doesn’t it, 


19:46.702 --> 19:50.339
of ones who have died 
that we don’t want to forget? 


19:50.338 --> 19:52.640
We want to keep reading about them, 


19:52.640 --> 19:54.843
meditating on their examples 


19:54.843 --> 19:56.845
and learning from them.


19:56.845 --> 19:59.648
Well, let’s get a third way, now, 


19:59.648 --> 20:02.383
that Jehovah uses his memory. 


20:02.383 --> 20:06.288
Let’s go to Joshua chapter 21, 


20:06.288 --> 20:09.558
and we’ll read verse 45, 


20:09.558 --> 20:13.000
Joshua 21:45: 


20:14.262 --> 20:16.765
“Not a promise failed 


20:16.765 --> 20:20.135
“out of all the good promises 
that Jehovah had made 


20:20.135 --> 20:22.137
“to the house of Israel; 


20:22.137 --> 20:25.140
all of them came true.” 


20:25.140 --> 20:27.943
Now, this scripture 
and several others show 


20:27.943 --> 20:30.478
that Jehovah 
never forgets his promises. 


20:30.478 --> 20:32.480
He remembers them, 


20:32.480 --> 20:36.252
and he fulfills all of his promises, 
doesn’t he? 


20:36.252 --> 20:38.254
In contrast, 


20:38.253 --> 20:40.555
speaking of politicians, 


20:40.555 --> 20:42.890
one writer made a comment: 


20:42.890 --> 20:45.560
“They promise the moon, 


20:45.560 --> 20:47.562
“but once they get into office, 


20:47.562 --> 20:51.000
they do well to deliver 
a moonbeam.” 


20:52.133 --> 20:56.036
Well, others have what has been labeled 
as a selective memory, 


20:56.037 --> 20:59.174
or selective amnesia, 
it’s been labeled, 


20:59.173 --> 21:02.376
regarding promises they’ve made, 
but not Jehovah. 


21:02.377 --> 21:05.414
And, of course, as Jehovah’s children, 
we want to imitate him; 


21:05.413 --> 21:07.415
remember our promises. 


21:07.415 --> 21:09.417
What promise especially? 


21:09.417 --> 21:11.487
Our dedication promise. 


21:11.487 --> 21:14.089
In our dedication vow, 


21:14.088 --> 21:17.125
we promised to do 
Jehovah’s will 


21:17.125 --> 21:19.127
unreservedly. 


21:19.127 --> 21:21.730
We promised that we 


21:21.730 --> 21:23.798
would put Jehovah’s will 
ahead of our own will. 


21:23.798 --> 21:25.800
That’s what we promised. 


21:25.800 --> 21:29.137
And what is the duration 
of this promise, 


21:29.137 --> 21:31.340
this most important promise 
we ever made? 


21:31.340 --> 21:33.342
Well, forever. 


21:33.342 --> 21:36.010
What if we die; we’re resurrected? 


21:36.010 --> 21:39.280
Well, are you 
going to have to get rebaptized 


21:39.280 --> 21:42.250
when you are resurrected 
or rededicate your life to Jehovah? 


21:42.250 --> 21:43.385
No. 


21:43.385 --> 21:45.920
Your dedication 
and baptism 


21:45.920 --> 21:48.623
endure even death 
and resurrection. 


21:48.623 --> 21:50.625
So he expects us 


21:50.625 --> 21:53.362
to fulfill that promise 
we have made. 


21:53.362 --> 21:55.497
Now, those of us 
who are married, 


21:55.497 --> 21:58.634
he expects us 
to fulfill our marriage vows. 


21:58.633 --> 22:01.636
Maybe we’ve made 
other promises to Jehovah. 


22:01.637 --> 22:04.005
For example, 
here at Gilead School, 


22:04.005 --> 22:07.408
you may have made promises 
to Jehovah. 


22:07.408 --> 22:09.945
Well, he expects us 
to remember 


22:09.945 --> 22:13.448
and fulfill 
those promises.


22:13.448 --> 22:17.085
But now, let’s get one more way
—a fourth way—Jehovah uses his memory. 


22:17.085 --> 22:20.422
Let’s go 
to Isaiah 43, please, 


22:20.422 --> 22:23.259
and this scripture 
will help us identify it, 


22:23.258 --> 22:27.161
Isaiah 43:25, 
Jehovah says: 


22:27.162 --> 22:30.399
“I, I am the One 


22:30.398 --> 22:33.935
“who is blotting out 
your transgressions 


22:33.935 --> 22:35.937
“for my own sake, 


22:35.937 --> 22:39.207
“and I will not remember 


22:39.207 --> 22:41.209
your sins.” 


22:41.208 --> 22:43.211
Now, very interestingly, 


22:43.212 --> 22:45.480
when Jehovah forgives a sin, 


22:45.480 --> 22:47.848
he refuses to remember


22:47.848 --> 22:49.851
—to recall it—


22:49.852 --> 22:52.654
to ever hold that sin 
against the person. 


22:52.653 --> 22:56.256
He chooses 
not to remember that sin. 


22:56.257 --> 23:00.195
The Watchtower some years ago 
said that Jehovah 


23:00.195 --> 23:02.730
“will never call to mind 


23:02.730 --> 23:04.833
our forgiven sins.” 


23:04.833 --> 23:07.635
Now that’s amazing 
use of memory, isn’t it? 


23:07.635 --> 23:09.637
Truly amazing. 


23:09.637 --> 23:12.307
Why does Jehovah choose, 


23:12.307 --> 23:15.810
you could say, 
to delete our forgiven sins? 


23:15.810 --> 23:19.000
Well, is it because he wants 
to make more room in his memory? 


23:21.483 --> 23:24.685
No. 
Jehovah has unlimited memory, doesn’t he? 


23:24.685 --> 23:26.755
He calls all of the trillions 


23:26.755 --> 23:29.090
of stars by name. 


23:29.090 --> 23:32.827
I have a hard time calling by name 
the some 20 commenters 


23:32.827 --> 23:36.164
at the Monday night 
Bethel family Watchtower Study. 


23:36.163 --> 23:39.433
Jehovah remembers 
in full detail 


23:39.433 --> 23:41.436
the billions 


23:41.437 --> 23:44.005
who are 
in the memorial tombs. 


23:44.005 --> 23:47.275
So memory capacity 
is not the problem, is it? 


23:47.275 --> 23:51.145
Jehovah forgives and forgets 


23:51.145 --> 23:53.648
because of his love and mercy.


23:53.648 --> 23:55.650
But now, how can we 


23:55.650 --> 23:58.187
imitate Jehovah here? 


23:58.187 --> 24:00.622
Well, we want 
to work hard 


24:00.622 --> 24:02.624
to freely forgive 


24:02.623 --> 24:05.960
as Jehovah does, 
but then we want to work hard 


24:05.960 --> 24:09.430
to try to delete that forgiven sin 
from our memories. 


24:09.430 --> 24:12.533
How do you delete something 
from your memory? 


24:12.533 --> 24:16.000
Well, you refuse 
to replay it, review it. 


24:17.505 --> 24:20.442
In contrast, if you want 
to remember something, 


24:20.442 --> 24:22.510
you do review it, 
don’t you? 


24:22.510 --> 24:24.512
If you want to remember 
someone’s name, 


24:24.512 --> 24:27.615
you keep repeating that 
to yourself


24:27.615 --> 24:30.285
—you want to remember 
a scripture, 


24:30.285 --> 24:33.788
a word in a language
you’re trying to learn. 


24:33.788 --> 24:36.525
On the other hand, if you don’t want 
to remember something, 


24:36.525 --> 24:39.527
you refuse to replay it
—you dismiss that thought


24:39.527 --> 24:41.597
like an immoral thought 
as an example. 


24:41.597 --> 24:44.399
The same way 
with forgiven sins, 


24:44.398 --> 24:46.535
we refuse to replay them. 


24:46.535 --> 24:50.638
We do our best, 
as 2 Corinthians 10:5 says, 


24:50.638 --> 24:53.175
to bring 
“every thought into captivity.” 


24:53.175 --> 24:56.243
“Make it obedient to the Christ.”


24:56.243 --> 24:58.513
Well, we have four ways 


24:58.513 --> 25:01.816
Jehovah uses his memory there 
that we’ve now discussed. 


25:01.817 --> 25:03.852
Did you get them? 


25:03.852 --> 25:07.322
(1) He remembers 
our love for him and our hard work 


25:07.322 --> 25:09.690
in behalf of Kingdom interests. 


25:09.690 --> 25:12.960
We want to remember his love 
and hard work on our behalf, 


25:12.960 --> 25:16.698
and by extension, 
the love and hard work of others. 


25:16.698 --> 25:20.101
(2) He never forgets 
faithful ones who have died. 


25:20.102 --> 25:22.104
Well, we don’t want 
to forget them either. 


25:22.103 --> 25:25.806
By means of the Bible, 
by means of life stories, 


25:25.807 --> 25:28.810
we can remember these ones 
and learn from them. 


25:28.810 --> 25:31.747
(3) He always remembers 


25:31.747 --> 25:34.049
his promises and fulfills them. 


25:34.048 --> 25:36.050
We want to do the same. 


25:36.050 --> 25:39.053
(4) He chooses not to remember, 


25:39.053 --> 25:42.856
completely forgets, 
our forgiven sins. 


25:42.857 --> 25:45.594
We want to work hard 
to do the same thing. 


25:45.593 --> 25:49.463
May we remember to forget. 


25:49.463 --> 25:52.000
You have to think about that.


25:53.302 --> 25:56.839
Well, likely you can think of other aspects 
of Jehovah’s use of memory 


25:56.838 --> 25:58.840
that would be 
worthy of imitation. 


25:58.840 --> 26:00.975
In fact, I’m going 
to give you students 


26:00.975 --> 26:03.143
that as a homework assignment. 


26:03.143 --> 26:06.748
Come up with some other examples 
of how Jehovah uses his memory 


26:06.748 --> 26:08.783
that we can imitate. 


26:08.783 --> 26:10.451
Now, I’ll get you started. 


26:10.452 --> 26:12.554
Psalm 103:14 


26:12.553 --> 26:15.390
says Jehovah remembers 


26:15.390 --> 26:17.425
that “we are dust.” 


26:17.425 --> 26:21.597
Now, how can we imitate 
that aspect of Jehovah’s memory? 


26:21.597 --> 26:23.965
Now, you’re used 
to homework assignments. 


26:23.965 --> 26:25.967
You’ve had them for five months. 


26:25.967 --> 26:28.202
Now you have another assignment. 


26:28.202 --> 26:30.805
But may Jehovah bless 


26:30.805 --> 26:33.408
each of you dear ones 


26:33.408 --> 26:35.543
as you strive, 


26:35.543 --> 26:37.545
with the help of holy spirit, 


26:37.545 --> 26:40.715
to imitate Jehovah’s use 


26:40.715 --> 26:43.000
of memory.


26:52.627 --> 26:55.230
Well, we sincerely thank you, 
Brother Lett, 


26:55.230 --> 26:57.465
for that fine talk, 
and you can be certain 


26:57.465 --> 27:00.000
that we will remember it. 


27:01.035 --> 27:04.172
Well next, we’re privileged to hear 
from Brother Saki Marais, 


27:04.172 --> 27:07.242
a helper to the Writing Committee 
of the Governing Body. 


27:07.242 --> 27:10.112
Brother Marais is going to speak 
to us on the subject 


27:10.112 --> 27:14.000
“With the Measure 
That You Measure Out.”


27:19.887 --> 27:23.392
We know that you as students 


27:23.392 --> 27:27.195
truly appreciated the privilege 


27:27.195 --> 27:31.398
to go through Gilead, 
to learn so many things. 


27:31.398 --> 27:33.468
And during this time, 


27:33.468 --> 27:35.470
you have been given 


27:35.470 --> 27:39.207
many things, 
many gifts, as it were. 


27:39.207 --> 27:42.444
And we know the scripture says 


27:42.443 --> 27:44.478
‘every good 


27:44.478 --> 27:46.546
‘and perfect gift 


27:46.547 --> 27:49.217
comes from Jehovah.’ 


27:49.217 --> 27:53.154
But now, 
how should we view this gift 


27:53.153 --> 27:55.923
that you have received? 


27:55.923 --> 27:58.993
The Bible helps us 
in a very interesting way 


27:58.993 --> 28:02.630
in Ephesians chapter 4, 


28:02.630 --> 28:06.267
Ephesians chapter 4, 


28:06.267 --> 28:09.770
and it says here in verse 7: 


28:09.770 --> 28:12.273
“Now undeserved kindness 


28:12.273 --> 28:15.710
“was given to each one of us 


28:15.710 --> 28:18.513
“according to how the Christ 


28:18.513 --> 28:20.915
measured out the free gift.”


28:20.915 --> 28:23.518
So it is a free gift. 


28:23.518 --> 28:25.520
We didn’t earn it. 


28:25.520 --> 28:27.588
We didn’t deserve it. 


28:27.588 --> 28:29.590
But nevertheless, 


28:29.590 --> 28:31.625
it came from the Christ, 


28:31.625 --> 28:34.962
and he measured it out to us


28:34.962 --> 28:37.000
—very kindly measured it out to us. 


28:39.633 --> 28:43.036
Now, what is the purpose 
of this gift? 


28:43.037 --> 28:46.074
Why did we get this gift? 


28:46.073 --> 28:48.341
He goes on to explain here 


28:48.342 --> 28:50.379
in chapter 4, 


28:50.378 --> 28:54.515
verse 8, 


28:54.515 --> 28:59.320
that he turns these individuals 


28:59.320 --> 29:01.823
who received these gifts 


29:01.823 --> 29:03.558
into gifts


29:03.558 --> 29:06.560
—they become gifts of men. 


29:06.560 --> 29:09.330
And now, we look at verse 10. 


29:09.330 --> 29:11.398
What is the purpose? 


29:11.398 --> 29:14.201
It’s “so that he might give 


29:14.202 --> 29:17.772
fullness to all things.” 


29:17.772 --> 29:20.775
Now, Christ gives out this gift 


29:20.775 --> 29:23.812
in many different ways, 


29:23.812 --> 29:28.650
many different manifestations 
of his gift. 


29:28.650 --> 29:31.318
For instance, 
look at verse 11. 


29:31.318 --> 29:34.588
Some are apostles, 
prophets, evangelizers, 


29:34.588 --> 29:36.623
shepherds, and teachers. 


29:36.623 --> 29:38.391
The purpose? 


29:38.392 --> 29:40.829
That each of these gifts 


29:40.828 --> 29:45.031
will share what they have 
in order to help 


29:45.032 --> 29:48.369
every member 
of the congregation. 


29:48.368 --> 29:51.471
If you look here 
in verses 12 and 13, 


29:51.472 --> 29:53.642
we read from the last part of verse 12: 


29:53.642 --> 29:56.410
“To build up 
the body of the Christ, 


29:56.410 --> 30:00.415
“until we all attain 


30:00.415 --> 30:02.450
“to the oneness of the faith 


30:02.450 --> 30:06.587
“and of the accurate knowledge 
of the Son of God, 


30:06.587 --> 30:09.357
“to being a full-grown man, 


30:09.357 --> 30:12.827
“attaining the measure of stature 


30:12.827 --> 30:16.697
that belongs 
to the fullness of the Christ.”


30:16.697 --> 30:19.167
This is wonderful, isn’t it? 


30:19.167 --> 30:21.169
Just to think 


30:21.168 --> 30:23.505
that Christ Jesus 
has given you 


30:23.505 --> 30:27.008
this wonderful gift, 
this ability 


30:27.008 --> 30:30.010
to build up 
the rest of the congregation


30:30.010 --> 30:34.000
—that is your obligation 
and your responsibility. 


30:36.885 --> 30:40.622
At 1 Peter 4:10, 


30:40.622 --> 30:44.692
an additional aspect 
about this gift is given to us. 


30:44.692 --> 30:49.197
Let us read at 1 Peter 4:10, 


30:49.197 --> 30:52.934
it says: 
“To the extent that each one 


30:52.933 --> 30:55.370
“has received a gift, 


30:55.370 --> 30:59.640
“use it in ministering 
to one another 


30:59.640 --> 31:04.278
“as fine stewards 
of God’s undeserved kindness 


31:04.278 --> 31:08.348
that is expressed 
in various ways.”


31:08.348 --> 31:10.885
So this is our opportunity 


31:10.885 --> 31:13.187
to use this gift 


31:13.187 --> 31:16.824
as a distributor, 
an administrator, 


31:16.823 --> 31:19.760
of God’s undeserved kindness. 


31:19.760 --> 31:21.762
But this gift 
is very different 


31:21.762 --> 31:24.365
from a normal gift 
that we would receive. 


31:24.365 --> 31:27.502
Why would this gift 
be different? 


31:27.502 --> 31:29.904
Normally, when you get a gift, 
what do you do? 


31:29.903 --> 31:33.000
You look at this gift and you think: 
‘I wonder what’s in it. 


31:34.408 --> 31:37.000
‘I wonder 
if I’m going to like it. 


31:38.847 --> 31:41.649
I wonder 
how I will use it.’ 


31:41.648 --> 31:45.453
That’s normally the case, 
but with this gift that we receive, 


31:45.453 --> 31:47.655
we receive the gift, 


31:47.655 --> 31:49.890
and we 
just simply give it on 


31:49.890 --> 31:53.227
without opening the gift. 


31:53.227 --> 31:57.332
This is our obligation 
with this gift that we’ve received. 


31:57.332 --> 31:59.800
Christ Jesus helps us 
to understand 


31:59.800 --> 32:02.070
how to administer 
this gift. 


32:02.070 --> 32:04.638
And we turn to Luke chapter 6, 


32:04.638 --> 32:08.508
verses 32-37, 


32:08.508 --> 32:11.000
Luke chapter 6, 


32:21.188 --> 32:23.223
starting with verse 32: 


32:23.223 --> 32:26.226
“If you love those loving you, 


32:26.227 --> 32:28.295
“of what credit is it to you? 


32:28.295 --> 32:31.698
“For even the sinners 
love those loving them. 


32:31.698 --> 32:34.701
“And if you do good 
to those doing good to you, 


32:34.702 --> 32:36.804
“of what credit is it to you? 


32:36.803 --> 32:39.340
“Even the sinners do the same. 


32:39.340 --> 32:42.577
“Also, if you lend to those 


32:42.577 --> 32:45.245
“from whom 
you expect repayment, 


32:45.245 --> 32:47.448
“of what credit is it to you? 


32:47.448 --> 32:49.550
“Even sinners lend to sinners 


32:49.550 --> 32:53.220
“so that they 
may get back as much. 


32:53.220 --> 32:55.255
“On the contrary, 


32:55.255 --> 32:57.858
“continue to love 


32:57.858 --> 33:00.260
“your enemies 


33:00.260 --> 33:03.563
“and to do good and to lend 


33:03.563 --> 33:06.433
“without hoping 
for anything back; 


33:06.433 --> 33:09.436
“and your reward will be great, 


33:09.437 --> 33:11.472
“and you will be 


33:11.472 --> 33:14.809
“sons of the Most High, 


33:14.808 --> 33:17.845
“for he is kind 


33:17.845 --> 33:21.648
“toward the unthankful 
and wicked. 


33:21.648 --> 33:24.318
“Continue being merciful, 


33:24.318 --> 33:26.920
“just as your Father is merciful. 


33:26.920 --> 33:30.090
“Moreover, stop judging, 


33:30.090 --> 33:32.427
“and you will 
by no means be judged; 


33:32.427 --> 33:34.429
“and stop condemning, 


33:34.428 --> 33:36.996
“and you will by no means 
be condemned. 


33:36.997 --> 33:39.400
“Keep on forgiving, 


33:39.400 --> 33:42.000
and you will be forgiven.”


33:45.038 --> 33:48.910
So we cannot be judges 


33:48.910 --> 33:52.580
of those to whom 
we give the gift. 


33:52.580 --> 33:56.250
We are not judges; 
we are not condemning people. 


33:56.250 --> 34:00.588
Our whole purpose 
of administering this gift 


34:00.588 --> 34:05.000
that we’ve received 
is to do so without any prejudice. 


34:06.127 --> 34:10.000
We do not judge 
the worthiness of the recipient. 


34:11.365 --> 34:14.502
We only take on our responsibility, 


34:14.502 --> 34:17.472
our dignity that we 
have been given by Jehovah


34:17.472 --> 34:20.000
—that of passing on the gift. 


34:22.008 --> 34:24.045
The second part, 


34:24.045 --> 34:27.748
apart 
from being completely unprejudiced, 


34:27.748 --> 34:31.418
the second part is that we 
must give freely and generously. 


34:31.418 --> 34:34.088
Now, we get to verse 37, 


34:34.088 --> 34:36.356
excuse me, verse 38: 


34:36.357 --> 34:39.160
“Practice giving, 


34:39.160 --> 34:42.062
“and people will give to you. 


34:42.062 --> 34:45.867
“They will pour 
into your laps a fine measure, 


34:45.867 --> 34:48.202
“pressed down, 
shaken together, 


34:48.202 --> 34:50.404
“and overflowing. 


34:50.403 --> 34:53.306
“For with the measure 


34:53.307 --> 34:56.210
“that you are measuring out, 


34:56.210 --> 34:58.345
“they will measure out 


34:58.345 --> 35:00.615
to you in return.”


35:00.615 --> 35:02.617
So Jehovah God 


35:02.617 --> 35:05.285
is extremely generous. 


35:05.285 --> 35:08.155
He makes the sun shine 


35:08.155 --> 35:10.992
and the rain 
come upon righteous 


35:10.992 --> 35:12.994
and the unrighteous. 


35:12.993 --> 35:15.395
And as Paul says: 
“He himself 


35:15.395 --> 35:17.732
“gives . . . life 


35:17.732 --> 35:20.802
and breath and all things” 


35:20.802 --> 35:22.804
to everyone. 


35:22.803 --> 35:25.405
And Jehovah is very interested 


35:25.405 --> 35:27.608
in how we administer 


35:27.608 --> 35:29.643
the gifts given into our hands. 


35:29.643 --> 35:31.911
That’s why it says 
‘with the measure 


35:31.912 --> 35:34.049
you measure out.’ 


35:34.048 --> 35:37.151
He is very interested 
to see whether we 


35:37.152 --> 35:40.822
do so very carefully.


35:40.822 --> 35:42.824
This is like the example 
of parents 


35:42.823 --> 35:45.091
that train their children 


35:45.092 --> 35:47.595
to make a contribution 
at the Kingdom Hall. 


35:47.595 --> 35:49.597
They give the child 
a little bit of money and they


35:49.597 --> 35:51.832
tell him to go put it 
in the contribution box. 


35:51.832 --> 35:54.802
Now, they expect the child to go 
and put it in the contribution box, 


35:54.802 --> 35:56.804
right, not to keep it for himself? 


35:56.803 --> 36:01.008
They also don’t expect the child 
to collect all the contributions 


36:01.008 --> 36:04.745
over a long period of time 
and then go make some big donation. 


36:04.745 --> 36:09.083
No, the parents 
are actually giving the contribution, 


36:09.083 --> 36:11.785
and they expect the child 
to do it the way they tell him. 


36:11.785 --> 36:15.890
Take it; go and put it 
in the contribution box now. 


36:15.890 --> 36:18.492
And so it is with Jehovah. 


36:18.492 --> 36:20.494
He is giving us this gift, 


36:20.493 --> 36:22.496
but we need to pass it on. 


36:22.497 --> 36:25.232
It is not for us to look 


36:25.232 --> 36:27.835
and to hold on to this gift. 


36:27.835 --> 36:31.172
So here’s the lesson: 
Be careful, 


36:31.172 --> 36:35.509
very careful, 
that you do not control 


36:35.508 --> 36:39.813
the gift that Jehovah 
gives you too closely. 


36:39.813 --> 36:43.583
Remember, 
the gift has to be passed on; 


36:43.583 --> 36:46.320
otherwise, 
we will lose Jehovah’s favor. 


36:46.320 --> 36:48.990
We cannot bury the talent 


36:48.990 --> 36:51.925
in the ground, as it were. 


36:51.925 --> 36:55.262
We receive it; we must spend it. 


36:55.262 --> 36:59.534
As much as we treasure it, 
we cannot hold on to it. 


36:59.533 --> 37:02.236
And so now we come 
to the key statement here: 


37:02.237 --> 37:06.000
“With the measure . . . 
you are measuring out,” 


37:07.942 --> 37:12.547
makes us sons 
of the Most High. 


37:12.547 --> 37:15.784
We cannot be more generous 
than Jehovah. 


37:15.783 --> 37:18.920
But does your generosity 


37:18.920 --> 37:23.190
match the generosity 
of Jehovah in your case? 


37:23.190 --> 37:26.427
Generosity has to become 
a habit for us,


37:26.427 --> 37:28.595
a way of life. 


37:28.595 --> 37:31.765
And here is 
another very important aspect: 


37:31.765 --> 37:34.968
Jehovah is giving 
not just anything; 


37:34.968 --> 37:39.006
he gives the very best. 


37:39.007 --> 37:43.210
He doesn’t hold back; 
he gives us the very best. 


37:43.210 --> 37:46.313
Let us read 
these most profound words 


37:46.313 --> 37:49.000
at Romans chapter 8,


37:51.185 --> 37:54.188
and in verse 32: 


37:54.188 --> 37:58.258
“Since he did not even spare 
his own Son 


37:58.258 --> 38:01.028
“but handed him over 
for us all, 


38:01.028 --> 38:03.430
“will he not also, 
along with him, 


38:03.430 --> 38:05.833
“kindly give us 


38:05.833 --> 38:08.000
all other things?”


38:09.303 --> 38:11.505
So Jehovah gives it all. 


38:11.505 --> 38:13.507
The principle for us: 


38:13.507 --> 38:15.910
With the measure we measure out, 


38:15.910 --> 38:18.178
it will be measured out to us. 


38:18.178 --> 38:20.313
This is an eternal truth. 


38:20.313 --> 38:22.316
We can count on it. 


38:22.317 --> 38:25.854
You’ve been given much; 
don’t hold back. 


38:25.853 --> 38:28.855
Give it all. 
Give your best. 


38:28.855 --> 38:32.793
The benefit 
is not in using the gift; 


38:32.793 --> 38:36.563
the benefit 
is in giving the gift. 


38:36.563 --> 38:39.500
For with the measure 


38:39.500 --> 38:44.000
you measure out,
it will be measured out to you.


38:54.482 --> 38:56.550
And we thank you very much, 
Brother Marais,


38:56.550 --> 38:59.020
for the beautiful gift 
that you gave us. 


38:59.020 --> 39:01.088
Now we’re looking forward 
to hearing 


39:01.088 --> 39:04.758
from another helper to the Writing Committee, 
Brother Robert Ciranko. 


39:04.758 --> 39:07.361
He’s going to speak 
to us today on the theme 


39:07.362 --> 39:10.000
“Is It All About You?”


39:15.635 --> 39:18.238
It is a rare privilege 
to be invited to attend


39:18.238 --> 39:21.941
the Watchtower Bible School 
of Gilead. 


39:21.942 --> 39:25.679
And in its 74-year history, 
only about 9,000 students 


39:25.678 --> 39:28.348
have graduated from this school. 


39:28.348 --> 39:31.751
Well, now at it’s current pace 
of two classes a year, 


39:31.752 --> 39:36.557
how long do you think it would take 
for all 67,000 special full-time servants 


39:36.557 --> 39:40.127
in the world to be able 
to attend Gilead? 


39:40.127 --> 39:43.164
Over 600 years. 


39:43.163 --> 39:45.966
So we rejoice with you students 


39:45.967 --> 39:48.169
for having been able to enjoy


39:48.168 --> 39:50.503
this excellent privilege.


39:50.503 --> 39:53.306
But now, 
we have to be cautious 


39:53.307 --> 39:56.577
when we think 
about the word “privilege.” 


39:56.577 --> 39:59.247
One dictionary says 
it is “a right 


39:59.247 --> 40:02.617
that is given to some people 
and not to others.” 


40:02.617 --> 40:06.987
So if not careful, 
we could wrongly assume that receiving this 


40:06.987 --> 40:09.924
or certain ther privileges 
in Jehovah’s organization 


40:09.923 --> 40:12.191
somehow elevates 
us above the rest 


40:12.192 --> 40:15.162
of Jehovah’s faithful servants. 


40:15.162 --> 40:17.499
And then by thinking that, 
we could start 


40:17.498 --> 40:20.366
to believe that it 
is all about us. 


40:20.367 --> 40:22.035
But is it?


40:22.035 --> 40:24.905
The same dictionary says 
that “privilege” can also mean 


40:24.905 --> 40:28.742
“a special opportunity 
to do something,” 


40:28.742 --> 40:31.179
and that is what 
we need to focus on 


40:31.178 --> 40:34.348
whenever we receive 
a privilege in God’s service


40:34.348 --> 40:38.285
—the opportunity 
it gives us to serve. 


40:38.285 --> 40:42.355
There was an incident with Jesus’ apostles 
that nicely illustrates this. 


40:42.355 --> 40:46.693
If you open your Bibles, please,
to Matthew the 19th chapter, 


40:46.693 --> 40:50.096
Matthew chapter 19, 
and keep your Bibles open there. 


40:50.097 --> 40:52.867
It was the year 33 
of our Common Era, 


40:52.867 --> 40:55.402
just days before Jesus’ life 
and ministry 


40:55.402 --> 40:57.672
would come 
to an abrupt end. 


40:57.672 --> 41:01.875
He and his disciples were traveling 
to Jerusalem for the Passover. 


41:01.875 --> 41:04.412
And a rich young ruler 
runs up to Jesus 


41:04.412 --> 41:07.280
and asks what he has to do 
to gain everlasting life, 


41:07.280 --> 41:09.048
and Jesus explained. 


41:09.048 --> 41:11.785
But the wealthy man 
was dismayed when he found out 


41:11.785 --> 41:15.022
that he would have to sell his belongings, 
give to the poor, 


41:15.022 --> 41:17.190
and follow Christ. 


41:17.190 --> 41:20.928
Well, taking this all in, 
one of Jesus’ apostles 


41:20.928 --> 41:23.163
pointed out that they 
had given up 


41:23.163 --> 41:26.566
their former vocations 
to follow Christ. 


41:26.567 --> 41:29.670
This is Matthew 19:27: 


41:29.670 --> 41:33.607
“Then Peter said 
in reply: ‘Look! 


41:33.607 --> 41:36.677
“‘We have left all things 
and followed you; 


41:36.677 --> 41:40.014
what, then, 
will there be for us?’”


41:40.013 --> 41:43.283
In modern parlance, 
Peter was asking, 


41:43.283 --> 41:45.418
“What’s in it for us?” 


41:45.418 --> 41:49.155
Well, Jesus doesn’t leave them wondering 
because in verse 28, 


41:49.155 --> 41:52.627
he promises them that when he 
gets into his Kingdom, 


41:52.627 --> 41:56.664
they eventually will sit
 on thrones with him. 


41:56.663 --> 42:00.666
And you can be sure that 
that prospect really stuck in their minds, 


42:00.667 --> 42:04.104
and they must have dwelled on it 
as they continued on their journey 


42:04.103 --> 42:06.140
to Jerusalem. 


42:06.140 --> 42:08.842
But a short time later, 
look at what happens 


42:08.842 --> 42:12.714
at Matthew 20:20: 


42:12.713 --> 42:16.716
“Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee 
approached him with her sons, 


42:16.717 --> 42:20.420
“doing obeisance and asking 
for something from him. 


42:20.420 --> 42:23.623
“He said to her: 
‘What do you want?’ 


42:23.623 --> 42:25.625
“She replied to him: 


42:25.625 --> 42:29.297
“‘Give the word that these two sons 
of mine may sit down, 


42:29.297 --> 42:33.800
one at your right hand and one at your left, 
in your Kingdom.’”


42:33.800 --> 42:37.572
Well, James and John 
probably put their mother up to that, 


42:37.572 --> 42:40.640
and how clever they 
must have thought they were 


42:40.640 --> 42:45.078
that they got to Jesus with their request 
before Peter or the others did! 


42:45.078 --> 42:47.246
And what was 
the reaction of the rest? 


42:47.247 --> 42:50.584
Look at verse 24: 
“When the ten others heard about it, 


42:50.583 --> 42:53.453
they became indignant 
at the two brothers.”


42:53.453 --> 42:55.455
They were upset with James and John 


42:55.455 --> 42:57.925
for trying to reserve for themselves 


42:57.925 --> 43:00.193
the best thrones in the Kingdom, 


43:00.193 --> 43:02.495
and they probably also wished 


43:02.495 --> 43:05.432
they had thought of the idea first. 


43:05.432 --> 43:09.235
Well, even before this, 
we know the apostles had argued 


43:09.235 --> 43:12.438
among themselves 
as to which one was the greatest. 


43:12.438 --> 43:15.041
So do you see 
what their problem was? 


43:15.042 --> 43:18.345
It was all about them. 


43:18.345 --> 43:21.848
These 12 men already enjoyed 
the special privilege 


43:21.848 --> 43:24.718
of having been chosen 
to be an apostle of Christ; 


43:24.718 --> 43:27.988
they were told 
of a future amazing privilege 


43:27.988 --> 43:30.923
to sit on thrones 
in the heavenly Kingdom; 


43:30.923 --> 43:34.828
and now they’re trying to secure 
something even more for themselves. 


43:34.828 --> 43:38.998
And what must have made this 
especially disheartening to Jesus 


43:38.998 --> 43:41.135
is what occurred 
just moments before. 


43:41.135 --> 43:43.170
Look at verse 17: 


43:43.170 --> 43:47.040
“While going up to Jerusalem, 
Jesus took the 12 disciples 


43:47.040 --> 43:50.510
“aside privately and said 
to them on the road: ‘Look! 


43:50.510 --> 43:53.647
“‘We are going up to Jerusalem, 
and the Son of man 


43:53.647 --> 43:56.884
“‘will be handed over 
to the chief priests and the scribes. 


43:56.883 --> 43:59.151
“‘They will condemn him to death 


43:59.152 --> 44:02.155
“‘and hand him over to men 
of the nations to be mocked 


44:02.155 --> 44:06.000
and scourged 
and executed on a stake.’”


44:07.862 --> 44:10.397
With all that Jesus 
had on his mind


44:10.397 --> 44:13.767
—preparing himself mentally 
and emotionally for what lay ahead—


44:13.767 --> 44:16.504
the last thing 
he should have been troubled with 


44:16.503 --> 44:19.740
was the apostles 
posturing themselves 


44:19.740 --> 44:22.142
for some sort of greatness. 


44:22.142 --> 44:25.079
But Jesus 
patiently took them aside 


44:25.078 --> 44:28.215
to impress upon them 
the right attitude. 


44:28.215 --> 44:30.350
Verse 25: 


44:30.350 --> 44:33.053
“But Jesus called them 
to him and said: 


44:33.053 --> 44:36.856
“‘You know that the rulers 
of the nations lord it over them 


44:36.857 --> 44:40.127
“‘and the great men 
wield authority over them. 


44:40.127 --> 44:43.030
“‘This must not be 
the way among you; 


44:43.030 --> 44:45.032
“‘but whoever 
wants to become great 


44:45.032 --> 44:47.167
“‘among you 
must be your minister, 


44:47.167 --> 44:49.169
“‘and whoever 
wants to be first 


44:49.168 --> 44:51.405
“‘among you 
must be your slave. 


44:51.405 --> 44:53.807
“‘Just as the Son of man came, 


44:53.807 --> 44:55.942
“‘not to be ministered to, 


44:55.942 --> 44:59.680
“‘but to minister 
and to give his life as a ransom 


44:59.680 --> 45:02.582
in exchange for many.’” 


45:02.582 --> 45:05.719
Yes, when Jesus came to earth, 
it was to minister


45:05.718 --> 45:07.921
—it was to serve others. 


45:07.922 --> 45:10.324
He was not aspiring 
to any positions 


45:10.323 --> 45:12.458
of honor or prestige, 


45:12.458 --> 45:15.828
and Jesus’ disciples 
needed that same disposition. 


45:15.828 --> 45:19.700
They needed to appreciate 
that the greatest person in the Kingdom 


45:19.700 --> 45:23.570
must be the one 
who humbly serves others. 


45:23.570 --> 45:27.207
You see, Jehovah bestows 
privileges on us, 


45:27.207 --> 45:30.277
not to give us 
some sense of entitlement, 


45:30.277 --> 45:33.480
but to create 
opportunities for us 


45:33.480 --> 45:37.000
to be more useful 
in our service to God. 


45:38.018 --> 45:40.453
To show that Jesus 
really meant what he said, 


45:40.453 --> 45:42.155
notice what happened next. 


45:42.155 --> 45:45.392
And by now, they are 
within a day’s journey of Jerusalem. 


45:45.392 --> 45:47.394
Verse 29: 


45:47.393 --> 45:50.730
“As they were going out of Jericho, 
a large crowd followed him. 


45:50.730 --> 45:54.033
“And look! two blind men 
sitting beside the road 


45:54.033 --> 45:57.771
“heard that Jesus 
was passing by and cried out: 


45:57.772 --> 46:01.575
“‘Lord, have mercy on us,
 Son of David!’ 


46:01.575 --> 46:03.910
“But the crowd rebuked them, 


46:03.910 --> 46:06.012
“telling them to keep silent; 


46:06.012 --> 46:08.349
“yet they cried all the louder, 
saying: 


46:08.348 --> 46:11.651
“‘Lord, have mercy on us, 
Son of David!’ 


46:11.652 --> 46:15.322
“So Jesus stopped, 
called them, and said: 


46:15.322 --> 46:18.992
“‘What do you want 
me to do for you?’ 


46:18.992 --> 46:22.864
“They said to him: 
‘Lord, let our eyes be opened.’ 


46:22.863 --> 46:25.598
“Moved with pity, 
Jesus touched their eyes, 


46:25.598 --> 46:27.801
“and immediately 
they recovered their sight, 


46:27.802 --> 46:30.437
and they followed him.”


46:30.437 --> 46:32.572
Imagine again how much 


46:32.572 --> 46:35.575
was weighing on Jesus’ heart 
at that very moment. 


46:35.575 --> 46:38.112
You see, he knew 
he was about to enter 


46:38.112 --> 46:40.447
the final week 
of his earthly life


46:40.447 --> 46:43.784
—that intense suffering 


46:43.783 --> 46:47.086
and a cruel death awaited him 
and that his integrity 


46:47.087 --> 46:49.624
to God was going 
to be put on the line. 


46:49.623 --> 46:51.691
And yet he does not ignore 


46:51.692 --> 46:54.000
the insistent cries 
of these desperate men. 


46:55.495 --> 46:57.497
Did you notice 
in verse 32 what Jesus 


46:57.497 --> 46:59.767
asked the two blind men? 


46:59.767 --> 47:02.569
He said: “What do you 
want me 


47:02.568 --> 47:04.638
to do for you?” 


47:04.638 --> 47:08.041
Now, what might we 
be tempted to say 


47:08.042 --> 47:11.745
if we see someone 
approaching us 


47:11.745 --> 47:14.582
and wanting to ask a favor, 


47:14.582 --> 47:16.717
or our help, for something? 


47:16.717 --> 47:20.020
Well, if we suspect that their request 
will be too distasteful 


47:20.020 --> 47:23.757
or time-consuming to fulfill, 
we might want to reserve for ourselves 


47:23.757 --> 47:26.360
the opportunity to delegate 
the task to someone else. 


47:26.360 --> 47:29.228
So we might just say, 
“What do you want?” 


47:29.228 --> 47:31.231
But not Jesus. 


47:31.232 --> 47:34.835
And on ever so many occasions, 
he was deeply moved 


47:34.835 --> 47:39.000
to serve the needs of others 
because it was never all about him.


47:40.207 --> 47:43.210
What a good lesson 
for us always to imitate. 


47:43.210 --> 47:45.478
You see, we can approach life 


47:45.478 --> 47:48.015
expecting to be 
a person of privilege 


47:48.015 --> 47:50.483
or, like Christ, we can use 


47:50.483 --> 47:52.751
the opportunities we are given 


47:52.752 --> 47:54.955
to serve 
in whatever capacity 


47:54.955 --> 47:58.392
we are allowed to do 
in Jehovah’s organization. 


47:58.392 --> 48:00.727
And for you dear members 


48:00.727 --> 48:03.297
of the 142nd class of Gilead, 


48:03.297 --> 48:05.732
we believe that you 
were already manifesting 


48:05.732 --> 48:07.734
that Christlike spirit 


48:07.733 --> 48:11.003
in your assignment, 
and that’s why you were chosen to attend 


48:11.003 --> 48:13.806
this 142nd class of Gilead. 


48:13.807 --> 48:15.809
Never lose that spirit. 


48:15.808 --> 48:19.145
Now soon, you’re going to go off 
with diploma in hand, aren’t you, 


48:19.145 --> 48:21.448
maybe to take on 
even more responsibility 


48:21.448 --> 48:23.450
than you had before? 


48:23.450 --> 48:26.253
And Jehovah has reserved 
a place for you 


48:26.253 --> 48:28.721
to serve him 
in his organization. 


48:28.722 --> 48:30.790
We are confident 
that you will remember 


48:30.790 --> 48:33.060
that it has not been 
all about you. 


48:33.060 --> 48:36.930
Rather, it has been about how you 
will use the fine education 


48:36.930 --> 48:40.833
you have received now 
at Gilead as an opportunity 


48:40.833 --> 48:44.436
to continually 
and humbly serve others, 


48:44.437 --> 48:48.000
and for that, 
Jehovah will richly bless you.


48:56.883 --> 48:59.686
We thank you very much, 
Brother Ciranko, 


48:59.687 --> 49:03.524
for those very heartwarming 
and very meaningful thoughts. 


49:03.523 --> 49:06.993
Well, now we’re going to begin 
to hear some comments 


49:06.993 --> 49:10.463
and thoughts from the instructors 
of the Gilead School. 


49:10.463 --> 49:13.333
First, we’re going to hear 
from Brother William Samuelson. 


49:13.333 --> 49:15.735
He’s going to speak to us 
on the subject 


49:15.735 --> 49:18.000
“Perfected Into One.”


49:20.640 --> 49:24.143
Some years ago, 
back in the 1700’s, 


49:24.143 --> 49:27.813
Thomas Paine, 
an American writer, said: 


49:27.813 --> 49:30.250
“It’s not in numbers 


49:30.250 --> 49:32.252
“but in unity 


49:32.252 --> 49:34.320
that great strength lies.” 


49:34.320 --> 49:36.357
Well, that reminded me 


49:36.357 --> 49:38.692
of a medical emergency 
that arose 


49:38.692 --> 49:41.529
at a district convention 
some years ago.


49:41.528 --> 49:44.731
A brother leaving the stadium 


49:44.732 --> 49:46.934
got to the sidewalk and fell 


49:46.933 --> 49:49.535
to the ground, 
or to the sidewalk, 


49:49.535 --> 49:51.672
apparently with a heart attack 


49:51.672 --> 49:53.774
or possibly a stroke. 


49:53.773 --> 49:57.643
Two ambulances 
eventually arrived, 


49:57.643 --> 50:00.646
and the two drivers 
got into a heated argument


50:00.647 --> 50:03.350
over who had the authority, 
or jurisdiction, 


50:03.350 --> 50:05.352
to transport our brother 


50:05.352 --> 50:08.289
to the nearest emergency ward. 


50:08.288 --> 50:10.490
Well, what was it that kept 


50:10.490 --> 50:12.692
these two drivers 


50:12.692 --> 50:15.329
from being effective 
at their job? 


50:15.328 --> 50:17.930
It was a lack of unity. 


50:17.930 --> 50:20.833
So I was thinking, 
‘How can you 


50:20.833 --> 50:23.703
‘promote unity 
in your job, 


50:23.703 --> 50:26.573
in your assignment, 
that you’ll be going to?’ 


50:26.573 --> 50:28.975
Well, there are 
any number of ways. 


50:28.975 --> 50:32.378
And the list that I’m going to give you, 
is just three, 


50:32.378 --> 50:35.481
and it is 
by no means exhaustive


50:35.482 --> 50:37.617
—good communication; 


50:37.617 --> 50:41.220
avoid promoting 
a personal agenda; 


50:41.220 --> 50:43.690
and if given oversight, 


50:43.690 --> 50:46.092
work within the boundaries 


50:46.092 --> 50:49.329
of the assignment 
and work hard 


50:49.328 --> 50:51.398
to be skilled at it.


50:51.398 --> 50:53.533
Good communication. 


50:53.533 --> 50:58.071
At the time of the emergency 
that I just mentioned, 


50:58.072 --> 51:00.740
an unauthorized person 


51:00.740 --> 51:02.808
called 911. 


51:02.808 --> 51:05.945
Now, that lack of communication


51:05.945 --> 51:08.013
—the unauthorized person 


51:08.013 --> 51:10.316
really should have communicated 


51:10.317 --> 51:12.685
with the attendants 
already on duty 


51:12.685 --> 51:15.088
and assigned 
to that particular job. 


51:15.088 --> 51:17.223
There were EMTs there, 


51:17.223 --> 51:20.593
but he saw what he thought 
was a serious situation 


51:20.593 --> 51:22.661
and called 911. 


51:22.662 --> 51:27.100
Now, that resulted in 911 


51:27.100 --> 51:29.903
sending the second ambulance. 


51:29.903 --> 51:31.971
We’ll talk about that 
a little later. 


51:31.972 --> 51:34.240
I got to thinking 
about a Bible account


51:34.240 --> 51:36.308
—a huge project 


51:36.308 --> 51:40.780
that failed because of lack 
of communication. 


51:40.780 --> 51:44.583
Now, you probably can think 
of any number, 


51:44.583 --> 51:48.121
and the one I’m going to talk about 
we usually think of in a negative way. 


51:48.122 --> 51:50.957
But turn 
to Genesis chapter 11, 


51:50.957 --> 51:54.294
and we’re going to look 
at verses 6 through 8 in particular, 


51:54.293 --> 51:58.365
and we won’t read all of it, 
but just a few little excerpts from it. 


51:58.365 --> 52:02.235
In verse 5: “Jehovah 
went down to see the city 


52:02.235 --> 52:05.505
and the tower,” 
the city and Tower of Babel. 


52:05.505 --> 52:09.042
They had a project.
“Jehovah then said: ‘Look! 


52:09.042 --> 52:12.312
They are one people,’” 
they’re united, 


52:12.312 --> 52:16.315
“‘with one language, and this 
is what they have started to do. 


52:16.315 --> 52:19.920
“‘Now there is nothing 
that they may have in mind to do 


52:19.920 --> 52:21.988
that will be impossible 
for them.’” 


52:21.988 --> 52:24.390
Because they 
had communication, 


52:24.390 --> 52:26.960
they were able 
to understand each other. 


52:26.960 --> 52:29.195
So Jehovah confused 
their languages. 


52:29.195 --> 52:31.197
But now, 
notice in verse 8, 


52:31.197 --> 52:34.567
he ‘scattered them 
over the entire face of the earth, 


52:34.567 --> 52:39.472
and they gradually left off 
building the tower.’ 


52:39.472 --> 52:41.809
Because they couldn’t communicate, 


52:41.808 --> 52:44.543
the project failed. 


52:44.543 --> 52:49.148
Well, when we examine 


52:49.148 --> 52:51.483
our own situation, 


52:51.483 --> 52:53.486
the Scriptures tell us—


52:53.487 --> 52:56.657
Paul wrote to the Philippians: 
“Look out 


52:56.657 --> 52:59.059
“not only 
for your own interests, 


52:59.058 --> 53:01.528
but also for the interests 
of others.” 


53:01.528 --> 53:03.530
How will you know 


53:03.530 --> 53:06.533
what is in the best interests 
of others 


53:06.533 --> 53:08.568
if you don’t communicate 
with them? 


53:08.568 --> 53:10.570
if you don’t talk to them? 


53:10.570 --> 53:12.872
if you don’t find out 
what their preferences are? 


53:12.872 --> 53:14.875
their thinking? their abilities? 


53:14.875 --> 53:17.643
And once you find out 
what these are, 


53:17.643 --> 53:20.780
then you act in harmony 


53:20.780 --> 53:24.050
with that and you look 
for their interests 


53:24.050 --> 53:26.920
rather than your own.


53:26.920 --> 53:29.088
The second point: 


53:29.088 --> 53:32.558
Avoid promoting 
a personal agenda. 


53:32.558 --> 53:34.593
Personal agenda 


53:34.593 --> 53:37.930
was defined this way 
in one publication: 


53:37.930 --> 53:41.702
“An ambitious scheme 
or plan of action 


53:41.702 --> 53:45.239
“designed to make things 
work out for your benefit 


53:45.238 --> 53:47.406
“or your convenience 


53:47.407 --> 53:52.079
or so that you 
can gain control.” 


53:52.078 --> 53:55.881
Control seems to sometimes be 
a dominant thing. 


53:55.882 --> 53:58.352
Well, in our initial illustration, 


53:58.352 --> 54:00.620
or example, our two drivers, 


54:00.620 --> 54:02.855
both had a personal agenda. 


54:02.855 --> 54:04.890
The first ambulance 


54:04.890 --> 54:08.127
had been radioed for 
and was on-site 


54:08.127 --> 54:11.732
because it had been employed 
by the convention. 


54:11.732 --> 54:14.367
It was there 
for just such an emergency, 


54:14.367 --> 54:18.505
and obviously that driver 
felt that he had jurisdiction. 


54:18.505 --> 54:21.975
But you remember 
our unauthorized brother 


54:21.975 --> 54:24.010
called 911. 


54:24.010 --> 54:27.213
Now, 911 dispatched 
an ambulance, 


54:27.213 --> 54:30.816
and our brother 
had collapsed on the sidewalk. 


54:30.817 --> 54:33.754
So he felt because it 
wasn’t inside the stadium, 


54:33.753 --> 54:36.388
it was on the sidewalk, 
and because he 


54:36.388 --> 54:38.525
had been dispatched 
by 911, 


54:38.525 --> 54:40.560
he had jurisdiction. 


54:40.560 --> 54:44.097
So the two of them 
had their own agenda. 


54:44.097 --> 54:46.365
Of course, our poor brother 
is laying here 


54:46.365 --> 54:48.368
not knowing 
what’s happening to him.


54:48.368 --> 54:50.370
Well, I got to thinking 


54:50.370 --> 54:52.738
about others in the Bible 


54:52.738 --> 54:55.175
that have gone out 
for their own agenda. 


54:55.175 --> 54:56.743
Satan obviously tops the list. 


54:56.743 --> 54:58.878
He had an agenda. 
He wanted worship. 


54:58.878 --> 55:02.448
But what about Korah, 
Dathan, Abiram? 


55:02.448 --> 55:04.783
Turn to Numbers 


55:04.783 --> 55:08.688
chapter 16, 


55:08.688 --> 55:12.525
verses 8 through 11, 
but we’re not going to read all of that. 


55:12.525 --> 55:14.527
You remember the account. 


55:14.527 --> 55:17.864
In fact, 
I think you studied it in detail. 


55:17.863 --> 55:20.466
But in verse 8: 


55:20.467 --> 55:23.235
“Moses then said to Korah: 
‘Listen, please, 


55:23.235 --> 55:25.238
“‘you sons of Levi. 


55:25.238 --> 55:28.408
“‘Does it seem to you 
such a little thing 


55:28.408 --> 55:30.443
“‘that the God of Israel 


55:30.443 --> 55:33.780
“‘has separated you 
from the assembly of Israel 


55:33.780 --> 55:37.383
“‘and allowed you
 to approach him in order to perform 


55:37.383 --> 55:39.418
“‘the service
 of Jehovah’s tabernacle 


55:39.418 --> 55:41.486
and to stand 
before the assembly?’” 


55:41.487 --> 55:44.624
In other words, 
you’ve been given a special privilege. 


55:44.623 --> 55:48.361
Now, does that seem 
like such a little thing to you? 


55:48.362 --> 55:50.430
In verse 10, he said: 


55:50.430 --> 55:54.400
“Must you also try 
to secure the priesthood?” 


55:54.400 --> 55:57.737
Well, if you think about this matter 
of a personal agenda, 


55:57.737 --> 56:01.674
in your assignments, 
you can contribute much 


56:01.673 --> 56:04.076
to the unity 
of the group you’re with,


56:04.077 --> 56:06.079
the branch, the department. 


56:06.078 --> 56:09.015
But if you start thinking 
about how this is going to give 


56:09.015 --> 56:11.017
honor and glory to you, 


56:11.017 --> 56:13.352
you could start thinking 
about getting 


56:13.352 --> 56:15.789
as much responsibility 
as you can


56:15.788 --> 56:18.256
—working for your own interests 


56:18.257 --> 56:20.260
rather than 
the interests of others, 


56:20.260 --> 56:22.262
getting or developing 


56:22.262 --> 56:24.330
a personal agenda. 


56:24.330 --> 56:27.633
So in addition 
to the special privileges you have 


56:27.633 --> 56:30.903
in full-time service, 
must you also 


56:30.903 --> 56:34.506
try to get something else? 
try to get something greater?


56:34.507 --> 56:38.177
Two others 
that fell victim to this 


56:38.177 --> 56:40.980
were James and John. 


56:40.980 --> 56:44.917
Turn to the book of Mark, 


56:44.917 --> 56:47.254
and again we’re just going to glance 


56:47.253 --> 56:49.388
at a couple of the scriptures, 
a couple of the verses. 


56:49.388 --> 56:51.858
Here, you remember
—and Brother Ciranko 


56:51.858 --> 56:55.361
already commented on this account
—James and John. 


56:55.362 --> 56:57.764
One account said 
they got their mother to do it, 


56:57.763 --> 57:00.500
but they knew, 
Jesus knew. 


57:00.500 --> 57:03.737
He answered them, 
and they said: “Teacher,” 


57:03.737 --> 57:06.139
verse 35, chapter 10, 
“Teacher, 


57:06.138 --> 57:09.975
we want you to do for us 
whatever we ask of you.” 


57:09.975 --> 57:12.312
‘We’ve got a personal agenda. 


57:12.312 --> 57:14.814
‘We want to sit 
on your right hand and your left. 


57:14.813 --> 57:17.216
‘We want to have honor; 
we want to have authority. 


57:17.217 --> 57:19.252
You see, we want this.’ 


57:19.252 --> 57:22.455
Well, without doing all 
of the details here, 


57:22.455 --> 57:26.558
verse 41, 
what did it do to the unity 


57:26.558 --> 57:29.161
of the group of the 12? 


57:29.162 --> 57:32.965
Verse 41: 
“When the ten others heard about it, 


57:32.965 --> 57:35.235
“they became indignant 


57:35.235 --> 57:37.703
at James and John.” 


57:37.703 --> 57:40.105
It didn’t help 
the unity of the group 


57:40.105 --> 57:42.108
with a personal agenda. 


57:42.108 --> 57:45.245
And so it is with you. 


57:45.245 --> 57:48.848
If you promote 
a personal agenda, 


57:48.848 --> 57:52.051
it’s not going to help 
the unity of the department 


57:52.052 --> 57:56.824
or the branch 
that you’re serving with.


57:56.823 --> 58:00.025
We might think, 
in conclusion, 


58:00.025 --> 58:02.062
of an illustration 


58:02.062 --> 58:04.130
of an orchestra. 


58:04.130 --> 58:06.132
Before a performance, 


58:06.132 --> 58:08.802
all of the instruments 
in an orchestra 


58:08.802 --> 58:11.004
generally adjust 


58:11.003 --> 58:13.038
to a single pitch


58:13.038 --> 58:15.641
—one generated sometimes 


58:15.642 --> 58:18.044
by an electronic tone generator. 


58:18.043 --> 58:21.948
Now, once they have been tuned 
to a single tone, 


58:21.948 --> 58:24.550
all of the instruments 
are automatically 


58:24.550 --> 58:26.552
tuned to each other. 


58:26.552 --> 58:30.122
And so it is if you listen 
to the one tone, 


58:30.122 --> 58:32.992
you will all 
be tuned together. 


58:32.992 --> 58:36.395
You remember Jesus 
in his prayer 


58:36.395 --> 58:40.333
to his Father 
in John 17 before his death. 


58:40.333 --> 58:43.736
He prayed that they 
would be in union, 


58:43.737 --> 58:46.405
that they 
would be together as one. 


58:46.405 --> 58:51.310
If you turn to John 17:21, 


58:51.310 --> 58:55.482
he said: “So that they may all be one,” 
in his prayer to his Father, 


58:55.482 --> 58:58.752
“just as you, Father, are in union with me,” 
in other words, 


58:58.752 --> 59:01.087
united, one, 


59:01.087 --> 59:04.290
“. . . that they also may be 
in union with us, 


59:04.290 --> 59:07.860
so that the world may believe 
that you sent me.” 


59:07.860 --> 59:11.000
But now, 
drop down to verse 23: 


59:12.265 --> 59:14.968
“In union with them and you—”


59:14.968 --> 59:19.371
“I in union with them 
and you in union with me, 


59:19.372 --> 59:23.442
in order that they 
may be perfected into one.” 


59:23.442 --> 59:28.247
Now, notice the footnote 
on “perfected into one.” 


59:28.247 --> 59:33.185
It says: 
“Or ‘be completely unified.’” 


59:33.185 --> 59:37.823
So for stability in the branch, 
the department, 


59:37.823 --> 59:39.891
whatever your assignment is, 


59:39.892 --> 59:43.664
unity is a must; 
it has to be. 


59:43.663 --> 59:46.765
Just as you’ve done 
for the past 20 weeks, 


59:46.765 --> 59:48.768
we encourage you to continue 


59:48.768 --> 59:51.503
to work together, united


59:51.503 --> 59:53.906
—perfectly, completely united—


59:53.907 --> 59:56.309
perfected into one. 


59:56.308 --> 1:00:00.145
As Gilead graduates, 
make sure you do your part 


1:00:00.145 --> 1:00:02.482
to help your brothers and sisters 


1:00:02.482 --> 1:00:06.000
become perfected into one.


1:00:15.328 --> 1:00:17.863
We thank you very much, 
Brother Samuelson, 


1:00:17.863 --> 1:00:20.065
for those 
very practical comments. 


1:00:20.065 --> 1:00:22.835
I know the students 
are going to benefit from them. 


1:00:22.835 --> 1:00:25.170
Well, now we’re looking forward 
to hearing a talk 


1:00:25.170 --> 1:00:29.142
from another of our Gilead instructors, 
Brother Mark Noumair. 


1:00:29.142 --> 1:00:33.000
His theme for us today 
is “See the Cause.”


1:00:34.513 --> 1:00:37.183
Well, this is a time 
of great change 


1:00:37.183 --> 1:00:39.385
for Jehovah’s people, 


1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:42.888
and you students 
have seen it firsthand 


1:00:42.888 --> 1:00:44.890
by being invited to Gilead. 


1:00:44.890 --> 1:00:46.892
In fact, some of you 


1:00:46.892 --> 1:00:49.495
will receive 
a change of assignment 


1:00:49.495 --> 1:00:51.497
after Gilead. 


1:00:51.497 --> 1:00:54.900
And still others 
might receive a change 


1:00:54.900 --> 1:00:57.803
in their circumstances
once they get back 


1:00:57.803 --> 1:00:59.871
to their branch territory. 


1:00:59.872 --> 1:01:03.142
So change 
will be a part of your life. 


1:01:03.142 --> 1:01:05.645
And although change can be good, 


1:01:05.645 --> 1:01:08.080
many find unexpected change 


1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:10.417
stressful or even unsettling. 


1:01:10.417 --> 1:01:12.819
We may find ourselves asking, 


1:01:12.818 --> 1:01:14.886
‘Why me?’ 


1:01:14.887 --> 1:01:18.759
And that question 
is not a sign of weak faith. 


1:01:18.758 --> 1:01:21.960
Rather, it is healthy to ask why 


1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:25.998
because when you ask 
the question why, 


1:01:25.998 --> 1:01:30.268
you usually 
begin to explore the cause 


1:01:30.268 --> 1:01:33.338
behind the change.


1:01:33.338 --> 1:01:36.941
Now, a careful study 
of Bible history 


1:01:36.942 --> 1:01:40.414
reveals that Jehovah God 
is a Master of change. 


1:01:40.413 --> 1:01:42.415
He loves change. 


1:01:42.415 --> 1:01:45.350
In fact, when we studied 
the New World Translation, 


1:01:45.350 --> 1:01:48.587
Appendix A-4, 
what did we learn? 


1:01:48.587 --> 1:01:51.457
We learned
that Jehovah causes, 


1:01:51.457 --> 1:01:55.795
or sets in motion, 


1:01:55.795 --> 1:02:00.000
anything he wants to happen 
in order to fulfill his purpose. 


1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:05.303
Now, we might accept 
that Jehovah permits this or that 


1:02:05.303 --> 1:02:07.606
when it comes to problems 


1:02:07.607 --> 1:02:09.609
in this imperfect system of things 


1:02:09.608 --> 1:02:12.211
and, perhaps, situations 


1:02:12.212 --> 1:02:15.214
that one goes through 
because of imperfection. 


1:02:15.213 --> 1:02:16.415
True. 


1:02:16.415 --> 1:02:20.185
But what about when 
adjustments are made 


1:02:20.185 --> 1:02:24.490
within Jehovah’s theocratic organization? 


1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:26.125
Now what? 


1:02:26.125 --> 1:02:28.527
If we have a difficult time 


1:02:28.527 --> 1:02:30.597
adjusting to a change 


1:02:30.597 --> 1:02:34.034
because it doesn’t match 
our thinking, 


1:02:34.033 --> 1:02:37.770
should we automatically conclude 
that Jehovah 


1:02:37.770 --> 1:02:41.673
is simply permitting 
this change? 


1:02:41.673 --> 1:02:43.708
Or is he, in fact, 


1:02:43.708 --> 1:02:47.113
causing it to happen?


1:02:47.113 --> 1:02:50.148
Well, I want to consider 
two Bible accounts with you 


1:02:50.148 --> 1:02:52.351
that are going to help 
answer that question. 


1:02:52.352 --> 1:02:57.000
First one, 
2 Chronicles chapter 11. 


1:02:59.858 --> 1:03:02.461
The setting is when 
the ten tribes 


1:03:02.462 --> 1:03:05.197
withdrew their support 
from Rehoboam. 


1:03:05.197 --> 1:03:08.367
They made 
Jeroboam their king. 


1:03:08.367 --> 1:03:12.037
Rehoboam wanted 
those ten tribes back, 


1:03:12.037 --> 1:03:15.475
no doubt thinking: 
‘They have no right to break away. 


1:03:15.475 --> 1:03:17.477
‘Who do they think they are? 


1:03:17.477 --> 1:03:19.545
‘In fact, breaking away, 


1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:21.547
‘or splitting, the 12 tribes 


1:03:21.547 --> 1:03:24.484
‘will only create 
an abrupt change 


1:03:24.483 --> 1:03:28.386
‘to a stable arrangement 
which originated with God 


1:03:28.387 --> 1:03:30.389
‘since the days of Moses. 


1:03:30.388 --> 1:03:32.391
I want them back.’ 


1:03:32.392 --> 1:03:35.795
This was unexpected, 
unsettling for Rehoboam. 


1:03:35.795 --> 1:03:39.065
And then Jehovah God 


1:03:39.065 --> 1:03:41.900
sends his prophet Shemaiah 


1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:43.903
to Rehoboam. 


1:03:43.903 --> 1:03:47.000
Second Chronicles 11, 
let’s read verse 4: 


1:03:48.507 --> 1:03:50.544
“This is what Jehovah says: 


1:03:50.543 --> 1:03:53.011
“‘You must not go up


1:03:53.012 --> 1:03:55.549
“‘and fight 
against your [Rehoboam’s] brothers. 


1:03:55.548 --> 1:03:57.883
“‘Each of you return 
to his house, 


1:03:57.883 --> 1:04:00.520
“‘for I [Jehovah] 


1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.722
“‘have caused this 


1:04:02.722 --> 1:04:04.724
to happen.’”


1:04:04.723 --> 1:04:07.025
‘I have caused 


1:04:07.025 --> 1:04:10.162
‘this split 
to happen, Rehoboam. 


1:04:10.162 --> 1:04:11.730
‘I caused it. 


1:04:11.730 --> 1:04:15.735
‘And anything that I cause 
can only have good results. 


1:04:15.735 --> 1:04:17.337
‘It’s going to be good. 


1:04:17.337 --> 1:04:19.872
I cause it; 
it’s going to be good.’ 


1:04:19.872 --> 1:04:22.209
And we too can discern 


1:04:22.208 --> 1:04:25.611
the possible benefits 
of this split. 


1:04:25.612 --> 1:04:27.614
Think about it: 


1:04:27.613 --> 1:04:30.515
Individual Israelites 
in either kingdom now 


1:04:30.515 --> 1:04:32.585
would have an opportunity 
to demonstrate 


1:04:32.585 --> 1:04:35.053
if they would personally uphold 
true worship 


1:04:35.053 --> 1:04:38.256
at the temple, 
regardless of which king was ruling 


1:04:38.257 --> 1:04:41.994
and regardless of which territory 
they lived in.


1:04:41.993 --> 1:04:45.698
Jehovah’s patience, 
his mercy, 


1:04:45.698 --> 1:04:48.766
his protection 
would be magnified 


1:04:48.767 --> 1:04:51.570
as he now dealt 
with two kingdoms 


1:04:51.570 --> 1:04:53.638
instead of one. 


1:04:53.638 --> 1:04:55.808
But we may wonder, 


1:04:55.808 --> 1:04:58.676
‘Since Jehovah caused this, 


1:04:58.677 --> 1:05:02.249
why did the apostasy 
occur afterwards?’ 


1:05:02.248 --> 1:05:06.118
Well, Jehovah intended this split 


1:05:06.118 --> 1:05:09.088
to be a mere governmental division, 


1:05:09.088 --> 1:05:11.156
an organizational adjustment, 


1:05:11.157 --> 1:05:13.625
not a departure 
from true worship 


1:05:13.625 --> 1:05:16.995
as centered 
at the temple in Jerusalem. 


1:05:16.995 --> 1:05:20.767
If Jeroboam 
had continued faithful, 


1:05:20.767 --> 1:05:23.569
that separate kingdom of Israel 


1:05:23.568 --> 1:05:27.105
would have continued 
right alongside the kingdom of Judah. 


1:05:27.105 --> 1:05:30.575
They would have worked together 
to honor and praise Jehovah God. 


1:05:30.575 --> 1:05:34.047
That would have been wonderful. 
Jehovah would have made sure of that.


1:05:34.047 --> 1:05:37.717
So Jehovah didn’t cause 


1:05:37.717 --> 1:05:39.752
the apostasy. 


1:05:39.752 --> 1:05:42.889
These problems, 
or human flaws, 


1:05:42.888 --> 1:05:47.191
resulted when Rehoboam 
and Jeroboam failed to see 


1:05:47.192 --> 1:05:49.995
that Jehovah expected obedience 


1:05:49.995 --> 1:05:53.032
no matter where they lived. 


1:05:53.032 --> 1:05:56.769
That’s the point: 
They failed to cooperate 


1:05:56.768 --> 1:06:00.038
with the new reality 
and reap the benefits 


1:06:00.038 --> 1:06:04.000
from what Jehovah 
was causing to happen.


1:06:05.110 --> 1:06:08.113
So, what first lesson 
do we want you to think about, 


1:06:08.113 --> 1:06:12.718
to learn, 
to have etched into your memory? 


1:06:12.718 --> 1:06:17.000
When Jehovah causes a change, 
it can only be for the good. 


1:06:18.590 --> 1:06:21.693
All we need to do 
is cooperate with the change 


1:06:21.693 --> 1:06:25.831
and see the cause, or see 


1:06:25.832 --> 1:06:29.369
what Jehovah 
is setting in motion, 


1:06:29.368 --> 1:06:33.000
and then look to him 
for a blessing on the outcome.


1:06:35.073 --> 1:06:37.776
See, this divine precedent 
teaches us 


1:06:37.777 --> 1:06:39.779
that it is vital 


1:06:39.778 --> 1:06:42.113
for you, for me, 


1:06:42.113 --> 1:06:44.216
vital to distinguish 


1:06:44.217 --> 1:06:46.619
the perfect cause 


1:06:46.618 --> 1:06:49.021
of Jehovah 


1:06:49.022 --> 1:06:51.424
from the imperfect flaws 


1:06:51.423 --> 1:06:53.425
of humans 


1:06:53.425 --> 1:06:55.427
who fail to cooperate 


1:06:55.427 --> 1:06:58.000
with what Jehovah God 
is doing. 


1:06:59.032 --> 1:07:01.034
That’s point number one.


1:07:01.033 --> 1:07:03.468
Let’s go on 
to our second example. 


1:07:03.468 --> 1:07:06.205
This one has to do with Joseph. 


1:07:06.205 --> 1:07:10.408
The setting is when Joseph 
was in Egypt, 


1:07:10.408 --> 1:07:13.845
and he’s making himself known 
to his brothers. 


1:07:13.845 --> 1:07:17.000
Genesis chapter 45, 
let’s open our Bibles there. 


1:07:22.755 --> 1:07:26.692
Chapter 45, verse 7, 


1:07:26.692 --> 1:07:30.462
notice what Joseph says 
to his brothers, how he words this: 


1:07:30.462 --> 1:07:35.134
“But God sent me 
ahead of you,” 


1:07:35.133 --> 1:07:37.201
sent me ahead of you, 


1:07:37.202 --> 1:07:39.805
“in order to preserve for you a remnant,” 


1:07:39.805 --> 1:07:42.340
there was a purpose, 
“on the earth 


1:07:42.340 --> 1:07:45.210
and to keep you alive 
by a great deliverance.”


1:07:45.210 --> 1:07:47.245
Do we see that? 


1:07:47.245 --> 1:07:50.648
Jehovah didn’t merely permit 
him to go to Egypt, 


1:07:50.648 --> 1:07:52.985
but he caused Joseph 
to go to Egypt. 


1:07:52.985 --> 1:07:55.453
‘I sent you; 
I caused you to go ahead 


1:07:55.453 --> 1:07:57.656
to preserve a remnant.’ 


1:07:57.657 --> 1:08:00.259
You see, 
Joseph’s arrival in Egypt 


1:08:00.258 --> 1:08:02.393
was part 
of Jehovah’s purpose 


1:08:02.393 --> 1:08:04.863
in creating the conditions 


1:08:04.863 --> 1:08:07.733
that would result 
in preserving the offspring 


1:08:07.733 --> 1:08:09.968
that would lead to the Messiah. 


1:08:09.968 --> 1:08:12.303
However, 


1:08:12.303 --> 1:08:15.406
Jehovah causing a change, 


1:08:15.407 --> 1:08:17.409
at times, 


1:08:17.408 --> 1:08:19.811
the consequences 
of that change 


1:08:19.812 --> 1:08:22.380
are not what we expect. 


1:08:22.380 --> 1:08:24.850
And that’s what we 
have to think about. 


1:08:24.850 --> 1:08:27.318
He causes the change, 
but the consequences 


1:08:27.318 --> 1:08:29.888
might not be 
what we expect. 


1:08:29.888 --> 1:08:32.023
For example, 
think about Joseph. 


1:08:32.023 --> 1:08:35.693
He becomes a slave. 
He didn’t expect that. 


1:08:35.693 --> 1:08:38.863
He went to prison. 
‘I don’t expect this. 


1:08:38.863 --> 1:08:41.400
‘I’m initially— 
I’m treated severely. 


1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:43.402
I didn’t like that.’ 


1:08:43.402 --> 1:08:46.672
See, Joseph suffered 
many human injustices 


1:08:46.672 --> 1:08:50.000
or flaws 
along the way. 


1:08:51.010 --> 1:08:53.278
He could have easily resisted, 


1:08:53.278 --> 1:08:55.280
proudly reasoned: 
‘Now, hold on here. 


1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:57.617
‘Me? A slave? 
A slave? 


1:08:57.617 --> 1:09:01.087
‘The prophetic dreams 
I received as a young man 


1:09:01.087 --> 1:09:04.457
‘indicated that others 
would bow down to me. 


1:09:04.457 --> 1:09:07.125
‘I don’t see anyone 
bowing down to me. 


1:09:07.125 --> 1:09:10.595
‘I’m bowing down to others as a slave. 
This doesn’t make sense. 


1:09:10.595 --> 1:09:13.698
‘This is not turning out the way 
I have expected 


1:09:13.698 --> 1:09:15.766
or preferred.’ 


1:09:15.767 --> 1:09:18.437
In fact, 
some 13 years would pass 


1:09:18.437 --> 1:09:22.207
before Joseph 
would experience relief. 


1:09:22.207 --> 1:09:25.912
The changes in his life 
were unexpected, 


1:09:25.912 --> 1:09:28.247
unclear, and unsettling. 


1:09:28.247 --> 1:09:30.449
But he didn’t ask: “Jehovah, 


1:09:30.448 --> 1:09:32.585
what are you doing to me?” 


1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:35.387
Rather, he humbly asked, 


1:09:35.387 --> 1:09:38.657
“What are you doing with me?”


1:09:38.657 --> 1:09:41.860
See, unlike proud Rehoboam 
and Jeroboam, 


1:09:41.860 --> 1:09:45.363
Joseph could see the cause


1:09:45.363 --> 1:09:47.566
—what Jehovah 
was setting in motion—


1:09:47.567 --> 1:09:49.769
not the human flaws. 


1:09:49.768 --> 1:09:52.638
He could discern 
the special work 


1:09:52.638 --> 1:09:54.673
to which he 
had been appointed. 


1:09:54.673 --> 1:09:56.675
Why, he even reassured 
his brothers 


1:09:56.675 --> 1:09:58.710
that Jehovah had directed 


1:09:58.710 --> 1:10:01.180
and caused 
his relocation to Egypt, 


1:10:01.180 --> 1:10:03.182
and it served 
for the preservation 


1:10:03.182 --> 1:10:05.617
of his family 
and for all families of the earth. 


1:10:05.617 --> 1:10:07.820
He got that.


1:10:07.820 --> 1:10:09.822
And what’s the lesson 


1:10:09.822 --> 1:10:12.290
that you really need 
to think about? 


1:10:12.290 --> 1:10:15.127
Our personal response


1:10:15.127 --> 1:10:18.864
—personal response—
to what Jehovah causes 


1:10:18.863 --> 1:10:20.865
reveals a lot 


1:10:20.865 --> 1:10:24.437
about our humility 
and our patience. 


1:10:24.437 --> 1:10:27.607
Our attitude, our response 


1:10:27.607 --> 1:10:30.109
can lead to a spiritual fall 


1:10:30.108 --> 1:10:32.510
or success.


1:10:32.510 --> 1:10:35.313
Now, let’s 
get specific with you. 


1:10:35.313 --> 1:10:38.000
How can you apply this? 


1:10:39.252 --> 1:10:42.822
There may be a time 
when organizational adjustments 


1:10:42.822 --> 1:10:44.824
make it seem that Jehovah 


1:10:44.823 --> 1:10:48.060
has handcuffed your talents, 


1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:50.362
clipped your wings. 


1:10:50.362 --> 1:10:53.299
And maybe this adjustment 
that you’re undergoing, 


1:10:53.298 --> 1:10:56.035
it just doesn’t match 
your thinking. 


1:10:56.035 --> 1:10:59.137
What are you going to do then? 
Now what happens? 


1:10:59.137 --> 1:11:01.940
Don’t let pride 
get in the way. 


1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:05.343
If you let pride get in the way, 
you could actually delay 


1:11:05.343 --> 1:11:08.546
the fruitage 
of organizational decisions. 


1:11:08.547 --> 1:11:11.084
And that’s not what 
you’ve been trained to do at Gilead. 


1:11:11.083 --> 1:11:13.085
It’s just the opposite. 


1:11:13.085 --> 1:11:16.355
We’ve talked for months 
about how you need to get on board 


1:11:16.355 --> 1:11:19.625
with the organizational direction. 


1:11:19.625 --> 1:11:22.360
But now, 
imagine if you begin to doubt 


1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:24.397
that instruction 
from headquarters. 


1:11:24.397 --> 1:11:27.265
“It doesn’t really apply 
to our country. 


1:11:27.265 --> 1:11:30.668
“Oh, these instructions, 
they won’t work here. 


1:11:30.668 --> 1:11:33.205
“We’re different. 
We do things differently. 


1:11:33.205 --> 1:11:35.340
“The brothers in New York, 
they’re really not— 


1:11:35.340 --> 1:11:37.508
“They don’t understand 
our circumstances. 


1:11:37.508 --> 1:11:39.845
We should apply it 
in a different way.” 


1:11:39.845 --> 1:11:42.347
You see, 
what have you just done?


1:11:42.347 --> 1:11:46.185
If that type of thinking 
begins to take root, 


1:11:46.185 --> 1:11:49.722
you will only hesitate 
to implement 


1:11:49.722 --> 1:11:52.457
or halfheartedly support 


1:11:52.457 --> 1:11:54.494
the direction received. 


1:11:54.493 --> 1:11:59.163
And that’s not what 
you’ve been trained to do. 


1:11:59.163 --> 1:12:02.500
So do you understand 
how this might apply in the future? 


1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:05.103
And voicing such doubts 
can only create 


1:12:05.103 --> 1:12:08.240
an unhealthy spirit 
and weaken your brothers. 


1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.243
Instead, try to see 
what Jehovah 


1:12:12.243 --> 1:12:14.646
is really causing to happen. 


1:12:14.647 --> 1:12:16.649
What is he causing to happen? 


1:12:16.648 --> 1:12:20.018
Jehovah God is training you 
to better refine 


1:12:20.018 --> 1:12:23.421
such qualities as obedience 
and patience and loyalty 


1:12:23.422 --> 1:12:26.225
so that you can be used 
that much more 


1:12:26.225 --> 1:12:29.000
for Jehovah’s purpose, 
honor, and glory.


1:12:31.030 --> 1:12:33.598
For your spiritual health, 


1:12:33.598 --> 1:12:36.601
you want to view decisions 
as from Jehovah, 


1:12:36.602 --> 1:12:39.037
causing his will to take place, 


1:12:39.037 --> 1:12:41.074
even if it is not convenient 


1:12:41.073 --> 1:12:44.576
or you don’t immediately discern 
the real benefits. 


1:12:44.577 --> 1:12:48.514
There is no spiritual risk 


1:12:48.513 --> 1:12:51.483
in wholeheartedly supporting 
decisions made 


1:12:51.483 --> 1:12:55.020
by Jehovah’s 
spirit-directed organization. 


1:12:55.020 --> 1:12:58.090
See the cause, 


1:12:58.090 --> 1:13:00.458
not the flaws. 


1:13:00.458 --> 1:13:03.395
There are plenty of human flaws 
to concentrate on. 


1:13:03.395 --> 1:13:05.397
Get away from that. 


1:13:05.397 --> 1:13:07.632
See what Jehovah 
is setting in motion. 


1:13:07.632 --> 1:13:10.235
Once you see it, 
help others to see it. 


1:13:10.235 --> 1:13:12.237
Like Joseph, use your words 


1:13:12.237 --> 1:13:14.840
to reassure and strengthen 
your brothers. 


1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.908
And then do you know 
what you will become part of? 


1:13:16.908 --> 1:13:18.910
What will you become a part of? 


1:13:18.910 --> 1:13:20.912
As Brother Sanderson said: 


1:13:20.912 --> 1:13:23.649
The Gilead legacy. 


1:13:23.648 --> 1:13:26.318
So stay 
with that understanding. 


1:13:26.318 --> 1:13:30.321
Stay with that attitude. 
Stay with that motive.


1:13:30.322 --> 1:13:34.427
Let’s distill our discussion 
down to three points: 


1:13:34.427 --> 1:13:36.429
(1) 


1:13:36.428 --> 1:13:40.465
Be careful not to assume 
that Jehovah is permitting, 


1:13:40.465 --> 1:13:42.902
just permitting 
an organizational adjustment, 


1:13:42.902 --> 1:13:47.874
when in reality he is far more likely
causing it to happen. 


1:13:47.873 --> 1:13:51.143
(2) When Jehovah causes a change, 


1:13:51.143 --> 1:13:54.245
it can only be for good, 


1:13:54.245 --> 1:13:59.050
and (3) don’t be quick 
to see the human flaws. 


1:13:59.050 --> 1:14:02.087
It takes patience and humility 


1:14:02.087 --> 1:14:06.292
to work along with Jehovah God 
as he progressively causes 


1:14:06.292 --> 1:14:09.000
his purpose to go forward. 


1:14:10.828 --> 1:14:14.398
Your maturity, 
your love for Jehovah God 


1:14:14.398 --> 1:14:17.568
and his way of doing things 
has been clearly manifest 


1:14:17.568 --> 1:14:21.506
while you’ve attended Gilead School, 
and that’s why Jehovah God loves you. 


1:14:21.507 --> 1:14:23.542
That’s why we love you. 


1:14:23.542 --> 1:14:26.879
So maintain this spirit as you work 


1:14:26.878 --> 1:14:31.115
along with God’s unfolding purpose. 


1:14:31.115 --> 1:14:33.218
For it is this attitude 


1:14:33.218 --> 1:14:36.521
that will lead 
to your spiritual success. 


1:14:36.522 --> 1:14:39.759
It is this attitude 
that will help you 


1:14:39.758 --> 1:14:44.000
to continue 
to see the cause.


1:14:56.442 --> 1:14:58.644
Well, we thank you very much, 
Brother Noumair, 


1:14:58.643 --> 1:15:00.645
for that excellent discourse.


1:15:00.645 --> 1:15:03.715
Well, now you have an opportunity 
to participate in the program. 


1:15:03.715 --> 1:15:05.717
If you’d like to stand, 
if you’re able, 


1:15:05.717 --> 1:15:08.120
we’re going to sing 
song number 84 


1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:10.588
which is entitled 
“Reaching Out,” 


1:15:10.588 --> 1:18:15.958
song 84.

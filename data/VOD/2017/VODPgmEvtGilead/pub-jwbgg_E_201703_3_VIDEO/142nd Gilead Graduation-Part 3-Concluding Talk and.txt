00:00 Well, 100 classes ago,
00:04 in September of 1966,
00:07 the 42nd class of Gilead graduated.
00:11 Here’s their picture.
00:13 Now, if you look carefully  back in the left corner,
00:16 you’ll see a young man
00:18 who graduated on that day.
00:21 That is our beloved Brother David Splane.
00:26 And so it seemed appropriate  to mention this occasion,
00:30 being that it’s 100 classes ago.
00:32 I did say classes, not years.
00:38 We’re now looking forward  to hearing from our dear Brother Splane.
00:42 He is going to give us the talk
00:44 “Don’t Forget the Purpose.”
00:49 I’m glad they didn’t get ahold  of my baby picture.
00:53 That was my baby picture.
01:01 Well, I know  that all of you students will agree
01:06 that Gilead School
01:08 has been a marvelous expression
01:11 of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness
01:15 —a dream come true.
01:18 But, really,  all of us have been recipients
01:21 of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness  in so many ways.
01:24 All of us have received  training in so many ways.
01:28 So, really, the apostle Paul’s words
01:30 recorded at 2 Corinthians chapter 6  can apply to all of us.
01:35 Let’s look it up —2 Corinthians chapter 6.
01:42 We’re going to read verses 1 and 2
01:46 —2 Corinthians 6:1, 2.
01:51 And here Paul writes:
01:53 “Working together with him,
01:57 “we also urge you
01:59 “not to accept  the undeserved kindness of God
02:03 and miss its purpose.”
02:06 That’s the theme of the talk,  “Don’t Forget the Purpose.”
02:09 And then verse 2 says:
02:11 “For he says:
02:13 “‘In an acceptable time I heard you,
02:16 and in a day of salvation I helped you.’
02:20 “Look!  Now is the especially acceptable time.
02:25 Look!  Now is the day of salvation.”
02:31 Now, let’s focus first of all  on the first words
02:34 that Paul writes here,  “working together with him.”
02:40 That really explains  why Paul’s ministry was such a success.
02:46 Now, Paul was a worker,  but it wasn’t enough to be a worker.
02:51 Paul’s ministry was successful
02:54 because Paul was working  together with Jehovah God.
02:59 It was Jehovah’s purpose that counted.
03:03 As Brother Samuelson  brought out this morning,
03:06 it was Jehovah’s agenda  that counted with the apostle Paul.
03:11 Well, our goal should be the same.
03:15 And we could be tested at times.
03:18 Perhaps back home  you’re waiting for a decision
03:22 and the decision  is a long-time coming.
03:26 And you could be tempted to run ahead  as we’ve heard this morning
03:30 —act on your own.
03:32 You’d be working.
03:34 But when that temptation arises,  keep repeating to yourself
03:38 “working together with him,”
03:41 “working together with him,”
03:44 and it’ll help.
03:46 It’ll help you to work within the bounds
03:48 that the organization has set.
03:51 And we heard about that  this morning as well.
03:54 Now, notice at the beginning of verse 2,
03:57 Paul has been doing some reading.
04:00 His first words are “for he says,”
04:04 and then Paul quotes Scripture.
04:07 And it will be useful for us
04:09 to look up the scripture  that Paul is quoting,
04:13 because it helps us  to understand his thinking.
04:15 When Paul was reading this verse,  or this passage,
04:19 what was it that helped him  to make the connection
04:22 with the idea of working  together with Jehovah?
04:25 The scripture, Isaiah 49:8, 9.
04:32 So let’s read that
04:34 —Isaiah 49:8, 9.
04:40 Now, as I read this,
04:43 I’d like you to see if you can guess
04:45 when this scripture  had its first fulfillment.
04:48 It has two fulfillments.
04:50 See if you can guess  when the scripture was first fulfilled.
04:54 Verse 8:
04:56 “This is what Jehovah says:
04:59 “‘In a time of favor I answered you,
05:01 “‘and in a day of salvation I helped you;
05:04 “‘I kept safeguarding you  to give you as a covenant for the people,
05:08 “‘to rehabilitate the land,
05:13 “‘to cause them to possess
05:15 “‘their desolate inheritances,
05:20 to say to the prisoners, “Come out!”’”
05:24 You got it?
05:26 Sure.
05:28 This scripture was fulfilled
05:30 when the Israelites were being released
05:32 from Babylonian captivity.
05:35 We have a few hints there:
05:37 “to rehabilitate the land,”  “desolate inheritances,”
05:41 “to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’”
05:44 But now,  they were released from Babylon,
05:47 but what was the purpose?
05:49 It was twofold:
05:51 (a) to resettle Jerusalem,
05:55 and (b) to reestablish pure worship
06:00 —the pure worship of Jehovah.
06:03 Now, Paul is telling the Corinthians,
06:06 “We have to work together with Jehovah God.”
06:09 And he’s been reading Isaiah 49:8, 9.
06:12 What’s the connection?
06:14 Well, to rehabilitate a land
06:17 that had lain desolate for 70 years
06:20 would require a lot of work.
06:24 So those who agreed to leave Babylon
06:28 and come back to Jerusalem
06:30 would have to be hard workers,
06:33 but it wasn’t enough to be a hard worker.
06:36 To be successful, they would have  to be working along with Jehovah God,
06:40 because Jehovah God had a purpose  in bringing them back to Babylon.
06:44 It wasn’t just so that they  could come back to Jerusalem.
06:48 His purpose was to get  his pure worship reestablished.
06:53 So they were going to have  to work together with him.
06:56 Now, as The Watchtower pointed out recently,
07:00 it would be a sacrifice on the part of some
07:02 to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem.
07:06 Why?
07:08 Well, do you remember what Jehovah  had told the Israelites,
07:10 the Jews,  when they went to Babylon?
07:13 “Build houses and live in them.
07:15 Plant gardens and eat their fruit.”
07:17 Pray for the peace of the city
07:19 because “in its peace you will have peace.”
07:22 So life in Babylon,  captivity in Babylon,
07:25 wasn’t totally like slavery in Egypt.
07:29 In fact, some Jews got rich in Babylon.
07:33 Some became buyers  and sellers of precious gems.
07:36 And it’s thought that it was in Babylon
07:39 that the Jews learned trade and commerce —how to buy and sell so well.
07:44 They didn’t learn that  on the pastures of Judah; that’s for sure.
07:48 And so it would’ve been  a sacrifice on the part of some
07:51 to leave Babylon and go to Jerusalem.
07:55 Hard workers were willing to do that.
07:58 Now,  the returning Jews started out very well,
08:02 but they ran into problems.
08:04 They ran into problems  with the building of the temple.
08:08 And as a result,  they continued working
08:13 but they weren’t working  together with Jehovah anymore.
08:17 They were building houses  and decorating them;
08:20 they were starting a business;  they were looking after their own families,
08:25 their own lives.
08:27 Now, could it be  that some of them had reasoned:
08:30 ‘I’ve sacrificed enough;
08:32 ‘I’ve left a comfortable life in Babylon  to come here
08:36 ‘to this wasteland,
08:38 ‘and that’s a lot more  than my brothers in Babylon have done.
08:42 ‘I’ve sacrificed enough.
08:44 ‘It’s time to look after my own family,  look after my own children.
08:48 Let the young people do their share.’
08:51 Well, we don’t know  what they were reasoning.
08:53 But the fact is  that part “b” of Jehovah’s purpose
08:57 —to reestablish pure worship—
08:59 was not being fulfilled.
09:01 So they were not working together  with Jehovah God.
09:06 The application:
09:08 All of you have made considerable sacrifices
09:12 in order to go to your present assignments.
09:14 Most of you were not born  in your assignments;
09:18 you went there of your own volition.
09:20 And you made a lot of sacrifices.
09:22 You learned another language;
09:24 you made financial, material sacrifices;  and so on.
09:28 But, you know, there’s a danger.
09:31 As we get older,  there can be a tendency for us to feel:
09:35 ‘You know, I’ve sacrificed enough.
09:38 Why not let the young people do more?’
09:41 —especially when we see those  our own age who are taking it easy.
09:46 ‘They’ll be in the new world.
09:48 Why do I have to work so hard?’
09:50 And so if we’re not careful,
09:52 we could lose sight  of the purpose of our training,
09:55 and we don’t want to do that.
09:57 Now, there’s a second application  to Isaiah 49,
10:01 and we know that because of the way  Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 6.
10:06 Let’s go back there, 2 Corinthians 6.
10:09 And you can leave your Bibles open there
10:11 because for the rest of this discussion
10:13 we’re going to be considering  verses in 2 Corinthians 6.
10:17 Now, I’m going to read verse 2,
10:20 and see if you can figure out how we know
10:23 that Paul sees more than one application
10:27 to this scripture at Isaiah 49.
10:29 Verse 2:
10:31 “For he says:
10:33 “‘In an acceptable time I heard you,
10:38 and in a day of salvation I helped you.’
10:43 “Look!
10:44 “Now is [not acceptable, but]
10:48 “the especially acceptable time.
10:51 “Look!
10:52 Now is the day of salvation.”
10:57 You got it, didn’t you?
10:59 The definite and indefinite articles.
11:03 And when Paul is thinking
11:05 about the deliverance  of the Jews from Babylon,
11:08 quoting Jehovah God,  it’s “an acceptable time”;
11:11 it’s “a day of salvation.”
11:13 That was one application of the prophecy.
11:16 But now Paul is telling the Christians  that there’s something much better:
11:20 “Now is the especially acceptable time . . .
11:24 Now is the day of salvation.”
11:27 Yes, when the Jews  were delivered from Babylon,
11:30 pure worship was going  to be reestablished.
11:33 But what about today?
11:34 What about the work  Christians are doing today?
11:38 The everlasting future of people is involved.
11:41 And so if workers were needed back then,
11:44 when the Jews were leaving Babylon,
11:47 how hard should we be working today?
11:50 The lives of people are at stake,
11:54 and so no matter how busy you are,
11:58 no matter whether you are at Bethel,
12:01 don’t neglect the field.
12:03 Have a zealous share in the preaching work.
12:06 This is the work  that Jesus commanded us to do.
12:10 Jesus never spent a day at Bethel.
12:14 He’ll be very interested  in what you do at Bethel,
12:17 but he’ll be even more interested  in what you’re doing in the field.
12:21 Now, let’s focus  on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.
12:25 We talk about the undeserved kindness
12:27 of being able to come to Gilead  and get this special training.
12:31 But, now, what was the purpose?
12:34 Why were you selected
12:37 to come to Gilead  and get this training?
12:41 Well,  you’re probably wondering that yourselves.
12:45 You were selected, first of all,
12:47 because you’re workers;  you’re hard workers.
12:50 But you were also chosen  because we believe
12:53 that you are going to use  your training unselfishly
12:57 for the benefit of others.
12:59 And how many speakers  on this platform today have made that point?
13:04 The training is not  to be kept to yourselves.
13:07 You’ve been trained
13:09 so that you  can unselfishly benefit other people.
13:13 You have been trained  to be more effective
13:16 in serving others.
13:19 Now, when you return home,
13:22 we know that your friends  and fellow workers
13:25 are going to be very pleased.
13:27 Your humility
13:29 —you’re not going  to be flashing your diploma
13:32 either literally or figuratively;
13:36 you’re not going  to be flaunting your knowledge;
13:38 you’re not going to be correcting  every small mistake and procedure.
13:43 You’re going to earn the respect
13:46 of your fellow workers  because of your humility
13:48 and because of your willingness  to work alongside them
13:51 and to do whatever needs to be done.
13:53 In fact,  the most powerful lesson that you teach
13:57 may not be in anything you say,
14:00 but it may be in your humility
14:03 and your willingness to work humbly  along with any arrangement
14:07 or any assignment that is given you.
14:10 In this you’ll be copying Paul’s example.
14:12 If you’ve kept your Bible open  at 2 Corinthians 6,
14:16 we’re going to be reading  a few more verses.
14:19 Now, Paul mentions a lot  in verses 4 to 6.
14:23 A lot is involved in humbly serving
14:26 the needs of our brothers.
14:28 And we’re going  to just highlight a few of these.
14:32 Verses 4 to 6, Paul writes:
14:35 “But in every way we recommend  ourselves as God’s ministers,
14:40 “by the endurance of much,
14:44 “by tribulations, by times of need,
14:48 “by difficulties,
14:50 “by beatings,  by imprisonments, by riots,
14:53 “by hard work,
14:56 “by sleepless nights,  by times without food;
15:00 “by purity, by knowledge,
15:03 “by patience, by kindness,
15:06 by holy spirit.”
15:09 Now, look at verse 4.
15:11 One of the things  Paul mentions is “endurance.”
15:14 “We recommend ourselves  as God’s ministers, by . . . endurance.”
15:19 Now, that’s something  all of us need to give attention to.
15:22 Suppose that you were serving  at Bethel before Gilead,
15:27 and you really, really enjoyed  your work assignment.
15:31 Well, you’ve been away for five months.
15:35 What do you suppose  has been happening while you were away?
15:39 Someone else got that work assignment.
15:43 And you know what?
15:45 He’s doing very, very well  at that assignment.
15:49 In fact,  it may be that the department
15:52 is not going to want to have  you back when you return.
15:56 And so you’re given another assignment,
15:59 one that you don’t enjoy so much.
16:02 Now, someone else might say,  “I’ve been trained at Gilead for this?”
16:06 But not you,
16:08 you’re going to have the attitude,
16:10 ‘Well, if the work needs to be done,  why shouldn’t I do it?’
16:14 You see, your humility  is going to be so appreciated.
16:18 And remember,  other Bethelites are watching you.
16:22 They’re intelligent.
16:24 They know that you’d have probably liked  to have had your old job back,
16:28 but your humility
16:30 in cheerfully applying yourself  to whatever you’re given to do
16:33 is going to make  a tremendous impression on them.
16:35 In fact, you know what?
16:37 You’re going to go up ten points  in their estimation.
16:41 “Well,” you say,  “all right, I have to do it,
16:44 but do I really have to be  cheerful about it?”
16:47 Yes, you do.
16:49 That’s a requirement.
16:51 And you know why?
16:53 At the regional convention last summer,
16:56 do you remember  the definition of endurance?
16:59 It’s not just a matter of sticking it out  until something better comes along.
17:03 But we have to be cheerful;
17:06 we have to do  what we’re asked to do
17:08 with a happy, positive attitude
17:11 —not always looking  for additional responsibility,
17:15 more privileges,  a different work assignment—
17:18 being happy  with what we are given to do.
17:23 Well, you folks understand that,  and we love you for it.
17:27 Now, in the same verse, verse 4,  Paul mentions “difficulties.”
17:32 And there will be problems  in the field;
17:34 there’ll be problems  at Bethel from time to time.
17:37 And the question is this,  Will you be the type of person
17:40 that fellow Bethelites  or those in the congregation
17:44 will want to talk to  when difficulties arise,
17:47 because whenever they talk to you,
17:49 they always feel better after?
17:52 You have such a good, positive attitude.
17:55 Well, we know you will.
17:57 Now, in verse 5,  Paul mentions “hard work.”
18:01 When brothers and sisters  get together for a gathering,
18:04 we know that you’re going to be  one of the ones in the kitchen
18:08 or one of the ones who  stays behind after to help clean up.
18:13 You’re going to be volunteering  to help clean the Kingdom Hall,
18:17 or you’re going to volunteer  for a local construction project.
18:20 You’re going to be known  as someone who enjoys serving others,
18:25 someone who loves  to get his hands dirty
18:28 —not someone who shows up  in a lovely white suit
18:32 when there’s work to be done.
18:34 Or if you have to wear  a lovely white suit,
18:38 at least bring a change of clothes
18:41 so that you can roll up your sleeves  and help with the work.
18:44 Well, notice in verse 6,  Paul mentions “purity.”
18:49 We would certainly never want to think
18:51 that as long as we work hard  in our assignment at Bethel or in the field,
18:56 Jehovah will turn a blind eye  to any immorality on our part.
19:01 Jehovah has no blind eye.
19:06 Now, Paul mentions  “kindness” in the same verse.
19:10 Now, some of you brothers  may get into a position of authority.
19:14 And the question is,
19:16 How are you going to use your authority?
19:19 The proper use of authority  is to help others,
19:24 to benefit others.
19:26 And you will never ever
19:29 use your authority vindictively  to punish someone
19:32 or get even for some slight,
19:35 perhaps holding someone back  from a deserved privilege
19:38 just because he offended you.
19:40 That’s not the way we use authority.
19:43 In the same verse,  Paul talks about “holy spirit.”
19:47 And that’s going to help you  to get along with others.
19:51 It’ll help elders and department heads
19:54 to work peacefully with one another,
19:57 to speak kindly and respectfully  to one another,
20:00 to listen —to really listen—
20:02 to one another.
20:04 Now, you may have a little difference
20:06 with someone  in the congregation or at Bethel.
20:09 Then you hear that person  give a morning worship comment
20:13 or a fine public talk in the congregation,
20:17 and his eyes shine  as he’s talking about the truth.
20:22 You’re sitting there,  you observe that,
20:25 and it hits you that this man
20:29 —this man that I’m having a problem with—
20:31 really, really loves Jehovah;
20:35 and so do you.
20:37 You have that in common.
20:39 So now,  can’t you get the rest to work?
20:43 Now, if we walk by the spirit,
20:45 as we heard from Brother Samuelson,
20:49 we’ll be careful not to lobby  or push our own agenda,
20:54 because Jehovah  might not agree with our agenda.
20:57 And we’d never want to make  the other elders or the department feel
21:01 that they can’t make  any decision without our input.
21:06 We would never want them  to feel that in our absence
21:10 we would have to go back and revisit  every decision that has been made,
21:13 as if they can’t do a single thing  without us because we’re so clever
21:17 —we’ve graduated from Gilead.
21:19 No, we realize that they  have Jehovah’s spirit too.
21:23 So don’t be too impressed  with your own ideas.
21:28 I’m going to repeat that.
21:30 Don’t be too impressed  with your own ideas.
21:35 When no Scriptural principle is involved,
21:38 we’ll be willing to yield
21:40 if the majority of the elders make a decision
21:42 that we don’t particularly agree with.
21:45 So when that happens, don’t pout
21:47 —pray!
21:49 Ask Jehovah to bless  the decision that was made,
21:53 you know, the decision  that you didn’t particularly agree with.
21:56 Ask Jehovah to bless that decision,
21:58 and ask Jehovah to help you  to be fully supportive of the decision
22:03 —and that way you’ll be working  along with Jehovah’s purpose.
22:07 And what’s his purpose?
22:09 To have a happy group of elders
22:11 serving the needs  of their brothers and sisters.
22:13 If the elders are happy,
22:15 no doubt the congregation  and the Bethel family will be happy.
22:20 Be resolved to allow nothing and no one
22:25 to interfere with your unity  on the body of elders.
22:30 I’m going to repeat that.
22:32 Be resolved to allow nothing or no one
22:36 to interfere with your unity  on the body of elders.
22:42 Well, you know all these things.
22:45 These were just helpful reminders.
22:48 Your time at Gilead  has been a dream come true,
22:53 but now it’s time to use your training
22:56 to be of service to others.
22:58 Remember,  you have been trained for a purpose.
23:02 And the purpose:
23:04 to be more effective  in unselfishly serving others.
23:09 Never ever forget the purpose.
23:14 And may God bless you.
23:38 Well, we sincerely thank you,  Brother Splane,
23:40 for those words of wisdom  spoken from experience.
23:45 Well, now we’re privileged  to hear greetings
23:48 from our brothers and sisters  at many different branches
23:50 who are thinking  about us here today.
23:52 In fact,  can you imagine,
23:54 25 different branches  have sent greetings.
23:58 So let me just share  a few of these with you.
24:00 Of course,  we can’t share all of them,
24:02 but perhaps I can just epitomize  some of the messages.
24:05 For example, Armenia says:
24:08 “We are delighted to see how Jehovah  is training more brothers and sisters
24:13 “to take on additional responsibilities
24:15 in his organization  for the advancement of Kingdom interests.”
24:18 Benin says:
24:19 “We know that the Gilead School has left
24:21 “an indelible impression on your mind
24:24 “—with memories  you’ll carry along all your life—
24:27 “and on your heart
24:29 “—with a deeper appreciation and joy
24:31 in serving Jehovah  in a closer relationship with him.”
24:35 Bulgaria says:
24:36 “We wish all of you  much joy on this special day.
24:40 “Bulgaria branch keenly anticipates  the arrival of one couple from this class.
24:45 “We pray for Jehovah’s blessing  on you students
24:48 wherever he asks you to serve him.”
24:51 Italy said:
24:53 “‘With what will I repay Jehovah  for all the good he has done for me?’
24:58 “We are sure  that these words well describe
25:01 “the feelings of you students  of the 142nd class.
25:04 “We rejoice with you in this special occasion
25:07 “and give thanks to Jehovah  for the spiritual enrichment you enjoyed.
25:11 “We are confident it will be  of great value to yourselves
25:14 “and to the ones you’ll be sharing  it with in the days to come.
25:18 “Please receive  the warmest brotherly affection
25:21 of the brothers in Italy.”
25:23 And finally,  Kazakhstan wrote and said:
25:26 “We would like to take this opportunity  to pass our love and greetings
25:29 “to the 142nd class of Gilead  on this graduation day.
25:34 “We are confident that they  will never forget these past five months
25:38 “as they have walked  hand in hand with our God, Jehovah,
25:41 “journeying page by page  through his Word, the Bible.
25:45 Our thoughts and prayers  are with them on this momentous day.”
25:49 Isn’t that wonderful?
26:00 Well, now, we know that many of you  like to hear the statistics about the class.
26:03 So let me share with you some  of the details about this class—the 142nd.
26:08 So the class was made up  of nine single brothers
26:11 and four single sisters.

26:16 of the students was 44.2.
26:19 The average years in the truth was 28,
26:23 and the average years  in the full-time ministry was 21.6.

32:29 Now that all of our students  have officially graduated,
32:33 would you like to see now
32:35 the 142nd class  of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?
33:14 Brother Sebastian Hoffmann  has been selected to read the class letter.
33:27 “Dear Governing Body and Bethel Family:
33:30 “In one  of the most beautiful inspired expressions
33:34 “of praise to Jehovah,
33:36 “King David of old said:
33:39 “‘And now, O our God, we thank you
33:43 and praise your beautiful name.’  (1 Chron. 29:13)
33:46 “With those words,  at the close of his 40-year reign,
33:50 “David expressed  his lifelong feelings for Jehovah.
33:54 “And here we are,  the 142nd class of Gilead,
33:58 “at the close  of our 20-week course of Bible education,
34:02 “with those very same feelings.
34:06 “As we have submitted to Jehovah’s molding  of our hearts and minds,
34:10 “we have come to appreciate more than ever
34:13 “the beauty  of the oldest personality in the universe
34:17 “—Jehovah’s personality.
34:19 “We have chosen it  to be our own new personality.
34:24 “We have deeply appreciated  being taught by you,
34:28 “members of the Governing Body.
34:31 “Despite your busy and demanding schedules,
34:35 “you made time to travel to Patterson
34:37 “to share with us your love  for Jehovah’s name and for his Word.
34:42 “We heard it in your expressions,  and we saw it
34:46 “in your eyes.
34:48 “The way you welcomed us  into your beautiful new home in Warwick
34:52 “and gave us of your time  will live long in our memory.
34:56 “You strengthened our trust  and respect for Jehovah’s organization.
35:01 “Our prayer is that Jehovah give you brothers
35:05 “the holy spirit and energy you need
35:09 “to carry out your assignments  as the end draws near.
35:14 “Throughout our schooling,
35:16 “we felt the power of God’s Word  at work in us students.
35:20 “The Bible has proven to be a mirror
35:23 “in which we have examined ourselves.
35:27 “You, our dear instructors,
35:30 “held that mirror up  in front of us every day.
35:34 “With kindness, love,
35:37 “patience, and reassurance,
35:39 “you helped us to look for attitudes,  thoughts, and inclinations
35:44 “within ourselves that are not  a reflection of Jehovah.
35:48 “We have come to see who we really are,
35:52 “who Jehovah wants us to be,
35:55 “and how we can bridge that gap.
35:58 “Every step of the way,  you guided us with God’s Word
36:02 “and never your own opinion.
36:05 “What a lesson that has been to us all!
36:08 “In imitation of the apostle Paul,
36:11 “you imparted to us  not only the good news of God
36:14 “but also your very selves,
36:17 “because we became beloved to you,
36:19 “and you have become beloved to us. —1 Thess. 2:8.
36:23 “As a class,
36:25 “we must acknowledge  that part of the education we received
36:29 “has been outside of the Gilead classroom.
36:32 “From the very first day we arrived
36:35 “at the Patterson Educational Center,
36:37 “our education began.
36:40 “The friends at reception, our hosts,
36:43 “and the entire Bethel family
36:46 “immediately made us feel at home.
36:49 “We experienced the same love  and brotherly affection
36:52 “when we visited Wallkill and Warwick.
36:56 “Over the last five months,
36:58 “we learned much observing you:
37:00 “how you responded to direction
37:03 “that you received  and humbly followed through,
37:07 “how you reacted to the loss of members
37:10 “of the Bethel family in death,
37:13 “and how quick you were
37:15 “to offer comfort and assistance.
37:19 “Thank you for your constancy
37:22 “in making yourselves available for us.
37:25 “How can we ever forget  the line of cars of Bethelites
37:29 “queuing up outside our residence building,
37:32 “ready and willing to take us to the meetings
37:35 “and in the ministry every week?
37:38 “You really went the extra mile for us.
37:41 “As we leave this awesome place,
37:44 “we take with us
37:46 “an unforgettable  and rich spiritual heritage.
37:51 “What will we do with it?
37:54 “Our determination is the same  as that of King David.
37:59 “At Psalm 145:1, 2,  he promised Jehovah:
38:06 “‘I will exalt you, O my God the King,
38:09 “‘I will praise your name forever and ever.
38:13 “‘All day long I will praise you;
38:16 I will praise your name forever and ever.’
38:20 “May the blessing of Jehovah our God
38:23 “be upon all those  who praise his name forever.
38:27 “With all our appreciation,  we love you very much.
38:32 Your brothers,
142nd class of Gilead.”
39:00 We thank you very much  for that beautiful, beautiful letter.
39:04 Well, we’ve come  to the concluding remarks
39:07 of our Gilead program.
39:09 At the beginning,  we discussed the importance
39:12 of praying to Jehovah to open our eyes
39:15 and help us see clearly his Word.
39:18 You know,  over time because of imperfection,
39:21 our vision tends to deteriorate.
39:25 And as a result, we may have to  constantly be seeking a brighter light
39:30 in order for us  to see things more clearly.
39:34 Well, in the same way,
39:36 as you will deal  with your own imperfections,
39:39 as you’ll deal  with the imperfections of others,
39:42 as you’ll cope with health problems
39:45 and a host of other things that will come
39:47 to all of us  as we live in this system,
39:50 you’ll need to look back  to God’s Word again
39:54 and again and again.
39:56 In a sense,  to turn up the light
39:59 so that you can see clearly
40:02 what Jehovah’s will will be  in so many areas of your life.
40:07 And at times,  you may scratch your head and say,
40:09 “Jehovah, I just don’t know what to do.”
40:13 But if you do not tire
40:15 of returning over  and over again to God’s Word,
40:19 he will show you the way.
40:21 And the words of Joshua chapter 1
40:23 will prove to be true in your case.
40:26 Let’s read this together.
40:29 In Joshua 1:7,
40:34 this is what Jehovah said to Joshua:
40:37 “Only be courageous and very strong,
40:41 “and observe carefully the entire Law  that Moses my servant commanded you.
40:46 “Do not deviate from it  either to the right or to the left,
40:51 “so that you may act wisely  wherever you go.
40:55 “This book of the Law  should not depart from your mouth,
40:59 “and you must read it  in an undertone day and night,
41:03 “in order to observe carefully  all that is written in it;
41:07 “for then your way will be successful
41:11 “and then you will act wisely.
41:14 “Have I not commanded you?
41:16 “Be courageous and strong.
41:19 “Do not be struck with terror or fear,
41:23 for Jehovah your God  is with you wherever you go.”
41:28 Well, please know that the good wishes,
41:33 the hopes, the prayers
41:35 of all of us go with you today
41:38 for your success in your assignment.
41:41 And may Jehovah God  be with you wherever you go.
42:02 Well, I know you’ll want  to know about our attendance.
42:05 We had many sites tied in today.
42:07 So here are the attendance figures.
42:09 For Canada, we had 838.
42:13 In the United States:
42:15 At Patterson, we had 3,469;
42:19 in Brooklyn, 328;
42:22 at Fishkill, 1,030;
42:25 at Wallkill, 2,502;
42:28 at Warwick, 1,571;
42:32 in Curaçao, 71;
42:36 in Florida,  in Fort Lauderdale, 137;
42:41 in Jamaica, 14;
42:44 in Mira Loma, we’re not certain
42:46 because the program  will not yet start for a few more minutes
42:50 (but we’ll find out in due time);
42:52 and in Puerto Rico, 149.
42:55 So that gives us a grand total of 10,109.
43:12 Well, brothers,  we’ve had a wonderful program today.
43:14 We have one last chance  to participate in the program
43:18 by standing now  and singing song number 150,
43:22 “Seek God for Your Deliverance.”
43:24 And then following the song,
43:26 Brother Herman van Selm,  a helper to the Writing Committee,
43:30 will offer our concluding prayer.
43:32 That’s song 150.

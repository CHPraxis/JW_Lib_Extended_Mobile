00:01.650 --> 00:04.353
“Always Allow Jehovah to Direct Your Steps” 


00:04.353 --> 00:06.990
is the theme Brother Geoffrey Jackson, 


00:06.990 --> 00:10.593
a member of the Governing Body, 
will now share with us.


00:10.593 --> 00:13.596
Well, it’s a real privilege 
and pleasure for me 


00:13.597 --> 00:15.299
to stand before you again. 


00:15.298 --> 00:19.368
It just seems like a few days ago 
 when I had the privilege 


00:19.368 --> 00:23.038
of giving you the first lecture 
that I give at Gilead.


00:23.038 --> 00:28.000
And now, here it is, 
your very special day of graduation.


00:29.345 --> 00:32.915
Before you go on 
to your assignments after graduation, 


00:32.915 --> 00:36.085
we’d like to leave you with a question, 


00:36.085 --> 00:38.455
Are you willing 


00:38.455 --> 00:41.892
to allow Jehovah to direct your steps? 


00:41.892 --> 00:45.395
Now, we all know how you’re going to answer 


00:45.395 --> 00:48.097
because we know that you’ve been willing 


00:48.097 --> 00:51.334
to allow Jehovah to direct your steps 
right up to this moment. 


00:51.333 --> 00:55.171
That’s why you dedicated 
yourselves to Jehovah, 


00:55.172 --> 00:58.842
why you entered full-time service, 
special full-time service, 


00:58.842 --> 01:02.912
and that’s why you’re here
—having attended Gilead. 


01:02.912 --> 01:06.015
And that’s why we love you, 
and we’re proud of you 


01:06.015 --> 01:11.000
because you are willing 
to allow Jehovah to direct your steps. 


01:12.188 --> 01:16.458
But, you know, perhaps it seems 
a little presumptuous on our part 


01:16.458 --> 01:20.863
to ask the question 
about are we willing to allow Jehovah. 


01:20.863 --> 01:24.066
Can mere man allow Jehovah to do anything? 


01:24.067 --> 01:27.437
Well, the reason behind that question is, 


01:27.437 --> 01:31.340
of course, that Jehovah 
doesn’t force himself on us. 


01:31.340 --> 01:34.410
It doesn’t automatically happen 


01:34.410 --> 01:36.913
that Jehovah directs our steps. 


01:36.913 --> 01:39.548
In fact, something is required of us,


01:39.548 --> 01:43.586
and this, in a sense, 
allows Jehovah to work with us. 


01:43.587 --> 01:47.057
Let’s have a look in our Bibles 
at an interesting scripture 


01:47.057 --> 01:48.925
in the book of Psalms. 


01:48.925 --> 01:51.293
It’s Psalm 37, 


01:51.293 --> 01:54.496
a section of Scripture 
that we all use 


01:54.497 --> 01:57.034
over and over again in the service. 


01:57.033 --> 02:00.903
But this time, 
we’re going to look at verse 23, 


02:00.903 --> 02:04.373
Psalm 37:23: 


02:04.373 --> 02:08.343
“Jehovah guides the steps of a man 


02:08.343 --> 02:11.380
when He finds pleasure in his way.” 


02:11.380 --> 02:13.750
Now, if you were just listening to that 


02:13.750 --> 02:17.287
and you didn’t have a printed 
or electronic copy in front of you, 


02:17.287 --> 02:20.624
it would be easy 
to misunderstand this verse. 


02:20.623 --> 02:21.590
Why? 


02:21.590 --> 02:25.595
Well, if you hear it read 
“when He finds pleasure in his way,” 


02:25.595 --> 02:30.000
you naturally assume “when [the man] 
finds pleasure in [Jehovah’s] way.” 


02:31.267 --> 02:36.272
But you notice the New World Translation 
capitalizes the “He”


02:36.272 --> 02:40.277
—“when He finds pleasure in his way.” 


02:40.277 --> 02:42.979
So now if we were 
to substitute the pronouns there, 


02:42.978 --> 02:44.980
what does it really say? 


02:44.980 --> 02:47.883
“Jehovah guides the steps of a man 


02:47.883 --> 02:52.088
when [Jehovah] finds pleasure 
in [the man’s] way.” 


02:52.088 --> 02:55.191
Now, isn’t that an interesting concept? 


02:55.192 --> 03:00.162
So for us to have our steps 
guided by Jehovah, 


03:00.162 --> 03:04.934
we have to do things 
that bring pleasure to Jehovah. 


03:04.933 --> 03:08.170
And when Jehovah finds pleasure in our way, 


03:08.170 --> 03:10.907
then he directs our steps. 


03:10.907 --> 03:13.142
Isn’t that a profound thought? 


03:13.142 --> 03:17.414
So in that way, once we do things 
in accordance with Jehovah’s will, 


03:17.413 --> 03:20.583
it’s as if we figuratively allow Jehovah 


03:20.583 --> 03:23.753
to direct our steps. 


03:23.753 --> 03:28.591
Now, that doesn’t come automatically 
just because we pray to Jehovah, 


03:28.592 --> 03:30.994
“Please, direct my steps.” 


03:30.993 --> 03:34.496
Let’s think of two examples 
from the Scriptures, 


03:34.497 --> 03:38.167
two negative examples, 
that help us in this regard.


03:38.167 --> 03:41.370
First of all, let’s think about Balaam. 


03:41.370 --> 03:45.308
Now, remember this is 
in the 15th century B.C.E., 


03:45.308 --> 03:49.045
when the Israelites were 
about to go into the Promised Land. 


03:49.045 --> 03:52.648
The Moabites were very worried about it. 


03:52.648 --> 03:57.320
Balaam was a man who had 
some connection to the worship of Jehovah. 


03:57.320 --> 04:02.292
And now all of a sudden, 
these messengers come to Balaam, 


04:02.292 --> 04:05.462
and they ask him to curse God’s people. 


04:05.462 --> 04:07.930
And do you remember what happened? 
What did Balaam do? 


04:07.930 --> 04:10.400
He didn’t automatically answer, did he? 


04:10.400 --> 04:12.935
He said: ‘Wait here overnight. 


04:12.935 --> 04:15.372
I want to hear from Jehovah.’ 


04:15.372 --> 04:17.640
And what did Jehovah say to him? 


04:17.640 --> 04:21.377
Basically, ‘Don’t go!’ 


04:21.377 --> 04:24.880
Now, that’s not hard to understand, is it? 


04:24.880 --> 04:26.882
‘Don’t go’ is simple; 


04:26.882 --> 04:30.820
you don’t need a lawyer 
to try and work out what that means. 


04:30.820 --> 04:32.955
But then what happened? 


04:32.955 --> 04:35.658
Well, the pressure intensified, didn’t it? 


04:35.658 --> 04:38.193
And more messengers came


04:38.193 --> 04:42.898
—this time, princes 
and more offers of material gain. 


04:42.898 --> 04:45.301
Now, what did Balaam do? 


04:45.302 --> 04:49.805
Well, he had clearly heard 
Jehovah’s direction: ‘Don’t go.’ 


04:49.805 --> 04:52.042
But what did he do? 


04:52.042 --> 04:56.245
Well, his heart was already leaning 
in a certain direction. 


04:56.245 --> 04:59.482
So he was hoping this would change a little. 


04:59.482 --> 05:03.085
So he said: ‘Well, let’s just wait 
and see what Jehovah says.’ 


05:03.085 --> 05:05.388
Now, this time what did Jehovah say? 


05:05.388 --> 05:07.390
‘Go, 


05:07.390 --> 05:11.427
but don’t say anything 
I don’t tell you to say.’ 


05:11.427 --> 05:13.562
In other words: 
‘Only say what I tell you.’ 


05:13.562 --> 05:18.467
Now, was this because Jehovah 
was directing Balaam’s steps? 


05:18.467 --> 05:23.305
Or was it because he allowed 
Balaam to go his own way? 


05:23.305 --> 05:27.310
Well, we see what happened
—three times, resistance. 


05:27.310 --> 05:29.312
But then what happened? 


05:29.312 --> 05:33.349
Well, notice, 
if we turn across to Numbers 22, 


05:33.348 --> 05:35.985
we hear a very clear statement. 


05:35.985 --> 05:40.590
In fact, nearly as clear 
as the statement, ‘Don’t go.’ 


05:40.590 --> 05:43.727
Numbers 22:32: 


05:43.727 --> 05:46.595
“Then Jehovah’s angel said to him: 


05:46.595 --> 05:50.867
“‘Why have you beaten 
your donkey these three times? 


05:50.867 --> 05:54.837
“‘Look! 
I myself came out to offer resistance, 


05:54.837 --> 05:58.942
because your way is in defiance of my will.’” 


05:58.942 --> 06:01.077
So there we see the answer, don’t we? 


06:01.077 --> 06:03.545
It wasn’t Jehovah directing his steps. 


06:03.545 --> 06:06.282
Jehovah was resisting what he was doing.


06:06.282 --> 06:08.752
So, what do we learn from this? 


06:08.752 --> 06:12.122
Well, even though Balaam initially 


06:12.122 --> 06:14.824
wanted to get Jehovah’s direction, 


06:14.823 --> 06:17.993
Jehovah didn’t force himself on Balaam. 


06:17.993 --> 06:21.630
And when Balaam was determined 
to go down a certain course, 


06:21.630 --> 06:26.035
yes, Jehovah gave him 
signals of ‘don’t go’ and again ‘don’t go.’ 


06:26.035 --> 06:28.337
But Jehovah allowed him to go and, of course, 


06:28.337 --> 06:31.740
eventually he ended up dying because of that. 


06:31.740 --> 06:34.943
And, of course, many others 
died because of that as well.


06:34.943 --> 06:37.180
So, what’s the lesson for us? 


06:37.180 --> 06:41.417
Well, sometimes we may feel 
that at a certain point in our life, 


06:41.417 --> 06:43.887
we say: “Jehovah, 
what do you want me to do? 


06:43.887 --> 06:45.522
What’s your will?” 


06:45.522 --> 06:47.957
And that’s good 
that we pray to Jehovah that way. 


06:47.957 --> 06:50.025
But what do we need to do? 


06:50.025 --> 06:53.695
We need to do what Jehovah wants us to do. 


06:53.695 --> 06:56.765
Then, when he finds pleasure 
in what we’re doing, 


06:56.765 --> 06:58.968
he directs our step. 


06:58.968 --> 07:01.603
So that’s a good lesson, isn’t it?


07:01.603 --> 07:06.441
The second example we want 
to use is of the unnamed prophet. 


07:06.442 --> 07:10.680
Do you remember the one 
that’s mentioned in 1 Kings chapter 13, 


07:10.680 --> 07:14.417
who was instructed to go up to Israel 


07:14.417 --> 07:19.289
and to utter a pronouncement 
there to King Jeroboam? 


07:19.288 --> 07:22.958
Now, remember the instructions again 
that Jehovah gave him: 


07:22.958 --> 07:25.595
‘Go up one way; 
come back the other way. 


07:25.595 --> 07:27.697
Don’t eat or drink.’ 


07:27.697 --> 07:30.500
Now, even when the king said: 
‘Come and eat and drink,’ 


07:30.500 --> 07:31.363
what did he say?


07:31.363 --> 07:34.536
‘Oh, no. 
I know what Jehovah wants me to do.’ 


07:34.537 --> 07:36.605
But then what happened? 


07:36.605 --> 07:39.408
Although he was doing 
very well up to that point, 


07:39.408 --> 07:43.478
remember the old prophet 
tricked him by saying: 


07:43.478 --> 07:45.615
‘Oh, don’t worry. 


07:45.615 --> 07:48.783
An angel spoke to me and said:
“It’s OK.”’ 


07:48.783 --> 07:51.486
What did the unnamed prophet say? 


07:51.487 --> 07:53.824
‘Let me check with Jehovah again. 


07:53.823 --> 07:56.158
I mean, he did actually tell me.’ 


07:56.158 --> 07:58.260
No. 
‘OK, let’s eat!’ 


07:58.260 --> 08:02.130
Well, again it resulted in disaster, 
didn’t it? 


08:02.130 --> 08:04.167
What’s the lesson we learned there? 


08:04.167 --> 08:06.969
Well, although he started a course 


08:06.968 --> 08:11.006
that was allowing Jehovah 
to direct his steps, 


08:11.007 --> 08:15.879
he didn’t continue to follow 
the direction that Jehovah had given him. 


08:15.878 --> 08:18.113
Now, that’s a good lesson for us too, 
isn’t it? 


08:18.113 --> 08:20.115
We may do the same. 


08:20.115 --> 08:23.818
There could be friends
—could even be people we respect—


08:23.818 --> 08:26.488
who give us advice contrary 


08:26.488 --> 08:28.958
to what Jehovah is telling us, 


08:28.958 --> 08:32.026
and that could also lead to disaster. 


08:32.027 --> 08:36.432
What would have helped 
in both of those situations? 


08:36.432 --> 08:39.835
Well, I’d like to read you 
a quote from The Watchtower 


08:39.835 --> 08:44.207
from back in 1950 
before any of you were ever born 


08:44.207 --> 08:48.277
and, incidentally, before I was born too. 


08:48.277 --> 08:51.000
But I’m sure Brother Herd read it.


08:57.753 --> 09:00.823
Anyway, the quote says: 


09:00.823 --> 09:03.225
“It is far better 


09:03.225 --> 09:07.430
“to take a few moments for quiet reflection, 


09:07.430 --> 09:10.667
“fully considering God’s requirements 


09:10.667 --> 09:13.269
“before rushing into an action 


09:13.268 --> 09:15.571
that might bring God’s reproof.” 


09:15.572 --> 09:17.105
Let me read it again: 


09:17.105 --> 09:21.577
“It is far better to take 
a few moments for quiet reflection, 


09:21.577 --> 09:24.580
“fully considering God’s requirements


09:24.580 --> 09:27.250
“before rushing into an action 


09:27.250 --> 09:30.052
that might bring God’s reproof.” 


09:30.052 --> 09:34.557
So how can we summarize that 
in a nice little expression? 


09:34.557 --> 09:38.494
Well, we could say: 
“Don’t rush in. 


09:38.493 --> 09:40.528
“Pause, 


09:40.528 --> 09:42.531
“ponder, 


09:42.532 --> 09:44.300
“pray, 


09:44.300 --> 09:46.302
“and prove. 


09:46.302 --> 09:50.439
Prove to yourself 
what Jehovah really wants you to do.” 


09:50.438 --> 09:54.310
So with that in mind, 
as you go do your assignments, 


09:54.310 --> 09:57.280
you’re going to find all sorts of challenges. 


09:57.280 --> 10:00.717
But how can you apply this principle 


10:00.717 --> 10:02.852
of don’t rush in, 


10:02.852 --> 10:05.889
pause, ponder, pray, 


10:05.888 --> 10:08.490
and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants?


10:08.490 --> 10:12.662
Well, let’s consider 
three different circumstances. 


10:12.662 --> 10:17.600
So we always want 
to allow Jehovah to direct our steps 


10:17.600 --> 10:21.137
when we’re excited about something. 


10:21.137 --> 10:24.940
We’re excited
—we want to get in and do something. 


10:24.940 --> 10:29.045
Now let’s take, for example, Jacob. 


10:29.045 --> 10:33.048
We all remember, 
it describes to us in the Scriptures 


10:33.048 --> 10:37.786
how he felt when he was told 
that his son Joseph supposedly had died. 


10:37.787 --> 10:40.189
He was grief-stricken, 


10:40.188 --> 10:42.290
and for years


10:42.290 --> 10:46.095
he was left with that impression 
that his son was dead. 


10:46.095 --> 10:48.197
Now, can you imagine? 


10:48.197 --> 10:52.267
Just try to imagine 
the joy that he would have felt 


10:52.267 --> 10:55.104
when all of a sudden 
his sons return back from Egypt. 


10:55.103 --> 10:58.540
There are wagons
—I mean, not just the average wagons—


10:58.540 --> 11:00.943
I’m sure they were pretty fancy wagons. 


11:00.943 --> 11:02.845
They’re coming to pick him up. 


11:02.845 --> 11:06.582
He finds out Joseph is alive. 


11:06.582 --> 11:09.019
Not only that, he’s in Egypt. 


11:09.018 --> 11:11.420
He’s got a very high position there. 


11:11.420 --> 11:12.622
How do you think—? 


11:12.622 --> 11:16.025
Do you think excited is the word? 
Of course! 


11:16.025 --> 11:18.927
He’s extremely excited and overjoyed. 


11:18.927 --> 11:22.565
So he left Hebron, 
went down to Beer-sheba. 


11:22.565 --> 11:25.133
But what did he do 


11:25.133 --> 11:28.736
before he left the Promised Land 
to go into Egypt? 


11:28.737 --> 11:32.509
Well, let’s have a look 
in Genesis chapter 46. 


11:32.508 --> 11:35.443
Genesis chapter 46 


11:35.443 --> 11:38.000
and we’ll read verses 1-4: 


11:39.548 --> 11:43.918
“So Israel [Jacob] took all 
that he had and departed. 


11:43.918 --> 11:48.256
When he arrived at Beer-sheba, 
he offered sacrifices to . . . God.” 


11:48.257 --> 11:52.360
You see, he stopped,
he paused, he pondered.


11:52.360 --> 11:54.697
Yes, verse 2: 


11:54.697 --> 11:58.900
“Then God spoke to Israel 
in a vision by night and said: 


11:58.900 --> 12:03.572
“‘Jacob, Jacob!’ 
to which he said: ‘Here I am!’ 


12:03.572 --> 12:08.510
“He said: ‘I am the true God, 
the God of your father. 


12:08.510 --> 12:11.313
“‘Do not be afraid 
to go down to Egypt, 


12:11.313 --> 12:15.150
“‘for there I will make you 
into a great nation. 


12:15.150 --> 12:18.053
“‘I myself will go down 
with you to Egypt, 


12:18.053 --> 12:21.323
“‘and I myself will also 
bring you back from there, 


12:21.323 --> 12:24.960
and Joseph will lay 
his hand on your eyes.’” 


12:24.960 --> 12:26.962
Do we see what happened? 


12:26.962 --> 12:30.834
You see, he stopped,
he paused, he pondered,


12:30.833 --> 12:35.303
he wanted to prove
to himself what Jehovah wanted. 


12:35.303 --> 12:37.305
And Jehovah gave him the go-ahead. 


12:37.305 --> 12:40.475
He had Jehovah’s blessing, 
and we know how that turned out. 


12:40.475 --> 12:42.778
So do we see the lesson for us? 


12:42.778 --> 12:46.015
Perhaps, at times, 
we get all excited about something. 


12:46.015 --> 12:48.283
It appears good; 
it appears that we should do it. 


12:48.283 --> 12:50.018
What should we do? 


12:50.018 --> 12:53.655
Pause, ponder, pray,


12:53.655 --> 12:57.960
and prove to yourself that 
that’s really what Jehovah wants you to do.


12:57.960 --> 13:01.063
Now, let’s think of a second example. 


13:01.063 --> 13:05.901
Imagine the time when the Israelites 
were entering the Promised Land. 


13:05.902 --> 13:08.170
They were about to conquer the land. 


13:08.170 --> 13:11.407
How exciting it must have been to them! 


13:11.407 --> 13:16.000
They were busy with an assignment 
that Jehovah had given them. 


13:17.345 --> 13:21.283
But still, even if we are 
in the middle of an assignment, 


13:21.283 --> 13:25.821
we have to pause, ponder, pray, 


13:25.822 --> 13:29.124
and prove to ourselves 
what Jehovah wants us to do. 


13:29.123 --> 13:33.028
For example, in Joshua chapter 8, 
when we look there, 


13:33.028 --> 13:35.430
you’ll notice (we won’t read it)


13:35.430 --> 13:38.800
but they were able to capture Jericho. 


13:38.800 --> 13:41.270
Then in Ai, there was a problem, 
wasn’t there? 


13:41.270 --> 13:43.938
They had to sort that out. 
They went back. 


13:43.938 --> 13:47.275
They were able to defeat 
the inhabitants of Ai. 


13:47.275 --> 13:49.278
What did they do next? 


13:49.278 --> 13:52.981
You see, here they are poised 
to conquer the whole Promised Land. 


13:52.982 --> 13:56.085
They went up to Mount Ebal, 


13:56.085 --> 13:59.755
not Mt. Ebo,
just so we got that right. 


13:59.755 --> 14:03.025
They went up to Mount Ebal, 
and what did they do? 


14:03.025 --> 14:07.697
They paused, pondered, prayed, 


14:07.697 --> 14:10.699
and proved to themselves 
what Jehovah wanted them to do. 


14:10.698 --> 14:13.135
They read the whole Law. 


14:13.135 --> 14:16.972
Yes, they stopped the military campaign, 


14:16.972 --> 14:20.509
took time to make sure 
what Jehovah wanted them to do, 


14:20.508 --> 14:24.145
and then they went ahead 
to complete that military campaign. 


14:24.145 --> 14:26.282
So again, what lesson for us? 


14:26.282 --> 14:28.284
You’ve received many assignments. 


14:28.283 --> 14:30.851
You will receive 
more assignments in the future. 


14:30.852 --> 14:34.490
But just because you’re in the middle 
of an assignment you’ve started 


14:34.490 --> 14:37.492
doesn’t mean to say that you’ll continue 


14:37.492 --> 14:39.795
to allow Jehovah to direct your steps. 


14:39.795 --> 14:44.467
You have to pause, ponder, pray, 


14:44.467 --> 14:47.535
and prove to yourself 
what Jehovah wants.


14:47.535 --> 14:51.173
Now, the third situation, 
as a reminder, 


14:51.173 --> 14:55.743
is that we still need 
to be extra careful to allow Jehovah 


14:55.743 --> 15:00.581
to direct our steps 
when we have special privileges. 


15:00.582 --> 15:03.552
You see, it’s very easy 
for us perhaps to think: 


15:03.552 --> 15:06.722
‘Well, now I’ve been to Gilead. 


15:06.722 --> 15:11.460
‘I can probably miss a few meetings 
for a few months anyway. 


15:11.460 --> 15:14.000
‘I’ve got a bit of spiritual fat. 


15:15.428 --> 15:18.700
‘You see, all those other brothers, 
they need to go to the meetings. 


15:18.700 --> 15:23.238
But I got plenty 
to keep me going for a while.’ 


15:23.238 --> 15:25.240
Really? 


15:25.240 --> 15:29.612
Well, we have an example in the Scriptures 
to help us in that regard. 


15:29.612 --> 15:32.615
Let’s look in Luke chapter 2, 


15:32.615 --> 15:37.052
and this, of course, is the account 
dealing with Joseph and Mary 


15:37.052 --> 15:39.322
and Jesus’ birth. 


15:39.322 --> 15:44.000
So Luke 2:22-24, 


15:45.327 --> 15:47.329
there it says: 


15:47.328 --> 15:50.231
“Also, when the time came 
for purifying them 


15:50.232 --> 15:52.234
“according to the Law of Moses, 


15:52.233 --> 15:56.305
“they brought him up to Jerusalem 
to present him to Jehovah,


15:56.305 --> 15:59.408
“just as it is written in Jehovah’s Law: 


15:59.408 --> 16:04.045
“‘Every firstborn male 
must be called holy to Jehovah.’ 


16:04.045 --> 16:06.982
“And they offered a sacrifice 
according to what


16:06.982 --> 16:09.150
“is said in the Law of Jehovah: 


16:09.150 --> 16:13.155
‘a pair of turtledoves 
or two young pigeons.’”


16:13.155 --> 16:15.623
So, what happened here? 
When? 


16:15.623 --> 16:20.361
Well, remember 
this was 40 days after Jesus’ birth. 


16:20.362 --> 16:25.300
Mary needed to go to the temple 
to purify herself, according to the Law. 


16:25.300 --> 16:29.938
And we notice 
verses 22 and 24 refer to that. 


16:29.938 --> 16:31.940
The Law says to do that. 


16:31.940 --> 16:35.677
But verse 23, 
what’s that referring to? 


16:35.677 --> 16:39.147
If you look at the marginal reference 
where this is taken from, 


16:39.147 --> 16:43.152
it’s not talking 
about the purification of Mary. 


16:43.152 --> 16:45.154
What is it talking about? 


16:45.153 --> 16:49.991
Well, possibly it’s talking about 
when the man, the husband, 


16:49.992 --> 16:54.262
would have to present the child to Jehovah
and pay the five shekels  


16:54.262 --> 16:57.265
and acknowledge that this child was his. 


16:57.265 --> 16:59.435
So if that’s the case, 


16:59.435 --> 17:01.903
that means both Joseph and Mary 


17:01.903 --> 17:06.508
took the time to go 
and make these presentations. 


17:06.508 --> 17:10.478
Joseph was supposed 
to do that after 30 days 


17:10.478 --> 17:13.848
after Jesus’ birth 
or sometime thereafter. 


17:13.848 --> 17:17.251
But whatever the case, 
what do we learn from this? 


17:17.252 --> 17:19.622
Joseph and Mary didn’t say: 


17:19.622 --> 17:23.059
‘Well, you know, 
we had an angel come to visit us. 


17:23.058 --> 17:27.528
‘And this child 
is very, very, very special. 


17:27.528 --> 17:30.998
‘And remember, 
when he was born, the shepherds came. 


17:30.998 --> 17:34.001
‘The heavens were filled with angels. 


17:34.002 --> 17:37.205
‘Surely, we shouldn’t have to go 
and pay the five shekels  


17:37.205 --> 17:39.642
and offer up the birds.’ 


17:39.642 --> 17:41.677
They didn’t do that, did they? 


17:41.677 --> 17:46.582
They didn’t use the special privilege 
they had as an excuse 


17:46.582 --> 17:50.352
not to do what Jehovah 
had instructed them to do. 


17:50.352 --> 17:52.654
Do we see the lesson for us? 


17:52.653 --> 17:56.258
If that was the case with them, 
what about us? 


17:56.258 --> 17:59.326
It doesn’t matter what privileges we have, 


17:59.327 --> 18:02.364
we still have to do the basic things. 


18:02.363 --> 18:04.633
We can’t use our privileges 


18:04.633 --> 18:07.601
as an excuse not to do those things


18:07.602 --> 18:11.774
—things such as daily Bible reading, prayer, 


18:11.773 --> 18:15.476
meeting attendance, 
the witnessing work, and so on. 


18:15.477 --> 18:18.547
So yes, we need to make sure 


18:18.547 --> 18:20.812
that we don’t allow those things to, 


18:20.812 --> 18:22.985
as it were, give us an excuse 


18:22.985 --> 18:25.887
to not do what Jehovah wants us to do.


18:25.887 --> 18:28.157
Well, when we think about it, 


18:28.157 --> 18:30.625
how could we summarize 


18:30.625 --> 18:33.228
what we personally need to do to make sure 


18:33.228 --> 18:36.198
that we allow Jehovah to direct our step? 


18:36.198 --> 18:38.300
Well, the last scripture 
I’d like to share with you 


18:38.300 --> 18:40.802
is in the book of Proverbs


18:40.802 --> 18:45.000
—Proverbs 23:19. 


18:47.408 --> 18:50.145
Proverbs 23:19: 


18:50.145 --> 18:54.448
“Listen, my son, and become wise, 


18:54.448 --> 18:58.220
and direct your heart in the right way.” 


18:58.220 --> 19:00.655
So, what do we need to do? 


19:00.655 --> 19:04.125
We need to direct our heart 
in the right way. 


19:04.125 --> 19:07.362
And when we go in the right way, 
what happens? 


19:07.362 --> 19:09.699
Jehovah then favors us, 


19:09.698 --> 19:12.266
he’s happy with us, 
and then, what does he do? 


19:12.267 --> 19:14.904
He directs our steps. 


19:14.903 --> 19:16.905
So it’s all very exciting. 


19:16.905 --> 19:19.007
You’re going to your assignments soon, 


19:19.007 --> 19:21.142
and we wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing. 


19:21.142 --> 19:24.279
And we know that you will succeed 
with Jehovah’s help. 


19:24.278 --> 19:28.583
But also remember, 
it doesn’t matter what situation you face


19:28.583 --> 19:30.851
—you’re excited about something, 


19:30.852 --> 19:33.155
you’re right in the middle of an assignment, 


19:33.155 --> 19:35.923
or perhaps you have special privileges


19:35.923 --> 19:37.926
—what do you need to do? 


19:37.927 --> 19:40.695
Pause, ponder, pray, 


19:40.695 --> 19:43.065
and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants. 


19:43.065 --> 19:46.202
If you do that, 
we know you will always 


19:46.202 --> 19:49.000
allow Jehovah to guide your steps.


19:55.477 --> 19:59.000
Now, we’ll have 
our presentation of the diplomas.

and he’s going to read 
the class letter to us.


26:29.737 --> 26:34.000
“September 9, 2017. 


26:35.043 --> 26:38.446
“To the Governing Body and the Bethel family. 


26:38.447 --> 26:40.582
“Dear Brothers: 


26:40.582 --> 26:45.520
“At Psalm 25:12, 13,

“David wrote:

27:35.437 --> 27:38.305
“revealing a marvelous picture. 


27:38.305 --> 27:40.608
“Moreover, we have learned 


27:40.608 --> 27:42.610
“how to work with Jehovah 


27:42.610 --> 27:44.612
“even more closely. 


27:44.612 --> 27:48.850
“We have also been taught how to display 


27:48.850 --> 27:51.585
“the mind of Christ more fully, 


27:51.585 --> 27:55.623
“especially by imitating his love 


27:55.623 --> 27:59.193
“when dealing with our brothers and sisters. 


27:59.193 --> 28:02.896
“Like Paul, we ask: 


28:02.897 --> 28:07.102
“‘What, then, 
are we to say about these things?’ 


28:07.102 --> 28:10.839
“We have mixed feelings: 


28:10.838 --> 28:12.973
“deep gratitude 


28:12.973 --> 28:17.145
“and a sense 
of insignificance overwhelm us, 


28:17.145 --> 28:19.447
“gratitude to you 


28:19.447 --> 28:21.750
“members of the Governing Body 


28:21.750 --> 28:24.685
“for your loving and honest counsel, 


28:24.685 --> 28:26.822
“gratitude to you 


28:26.822 --> 28:28.857
“our dear instructors 


28:28.857 --> 28:30.859
“for your tireless efforts 


28:30.858 --> 28:33.761
“to reach and touch our hearts, 


28:33.762 --> 28:36.264
“and gratitude to you 


28:36.263 --> 28:38.766
“dear members of the Bethel family. 


28:38.767 --> 28:43.672
“We will never forget your warm welcome 


28:43.672 --> 28:48.000
“and the way you included us in your family.


28:49.943 --> 28:52.880
“On the other hand, 
we feel insignificant 


28:52.880 --> 28:56.450
“in view of the greatness 
of Jehovah’s organization, 


28:56.450 --> 28:59.853
“insignificant as we begin to understand 


28:59.853 --> 29:02.290
“the depth of God’s Word, 


29:02.290 --> 29:04.825
“insignificant in view 


29:04.825 --> 29:08.028
“of the immense task ahead of us 


29:08.028 --> 29:10.465
“as we strive to apply 


29:10.465 --> 29:13.033
“all that we have learned. 


29:13.033 --> 29:15.436
“Furthermore, 


29:15.437 --> 29:18.339
“staying at Patterson for 20 weeks 


29:18.338 --> 29:20.841
“allowed us to feel the pulse 


29:20.842 --> 29:24.212
“of the earthly part 
of Jehovah’s organization. 


29:24.212 --> 29:27.649
“We have enjoyed the willing spirit 


29:27.648 --> 29:29.716
“of the many young ones 


29:29.717 --> 29:33.020
“and the wonderful example 
of faithful service 


29:33.020 --> 29:36.723
“of our older brothers and sisters. 


29:36.723 --> 29:39.260
“While working with you, 


29:39.260 --> 29:42.063
“we realized how much is accomplished 


29:42.063 --> 29:44.065
“behind the scenes. 


29:44.065 --> 29:46.167
“And we were deeply touched 


29:46.167 --> 29:49.104
“when we personally saw 
how the Governing Body 


29:49.103 --> 29:51.205
“genuinely cares 


29:51.205 --> 29:54.008
“for our dear brothers and sisters 


29:54.008 --> 29:56.076
“all over the world, 


29:56.077 --> 30:00.449
“and especially now in Russia.


30:00.448 --> 30:03.985
“However, these 


30:03.985 --> 30:07.555
“are more than just mere memories. 


30:07.555 --> 30:11.192
“It is a turning point in our lives. 


30:11.192 --> 30:13.227
“We understand 


30:13.227 --> 30:16.230
“that the biggest test is still ahead of us. 


30:16.230 --> 30:18.933
“Whatever assignment comes our way, 


30:18.933 --> 30:23.136
“we are determined to do 


30:23.137 --> 30:26.942
“our very best for Jehovah’s glory 


30:26.942 --> 30:30.379
“and the benefit of his organization. 


30:30.378 --> 30:33.915
“Yes, ‘it is 


30:33.915 --> 30:37.718
“‘the blessing of Jehovah 


30:37.718 --> 30:40.120
“that makes one rich.’ 


30:40.120 --> 30:44.558
“We have been enriched 
by making new lifelong friends 


30:44.558 --> 30:48.530
“and by the wonderful heritage 
received at Gilead. 


30:48.530 --> 30:51.065
“It is now 


30:51.065 --> 30:54.968
“our wish and pleasure 


30:54.968 --> 30:57.938
“to share these blessings 


30:57.938 --> 31:01.708
“with others in our assignments. 


31:01.708 --> 31:04.978
“Your brothers and sisters, 


31:04.978 --> 31:09.000
the 143rd class of Gilead.”


31:36.110 --> 31:38.478
It was definitely brought home to us today 


31:38.478 --> 31:41.916
that Jehovah is our Grand Instructor. 


31:41.917 --> 31:46.020
There is none like him 
in the entire universe. 


31:46.020 --> 31:49.957
He is so patient with us 
and so kind and so merciful 


31:49.957 --> 31:52.227
and definitely so loving. 


31:52.227 --> 31:55.797
He’s been good to us today, 


31:55.797 --> 32:00.669
and he’s going to be good for us forever. 


32:00.668 --> 32:02.870
So we’re just getting started. 


32:02.870 --> 32:05.440
We’re crawling. 


32:05.440 --> 32:07.842
But one of these days, we’ll get up 


32:07.842 --> 32:11.212
and we’ll walk and we’ll run. 


32:11.212 --> 32:13.982
Jehovah ranks the highest. 


32:13.982 --> 32:16.350
He was teaching not just you 


32:16.350 --> 32:18.720
but all of us today. 


32:18.720 --> 32:21.388
None of us as sinful humans 


32:21.388 --> 32:23.390
could say or speak the words 


32:23.390 --> 32:26.227
that touched our hearts without the help 


32:26.227 --> 32:28.462
of Jehovah’s holy spirit. 


32:28.462 --> 32:30.499
And there’s not a brother 


32:30.498 --> 32:34.935
that does not ask for that spirit, or sister, 


32:34.935 --> 32:38.000
who steps out here before God’s sheep 


32:39.907 --> 32:44.579
and gives any kind 
of encouragement or instruction.


32:44.578 --> 32:46.713
Jesus gave us the promise 


32:46.713 --> 32:50.083
at John 14:26, 


32:50.083 --> 32:53.788
and this is what he said. 


32:53.788 --> 32:56.000
Those of you who have your pads, 


32:57.992 --> 33:00.462
you’re already there. 


33:00.462 --> 33:03.597
I’m just getting there. 


33:03.597 --> 33:07.902
That’s John 14:26, which says: 


33:07.902 --> 33:09.870
“But the helper, the holy spirit, 


33:09.870 --> 33:12.273
“which the Father will send in my name, 


33:12.273 --> 33:15.141
“that one will teach you all things 


33:15.142 --> 33:17.712
“and bring back to your minds 


33:17.712 --> 33:20.000
all the things I told you.” 


33:21.282 --> 33:23.384
So 


33:23.383 --> 33:26.000
the holy spirit is going 
to help you remember. 


33:27.188 --> 33:30.000
Without it, you couldn’t remember. 


33:31.458 --> 33:34.595
But we pray for the holy spirit, 


33:34.595 --> 33:38.365
and it’s sent to us, and we remember. 


33:38.365 --> 33:40.768
Sometimes we’re shocked at how much 


33:40.768 --> 33:42.870
we can remember at a given time. 


33:42.870 --> 33:44.672
Well, it’s not us. 


33:44.672 --> 33:47.675
Somebody is helping us to remember, 


33:47.675 --> 33:50.412
and we must never forget that. 


33:50.412 --> 33:52.814
That promise 


33:52.813 --> 33:56.150
that Jesus gave way back then 


33:56.150 --> 33:59.453
held true not only for Jesus’ disciples 


33:59.453 --> 34:02.523
back then who loved him very much 


34:02.523 --> 34:05.125
but it holds true today 


34:05.125 --> 34:09.163
for those who love him as we do. 


34:09.163 --> 34:12.500
And we definitely love him. 


34:12.500 --> 34:14.602
There is just no doubt in our minds 


34:14.602 --> 34:17.239
about the love that we have in our hearts 


34:17.238 --> 34:21.008
for Jehovah God and Jesus. 


34:21.008 --> 34:24.000
It’s there.


34:25.245 --> 34:27.415
Jehovah opens our minds 


34:27.415 --> 34:29.583
and hearts to receive his Word. 


34:29.583 --> 34:33.286
Just think of the things that we’ve heard 


34:33.287 --> 34:35.824
from this platform today


34:35.823 --> 34:38.325
—things that touched the heart, 


34:38.325 --> 34:41.762
warmed the soul. 


34:41.762 --> 34:43.765
Jehovah was with us today 


34:43.765 --> 34:46.000
by means of his holy spirit. 


34:47.968 --> 34:50.070
Of course, this happened years ago 


34:50.070 --> 34:52.340
to a worshipper of Jehovah. 


34:52.340 --> 34:55.000
It wasn’t a male; it was a female. 


34:56.410 --> 35:01.000
At Acts 16:14, we find it’s Lydia. 


35:03.117 --> 35:05.987
It reads: “And a certain woman named Lydia, 


35:05.987 --> 35:08.957
“a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira 


35:08.957 --> 35:12.994
“and a worshiper of God, was listening, 


35:12.993 --> 35:16.730
“and Jehovah opened her heart wide 


35:16.730 --> 35:19.500
“to pay attention to the things 


35:19.500 --> 35:21.902
being spoken by Paul.” 


35:21.902 --> 35:24.972
When Jehovah speaks 
and he opens our hearts, 


35:24.972 --> 35:27.242
we must not close our hearts 


35:27.242 --> 35:29.644
by failing to pay attention 


35:29.643 --> 35:34.681
to the brother that Jehovah 
is using to speak through. 


35:34.682 --> 35:36.184
If we’re not careful, 


35:36.183 --> 35:39.553
we just may close to that brother 


35:39.553 --> 35:43.390
because his tie is not straight, 


35:43.390 --> 35:47.000
his shoes are not shined. 


35:49.130 --> 35:51.132
That’s dangerous. 


35:51.132 --> 35:53.134
We want to listen to him. 


35:53.133 --> 35:55.703
Jehovah put him up there, 


35:55.703 --> 35:58.000
and we want to listen to what he has to say. 


35:59.273 --> 36:02.000
Don’t be so concerned with the way he looks. 


36:03.510 --> 36:06.047
If someone was concerned 
about the way a donkey looked, 


36:06.047 --> 36:08.749
he wouldn’t have paid any attention years ago 


36:08.748 --> 36:11.000
because Jehovah spoke through a donkey. 


36:12.620 --> 36:16.000
Donkeys are not the most beautiful animal. 


36:17.558 --> 36:19.593
But Jehovah chooses 


36:19.593 --> 36:22.095
what Jehovah wants to choose, 


36:22.095 --> 36:24.898
and he teaches lessons 


36:24.898 --> 36:27.066
for each and every one of us.


36:27.067 --> 36:29.504
Now, of course, when Lydia 


36:29.503 --> 36:32.773
was opening her heart 
by Jehovah’s help, 


36:32.773 --> 36:34.775
she’s looking at Paul. 


36:34.775 --> 36:38.845
But Paul may not have been 
the most handsome man to look at. 


36:38.845 --> 36:41.000
We don’t really know. 


36:42.082 --> 36:45.000
Some say that his eyebrows matched. 


36:46.987 --> 36:49.890
Others say he couldn’t see good. 


36:49.890 --> 36:52.927
Some say he was bald-headed. 


36:52.927 --> 36:55.162
We don’t really know. 


36:55.162 --> 37:00.000
One of these days we’ll know.


37:01.935 --> 37:04.738
Well, you’re no longer Gilead students 


37:04.738 --> 37:08.000
you are ex-Gilead students, 


37:10.177 --> 37:14.149
but may you never 
become ex-students of Jehovah


37:14.148 --> 37:17.451
—your Grand Instructor. 


37:17.452 --> 37:21.189
They didn’t give me too many minutes, 
you know, to talk to you, 


37:21.188 --> 37:24.558
but that’s all the time I’ve got. 


37:24.558 --> 37:43.461
Isn’t this a beautiful group, though?

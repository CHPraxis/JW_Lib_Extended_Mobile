00:01 “Always Allow Jehovah to Direct Your Steps”
00:04 is the theme Brother Geoffrey Jackson,
00:06 a member of the Governing Body,  will now share with us.
00:10 Well, it’s a real privilege  and pleasure for me
00:13 to stand before you again.
00:15 It just seems like a few days ago   when I had the privilege
00:19 of giving you the first lecture  that I give at Gilead.
00:23 And now, here it is,  your very special day of graduation.
00:29 Before you go on  to your assignments after graduation,
00:32 we’d like to leave you with a question,
00:36 Are you willing
00:38 to allow Jehovah to direct your steps?
00:41 Now, we all know how you’re going to answer
00:45 because we know that you’ve been willing
00:48 to allow Jehovah to direct your steps  right up to this moment.
00:51 That’s why you dedicated  yourselves to Jehovah,
00:55 why you entered full-time service,  special full-time service,
00:58 and that’s why you’re here —having attended Gilead.
01:02 And that’s why we love you,  and we’re proud of you
01:06 because you are willing  to allow Jehovah to direct your steps.
01:12 But, you know, perhaps it seems  a little presumptuous on our part
01:16 to ask the question  about are we willing to allow Jehovah.
01:20 Can mere man allow Jehovah to do anything?
01:24 Well, the reason behind that question is,
01:27 of course, that Jehovah  doesn’t force himself on us.
01:31 It doesn’t automatically happen
01:34 that Jehovah directs our steps.
01:36 In fact, something is required of us,
01:39 and this, in a sense,  allows Jehovah to work with us.
01:43 Let’s have a look in our Bibles  at an interesting scripture
01:47 in the book of Psalms.
01:48 It’s Psalm 37,
01:51 a section of Scripture  that we all use
01:54 over and over again in the service.
01:57 But this time,  we’re going to look at verse 23,
02:00 Psalm 37:23:
02:04 “Jehovah guides the steps of a man
02:08 when He finds pleasure in his way.”
02:11 Now, if you were just listening to that
02:13 and you didn’t have a printed  or electronic copy in front of you,
02:17 it would be easy  to misunderstand this verse.
02:20 Why?
02:21 Well, if you hear it read  “when He finds pleasure in his way,”
02:25 you naturally assume “when [the man]  finds pleasure in [Jehovah’s] way.”
02:31 But you notice the New World Translation  capitalizes the “He”
02:36 —“when He finds pleasure in his way.”
02:40 So now if we were  to substitute the pronouns there,
02:42 what does it really say?
02:44 “Jehovah guides the steps of a man
02:47 when [Jehovah] finds pleasure  in [the man’s] way.”
02:52 Now, isn’t that an interesting concept?
02:55 So for us to have our steps  guided by Jehovah,
03:00 we have to do things  that bring pleasure to Jehovah.
03:04 And when Jehovah finds pleasure in our way,
03:08 then he directs our steps.
03:10 Isn’t that a profound thought?
03:13 So in that way, once we do things  in accordance with Jehovah’s will,
03:17 it’s as if we figuratively allow Jehovah
03:20 to direct our steps.
03:23 Now, that doesn’t come automatically  just because we pray to Jehovah,
03:28 “Please, direct my steps.”
03:30 Let’s think of two examples  from the Scriptures,
03:34 two negative examples,  that help us in this regard.
03:38 First of all, let’s think about Balaam.
03:41 Now, remember this is  in the 15th century B.C.E.,
03:45 when the Israelites were  about to go into the Promised Land.
03:49 The Moabites were very worried about it.
03:52 Balaam was a man who had  some connection to the worship of Jehovah.
03:57 And now all of a sudden,  these messengers come to Balaam,
04:02 and they ask him to curse God’s people.
04:05 And do you remember what happened?  What did Balaam do?
04:07 He didn’t automatically answer, did he?
04:10 He said: ‘Wait here overnight.
04:12 I want to hear from Jehovah.’
04:15 And what did Jehovah say to him?
04:17 Basically, ‘Don’t go!’
04:21 Now, that’s not hard to understand, is it?
04:24 ‘Don’t go’ is simple;
04:26 you don’t need a lawyer  to try and work out what that means.
04:30 But then what happened?
04:32 Well, the pressure intensified, didn’t it?
04:35 And more messengers came
04:38 —this time, princes  and more offers of material gain.
04:42 Now, what did Balaam do?
04:45 Well, he had clearly heard  Jehovah’s direction: ‘Don’t go.’
04:49 But what did he do?
04:52 Well, his heart was already leaning  in a certain direction.
04:56 So he was hoping this would change a little.
04:59 So he said: ‘Well, let’s just wait  and see what Jehovah says.’
05:03 Now, this time what did Jehovah say?
05:05 ‘Go,
05:07 but don’t say anything  I don’t tell you to say.’
05:11 In other words:  ‘Only say what I tell you.’
05:13 Now, was this because Jehovah  was directing Balaam’s steps?
05:18 Or was it because he allowed  Balaam to go his own way?
05:23 Well, we see what happened —three times, resistance.
05:27 But then what happened?
05:29 Well, notice,  if we turn across to Numbers 22,
05:33 we hear a very clear statement.
05:35 In fact, nearly as clear  as the statement, ‘Don’t go.’
05:40 Numbers 22:32:
05:43 “Then Jehovah’s angel said to him:
05:46 “‘Why have you beaten  your donkey these three times?
05:50 “‘Look!  I myself came out to offer resistance,
05:54 because your way is in defiance of my will.’”
05:58 So there we see the answer, don’t we?
06:01 It wasn’t Jehovah directing his steps.
06:03 Jehovah was resisting what he was doing.
06:06 So, what do we learn from this?
06:08 Well, even though Balaam initially
06:12 wanted to get Jehovah’s direction,
06:14 Jehovah didn’t force himself on Balaam.
06:17 And when Balaam was determined  to go down a certain course,
06:21 yes, Jehovah gave him  signals of ‘don’t go’ and again ‘don’t go.’
06:26 But Jehovah allowed him to go and, of course,
06:28 eventually he ended up dying because of that.
06:31 And, of course, many others  died because of that as well.
06:34 So, what’s the lesson for us?
06:37 Well, sometimes we may feel  that at a certain point in our life,
06:41 we say: “Jehovah,  what do you want me to do?
06:43 What’s your will?”
06:45 And that’s good  that we pray to Jehovah that way.
06:47 But what do we need to do?
06:50 We need to do what Jehovah wants us to do.
06:53 Then, when he finds pleasure  in what we’re doing,
06:56 he directs our step.
06:58 So that’s a good lesson, isn’t it?
07:01 The second example we want  to use is of the unnamed prophet.
07:06 Do you remember the one  that’s mentioned in 1 Kings chapter 13,
07:10 who was instructed to go up to Israel
07:14 and to utter a pronouncement  there to King Jeroboam?
07:19 Now, remember the instructions again  that Jehovah gave him:
07:22 ‘Go up one way;  come back the other way.
07:25 Don’t eat or drink.’
07:27 Now, even when the king said:  ‘Come and eat and drink,’
07:30 what did he say?
07:31 ‘Oh, no.  I know what Jehovah wants me to do.’
07:34 But then what happened?
07:36 Although he was doing  very well up to that point,
07:39 remember the old prophet  tricked him by saying:
07:43 ‘Oh, don’t worry.
07:45 An angel spoke to me and said: “It’s OK.”’
07:48 What did the unnamed prophet say?
07:51 ‘Let me check with Jehovah again.
07:53 I mean, he did actually tell me.’
07:56 No.  ‘OK, let’s eat!’
07:58 Well, again it resulted in disaster,  didn’t it?
08:02 What’s the lesson we learned there?
08:04 Well, although he started a course
08:06 that was allowing Jehovah  to direct his steps,
08:11 he didn’t continue to follow  the direction that Jehovah had given him.
08:15 Now, that’s a good lesson for us too,  isn’t it?
08:18 We may do the same.
08:20 There could be friends —could even be people we respect—
08:23 who give us advice contrary
08:26 to what Jehovah is telling us,
08:28 and that could also lead to disaster.
08:32 What would have helped  in both of those situations?
08:36 Well, I’d like to read you  a quote from The Watchtower
08:39 from back in 1950  before any of you were ever born
08:44 and, incidentally, before I was born too.
08:48 But I’m sure Brother Herd read it.
08:57 Anyway, the quote says:
09:00 “It is far better
09:03 “to take a few moments for quiet reflection,
09:07 “fully considering God’s requirements
09:10 “before rushing into an action
09:13 that might bring God’s reproof.”
09:15 Let me read it again:
09:17 “It is far better to take  a few moments for quiet reflection,
09:21 “fully considering God’s requirements
09:24 “before rushing into an action
09:27 that might bring God’s reproof.”
09:30 So how can we summarize that  in a nice little expression?
09:34 Well, we could say:  “Don’t rush in.
09:38 “Pause,
09:40 “ponder,
09:42 “pray,
09:44 “and prove.
09:46 Prove to yourself  what Jehovah really wants you to do.”
09:50 So with that in mind,  as you go do your assignments,
09:54 you’re going to find all sorts of challenges.
09:57 But how can you apply this principle
10:00 of don’t rush in,
10:02 pause, ponder, pray,
10:05 and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants?
10:08 Well, let’s consider  three different circumstances.
10:12 So we always want  to allow Jehovah to direct our steps
10:17 when we’re excited about something.
10:21 We’re excited —we want to get in and do something.
10:24 Now let’s take, for example, Jacob.
10:29 We all remember,  it describes to us in the Scriptures
10:33 how he felt when he was told  that his son Joseph supposedly had died.
10:37 He was grief-stricken,
10:40 and for years
10:42 he was left with that impression  that his son was dead.
10:46 Now, can you imagine?
10:48 Just try to imagine  the joy that he would have felt
10:52 when all of a sudden  his sons return back from Egypt.
10:55 There are wagons —I mean, not just the average wagons—
10:58 I’m sure they were pretty fancy wagons.
11:00 They’re coming to pick him up.
11:02 He finds out Joseph is alive.
11:06 Not only that, he’s in Egypt.
11:09 He’s got a very high position there.
11:11 How do you think—?
11:12 Do you think excited is the word?  Of course!
11:16 He’s extremely excited and overjoyed.
11:18 So he left Hebron,  went down to Beer-sheba.
11:22 But what did he do
11:25 before he left the Promised Land  to go into Egypt?
11:28 Well, let’s have a look  in Genesis chapter 46.
11:32 Genesis chapter 46
11:35 and we’ll read verses 1-4:
11:39 “So Israel [Jacob] took all  that he had and departed.
11:43 When he arrived at Beer-sheba,  he offered sacrifices to . . . God.”
11:48 You see, he stopped, he paused, he pondered.
11:52 Yes, verse 2:
11:54 “Then God spoke to Israel  in a vision by night and said:
11:58 “‘Jacob, Jacob!’  to which he said: ‘Here I am!’
12:03 “He said: ‘I am the true God,  the God of your father.
12:08 “‘Do not be afraid  to go down to Egypt,
12:11 “‘for there I will make you  into a great nation.
12:15 “‘I myself will go down  with you to Egypt,
12:18 “‘and I myself will also  bring you back from there,
12:21 and Joseph will lay  his hand on your eyes.’”
12:24 Do we see what happened?
12:26 You see, he stopped, he paused, he pondered,
12:30 he wanted to prove to himself what Jehovah wanted.
12:35 And Jehovah gave him the go-ahead.
12:37 He had Jehovah’s blessing,  and we know how that turned out.
12:40 So do we see the lesson for us?
12:42 Perhaps, at times,  we get all excited about something.
12:46 It appears good;  it appears that we should do it.
12:48 What should we do?
12:50 Pause, ponder, pray,
12:53 and prove to yourself that  that’s really what Jehovah wants you to do.
12:57 Now, let’s think of a second example.
13:01 Imagine the time when the Israelites  were entering the Promised Land.
13:05 They were about to conquer the land.
13:08 How exciting it must have been to them!
13:11 They were busy with an assignment  that Jehovah had given them.
13:17 But still, even if we are  in the middle of an assignment,
13:21 we have to pause, ponder, pray,
13:25 and prove to ourselves  what Jehovah wants us to do.
13:29 For example, in Joshua chapter 8,  when we look there,
13:33 you’ll notice (we won’t read it)
13:35 but they were able to capture Jericho.
13:38 Then in Ai, there was a problem,  wasn’t there?
13:41 They had to sort that out.  They went back.
13:43 They were able to defeat  the inhabitants of Ai.
13:47 What did they do next?
13:49 You see, here they are poised  to conquer the whole Promised Land.
13:52 They went up to Mount Ebal,
13:56 not Mt. Ebo, just so we got that right.
13:59 They went up to Mount Ebal,  and what did they do?
14:03 They paused, pondered, prayed,
14:07 and proved to themselves  what Jehovah wanted them to do.
14:10 They read the whole Law.
14:13 Yes, they stopped the military campaign,
14:16 took time to make sure  what Jehovah wanted them to do,
14:20 and then they went ahead  to complete that military campaign.
14:24 So again, what lesson for us?
14:26 You’ve received many assignments.
14:28 You will receive  more assignments in the future.
14:30 But just because you’re in the middle  of an assignment you’ve started
14:34 doesn’t mean to say that you’ll continue
14:37 to allow Jehovah to direct your steps.
14:39 You have to pause, ponder, pray,
14:44 and prove to yourself  what Jehovah wants.
14:47 Now, the third situation,  as a reminder,
14:51 is that we still need  to be extra careful to allow Jehovah
14:55 to direct our steps  when we have special privileges.
15:00 You see, it’s very easy  for us perhaps to think:
15:03 ‘Well, now I’ve been to Gilead.
15:06 ‘I can probably miss a few meetings  for a few months anyway.
15:11 ‘I’ve got a bit of spiritual fat.
15:15 ‘You see, all those other brothers,  they need to go to the meetings.
15:18 But I got plenty  to keep me going for a while.’
15:23 Really?
15:25 Well, we have an example in the Scriptures  to help us in that regard.
15:29 Let’s look in Luke chapter 2,
15:32 and this, of course, is the account  dealing with Joseph and Mary
15:37 and Jesus’ birth.
15:39 So Luke 2:22-24,
15:45 there it says:
15:47 “Also, when the time came  for purifying them
15:50 “according to the Law of Moses,
15:52 “they brought him up to Jerusalem  to present him to Jehovah,
15:56 “just as it is written in Jehovah’s Law:
15:59 “‘Every firstborn male  must be called holy to Jehovah.’
16:04 “And they offered a sacrifice  according to what
16:06 “is said in the Law of Jehovah:
16:09 ‘a pair of turtledoves  or two young pigeons.’”
16:13 So, what happened here?  When?
16:15 Well, remember  this was 40 days after Jesus’ birth.
16:20 Mary needed to go to the temple  to purify herself, according to the Law.
16:25 And we notice  verses 22 and 24 refer to that.
16:29 The Law says to do that.
16:31 But verse 23,  what’s that referring to?
16:35 If you look at the marginal reference  where this is taken from,
16:39 it’s not talking  about the purification of Mary.
16:43 What is it talking about?
16:45 Well, possibly it’s talking about  when the man, the husband,
16:49 would have to present the child to Jehovah and pay the five shekels
16:54 and acknowledge that this child was his.
16:57 So if that’s the case,
16:59 that means both Joseph and Mary
17:01 took the time to go  and make these presentations.
17:06 Joseph was supposed  to do that after 30 days
17:10 after Jesus’ birth  or sometime thereafter.
17:13 But whatever the case,  what do we learn from this?
17:17 Joseph and Mary didn’t say:
17:19 ‘Well, you know,  we had an angel come to visit us.
17:23 ‘And this child  is very, very, very special.
17:27 ‘And remember,  when he was born, the shepherds came.
17:30 ‘The heavens were filled with angels.
17:34 ‘Surely, we shouldn’t have to go  and pay the five shekels
17:37 and offer up the birds.’
17:39 They didn’t do that, did they?
17:41 They didn’t use the special privilege  they had as an excuse
17:46 not to do what Jehovah  had instructed them to do.
17:50 Do we see the lesson for us?
17:52 If that was the case with them,  what about us?
17:56 It doesn’t matter what privileges we have,
17:59 we still have to do the basic things.
18:02 We can’t use our privileges
18:04 as an excuse not to do those things
18:07 —things such as daily Bible reading, prayer,
18:11 meeting attendance,  the witnessing work, and so on.
18:15 So yes, we need to make sure
18:18 that we don’t allow those things to,
18:20 as it were, give us an excuse
18:22 to not do what Jehovah wants us to do.
18:25 Well, when we think about it,
18:28 how could we summarize
18:30 what we personally need to do to make sure
18:33 that we allow Jehovah to direct our step?
18:36 Well, the last scripture  I’d like to share with you
18:38 is in the book of Proverbs
18:40 —Proverbs 23:19.
18:47 Proverbs 23:19:
18:50 “Listen, my son, and become wise,
18:54 and direct your heart in the right way.”
18:58 So, what do we need to do?
19:00 We need to direct our heart  in the right way.
19:04 And when we go in the right way,  what happens?
19:07 Jehovah then favors us,
19:09 he’s happy with us,  and then, what does he do?
19:12 He directs our steps.
19:14 So it’s all very exciting.
19:16 You’re going to your assignments soon,
19:19 and we wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing.
19:21 And we know that you will succeed  with Jehovah’s help.
19:24 But also remember,  it doesn’t matter what situation you face
19:28 —you’re excited about something,
19:30 you’re right in the middle of an assignment,
19:33 or perhaps you have special privileges
19:35 —what do you need to do?
19:37 Pause, ponder, pray,
19:40 and prove to yourself what Jehovah wants.
19:43 If you do that,  we know you will always
19:46 allow Jehovah to guide your steps.
19:55 Now, we’ll have  our presentation of the diplomas.

26:29 “September 9, 2017.
26:35 “To the Governing Body and the Bethel family.
26:38 “Dear Brothers:
26:40 “At Psalm 25:12, 13,
26:45 “David wrote:
26:48 “‘Who is the man fearing Jehovah?
26:53 “‘He will instruct him
26:56 “‘about the way he should choose.
26:59 “He will experience what is good.’
27:05 “The instructions we have received
27:07 “at Jehovah’s hand over the past five months
27:11 “have far surpassed our expectations.
27:14 “Indeed, our hearts have been filled
27:18 “with so many good things!
27:21 “When we started our training,
27:24 “Bible verses were
27:26 “like many isolated dots on a canvas.
27:30 “We have been taught
27:32 “how to connect them,
27:35 “revealing a marvelous picture.
27:38 “Moreover, we have learned
27:40 “how to work with Jehovah
27:42 “even more closely.
27:44 “We have also been taught how to display
27:48 “the mind of Christ more fully,
27:51 “especially by imitating his love
27:55 “when dealing with our brothers and sisters.
27:59 “Like Paul, we ask:
28:02 “‘What, then,  are we to say about these things?’
28:07 “We have mixed feelings:
28:10 “deep gratitude
28:12 “and a sense  of insignificance overwhelm us,
28:17 “gratitude to you
28:19 “members of the Governing Body
28:21 “for your loving and honest counsel,
28:24 “gratitude to you
28:26 “our dear instructors
28:28 “for your tireless efforts
28:30 “to reach and touch our hearts,
28:33 “and gratitude to you
28:36 “dear members of the Bethel family.
28:38 “We will never forget your warm welcome
28:43 “and the way you included us in your family.
28:49 “On the other hand,  we feel insignificant
28:52 “in view of the greatness  of Jehovah’s organization,
28:56 “insignificant as we begin to understand
28:59 “the depth of God’s Word,
29:02 “insignificant in view
29:04 “of the immense task ahead of us
29:08 “as we strive to apply
29:10 “all that we have learned.
29:13 “Furthermore,
29:15 “staying at Patterson for 20 weeks
29:18 “allowed us to feel the pulse
29:20 “of the earthly part  of Jehovah’s organization.
29:24 “We have enjoyed the willing spirit
29:27 “of the many young ones
29:29 “and the wonderful example  of faithful service
29:33 “of our older brothers and sisters.
29:36 “While working with you,
29:39 “we realized how much is accomplished
29:42 “behind the scenes.
29:44 “And we were deeply touched
29:46 “when we personally saw  how the Governing Body
29:49 “genuinely cares
29:51 “for our dear brothers and sisters
29:54 “all over the world,
29:56 “and especially now in Russia.
30:00 “However, these
30:03 “are more than just mere memories.
30:07 “It is a turning point in our lives.
30:11 “We understand
30:13 “that the biggest test is still ahead of us.
30:16 “Whatever assignment comes our way,
30:18 “we are determined to do
30:23 “our very best for Jehovah’s glory
30:26 “and the benefit of his organization.
30:30 “Yes, ‘it is
30:33 “‘the blessing of Jehovah
30:37 “that makes one rich.’
30:40 “We have been enriched  by making new lifelong friends
30:44 “and by the wonderful heritage  received at Gilead.
30:48 “It is now
30:51 “our wish and pleasure
30:54 “to share these blessings
30:57 “with others in our assignments.
31:01 “Your brothers and sisters,
31:04 the 143rd class of Gilead.”
31:36 It was definitely brought home to us today
31:38 that Jehovah is our Grand Instructor.
31:41 There is none like him  in the entire universe.
31:46 He is so patient with us  and so kind and so merciful
31:49 and definitely so loving.
31:52 He’s been good to us today,
31:55 and he’s going to be good for us forever.
32:00 So we’re just getting started.
32:02 We’re crawling.
32:05 But one of these days, we’ll get up
32:07 and we’ll walk and we’ll run.
32:11 Jehovah ranks the highest.
32:13 He was teaching not just you
32:16 but all of us today.
32:18 None of us as sinful humans
32:21 could say or speak the words
32:23 that touched our hearts without the help
32:26 of Jehovah’s holy spirit.
32:28 And there’s not a brother
32:30 that does not ask for that spirit, or sister,
32:34 who steps out here before God’s sheep
32:39 and gives any kind  of encouragement or instruction.
32:44 Jesus gave us the promise
32:46 at John 14:26,
32:50 and this is what he said.
32:53 Those of you who have your pads,
32:57 you’re already there.
33:00 I’m just getting there.
33:03 That’s John 14:26, which says:
33:07 “But the helper, the holy spirit,
33:09 “which the Father will send in my name,
33:12 “that one will teach you all things
33:15 “and bring back to your minds
33:17 all the things I told you.”
33:21 So
33:23 the holy spirit is going  to help you remember.
33:27 Without it, you couldn’t remember.
33:31 But we pray for the holy spirit,
33:34 and it’s sent to us, and we remember.
33:38 Sometimes we’re shocked at how much
33:40 we can remember at a given time.
33:42 Well, it’s not us.
33:44 Somebody is helping us to remember,
33:47 and we must never forget that.
33:50 That promise
33:52 that Jesus gave way back then
33:56 held true not only for Jesus’ disciples
33:59 back then who loved him very much
34:02 but it holds true today
34:05 for those who love him as we do.
34:09 And we definitely love him.
34:12 There is just no doubt in our minds
34:14 about the love that we have in our hearts
34:17 for Jehovah God and Jesus.
34:21 It’s there.
34:25 Jehovah opens our minds
34:27 and hearts to receive his Word.
34:29 Just think of the things that we’ve heard
34:33 from this platform today
34:35 —things that touched the heart,
34:38 warmed the soul.
34:41 Jehovah was with us today
34:43 by means of his holy spirit.
34:47 Of course, this happened years ago
34:50 to a worshipper of Jehovah.
34:52 It wasn’t a male; it was a female.
34:56 At Acts 16:14, we find it’s Lydia.
35:03 It reads: “And a certain woman named Lydia,
35:05 “a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira
35:08 “and a worshiper of God, was listening,
35:12 “and Jehovah opened her heart wide
35:16 “to pay attention to the things
35:19 being spoken by Paul.”
35:21 When Jehovah speaks  and he opens our hearts,
35:24 we must not close our hearts
35:27 by failing to pay attention
35:29 to the brother that Jehovah  is using to speak through.
35:34 If we’re not careful,
35:36 we just may close to that brother
35:39 because his tie is not straight,
35:43 his shoes are not shined.
35:49 That’s dangerous.
35:51 We want to listen to him.
35:53 Jehovah put him up there,
35:55 and we want to listen to what he has to say.
35:59 Don’t be so concerned with the way he looks.
36:03 If someone was concerned  about the way a donkey looked,
36:06 he wouldn’t have paid any attention years ago
36:08 because Jehovah spoke through a donkey.
36:12 Donkeys are not the most beautiful animal.
36:17 But Jehovah chooses
36:19 what Jehovah wants to choose,
36:22 and he teaches lessons
36:24 for each and every one of us.
36:27 Now, of course, when Lydia
36:29 was opening her heart  by Jehovah’s help,
36:32 she’s looking at Paul.
36:34 But Paul may not have been  the most handsome man to look at.
36:38 We don’t really know.
36:42 Some say that his eyebrows matched.
36:46 Others say he couldn’t see good.
36:49 Some say he was bald-headed.
36:52 We don’t really know.
36:55 One of these days we’ll know.
37:01 Well, you’re no longer Gilead students
37:04 you are ex-Gilead students,
37:10 but may you never  become ex-students of Jehovah
37:14 —your Grand Instructor.
37:17 They didn’t give me too many minutes,  you know, to talk to you,
37:21 but that’s all the time I’ve got.
37:24 Isn’t this a beautiful group, though?

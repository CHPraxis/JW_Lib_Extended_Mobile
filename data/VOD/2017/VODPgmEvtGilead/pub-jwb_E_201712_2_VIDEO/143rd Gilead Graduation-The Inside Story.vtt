00:00.897 --> 00:05.234
The next part is a video 
entitled The Inside Story, 


00:05.233 --> 00:08.153
hosted by Brother Ken Stovall, 


00:08.153 --> 00:13.000
who also serves 
as a Theocratic Schools instructor.


00:42.020 --> 00:45.815
I am so excited to be with you here again 


00:45.815 --> 00:48.152
on this segment of The Inside Story! 


00:48.152 --> 00:52.530
This time we’re 
with class number 143 of the Gilead School, 


00:52.530 --> 00:56.368
and you are going to meet 
some adorable brothers and sisters. 


00:56.368 --> 00:57.493
And let me tell you, 


00:57.493 --> 01:01.040
they have some moving experiences 
to relate to you. 


01:01.040 --> 01:05.168
And we’re going to solve 
two fascinating mysteries. 


01:05.168 --> 01:06.170
And we have music. 


01:06.170 --> 01:08.630
Students in this class are going 


01:08.630 --> 01:10.715
to thrill you with their musical talent. 


01:10.715 --> 01:14.262
There is a captivating song 
that they’re going to sing for you. 


01:14.262 --> 01:17.890
So come with me as we, together, 


01:17.890 --> 01:20.000
get “the inside story.”


01:23.312 --> 01:25.105
Let’s introduce our first guest. 


01:25.105 --> 01:28.000
And that would be Saša Komaromi 
from the Serbia branch.


01:37.533 --> 01:42.163
So, Brother Komaromi, 
you serve at the Serbia branch. 


01:42.163 --> 01:46.793
But you told me that some years ago, 
before you were in the truth, 


01:46.793 --> 01:50.796
you discovered that there were 
two main interests you had in life. 


01:50.797 --> 01:52.884
One of them had to do with a career choice. 


01:52.883 --> 01:54.008
Could you explain that?


01:54.008 --> 01:56.178
One was music.


01:56.178 --> 01:57.386
Music. 


01:57.387 --> 02:01.809
Now, is this a picture of you?


02:01.808 --> 02:04.895
That was the old me.


02:04.895 --> 02:06.000
Evidently, you were in a band.


02:07.522 --> 02:12.000
Yes, we were at a competition at the time.


02:13.028 --> 02:16.156
That was one of your interests, 
but there was another. 


02:16.157 --> 02:17.157
What was that?


02:17.157 --> 02:19.284
Searching for the purpose of life.


02:19.283 --> 02:22.286
And how did you 
go about searching for life’s purpose?


02:22.287 --> 02:24.332
I read a lot of books


02:24.332 --> 02:28.210
—books about parapsychology, Buddhism, 


02:28.210 --> 02:30.837
spiritism, Tibetan Lamaism.


02:30.837 --> 02:33.007
Amazing! 
That’s a lot of books. 


02:33.007 --> 02:38.387
Now, at the time, though, 
you were dating your wife, Vicki. 


02:38.387 --> 02:40.222
What did she think of all these books? 


02:40.222 --> 02:42.850
Did she share your interest 
in all this reading?


02:42.850 --> 02:44.352
I wished she did. 


02:44.352 --> 02:46.854
But no, she did not. 


02:46.853 --> 02:50.065
To be honest, it’s not really easy 


02:50.065 --> 02:52.525
to like to read those kinds of books


02:52.525 --> 02:55.737
—for example, The Book of the Dead.


02:55.737 --> 02:57.949
The Book of the Dead? 


02:57.948 --> 03:00.000
I can see that’s not going 
to be a very enjoyable book. 


03:02.703 --> 03:04.036
Now, was it only books? 


03:04.037 --> 03:07.709
Was that the only way 
you were searching for the purpose of life?


03:07.708 --> 03:12.503
No, I was also experimenting 
with different states of mind 


03:12.503 --> 03:15.381
under the influence of drugs. 


03:15.382 --> 03:18.594
During my hallucinations, 


03:18.593 --> 03:21.846
I had many things already “solved.”


03:21.847 --> 03:23.557
You had everything “solved.”


03:23.557 --> 03:25.142
This is what I thought. 


03:25.142 --> 03:30.147
But after I came to myself again, 


03:30.147 --> 03:34.944
I was again in the same room 
and everything was the same. 


03:34.943 --> 03:37.361
So I was really, really disappointed. 


03:37.362 --> 03:39.532
And then I prayed to God. 


03:39.532 --> 03:43.660
I said: 
“God, I’m asking just for one thing. 


03:43.660 --> 03:48.290
But whatever it is, just, please, 
help me to be certain that I find the truth.”


03:48.290 --> 03:50.667
Very interesting. 


03:50.667 --> 03:52.669
So you prayed for Jehovah 
to help you find the truth. 


03:52.668 --> 03:55.671
Of course, 
you didn’t know Jehovah at the time. 


03:55.672 --> 03:58.000
So how was your prayer answered?


03:59.468 --> 04:01.511
Soon after that, I went to Germany. 


04:01.512 --> 04:05.099
I had the idea to form my music studio. 


04:05.098 --> 04:07.100
During my visit there, 


04:07.100 --> 04:11.313
I understood that my uncle 
and my aunt were Jehovah’s Witnesses.


04:11.313 --> 04:12.730
And you never knew that before?


04:12.730 --> 04:14.692
No. 
No, I didn’t know.


04:14.692 --> 04:18.000
So, what did they have in their home 
that would have been really exciting to you?


04:20.530 --> 04:25.368
As all Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
they had a lot of theocratic books.


04:25.368 --> 04:27.078
Ahh. 


04:27.078 --> 04:29.246
So, did you read the books?


04:29.247 --> 04:31.040
Yes, I read them a lot. 


04:31.040 --> 04:33.835
Actually, I read a book daily.


04:33.835 --> 04:34.795
Wow! 


04:34.795 --> 04:38.215
So you get back home; 
you open up the suitcases. 


04:38.215 --> 04:42.260
And Vicki is there, 
and she sees books. 


04:42.260 --> 04:45.388
And you were supposed 
to bring home musical equipment. 


04:45.388 --> 04:47.390
What did she think about that?


04:47.390 --> 04:52.938
She thought, 
‘Now definitely he’s totally crazy.’


04:52.938 --> 04:55.648
So, what did you do?


04:55.648 --> 04:59.235
I explained to her immediately 
that from now on 


04:59.235 --> 05:03.907
I would like to live according to what I read 
in these books and the Bible. 


05:03.907 --> 05:08.370
And I would also like it for her
—that she also live like that. 


05:08.370 --> 05:11.498
If this was OK with her, 
we could stay together. 


05:11.498 --> 05:14.000
If it was not OK with her, 
we were finished.


05:16.545 --> 05:18.255
You like to be direct, don’t you?


05:18.255 --> 05:22.592
I know, I was “very tactful.” 


05:22.592 --> 05:25.804
But I also offered her 
the book Young People Ask.


05:25.803 --> 05:26.721
Did she like that?


05:26.722 --> 05:27.764
Yes. 


05:27.763 --> 05:30.641
Yes, she liked it 
much more than my ultimatum.


05:30.642 --> 05:31.519
I see.


05:31.518 --> 05:34.521
We started studying the Bible. 


05:34.522 --> 05:38.150
At the beginning, 
my wife started because of me, 


05:38.150 --> 05:40.443
but later 
she did this because of herself. 


05:40.443 --> 05:45.281
And after six months, 
we became unbaptized publishers. 


05:45.282 --> 05:50.000
Then we got married, 
and we were baptized in 1994. 


05:51.247 --> 05:53.457
Immediately, we started full-time service, 


05:53.457 --> 05:56.585
and we served five years 
as regular pioneers 


05:56.585 --> 06:00.588
and then almost five years 
as special pioneers. 


06:00.588 --> 06:05.510
And now we’ve been 
13 years at the Serbia branch.


06:05.510 --> 06:07.137
Jehovah has answered your prayer. 


06:07.137 --> 06:08.430
You’re satisfied; 


06:08.430 --> 06:12.600
you found the truth; 
you found the purpose in life. 


06:12.600 --> 06:15.728
But there’s still the music. 


06:15.728 --> 06:19.900
Did you have to give up 
your desire to play music, 


06:19.900 --> 06:23.237
to be involved in music, 
especially since you’ve come to Bethel now?


06:23.237 --> 06:25.780
Actually, in 2013, 


06:25.780 --> 06:29.827
there was an idea 
that we should start with a project 


06:29.827 --> 06:34.080
of recording vocal renditions 
of our theocratic songs. 


06:34.080 --> 06:39.252
And my wife, Violeta, and I had the privilege 
to participate in that project.


06:39.252 --> 06:42.630
Now, was this just for the Serbia branch?


06:42.630 --> 06:46.260
No, the plan was to record the songs 
in four or five languages.


06:46.260 --> 06:48.470
Four or five languages? 


06:48.470 --> 06:50.472
But would this mean, then, 
that you would travel 


06:50.472 --> 06:53.350
around to different countries 
surrounding Serbia?


06:53.350 --> 06:57.270
No, the idea was that singers 


06:57.270 --> 06:59.522
would come from other countries to Serbia, 


06:59.522 --> 07:02.192
and they would be full-time singers 


07:02.192 --> 07:05.570
for a period of time 
until we finished that project.


07:05.570 --> 07:07.822
That must have been 
a tremendous amount of work. 


07:07.822 --> 07:09.950
How did you get that accomplished?


07:09.950 --> 07:12.910
Yeah, it’s easier if we see a video, 


07:12.910 --> 07:15.080
and it will be much more understandable.


07:15.080 --> 07:19.417
All right, good. 
Let’s watch the video.


07:19.417 --> 07:24.000
One of the first things we needed 
was a recording studio. 


07:25.215 --> 07:30.000
So with the help of many, we built our own.


07:34.182 --> 07:38.000
A typical day began 
with a little music theory, 


07:41.230 --> 07:43.025
a little stretching,


07:43.025 --> 07:47.000
and a brief review 
of the song’s Scriptural theme.


07:49.155 --> 07:51.533
Once they received a new song, 


07:51.533 --> 07:54.000
they practiced in separate groups. 


07:55.578 --> 07:58.000
Then they would all come together.


08:00.042 --> 08:04.000
Finally, it was time to record. 


08:05.047 --> 08:09.050
This resulted in 450 songs being recorded 


08:09.050 --> 08:14.000
in a period of 22 months.


08:30.197 --> 08:34.702
Looking back, 
these songs were sung not just with words 


08:34.702 --> 08:39.000
but with hearts full of love for Jehovah.


08:44.043 --> 08:47.000
Look at them.


08:49.800 --> 08:51.385
Those are nice greetings at the end there.


08:51.385 --> 08:52.552
Yeah, nice surprise.


08:52.552 --> 08:54.137
I loved the way the chorus sounded. 


08:54.137 --> 08:55.305
You did a good job with them. 


08:55.305 --> 08:58.933
That must have been 
a tremendous amount of work, 


08:58.933 --> 09:02.061
getting that all done, though, 
in five different languages.


09:02.062 --> 09:05.899
Yes, the singers did a great job 
and also all the crew. 


09:05.898 --> 09:08.693
And you really could see, 
all the time, 


09:08.693 --> 09:11.696
their love for Jehovah 
and love for the brotherhood. 


09:11.697 --> 09:15.000
And every day you could see 
a lot of their self-sacrificing spirit.


09:16.993 --> 09:18.370
Now, Saša, 
let me ask you one more question. 


09:18.370 --> 09:20.913
We saw the picture there 
of you as a musician, 


09:20.913 --> 09:23.583
and I know you have 
some musical talent. 


09:23.583 --> 09:25.876
Possibly, you could have become famous. 


09:25.877 --> 09:30.299
Do you ever regret not pursuing 
some sort of a career in the world 


09:30.298 --> 09:34.260
as opposed to giving your life 
in full-time service to Jehovah?


09:34.260 --> 09:36.722
As you said, I could be famous. 


09:36.722 --> 09:41.017
Or I could have become 
a drug addict and now be dead.


09:41.017 --> 09:43.479
That’s a good point.


09:43.478 --> 09:46.606
So no, no regrets at all. 


09:46.607 --> 09:52.487
I received much, 
much more than I ever imagined. 


09:52.487 --> 09:56.115
And in my case, 
from my first prayer till now, 


09:56.115 --> 09:59.912
Jehovah assured me 
that he’s really the “Hearer of prayer,” 


09:59.912 --> 10:03.000
as the psalmist 
mentioned in Psalm 65:2.


10:04.248 --> 10:05.791
Excellent! 
Thank you so much, Saša, 


10:05.792 --> 10:08.670
for sharing 
these very heartfelt comments.


10:08.670 --> 10:09.753
You’re welcome.


10:09.753 --> 10:11.000
Thank you.


10:17.262 --> 10:19.305
Now, you know what we’re going to do? 


10:19.305 --> 10:21.390
We’re going to give you the opportunity 


10:21.390 --> 10:23.477
to get to know some of the students 


10:23.477 --> 10:24.854
in our audience. 


10:24.853 --> 10:26.228
We’re going to do an activity 


10:26.228 --> 10:28.690
I call What’s My Favorite Scripture? 


10:28.690 --> 10:31.527
So we’re going to ask 
the students if they’ll volunteer 


10:31.527 --> 10:34.112
and give us their favorite scripture and, 
in a minute or less, 


10:34.112 --> 10:37.699
tell us what it says 
and why it’s their favorite scripture.


10:37.698 --> 10:38.700
OK, 


10:38.700 --> 10:41.000
let’s see now. 


10:42.745 --> 10:45.373
Who would like to go first? 


10:45.373 --> 10:49.293
Shingirai Mapfumo from Zimbabwe.


10:49.293 --> 10:51.420
Psalm 84:11.


10:51.420 --> 10:53.798
And what does that say?


10:53.798 --> 10:57.301
“For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield; 


10:57.302 --> 10:59.720
“he gives favor and glory. 


10:59.720 --> 11:02.723
“Jehovah will not hold back anything good 


11:02.723 --> 11:04.725
from those walking in integrity.”


11:04.725 --> 11:07.000
OK, so tell us, 
Why is that your favorite scripture?


11:08.230 --> 11:11.065
During the economic crisis in Zimbabwe, 


11:11.065 --> 11:13.860
my pioneer partner and I ran out of food. 


11:13.860 --> 11:16.278
We were really starving, 


11:16.278 --> 11:19.740
and physically we were so weak 
that we could not even function. 


11:19.740 --> 11:21.702
Still, we managed to go to town, 


11:21.702 --> 11:24.454
hoping that we could get 
some money from the bank. 


11:24.453 --> 11:26.455
There was a long queue, 


11:26.455 --> 11:29.042
and the bank 
was not giving any money either. 


11:29.042 --> 11:31.002
We were so distraught. 


11:31.002 --> 11:35.007
At that moment 
when we didn’t know what to do, 


11:35.007 --> 11:40.137
a truck from the branch office 
brought food supplies for us. 


11:40.137 --> 11:42.639
Then it became so clear to me 


11:42.638 --> 11:44.640
that Jehovah is “a shield,” 


11:44.640 --> 11:48.562
and he never “hold[s] back anything good” 
from his loyal servants.


11:48.562 --> 11:51.105
Amazing! Well, I can see why 
that’s your favorite scripture.


11:51.105 --> 11:53.107
All right, who else? 


11:53.107 --> 11:56.654
Let’s get Sister Tšèpang Mhlongo, 


11:56.653 --> 11:58.488
and she’s from South Africa.


11:58.488 --> 12:02.366
My favorite scripture is Psalm 68:5, 


12:02.367 --> 12:04.577
and it says about Jehovah 


12:04.577 --> 12:08.707
that he is the “father of the fatherless 
and a protector of widows.”


12:08.707 --> 12:10.917
Why is that your favorite scripture?


12:10.917 --> 12:14.504
Well, I became motherless 
when I was only one year old. 


12:14.503 --> 12:19.341
But Jehovah has provided me 
with hundreds of mothers around the globe, 


12:19.342 --> 12:22.262
both black and white. 


12:22.262 --> 12:25.057
And because our Bethel work 


12:25.057 --> 12:28.352
involves traveling 
all around the African continent 


12:28.352 --> 12:30.354
working with the translators, 


12:30.353 --> 12:32.855
it makes it even more precious to me 


12:32.855 --> 12:36.025
that I adopt this family wherever we go. 


12:36.025 --> 12:39.278
Truly, Jehovah has proved to be my Father 


12:39.278 --> 12:41.571
and my Protector to this day.


12:41.572 --> 12:43.074
Hmm, very touching. 


12:43.073 --> 12:45.743
And I’m sure that all 
of those parents who have adopted you 


12:45.743 --> 12:48.000
are proud to have you as a daughter.


12:49.122 --> 12:51.834
Who else could tell us 
their favorite scripture? 


12:51.833 --> 12:56.086
All right, 
let’s get Brother Sylvain Bois from Benin.


12:56.087 --> 12:59.090
It is Psalm 94:18, 19.


12:59.090 --> 13:01.092
And what does it say?


13:01.092 --> 13:05.722
“Your loyal love, O Jehovah, 
kept supporting me. 


13:05.722 --> 13:08.392
“When anxieties overwhelmed me, 


13:08.392 --> 13:11.812
you comforted and soothed me.”


13:11.812 --> 13:15.940
So tell us, 
Why is that scripture special to you?


13:15.940 --> 13:19.110
Years ago, when I was attending 
Ministerial Training School (MTS), 


13:19.110 --> 13:22.822
I had a serious stroke 
and I was hospitalized. 


13:22.822 --> 13:25.575
When I awoke from the coma, 


13:25.575 --> 13:28.537
I felt very happy because I was alive. 


13:28.537 --> 13:30.622
But also very discouraged 


13:30.622 --> 13:33.290
because I thought 
everything was over for me


13:33.290 --> 13:35.793
—pioneer service, school, 


13:35.793 --> 13:40.215
and even my dream 
to one day become a missionary. 


13:40.215 --> 13:44.593
But one of the instructors 
and his wife came to the hospital, 


13:44.593 --> 13:46.721
and they read me that verse. 


13:46.722 --> 13:50.059
And my heart was full of anxieties, 


13:50.058 --> 13:52.393
but I really felt that day that Jehovah 


13:52.393 --> 13:55.896
was able to comfort me and soothe me. 


13:55.897 --> 13:57.065
And you know what? 


13:57.065 --> 13:59.400
One year later, 


13:59.400 --> 14:01.862
I was permitted to again attend MTS. 


14:01.862 --> 14:03.864
And a few months later, 


14:03.863 --> 14:06.406
Jehovah fulfilled another of my dreams, 


14:06.407 --> 14:09.035
as I was assigned as a missionary in Africa.


14:09.035 --> 14:11.037
Brother Bois, that was very touching. 


14:11.037 --> 14:14.374
Thank you so much, and we’re so glad 
to have you in this class of Gilead.


14:14.373 --> 14:17.000
Well, that’s all 
that we’re going to have time for.


14:20.963 --> 14:24.050
So now it’s time to introduce our next guest, 


14:24.050 --> 14:28.000
and that would be Brother Paulo Maganha, 
and he’s from Brazil.


14:37.688 --> 14:39.981
Now, Brother Maganha, 
you’re at the Brazil branch. 


14:39.982 --> 14:43.235
But you came into the truth 
at nine years old, 


14:43.235 --> 14:45.238
at the same time as your mother. 


14:45.238 --> 14:49.366
And you went to the branch, 
to Bethel, in your early 20’s, 


14:49.367 --> 14:52.579
and you’ve been there for 27 years. 


14:52.578 --> 14:55.706
What department 
do you work in at the branch now?


14:55.707 --> 14:58.209
I am now in LDC for one and a half years.


14:58.208 --> 14:59.210
LDC. 


14:59.210 --> 15:03.632
OK, would you just tell us, 
What does the LDC Department do?


15:03.632 --> 15:06.927
LDC is 
the Local Design/Construction Department. 


15:06.927 --> 15:09.012
It’s responsible for the work of planning, 


15:09.012 --> 15:13.182
construction, and maintenance 
of Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.


15:13.182 --> 15:17.104
You have the LDC Department there at Bethel, 


15:17.103 --> 15:19.480
but who outside of Bethel 


15:19.480 --> 15:23.400
works with building 
Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls?


15:23.400 --> 15:26.237
Outside we have many brothers and sisters 


15:26.237 --> 15:29.657
serving as construction servants, 
construction volunteers, 


15:29.657 --> 15:33.077
remote volunteers, 
and field representatives.


15:33.077 --> 15:34.245
Now, this is—
This is the mystery.


15:34.245 --> 15:35.122
This is our first mystery. 


15:35.122 --> 15:38.875
What really, then, 
does a field representative do?


15:38.875 --> 15:42.003
OK, let’s just call them field rep. OK?


15:42.003 --> 15:43.796
OK. 
Field rep, I like that.


15:43.797 --> 15:48.050
You could say that they are the eyes 
and the ears of the LDC at the branch. 


15:48.050 --> 15:51.178
But what if I show you 
some pictures regarding the work?


15:51.178 --> 15:52.263
I would love that!


15:52.263 --> 15:52.971
OK. 


15:52.972 --> 15:57.935
At the first step, the office asks him 
to investigate some congregation needs. 


15:57.935 --> 16:01.147
He meets with the local elders 
and the circuit overseer 


16:01.147 --> 16:03.149
to determine the needs. 


16:03.148 --> 16:06.568
And later, he sends 
a recommendation to the office.


16:06.568 --> 16:08.863
I see.
So if he has a large region,


16:08.863 --> 16:11.198
he may have to have 
many, many of these meetings 


16:11.198 --> 16:14.285
and do a lot of research to determine 
what the needs are for Kingdom Halls.


16:14.285 --> 16:15.537
Yeah. 


16:15.537 --> 16:17.289
Once the project is approved, 


16:17.288 --> 16:21.291
the next step is to search 
for appropriate land, a property. 


16:21.292 --> 16:23.754
To do that, 
he goes to the Internet, 


16:23.753 --> 16:27.000
consults real estate agents, 
local brothers, neighbors. 


16:28.257 --> 16:31.260
To find the right property 
at the right cost can be very time consuming 


16:31.260 --> 16:34.597
and requires of him 
a lot of skills and abilities. 


16:34.597 --> 16:38.894
And the field rep 
is also responsible for getting the permits, 


16:38.893 --> 16:40.895
the approvals, for construction. 


16:40.895 --> 16:44.523
And he visits 
several different agencies every day 


16:44.523 --> 16:48.193
to get the permits to have 
everything approved by the government.


16:48.193 --> 16:51.446
In big cities, he may have to stand 
in line after line after line. 


16:51.447 --> 16:52.532
This could take—


16:52.532 --> 16:55.577
Yeah. And in bigger cities, 
it can take even some weeks 


16:55.577 --> 16:57.912
or months 
to get everything approved. 


16:57.912 --> 17:02.125
Finally, when everything is approved, 
the construction group starts the work. 


17:02.125 --> 17:04.627
And you can see him again visiting the site 


17:04.627 --> 17:08.464
in order to give some technical support 
to the construction overseer.


17:08.463 --> 17:10.675
So, now, does he stay on the site 


17:10.675 --> 17:12.343
when a building is being built?


17:12.343 --> 17:14.595
No, he returns to his office 


17:14.595 --> 17:18.850
but remains in contact with the group 
to give some remote support. 


17:18.850 --> 17:22.770
Especially when some big issues 
arise at the site, 


17:22.770 --> 17:26.315
the construction overseer 
can always count on his good support.


17:26.315 --> 17:27.317
OK, good. 


17:27.317 --> 17:30.194
I notice in this picture, 
behind the field representative, 


17:30.193 --> 17:32.071
we see a sister pictured there. 


17:32.072 --> 17:33.699
Who might that be?


17:33.698 --> 17:35.700
Well, if he’s married, 


17:35.700 --> 17:39.162
his wife can do 
lots of work to help him. 


17:39.162 --> 17:43.499
But if he is not, he can count 
on a local volunteer to help him. 


17:43.498 --> 17:46.376
Once the project is concluded, 
he visits the site again, 


17:46.377 --> 17:48.379
now to do the commissioning 


17:48.378 --> 17:51.631
and to make sure that everything 
was done according to the plans.


17:51.632 --> 17:54.010
So, evidently, his job is done now.


17:54.010 --> 17:55.470
No, not yet. 


17:55.470 --> 17:59.015
He’s also responsible 
for giving training to local brothers 


17:59.015 --> 18:01.058
to properly maintain the building.


18:01.058 --> 18:03.978
Wow! 
So you have helped solve this mystery. 


18:03.978 --> 18:06.000
He does have a lot of work to do. 


18:07.315 --> 18:11.693
But really, does working 
on one project keep him busy?


18:11.693 --> 18:13.361
No, it is not just one, Brother Stovall. 


18:13.362 --> 18:16.199
They are very busy and productive workers. 


18:16.198 --> 18:20.745
On average, each field rep 
can be working on 10 to 15 projects 


18:20.745 --> 18:23.122
in different phases but at the same time.


18:23.122 --> 18:24.957
My goodness!
That’s amazing!


18:24.957 --> 18:28.419
So they really do 
an amazing amount of work then. 


18:28.418 --> 18:30.880
Paulo, I understand that at your branch, 


18:30.880 --> 18:34.883
you’ve come up with a very innovative idea 


18:34.883 --> 18:37.720
regarding Assembly Halls and Kingdom Halls. 


18:37.720 --> 18:39.263
Could you explain that to us?


18:39.263 --> 18:43.433
Yes, we have done what is called 
an expandable Kingdom Hall.


18:43.433 --> 18:46.561
Expandable Kingdom Hall? 


18:46.562 --> 18:49.690
Saša, do you have 
expandable Kingdom Halls in Serbia?


18:49.690 --> 18:51.000
Not that I’m aware of.


18:52.068 --> 18:53.276
I can’t even imagine. 


18:53.277 --> 18:55.447
How do you expand a Kingdom Hall?


18:55.447 --> 18:58.615
OK, what if we see a brief video about this?


18:58.615 --> 19:01.000
OK, I’d like that.


19:02.787 --> 19:06.790
At first, 
it looks like a normal Kingdom Hall. 


19:06.790 --> 19:11.920
But something wonderful happens 
when the back walls are lifted.


19:11.920 --> 19:17.000
It’s now large enough to hold 
an entire assembly or convention.


19:19.012 --> 19:23.767
But before we can meet there, 
it has to be cleaned. 


19:23.767 --> 19:27.270
Chairs are rented and arranged. 


19:27.270 --> 19:30.690
And audio and video equipment must be set up 


19:30.690 --> 19:33.067
so that no matter where you sit, 


19:33.067 --> 19:36.862
you won’t miss anything.


19:36.862 --> 19:41.000
All the hard work is worth it 
when you see how much the friends benefit.


19:59.218 --> 20:02.055
When the special weekend of activity is over 


20:02.055 --> 20:04.223
and the walls are lowered, 


20:04.223 --> 20:09.000
it goes right back 
to being a Kingdom Hall again.


20:26.787 --> 20:28.164
That’s our family there.


20:28.163 --> 20:30.583
Uh-huh. 
They sent you some spirited greetings.


20:30.583 --> 20:31.333
Yeah.


20:31.333 --> 20:33.335
And what a brilliant way 


20:33.335 --> 20:36.213
to get the most out of a building 
and save money! 


20:36.213 --> 20:38.548
Now, Brother Maganha, 
I just want to ask you, 


20:38.548 --> 20:42.886
What has impressed you the most 
about working with the LDC Department?


20:42.887 --> 20:47.057
What really touched my heart 
is to see the spirit of willingness to help 


20:47.057 --> 20:50.144
shown by all those involved with the LDC. 


20:50.143 --> 20:53.105
You know, these brothers 
and sisters have left their families, 


20:53.105 --> 20:55.107
their houses, their friends behind 


20:55.107 --> 20:56.984
to work with these projects. 


20:56.983 --> 21:00.153
All these sacrifices are done out of love


21:00.153 --> 21:03.365
—love for our brotherhood 
and especially love for Jehovah. 


21:03.365 --> 21:07.662
That’s the reason 
that I really, really appreciate their work.


21:07.662 --> 21:09.039
Thank you, Brother Maganha. 


21:09.038 --> 21:12.166
Obviously, those brothers 
and sisters that work with LDC 


21:12.167 --> 21:14.377
set a good example for the rest of us. 


21:14.377 --> 21:15.587
Thank you very much.


21:15.587 --> 21:17.000
My pleasure.


21:21.675 --> 21:23.177
Now, Brother Komaromi, 


21:23.177 --> 21:26.264
it’s time for you to give us 
a sample of your musical talent. 


21:26.263 --> 21:29.000
Would you go and join our band?


21:33.478 --> 21:37.316
Recently, the Governing Body 
has given us loving encouragement 


21:37.317 --> 21:41.445
through our regional convention program 
to never give up. 


21:41.445 --> 21:44.448
Now, the Gilead students have written a song 


21:44.448 --> 21:48.576
that goes right along with that spirit 
and that theme. 


21:48.577 --> 21:53.000
It’s entitled “We’ll Never Let Go.”


24:43.377 --> 24:46.255
I thought that was a thrilling song.


24:46.255 --> 24:49.258
You brothers and sisters
did a marvelous job on that.


24:49.258 --> 24:51.260
And you know what I liked about the song too


24:51.260 --> 24:53.720
is that it gets progressively more modern


24:53.720 --> 24:56.307
as you go through the song.


24:56.307 --> 24:58.809
So it really says to me that our organization 


24:58.808 --> 25:00.811
in its modern-day history, 


25:00.812 --> 25:03.314
even in early times, has never given up,


25:03.313 --> 25:05.691
and we will never give up. 


25:05.692 --> 25:07.694
And it’s so joyful. 


25:07.693 --> 25:10.236
It says that we’re going to endure with joy. 


25:10.237 --> 25:11.739
No one can take that away from us. 


25:11.738 --> 25:15.450
It’s Jehovah’s gift through his holy spirit.


25:15.450 --> 25:18.453
Now it’s time to introduce our final guest, 


25:18.453 --> 25:23.000
and that is Sister Angela Khang 
from the United States.


25:32.342 --> 25:36.139
Angela, you are one 
of the single sisters in our class,


25:36.138 --> 25:39.308
but where in the United States 
do you serve?


25:39.308 --> 25:42.143
I’m at the remote translation office (RTO) 
in Sacramento, California, 


25:42.143 --> 25:44.980
and they translate
into the Hmong language there.


25:44.980 --> 25:47.983
Now, I have to confess
—the Hmong language—


25:47.983 --> 25:50.610
I never knew until very recently 


25:50.610 --> 25:53.780
that there was such a language 
as the Hmong language. 


25:53.780 --> 25:56.992
And I didn’t realize 
there was a Hmong people. 


25:56.992 --> 25:58.369
Why is that?


25:58.368 --> 26:02.121
Well, for a long time, the Hmong story 
was kept a secret from the American public.


26:02.122 --> 26:04.959
Now this is another one of our mysteries 


26:04.958 --> 26:07.711
because why would it be 


26:07.712 --> 26:13.259
that someone would try to keep 
the existence of a whole culture secret?


26:13.258 --> 26:16.636
Well, during the Vietnam War, 
which was a very unpopular conflict, 


26:16.637 --> 26:20.224
many U.S. citizens 
didn’t want the war to expand. 


26:20.223 --> 26:22.810
So the U.S. government 
actually went to Southeast Asia, 


26:22.810 --> 26:24.812
and they secretly recruited the Hmong men 


26:24.812 --> 26:26.855
who were living in the hill tribes of Laos 


26:26.855 --> 26:29.317
to fight Communism in that part of the world. 


26:29.317 --> 26:32.277
In the end, about 40,000 Hmong men 
were killed in that war, 


26:32.277 --> 26:34.697
and so that’s about 1 in 4 Hmong men. 


26:34.697 --> 26:36.699
So every family lost someone.


26:36.698 --> 26:38.700
Forty thousand men. 


26:38.700 --> 26:42.162
I don’t think that people 
really are aware of that fact, are they?


26:42.162 --> 26:46.000
No. Many historians 
call that conflict the Secret War.


26:46.000 --> 26:49.462
Looking at our monitor here, 
what is it we are seeing here?


26:49.462 --> 26:51.714
This was an exhibit 
showcasing the Hmong experience


26:51.713 --> 26:53.715
—how they came to the U.S. 


26:53.715 --> 26:56.802
And it’s a wall of unknown soldiers 
who fought in the war, 


26:56.802 --> 26:59.764
and they were asking the Hmong community
to identify their loved ones.


26:59.763 --> 27:02.600
So a few in our congregation 
knew some of those men.


27:02.600 --> 27:04.017
I see. 


27:04.017 --> 27:06.479
Now, 
as I think back to the history of that war, 


27:06.478 --> 27:09.856
at some point in time, 
the United States pulled out of Vietnam. 


27:09.857 --> 27:11.859
So, what happened then 


27:11.858 --> 27:16.155
to the Hmong that were left there 
in Vietnam when the U.S. pulled out?


27:16.155 --> 27:20.658
It was a desperate situation 
because there was an aggressive campaign 


27:20.658 --> 27:23.036
to capture and kill 
any of the remaining Hmong families, 


27:23.037 --> 27:26.457
and so many of them 
had to find a way to escape. 


27:26.457 --> 27:28.459
And so we see that here in this photo. 


27:28.458 --> 27:32.461
This is Long Tieng Air Base in 1975. 


27:32.462 --> 27:34.840
About 30,000 Hmong people 
converged on that airport, 


27:34.840 --> 27:36.842
hoping to find a way out. 


27:36.842 --> 27:40.095
But only about 2,500 were airlifted
—the more prominent officials.


27:40.095 --> 27:41.180
I see.


27:41.180 --> 27:42.807
You can see 
that those thousands of people there 


27:42.807 --> 27:44.809
are not going 
to fit on that airplane. 


27:44.808 --> 27:47.561
So all those thousands that were left behind,


27:47.562 --> 27:49.564
what happened to them?


27:49.563 --> 27:51.565
They were pretty much left on their own, 


27:51.565 --> 27:55.027
and they had to find their way out 
along with thousands of other families. 


27:55.027 --> 27:56.779
And so that’s what happened to my family. 


27:56.778 --> 27:59.656
They found their way 
across the Mekong River into Thailand, 


27:59.657 --> 28:01.659
and they were placed in refugee camps.


28:01.658 --> 28:02.366
I see. 


28:02.367 --> 28:04.662
So who are we seeing 
a picture of here now on the monitor?


28:04.662 --> 28:08.207
This is my father 
in a Thailand refugee camp 


28:08.207 --> 28:11.000
and my mother,
my grandmother, and my uncle.


28:12.460 --> 28:16.923
So your family managed to survive 
by fleeing into Thailand 


28:16.923 --> 28:18.925
and getting into the refugee camp. 


28:18.925 --> 28:22.303
But then how did they get 
to the United States?


28:22.303 --> 28:25.306
In 1979, 
they were sponsored to the United States. 


28:25.307 --> 28:29.354
And the Hmong culture is patriarchal, 
so you stick close with your clan. 


28:29.353 --> 28:34.233
And so my entire clan ended up in California, 
and they settled in South Sacramento.


28:34.233 --> 28:39.111
I can imagine that this experience 
must have been a tremendous amount of loss 


28:39.112 --> 28:42.240
for the Hmong people, Hmong families.


28:42.240 --> 28:44.452
My father lost his mother 
when they were fleeing; 


28:44.452 --> 28:45.869
he lost his brother. 


28:45.868 --> 28:47.871
He saw many people lose their lives. 


28:47.872 --> 28:49.415
Many clans were separated. 


28:49.415 --> 28:51.417
Some of their relatives ended up in France, 


28:51.417 --> 28:53.877
and the rest of them 
ended up in the United States. 


28:53.877 --> 28:57.505
And then when they settled here, 
my mom lost her hearing. 


28:57.505 --> 28:59.550
So it was just an added stress 
in their lives.


28:59.550 --> 29:03.678
So how did all this suffering and loss, 
how did it affect your mother?


29:03.678 --> 29:05.680
Even though her background is animist, 


29:05.680 --> 29:09.058
she knew that the Bible was a holy book 
that would teach her about the Creator. 


29:09.058 --> 29:11.520
So she found comfort in reading the Bible. 


29:11.520 --> 29:15.023
And she started to collect 
different Bibles from different translations 


29:15.023 --> 29:17.818
and comparing them to try 
to understand what she was reading. 


29:17.818 --> 29:20.695
And every night she would pray 
with me and my sister. 


29:20.695 --> 29:23.657
And so from a young age, 
we were taught that God is real, 


29:23.657 --> 29:25.000
even though we didn’t know Jehovah yet.


29:26.243 --> 29:28.703
Wow, very, very interesting. 


29:28.703 --> 29:31.790
So she was 
really, really looking for the truth. 


29:31.790 --> 29:34.877
So how did she eventually find the truth?


29:34.877 --> 29:38.047
Well, in the meantime, 
my uncle (the one who was pictured earlier) 


29:38.047 --> 29:41.009
and his wife started studying the Bible, 
and they came into the truth. 


29:41.008 --> 29:43.760
And they asked a sister 
to come and study with my mom, 


29:43.760 --> 29:46.138
and soon my entire family was studying. 


29:46.138 --> 29:48.181
In 1996, my mom was baptized. 


29:48.182 --> 29:51.310
In 1997, my sister and I were baptized.


29:51.310 --> 29:55.355
Amazing! So, now, 
you were baptized at the age of 12, 


29:55.355 --> 29:58.608
and then you 
started pioneering at the age of 15.


29:58.608 --> 29:59.610
Yes.


29:59.610 --> 30:01.778
Now, first of all, 
you were in an English congregation. 


30:01.778 --> 30:04.071
But what changed that?


30:04.072 --> 30:07.952
Our circuit overseer came through, 
and he was telling us about a Hmong group 


30:07.952 --> 30:10.079
that had formed in our sister congregation. 


30:10.078 --> 30:12.496
And he told us we had 
no reason to be in English, 


30:12.497 --> 30:14.875
and he was right. 


30:14.875 --> 30:17.127
So as a family, 
we moved over to the Hmong group, 


30:17.127 --> 30:20.880
and in 1999, that group 
became the very first Hmong congregation. 


30:20.880 --> 30:22.632
So that made us very happy.


30:22.632 --> 30:25.969
So you were associated 
with the very first Hmong congregation 


30:25.968 --> 30:26.970
anywhere in the world.


30:26.970 --> 30:27.637
Yes.


30:27.637 --> 30:29.515
Amazing! 


30:29.515 --> 30:32.810
Now, later you toured Bethel, 
and that had a profound effect on you. 


30:32.810 --> 30:34.185
Can you tell us about that?


30:34.185 --> 30:37.898
Well, we came to Bethel,
and a brother in Translation Services


30:37.898 --> 30:40.900
found out we were coming through,
so he wanted to meet with us.


30:40.900 --> 30:43.278
And he sat us girls down,
and he told us,


30:43.278 --> 30:47.031
“You have something you can give to Jehovah, 
and that’s your language.” 


30:47.032 --> 30:49.034
So it really got me thinking 


30:49.033 --> 30:52.245
about what I could do 
to really support the field. 


30:52.245 --> 30:55.123
So I went home,
and I really worked on my language 


30:55.123 --> 30:56.666
and worked on supporting the group. 


30:56.667 --> 30:59.252
And in 2007 


30:59.252 --> 31:01.255
when Bethel came looking for translators, 


31:01.255 --> 31:04.090
this same brother came out 
and he interviewed a group of us. 


31:04.090 --> 31:07.177
And shortly after that,
my mom and another brother and I


31:07.177 --> 31:10.930
were invited to serve 
on the Hmong translation team 


31:10.930 --> 31:13.100
at the first RTO 
here in the U.S. branch.


31:13.100 --> 31:14.142
My goodness! 


31:14.142 --> 31:17.939
So the first Hmong congregation 
anywhere in the world 


31:17.938 --> 31:21.316
and the first RTO for the U.S. branch. 


31:21.317 --> 31:25.320
Jehovah certainly has blessed you 
with some wonderful privileges. 


31:25.320 --> 31:26.780
Could you just tell us, 


31:26.780 --> 31:30.492
What’s it like working 
at the RTO from day to day?


31:30.492 --> 31:31.910
Sure. 
Would you like to see a video?


31:31.910 --> 31:33.000
Yes, we would.


31:36.373 --> 31:41.128
At the Hmong RTO, 
many hands help in the translation work.


31:41.128 --> 31:44.923
When questions come up, 
we’re not left on our own. 


31:44.923 --> 31:49.000
The Translation Services Department 
is always ready to provide support.


31:52.263 --> 31:55.000
Once everything is approved, 
it’s time to record. 


31:56.143 --> 31:59.480
Since Hmong wasn’t a written language 
until the 1950’s, 


31:59.480 --> 32:03.650
audio publications are very important 
to the Hmong field.


32:03.650 --> 32:07.070
Some support the RTO 
in other valuable ways too, 


32:07.070 --> 32:10.198
such as cooking and cleaning.


32:10.198 --> 32:14.118
It’s the best feeling 
to talk to the Hmong people 


32:14.118 --> 32:16.455
and to show them 
something in their language. 


32:16.455 --> 32:20.000
You can see how it touches their heart.


32:21.710 --> 32:25.000
As a result, we have many interested ones 
attend our meetings.


32:28.758 --> 32:31.051
As the Hmong field continues to grow, 


32:31.052 --> 32:36.000
many are learning our language 
to help support the preaching work.


32:37.642 --> 32:40.979
When we get together,
we have a great time


32:40.978 --> 32:42.940
—with good food, 


32:42.940 --> 32:46.777
association,
watching the kids play.


32:46.777 --> 32:50.030
It’s obvious to everyone in the community 


32:50.030 --> 32:52.198
that we’re not just a congregation


32:52.198 --> 32:55.000
—we’re a family.


33:05.628 --> 33:08.881
That is a wonderful video, really. 


33:08.882 --> 33:10.884
Angela, could you just tell us, 


33:10.883 --> 33:13.386
Why does the work done at the RTO 


33:13.387 --> 33:16.932
fill such a great need 
among the Hmong people?


33:16.932 --> 33:20.019
Well, the Hmong are a people
without a country, and throughout history,


33:20.018 --> 33:22.311
they’ve been pushed
from one location to another.


33:22.312 --> 33:25.149
They were pushed out of China
in the late 1800’s, 


33:25.148 --> 33:26.566
they were pushed out of Laos,


33:26.567 --> 33:29.485
and from there 
they were scattered across the world


33:29.485 --> 33:30.862
—to the U.S., 


33:30.862 --> 33:32.865
to France, to Australia. 


33:32.865 --> 33:34.867
And so for many of the Hmong brothers, 


33:34.867 --> 33:37.827
they feel like a forgotten people. 


33:37.827 --> 33:41.000
Excuse me, 
I watched this video for the first time here.


33:42.748 --> 33:44.751
It’s the first time she’s seen the video.


33:44.752 --> 33:46.169
It’s the first time.


33:46.168 --> 33:48.171
So it’s, it’s moving.


33:48.172 --> 33:51.800
So many of the Hmong brothers 
feel like a forgotten people. 


33:51.800 --> 33:56.388
But the work at the RTO is a reminder
that Jehovah hasn’t forgotten them.


33:56.388 --> 33:58.390
In fact, he invites them


33:58.390 --> 34:01.893
to become part of an international clan
—a brotherhood.


34:01.893 --> 34:04.103
And when they respond to that invitation,


34:04.103 --> 34:07.023
they find something
that they’ve been looking for all along.


34:07.023 --> 34:09.025
They finally find a place


34:09.025 --> 34:11.320
—a permanent home—
under God’s Kingdom.


34:11.320 --> 34:13.322
Thank you for those heartfelt comments. 


34:13.322 --> 34:16.157
Really, those were very nice.


34:16.157 --> 34:18.952
Now, Sister Khang,
we have a little surprise for you.


34:18.952 --> 34:23.290
We really want the audience to know that, 


34:23.290 --> 34:25.292
well, the work done at the Hmong RTO 


34:25.292 --> 34:27.627
is not just for the United States, 


34:27.627 --> 34:30.922
but the effect
reaches clear around the world


34:30.922 --> 34:31.965
In fact, 


34:31.965 --> 34:35.260
we have caught up 
with a congregation in northern Thailand. 


34:35.260 --> 34:39.013
And I know this is a surprise;
we did not rehearse this.


34:39.013 --> 34:41.266
No, we did not.


34:41.267 --> 34:43.269
But we’re going to show you, if you’d like.


34:43.268 --> 34:44.143
Yes.


34:44.143 --> 34:46.000
Watch this.


35:18.053 --> 35:20.096
Well, obviously,
they are grateful for the work


35:20.097 --> 35:23.434
you brothers and sisters do in that RTO.


35:23.433 --> 35:26.268
Wasn’t this a thrilling occasion?


35:26.268 --> 35:31.231
It was wonderful, enjoyable,
to get to know these brothers and sisters.


35:31.232 --> 35:36.237
We wish that Jehovah continues
to bless you in your faithful service to him


35:36.237 --> 35:40.000
until the next time we get together 
on The Inside Story.


35:50.335 --> 35:55.048
Thank you very much, Brother Stovall,
for sharing with us The Inside Story.


35:55.048 --> 35:59.051
We appreciate very much
your letting us in on it.


35:59.052 --> 36:02.180
But I have to admit
that this is the first Gilead graduation


36:02.180 --> 36:07.000
I’ve ever been to where
I couldn’t help but pat my foot back there.


36:08.728 --> 36:25.058
I’m just so glad I was behind the curtain.

WEBVTT

00:01.785 --> 00:04.420
Well, now we have something exciting. 


00:04.420 --> 00:07.890
We’re pleased to feature a new part 


00:07.890 --> 00:10.260
on our Gilead program this year. 


00:10.260 --> 00:14.000
Now, they’ve made me promise 
not to say another word. 


00:15.332 --> 00:18.000
So let’s enjoy this new feature together.


00:20.303 --> 00:22.105
Thanks for coming. 


00:22.105 --> 00:22.938
Follow me. 


00:22.938 --> 00:24.940
I need to talk to Ken 
about something really important. 


00:24.940 --> 00:26.000
Come on!


00:27.210 --> 00:28.412
Come in!


00:28.412 --> 00:32.515
Ken, I have some interesting news 
I need to share with you.


00:32.515 --> 00:33.550
It’s exciting!


00:33.550 --> 00:36.152
I could tell by the look 
on your face something is up.


00:36.152 --> 00:38.455
It is. 
It’s about the Gilead graduation program.


00:38.455 --> 00:39.755
Oh, no! 
Not a change!


00:39.755 --> 00:42.958
Yeah, a change.
But it’s so intriguing; it’s positive. 


00:42.958 --> 00:46.461
You know, the student experiences part 
that we’ve had for many years? 


00:46.462 --> 00:47.964
They share their field service experiences.


00:47.963 --> 00:48.865
I love that part.


00:48.865 --> 00:52.035
And I do too, but the Teaching Committee 
wants to broaden it out. 


00:52.035 --> 00:55.238
Look, Ken, the students 
are from all over the world, 


00:55.238 --> 00:56.638
coming from various branches.


00:56.638 --> 00:57.473
Yeah, that’s true.


00:57.473 --> 00:58.908
They have experiences they can share, 


00:58.908 --> 01:01.010
perhaps from their own branch 


01:01.010 --> 01:03.413
or maybe something 
about the Kingdom work 


01:03.413 --> 01:05.148
that is taking place 
in that country. 


01:05.148 --> 01:07.816
It’s going to be exciting, 
different, interesting.


01:07.817 --> 01:09.985
I like it, but I’m wondering. . .


01:09.985 --> 01:11.320
It’s just broadening it out.


01:11.320 --> 01:14.490
But I’m wondering, you know, 
everybody is used to that experiences format. 


01:14.490 --> 01:15.625
Mhm, I know.


01:15.625 --> 01:17.660
What’s the format 
of this new segment going to be?


01:17.660 --> 01:18.928
You’re going to love it—a talk show!


01:18.928 --> 01:20.296
A talk show?


01:20.297 --> 01:20.997
A talk show.


01:20.997 --> 01:22.932
It means, though, 
you’re going to have to build a set.


01:22.932 --> 01:24.567
You’re going to have to have lighting.


01:24.567 --> 01:25.735
What about if they can sing 


01:25.735 --> 01:28.103
or there’s musical instruments 
that they can play? 


01:28.103 --> 01:31.340
We’ll need a little spot for them 
to actually perform a song.


01:31.340 --> 01:33.510
I’m thinking, though, 
if it’s going to be a show, 


01:33.510 --> 01:35.778
it’s got to have a name.


01:35.778 --> 01:37.313
What are you thinking? 
Make it unique.


01:37.313 --> 01:40.350
OK. 
“The Inside Story.”


01:40.350 --> 01:43.520
Ken, it resonates.


01:43.520 --> 01:45.122
Because you’re getting it
—you’re getting “the inside story.”


01:45.122 --> 01:46.522
I love it! 
“The Inside Story.” 


01:46.522 --> 01:47.457
Let’s go with that.


01:47.457 --> 01:48.492
OK. 


01:48.492 --> 01:51.527
But, Mark, we are weeks away 
from Gilead graduation.


01:51.527 --> 01:53.797
I know, we’ll have to work hard 
to pull this off.


01:53.797 --> 01:55.865
Do you think we can get 
this done in time?


01:55.865 --> 01:58.000
Let’s see.


02:25.495 --> 02:28.865
Friends, you are in for a real treat! 


02:28.865 --> 02:31.033
I’m here with the whole class of Gilead, 


02:31.033 --> 02:33.001
and they’ve gotten together 
to get better acquainted 


02:33.002 --> 02:34.504
with some of their classmates, 


02:34.503 --> 02:37.540
and we have been invited to this occasion. 


02:37.540 --> 02:41.277
You are going to meet 
some lovable brothers and sisters, 


02:41.277 --> 02:43.680
and you are going to hear some exciting, 


02:43.680 --> 02:46.782
faith-strengthening experiences. 


02:46.782 --> 02:49.419
You’re also going to hear 
some delightful music 


02:49.418 --> 02:50.686
because some in this class 


02:50.687 --> 02:53.189
have musical talent. 


02:53.188 --> 02:55.758
So, come with me, 
and we’re going to get 


02:55.758 --> 02:57.000
“the inside story.” 


02:59.762 --> 03:03.232
Our first guest is Sister Evelyn Huber 


03:03.232 --> 03:05.735
who is a single sister in this class, 


03:05.735 --> 03:08.170
and she’s serving in Paraguay. 


03:08.170 --> 03:12.000
Evelyn, thank you so much for coming.


03:13.442 --> 03:16.914
You were living in a neighborhood like this 


03:16.913 --> 03:20.683
in Munich, a culturally rich city. 


03:20.683 --> 03:24.686
You lived in an apartment like this


03:24.687 --> 03:27.724
—very sleek, modern, nice. 


03:27.723 --> 03:31.928
You had a good-paying job 
and you were pioneering. 


03:31.928 --> 03:35.196
How did you end up 
clear around the world in Paraguay?


03:35.197 --> 03:38.969
Yes, that was actually quite a change for me. 


03:38.968 --> 03:41.870
So there was this German Kingdom Ministry 


03:41.870 --> 03:43.873
back then in 2005 


03:43.873 --> 03:45.808
that mentioned 


03:45.808 --> 03:48.878
a large German-speaking community 
in Paraguay, 


03:48.878 --> 03:52.415
and a great need 
for German-speaking publishers 


03:52.415 --> 03:54.417
there in South America. 


03:54.417 --> 03:57.754
And that call—that announcement—
really touched my heart. 


03:57.753 --> 04:00.956
I wanted to go there; 
I wanted to serve there. 


04:00.957 --> 04:02.959
So I wrote my letter to the branch. 


04:02.958 --> 04:04.493
They invited me over, 


04:04.493 --> 04:07.330
and a few months later, 
I arrived in Paraguay. 


04:07.330 --> 04:10.032
And they sent me together 
with seven others 


04:10.032 --> 04:12.369
to Santa Rosa del Aguaray, 


04:12.368 --> 04:17.073
and there we started 
a German activity from zero.


04:17.073 --> 04:20.410
Now, when you got there, though, 
you got a little bit of a surprise.


04:20.410 --> 04:24.047
So we arrived in the first colony, 
and I talked to a man. 


04:24.047 --> 04:26.482
And after my nice introduction, 


04:26.482 --> 04:29.785
he just looked at me 
with big eyes and he said,


04:29.785 --> 04:31.653
“Ekj kaun die nijch vestohne.” 


04:31.653 --> 04:34.156
So, “Sorry, I can’t understand you.” 


04:34.157 --> 04:36.859
And I looked at him and I said, 


04:36.858 --> 04:39.095
“I can’t understand you either.” 


04:39.095 --> 04:43.598
That was the moment 
when I realized these people


04:43.598 --> 04:46.801
—the Mennonites—
they don’t speak our German. 


04:46.802 --> 04:50.440
They have their own language, 
the so-called Low German.


04:50.440 --> 04:52.175
How do you learn Low German?


04:52.175 --> 04:53.575
There are no books that exist 


04:53.575 --> 04:55.878
for learning the language
—Low German. 


04:55.878 --> 05:00.248
And we didn’t have Internet 
at that time in our area in Paraguay. 


05:00.248 --> 05:03.820
So we really didn’t know how 
to learn the language. 


05:03.820 --> 05:05.422
We prayed to Jehovah and we said, 


05:05.422 --> 05:07.890
“Jehovah, we really want
to preach to these people.” 


05:07.890 --> 05:10.493
And an 80-year-old Mennonite man 


05:10.493 --> 05:12.495
was the answer to our prayer. 


05:12.495 --> 05:15.297
That’s him; that’s Willie. 


05:15.297 --> 05:18.000
He really wanted to study the Bible. 


05:18.000 --> 05:20.002
So we taught him the Bible, 


05:20.002 --> 05:22.472
and he taught us the language
—Low German. 


05:22.472 --> 05:24.940
And he was an excellent Bible student 


05:24.940 --> 05:27.677
and also a fantastic language teacher.


05:27.677 --> 05:30.045
Well, isn’t that amazing? 


05:30.045 --> 05:31.380
Now, I do understand, though, 


05:31.380 --> 05:34.283
that you learned a trick that helped you 


05:34.283 --> 05:37.386
to be better understood 
by those Low German speakers.


05:37.387 --> 05:40.255
We found out 
that when we spoke our German 


05:40.255 --> 05:42.392
like Americans, 
with an American accent. . .


05:42.392 --> 05:44.860
Now, with an American accent. 


05:44.860 --> 05:46.462
What do you mean by that?


05:46.462 --> 05:48.364
I’ll give you an example: “Good morning.” 


05:48.363 --> 05:50.298
In German, we would say, “Guten Morgen,” 


05:50.298 --> 05:53.035
and Americans would say, 
“Guten Morgen” with the “rrr” sound.


05:53.035 --> 05:55.638
Oh, OK. 
I get it.


05:55.638 --> 05:57.506
And they said: “Please talk to us like that. 


05:57.507 --> 05:59.709
It is so much better to understand you.” 


05:59.708 --> 06:04.680
So for quite a while, 
we kept on going like that.


06:04.680 --> 06:08.000
So the American accent r-r-really helped you. 


06:10.185 --> 06:12.188
Finally, you came to a realization 


06:12.188 --> 06:15.123
that you were beginning 
to get fluent in the language. 


06:15.123 --> 06:16.525
How did that happen?


06:16.525 --> 06:20.430
We went out again in the ministry, 
and a very furious lady


06:20.430 --> 06:23.065
—Mennonite lady—
came out of her house. 


06:23.065 --> 06:26.702
And while she was yelling at us, 
I realized, ‘Wow! 


06:26.702 --> 06:30.474
I understand every single word 
that she’s saying to me!’ 


06:30.473 --> 06:34.676
So I looked at my pioneer partner, 
Tanya, and she looked so happy too. 


06:34.677 --> 06:38.047
And the lady thought 
we couldn’t understand her.


06:38.047 --> 06:39.582
Because you’re smiling at her. 


06:39.582 --> 06:42.085
So she repeated the whole thing again. 


06:42.085 --> 06:43.853
And that was our confirmation. 


06:43.853 --> 06:44.520
Wow! 


06:44.520 --> 06:48.157
We really understood her, 
and we really understood Low German. 


06:48.157 --> 06:51.727
So with a big smile 
and very happy, we left her farm.


06:51.727 --> 06:54.000
I see. 
I’m sure she was really confused. 


06:55.665 --> 06:58.033
Evelyn, could you 
just kind of explain to us, 


06:58.033 --> 07:00.603
What are some 
of the challenges you face 


07:00.603 --> 07:03.438
as a single sister in your territory 
there in Paraguay?


07:03.438 --> 07:06.000
Let’s go to Paraguay!


07:07.008 --> 07:10.513
Would you join me 
in traveling to a Mennonite colony? 


07:10.513 --> 07:13.000
Let’s go!


07:35.805 --> 07:39.742
The trip takes us approximately three hours. 


07:39.742 --> 07:44.647
Now we enter the real Paraguayan roads
—bright red sand—


07:44.647 --> 07:47.584
sometimes dry and dusty 


07:47.583 --> 07:51.220
and sometimes just muddy and dirty. 


07:51.220 --> 07:53.155
There we are traveling, 


07:53.155 --> 07:57.627
having time to enjoy 
Jehovah’s wonderful creation 


07:57.627 --> 08:01.000
and to think about the people 
we are going to visit today.


08:07.403 --> 08:09.771
Do you know what we especially love? 


08:09.772 --> 08:11.907
When we enter a colony 


08:11.907 --> 08:14.044
and the following happens: 


08:14.043 --> 08:17.546
Children come running out of their homes 


08:17.547 --> 08:20.315
asking for new Caleb 
and Sophia videos. 


08:20.315 --> 08:23.218
Kids just love the videos, 


08:23.218 --> 08:27.000
and we are so happy 
to have them now also in Low German.


08:28.523 --> 08:32.661
Ah, now you see 
what Mennonite homes look like. 


08:32.662 --> 08:36.699
They have nice houses, lovely gardens. 


08:36.698 --> 08:39.000
They all have their own farm. 


08:41.603 --> 08:46.000
It’s really a pleasure when you get 
to study with the Mennonites. 


08:48.878 --> 08:51.213
It’s so encouraging 
when one of your studies 


08:51.213 --> 08:54.000
progresses enough 
to come to the meetings; 


08:55.985 --> 08:59.000
it takes great courage for them.


09:02.492 --> 09:05.929
And you really have 
to meet my congregation, 


09:05.928 --> 09:07.963
Santa Rosa Low German


09:07.963 --> 09:10.000
—full of zealous pioneers and publishers.


09:18.873 --> 09:20.876
Ah, look at them! 


09:20.877 --> 09:23.579
Here are my beloved brothers and sisters. 


09:23.578 --> 09:25.748
So good to see them all again. 


09:25.748 --> 09:28.000
They all send us their love.


09:32.888 --> 09:34.523
That was a very touching video. 


09:34.523 --> 09:36.658
It seems like such an exciting life.


09:36.658 --> 09:40.328
I realized how much Jehovah 
can do with single sisters


09:40.328 --> 09:41.863
—how he uses them. 


09:41.863 --> 09:43.331
And in my congregation, 


09:43.332 --> 09:46.402
there are actually 
more than 50 percent of single sisters.


09:46.402 --> 09:48.000
I see. 


09:50.472 --> 09:53.909
There’s a long heritage, 
actually, for sisters going to Gilead, 


09:53.908 --> 09:55.343
serving in foreign assignments. 


09:55.343 --> 09:58.246
Jehovah really loves single sisters. 


09:58.247 --> 09:59.382
They are precious to him.


09:59.382 --> 10:01.150
Well, that’s certainly the truth. 


10:01.150 --> 10:05.353
And we are very proud of you 
and all the single sisters 


10:05.353 --> 10:08.958
and very appreciative 
of the huge contribution that you’ve made 


10:08.958 --> 10:12.961
to the worldwide work 
and the Kingdom efforts. 


10:12.962 --> 10:16.265
It’s amazing, 
and we know Jehovah loves you. 


10:16.265 --> 10:18.300
It’s been such a pleasure 
getting to know you, Evelyn. 


10:18.300 --> 10:21.103
Thank you so much for sharing 
your experiences with us.


10:21.103 --> 10:24.000
That was my pleasure. 
Thank you.


10:25.975 --> 10:28.143
Now, Evelyn, 
I have one more question for you. 


10:28.143 --> 10:30.145
Were you surprised to find out 


10:30.145 --> 10:32.180
that there was 
so much musical talent in your class?


10:32.180 --> 10:34.750
Whoa! 
I definitely was, uh-hu.


10:34.750 --> 10:37.887
Well, now it’s time to get 
a sample of that musical talent. 


10:37.887 --> 10:39.722
We have a band! 


10:39.722 --> 10:44.194
They’re going to perform an original song 
composed by one of your classmates. 


10:44.193 --> 10:48.030
And the song is entitled 
“Pronto Será Realidad.” 


10:48.030 --> 10:51.167
In English that means 
“soon it will be a reality.” 


10:51.167 --> 10:55.000
Let’s listen to “Pronto Será Realidad.”


14:10.565 --> 14:14.000
That was a great song
—very touching.


14:15.203 --> 14:18.206
Our next guest is actually 
one of the band members. 


14:18.207 --> 14:22.000
Let’s welcome Brother Joel Hurley. 


14:27.550 --> 14:31.387
So, Joel, you’re serving 
at the branch in Australia now. 


14:31.387 --> 14:34.424
But you have a rich heritage in the truth 


14:34.423 --> 14:37.391
given to you by your grandparents, parents. 


14:37.392 --> 14:39.862
Could you just explain 
a little bit about that to us?


14:39.862 --> 14:43.632
My grandfather actually learned the truth 
from a fellow band member. 


14:43.632 --> 14:46.069
He was so impressed 
with the use of God’s name 


14:46.068 --> 14:48.836
and that God’s name 
was Jehovah that he made sure 


14:48.837 --> 14:51.440
that he taught the truth 
to many family members. 


14:51.440 --> 14:54.310
But sometime later in 1960, 


14:54.310 --> 14:58.280
they decided as a family to move 
to serve where the need was greater, 


14:58.280 --> 15:01.183
so they moved to the Pacific islands in Fiji. 


15:01.183 --> 15:03.385
So my dad grew up in Fiji.


15:03.385 --> 15:05.620
I see. 
I think we have a picture, yeah.


15:05.620 --> 15:08.723
There’s my dad next to the car; 


15:08.723 --> 15:12.728
they’re witnessing 
to the village chief and his family


15:12.728 --> 15:15.830
—so memories of them 
growing up in Fiji. 


15:15.830 --> 15:16.998
Later on, he married my mum 


15:16.998 --> 15:19.335
and they continued 
to serve there for some time. 


15:19.335 --> 15:22.470
They really did have 
a big impact on my early years


15:22.470 --> 15:24.507
—preaching in the villages; 


15:24.507 --> 15:26.642
organizing special conventions; 


15:26.642 --> 15:29.512
events, such as 
the Around-the-World convention.


15:29.512 --> 15:31.580
We see Brother Franz. 


15:31.580 --> 15:35.683
So now, as a young person, 
then, you decided to learn Japanese. 


15:35.683 --> 15:37.151
Why did you do that?


15:37.152 --> 15:39.187
Well, in the early 80’s, 


15:39.187 --> 15:41.457
there was a Japanese group attached 


15:41.457 --> 15:43.592
to the Kingdom Hall where we attended, 


15:43.592 --> 15:45.894
so there was a need at the time 
in that group. 


15:45.893 --> 15:49.030
In fact, many from Japan came to help out. 


15:49.030 --> 15:51.000
They encouraged me to learn Japanese, 


15:51.000 --> 15:52.935
so I began to learn the language.


15:52.935 --> 15:55.370
So you’ve been speaking 
Japanese now for how long?


15:55.370 --> 15:56.905
Thirty-odd years.


15:56.905 --> 15:58.073
My goodness! 


15:58.073 --> 15:59.875
Now, you went to MTS. 


15:59.875 --> 16:02.443
And after MTS graduation, 


16:02.443 --> 16:04.480
tell us about some of your assignments.


16:04.480 --> 16:07.650
The first assignment 
was with the Japanese group, 


16:07.650 --> 16:10.818
and shortly after, 
it became a congregation. 


16:10.818 --> 16:13.788
A whole range of different backgrounds 
came into the truth: 


16:13.788 --> 16:16.425
CEOs in Japanese companies, 


16:16.425 --> 16:19.127
young ones for the first time 
who learned the truth, 


16:19.127 --> 16:21.264
and even a Buddhist monk learned the truth 


16:21.263 --> 16:24.298
and became a zealous pioneer 
in the congregation.


16:24.298 --> 16:25.300
What was your next assignment?


16:25.300 --> 16:26.935
It was the other side of the country


16:26.935 --> 16:28.770
—to western Australia—
to a country assignment.


16:28.770 --> 16:30.805
Western Australia, 
now, is that the outback? 


16:30.805 --> 16:32.473
We’ve all heard about the outback.


16:32.473 --> 16:35.310
Well, parts of it 
are called the Golden Outback, 


16:35.310 --> 16:37.545
but there’s a lot of bushland. 


16:37.545 --> 16:39.982
There’s a large farming community
—wheat, sheep.


16:39.982 --> 16:42.150
You have a picture here 
of some of the things.


16:42.150 --> 16:44.152
In fact, there’s a variety of people 


16:44.152 --> 16:46.155
that we were able to speak to 
in that territory.


16:46.155 --> 16:49.592
You say, “a variety of people.” 


16:49.592 --> 16:52.829
I don’t see too many people in that picture. 


16:52.828 --> 16:54.830
Where did this variety come from?


16:54.830 --> 16:57.700
Well, there were townships, 
there were the farmers, 


16:57.700 --> 17:00.235
there were “bushies”
—ones who live off the land— 


17:00.235 --> 17:03.005
Australian aborigines, and tourists.


17:03.005 --> 17:04.673
Tourists? 


17:04.673 --> 17:08.043
So way out there 
in rural Australia there are tourists? 


17:08.043 --> 17:09.411
What is there to see?


17:09.412 --> 17:13.000
They’d come to visit the famous icons 
in the area, for example, “Wave Rock.” 


17:14.917 --> 17:18.587
This is a natural rock formation 
in the shape of a breaking wave. 


17:18.587 --> 17:20.955
In fact, one time 
there was this Japanese man 


17:20.955 --> 17:25.793
who cycled across Australia 
and was camping not far from the rock. 


17:25.793 --> 17:28.130
I was able to speak to him 
and use my Japanese. 


17:28.130 --> 17:29.465
He was interested. 


17:29.465 --> 17:31.967
The next day, he traveled 
100 or so kilometers (60 miles) 


17:31.967 --> 17:33.469
to where I was living. 


17:33.468 --> 17:35.503
I followed up the interest 
and then was able 


17:35.503 --> 17:38.106
to pass it on to Japan 
for further follow-up.


17:38.107 --> 17:41.410
Was there a congregation 
out there in the rural areas?


17:41.410 --> 17:43.512
It was a small family-like congregation. 


17:43.512 --> 17:44.680
We stuck together.


17:44.680 --> 17:45.480
I see. 


17:45.480 --> 17:47.783
So how far would they 
have to drive sometimes?


17:47.783 --> 17:50.585
Over 100 kilometers (60 miles) 
in many instances, 


17:50.585 --> 17:53.455
on gravel roads—roads whereby 


17:53.455 --> 17:56.325
a mob of kangaroos 
could actually come out. 


17:56.325 --> 17:57.325
So quite challenging.


17:57.325 --> 17:59.928
Sorry, Joel, 
one second, a mob of kangaroos. 


17:59.928 --> 18:00.728
What’s that?


18:00.728 --> 18:03.065
I was wondering the same thing. 
What do you mean a mob?


18:03.065 --> 18:05.900
For example, coming home from a Bible study 


18:05.900 --> 18:07.870
at dusk one night on a dirt road, 


18:07.870 --> 18:10.205
suddenly I find 
this mob of kangaroos


18:10.205 --> 18:12.775
—10, 15 kangaroos around the car. 


18:12.775 --> 18:15.410
So you just have to be careful in those areas 


18:15.410 --> 18:17.612
to make sure you take caution at all times.


18:17.612 --> 18:19.615
That’s quite a picture
—you know, mental picture—


18:19.615 --> 18:21.650
all of these kangaroos 
bouncing around the car. 


18:21.650 --> 18:23.385
After that rural assignment, 


18:23.385 --> 18:26.087
you had some assignments 
to some bigger cities 


18:26.087 --> 18:28.724
and then you did 
some substitute circuit work 


18:28.723 --> 18:31.193
and then you were reassigned 
to Bethel. 


18:31.193 --> 18:34.630
So at Bethel, you are back 
in the Japanese congregation. 


18:34.630 --> 18:39.000
So, Joel, tell us, 
what is it like being at Bethel 


18:39.000 --> 18:40.935
serving in a Japanese congregation?


18:40.935 --> 18:42.503
Well, would you like 
to have a look at a video 


18:42.503 --> 18:44.271
which explains 
what our territory is like?


18:44.272 --> 18:45.000
Of course we would.


18:50.412 --> 18:53.315
We only have one 
Japanese language congregation in Sydney, 


18:53.315 --> 18:56.285
so our territory is vast. 


18:56.285 --> 18:59.453
We typically spend long days in the ministry. 


18:59.453 --> 19:03.391
Some of us will leave early in the morning 
to catch the ferry 


19:03.392 --> 19:06.995
and go to a popular tourist place 
called Circular Quay. 


19:06.995 --> 19:09.665
There are many Japanese tourists here. 


19:09.665 --> 19:12.400
We’ll often find a group 
of Japanese tourists 


19:12.400 --> 19:14.035
setting up to take a photo. 


19:14.035 --> 19:16.137
We might approach them and say: 


19:16.137 --> 19:17.907
“Shyashin wo torimasho ka?” 


19:17.907 --> 19:19.542
“Can I take a photo for you?” 


19:19.542 --> 19:22.000
A good conversation then begins.


19:23.845 --> 19:27.883
The many young Japanese pioneers 
still in school 


19:27.883 --> 19:30.000
may join up with us 
later in the afternoon. 


19:31.887 --> 19:36.057
The interested person may hear 
the message for the first time 


19:36.057 --> 19:39.000
and attend the meeting that night.


19:43.732 --> 19:46.269
We often enjoy refreshing association 


19:46.268 --> 19:48.303
with each other in the congregation, 


19:48.303 --> 19:51.306
particularly after a long day 
in the ministry. 


19:51.307 --> 19:55.810
Recently, we just had 
our first pioneer school in Japanese. 


19:55.810 --> 19:58.880
They were so grateful 
that they didn’t have to travel 


19:58.880 --> 20:01.000
back to Japan to attend the school.


20:02.683 --> 20:07.788
There’s really no separation 
between ministry and life. 


20:07.788 --> 20:10.858
It is life—the best life.


20:10.858 --> 20:14.000
Kon’ichiwa!


20:17.798 --> 20:19.433
Thank you for sharing that video. 


20:19.433 --> 20:22.000
It seems like you have 
a very nice assignment there. 


20:23.138 --> 20:26.073
Now, looking back over your life, 
Joel, would you have chosen


20:26.073 --> 20:28.743
—now looking back—
to do anything else?


20:28.743 --> 20:31.011
At times there have been challenges, 


20:31.012 --> 20:35.117
whether that be loneliness or isolation 


20:35.117 --> 20:38.054
because of language or the environment. 


20:38.053 --> 20:39.888
But it’s really given me an opportunity 


20:39.888 --> 20:41.723
to rely on Jehovah God at that time


20:41.723 --> 20:43.691
—to learn endurance. 


20:43.692 --> 20:47.529
He’s provided family, 
friends wherever I’ve gone. 


20:47.528 --> 20:50.265
And to be able to sense Jehovah’s pleasure 


20:50.265 --> 20:52.600
and Jehovah’s support at these times 


20:52.600 --> 20:54.637
is something that I’m really grateful for.


20:54.637 --> 20:57.239
Joel, this has been very pleasurable


20:57.238 --> 20:59.240
—talking to you—
and very encouraging. 


20:59.240 --> 21:01.000
Thank you for sharing 
your experiences with us.


21:05.047 --> 21:08.000
Now, Joel, it’s time 
for you to go back to the piano.


21:09.985 --> 21:12.653
Our band is going to play 
another song for us. 


21:12.653 --> 21:15.756
And like the first one, 
this is an original composition 


21:15.757 --> 21:17.000
written by one of your classmates. 


21:18.493 --> 21:22.130
This song is entitled 
“The Promised Land.” 


21:22.130 --> 21:25.000
Let’s listen.


24:35.157 --> 24:36.525
What a beautiful song! 


24:36.525 --> 24:39.360
What wonderful sentiments 
were expressed there. 


24:39.360 --> 24:41.362
Well, we’ve been to Paraguay; 


24:41.362 --> 24:43.365
we’ve been to Australia; 


24:43.365 --> 24:46.000
now it’s time to go to Russia. 


24:47.002 --> 24:52.000
Our final guest is Brother Moses Ajiboye, 
who’s serving in the Russia branch.


24:57.478 --> 24:59.446
Back in 1988, 


24:59.447 --> 25:04.019
you were a man in your late teens 
pioneering in Britain, 


25:04.018 --> 25:07.355
but somehow you ended up in Soviet Russia 


25:07.355 --> 25:10.058
pioneering in a country under ban. 


25:10.058 --> 25:12.160
How did that happen, Moses?


25:12.160 --> 25:16.497
My pioneer partner and myself, 
we were out in the ministry 


25:16.497 --> 25:21.502
and met a man who happened 
to be a diplomat from Russia, 


25:21.502 --> 25:24.605
and he was interested, 
and we would go back to him 


25:24.605 --> 25:26.942
and make return visits regularly. 


25:26.942 --> 25:29.244
And after a few weeks, 


25:29.243 --> 25:33.715
he asked us 
if we want to go to Moscow. 


25:33.715 --> 25:35.750
He offered us, actually, 


25:35.750 --> 25:38.887
a free language scholarship 
for three months.


25:38.887 --> 25:40.955
That was back in 1988. 


25:40.955 --> 25:42.357
What happened in the meantime?


25:42.357 --> 25:45.460
Following the three months, 
during the language course, 


25:45.460 --> 25:48.630
the professor—one of the professors 
who was teaching the language—


25:48.630 --> 25:52.000
helped to upgrade my language scholarship 


25:52.000 --> 25:53.902
into a medical scholarship.


25:53.902 --> 25:54.937
A medical scholarship?


25:54.937 --> 25:56.004
Like a medical student.


25:56.003 --> 25:59.740
My goodness, so now you’re going 
to medical school 


25:59.740 --> 26:01.743
and you’re pioneering.


26:01.743 --> 26:03.000
That’s right, absolutely.


26:09.483 --> 26:13.888
But, even so, you really didn’t plan 
to finish the medical degree. 


26:13.888 --> 26:15.123
But what happened?


26:15.123 --> 26:17.691
I thought that the ban 
would be lifted pretty soon 


26:17.692 --> 26:21.362
and that I would be serving 
as a pioneer 


26:21.362 --> 26:24.565
in a territory where the need is great. 


26:24.565 --> 26:28.303
But, you see, the lifting 
of the ban took several years.


26:28.303 --> 26:30.271
And so you kept going to medical school?


26:30.272 --> 26:31.039
That’s right.


26:31.038 --> 26:33.475
Nineteen ninety-one, March 27, 


26:33.475 --> 26:35.343
could you just explain to us about that?


26:35.343 --> 26:36.945
The ban was lifted; we are registered. 


26:36.945 --> 26:39.013
It means that we have freedom of religion, 


26:39.013 --> 26:42.083
so we cannot stay 
in those private homes anymore.


26:42.083 --> 26:43.150
I think we have a picture, yeah.


26:43.150 --> 26:45.687
And so, yeah, 
this is the first place we actually got. 


26:45.687 --> 26:47.855
It was a movie theater 


26:47.855 --> 26:50.825
in one part of Moscow that we rented, 


26:50.825 --> 26:54.428
and we read 
the first letter that we got 


26:54.428 --> 26:57.298
from the organization 
about the lifting of the ban. 


26:57.298 --> 27:00.901
The brother who read it, 
it took him about 20 minutes 


27:00.902 --> 27:04.472
to read a one-and-a-half page letter.


27:04.472 --> 27:05.740
Why did it take so long?


27:05.740 --> 27:07.875
Wow, you can imagine. 


27:07.875 --> 27:10.045
Many years they were under ban, 


27:10.045 --> 27:11.345
and now the ban is lifted. 


27:11.345 --> 27:13.715
The friends cannot believe it, 
even the brother himself. 


27:13.715 --> 27:16.885
There was a lot of crying and cries of joy. 


27:16.885 --> 27:18.720
And, oh, it was a touching moment. 


27:18.720 --> 27:20.622
I’ll never forget that.


27:20.622 --> 27:23.024
How did you care 
for all the new ones coming in?


27:23.023 --> 27:27.395
By 1992, we already had 
four large congregations in Moscow.


27:27.395 --> 27:29.263
When you say large, 
how many are we talking about?


27:29.263 --> 27:32.200
Well, up to 800 publishers in each of them. 


27:32.200 --> 27:33.902
If we had enough elders, 


27:33.902 --> 27:35.837
those congregations would have split 


27:35.837 --> 27:37.572
into three, four, or even five.


27:37.572 --> 27:39.474
We used to have, for example, book studies. 


27:39.473 --> 27:41.041
You only had a few elders. 


27:41.042 --> 27:42.677
How did you have 
enough book study conductors?


27:42.677 --> 27:46.047
We figured out that any male member 
of the congregation 


27:46.047 --> 27:49.250
who gets baptized will get a book study. 


27:49.250 --> 27:51.518
We’re happy that they 
made themselves available. 


27:51.518 --> 27:53.253
They were very zealous.


27:53.253 --> 27:55.890
But some of the material we discussed 
in the book study was pretty deep.


27:55.890 --> 27:56.357
Yes.


27:56.357 --> 27:57.792
How did they manage to teach it correctly?


27:57.792 --> 28:00.362
We would put 
all these newly baptized brothers 


28:00.362 --> 28:03.799
who conducted book studies 
together on a Sunday evening 


28:03.798 --> 28:06.633
and have three to four-hour sessions 
with them. 


28:06.633 --> 28:10.071
Yes, there are some of them.


28:10.072 --> 28:13.274
These brothers are 
newly baptized book study conductors. 


28:13.273 --> 28:14.941
Now, this was just one of the groups. 


28:14.942 --> 28:16.410
There were several groups like this.


28:16.410 --> 28:17.245
Many.


28:17.245 --> 28:18.112
My goodness. 


28:18.112 --> 28:20.449
How did you manage, even on the weekend, 


28:20.448 --> 28:22.783
to have enough speakers 
for public talks and things?


28:22.783 --> 28:24.351
Absolutely. 


28:24.352 --> 28:28.222
And in Moscow at that time, 
there were only a few elders; 


28:28.222 --> 28:30.225
so we were all grouped together, 


28:30.225 --> 28:32.993
basically, into one body of elders; 


28:32.993 --> 28:35.163
and each one of us were 


28:35.163 --> 28:38.231
on a rotating list of giving public talks. 


28:38.232 --> 28:41.535
So some brothers on the weekends
—Saturdays and Sundays—


28:41.535 --> 28:43.070
we had many meetings. 


28:43.070 --> 28:45.207
They would go and give two to three talks. 


28:45.207 --> 28:48.444
Myself, because I was single, 


28:48.443 --> 28:51.813
very often gave four to five talks 
every weekend.


28:51.813 --> 28:53.046
Oh, my goodness. 


28:53.047 --> 28:55.049
Amazing! 


28:55.048 --> 28:59.353
Now, let’s take a look 
at this next picture we have here. 


28:59.353 --> 29:01.355
So here we see Brother Jaracz. 


29:01.355 --> 29:03.357
This is shortly after the ban. 


29:03.357 --> 29:05.594
And can you tell us one of the things 
he’s explaining to you here?


29:05.593 --> 29:08.730
We were all in the audience, 
and he told us of the importance 


29:08.730 --> 29:11.132
to go through the baptismal questions 


29:11.132 --> 29:14.769
with each one individually. 


29:14.768 --> 29:17.538
And then as we sat 
in the audience, most of us said, 


29:17.538 --> 29:19.740
“Oh, how on earth are we going to do that?” 


29:19.740 --> 29:21.777
Because before that
—you know, Brother Stovall—


29:21.777 --> 29:24.712
we would put 30, 40 people together 


29:24.712 --> 29:26.849
and just go through 
the questions with them 


29:26.848 --> 29:28.883
because the influx was so big; 


29:28.883 --> 29:31.551
we basically 
could not handle them individually. 


29:31.552 --> 29:34.255
But Brother Jaracz 
proved the point by telling us 


29:34.255 --> 29:39.193
that the Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry 
book is for that purpose,


29:39.193 --> 29:43.030
because we want 
a spiritually strong organization, 


29:43.030 --> 29:45.433
not just the statistics. 


29:45.433 --> 29:48.670
We obeyed, but it was not easy 
in the beginning.


29:48.670 --> 29:50.438
So how did you do it? 


29:50.438 --> 29:53.406
I mean, how long did it take 
to go through these questions 


29:53.407 --> 29:54.575
with these baptismal candidates?


29:54.575 --> 29:57.245
Well, it took many hours 
for many elders to do that. 


29:57.245 --> 30:00.715
Myself, because I was single 
and young back then, 


30:00.715 --> 30:04.285
I remember occasions 
where I would sit at 8:00 a.m. 


30:04.285 --> 30:07.188
with the first candidate
—baptismal candidate—


30:07.188 --> 30:09.490
and end up at 12:00 midnight. 


30:09.490 --> 30:11.325
And they would take their turns;  


30:11.325 --> 30:14.628
after work, they would come; 
they were not going to miss their turn. 


30:14.628 --> 30:18.600
That was how zealous 
the harvest was and the brothers were.


30:18.600 --> 30:20.033
So let me get this straight. 


30:20.033 --> 30:21.768
So you’re pioneering; 


30:21.768 --> 30:23.638
you’re going to medical school; 


30:23.638 --> 30:26.206
you’re giving five talks on the weekend; 


30:26.207 --> 30:30.144
you’re spending three hours in sessions 
with book study conductors; 


30:30.143 --> 30:33.681
you’re spending from eight to midnight 
with baptismal candidates. 


30:33.682 --> 30:34.915
How did you do it?


30:34.915 --> 30:36.000
Holy spirit. 


30:37.152 --> 30:38.787
And we were young. 


30:38.787 --> 30:40.855
When we’re young, 
we think we can move mountains, 


30:40.855 --> 30:44.000
but the holy spirit was actually obvious.


30:45.058 --> 30:47.461
The branch, then, has asked you 


30:47.462 --> 30:50.465
to come to the branch from the field. 


30:50.465 --> 30:54.402
And probably you were happy 
because that would have been relief, 


30:54.402 --> 30:56.404
I think, from this schedule.


30:56.403 --> 30:58.371
You know, to be honest Brother Stovall, 


30:58.372 --> 31:00.309
it was the opposite. 


31:00.308 --> 31:02.343
It was the harvesttime. 


31:02.343 --> 31:04.911
And, you know, to experience 


31:04.912 --> 31:07.549
the joy of what Jesus said 
about the harvest


31:07.548 --> 31:11.451
—that ‘the harvest is great 
and the workers are joyous.’ 


31:11.452 --> 31:13.655
Many things were happening. 


31:13.655 --> 31:14.855
People were coming in. 


31:14.855 --> 31:17.058
We were studying the Bible 
with hundreds of people.


31:17.058 --> 31:20.528
You say you’ve actually been involved 


31:20.528 --> 31:23.330
with helping hundreds of people 
into the truth?


31:23.330 --> 31:26.767
Yes, directly or indirectly sitting 
and studying the Bible. 


31:26.767 --> 31:29.570
And so, I didn’t hurry to go down there. 


31:29.570 --> 31:32.807
Conventions were going on, 
all these meetings.


31:32.807 --> 31:34.842
But they tracked you down.


31:34.842 --> 31:37.412
Oh, yes, they did. 


31:37.412 --> 31:40.315
And I was obedient 
when they tracked me down 


31:40.315 --> 31:44.000
and later on apologized 
for my behavior.


31:45.987 --> 31:48.322
So, what did you do 
when you went to the branch?


31:48.322 --> 31:50.592
The branch actually wanted me to set up 


31:50.592 --> 31:53.194
the Hospital Information Desk work.


31:53.193 --> 31:55.263
Amazing! So that medical training 


31:55.263 --> 31:58.231
really has been very valuable. 


31:58.232 --> 32:00.635
So, what is it like, then, 


32:00.635 --> 32:04.738
working with the HID in Russia?


32:04.738 --> 32:06.340
How about if we look at a video? 


32:06.340 --> 32:08.877
It would be easier to just give you the gist 


32:08.877 --> 32:12.414
of what happens 
and how that work is going on in Russia.


32:12.413 --> 32:14.000
That would be great.


32:15.883 --> 32:19.820
One of our sisters was told 
that she needed a blood transfusion. 


32:19.820 --> 32:21.822
But the doctor said, 


32:21.822 --> 32:23.424
“They should forget about their religion


32:23.423 --> 32:26.360
because I am like God to them.” 


32:26.360 --> 32:29.330
Incidentally, I caught a cockroach 


32:29.330 --> 32:32.000
crawling on the floor of his office. 


32:33.635 --> 32:35.637
Then I smashed the cockroach, 


32:35.637 --> 32:39.000
and I told him: 
“That cockroach is dead. 


32:40.475 --> 32:43.110
“Now if you can bring it back to life, 


32:43.110 --> 32:47.115
then I believe you are a god.” 


32:47.115 --> 32:50.000
Well, he could say nothing at all.


32:51.052 --> 32:54.155
Righteous indignation gave me the courage 


32:54.155 --> 32:57.425
to go and clear our case 
with the director of the hospital. 


32:57.425 --> 33:02.697
There’s no doubt Jehovah 
really was helping us. 


33:02.697 --> 33:05.734
That director became one 
of our strongest advocates 


33:05.733 --> 33:07.535
in bloodless surgeries. 


33:07.535 --> 33:10.405
Later, he would even speak in our behalf 


33:10.405 --> 33:13.000
to many doctors and conferences.


33:14.208 --> 33:16.643
Look at this beautiful little girl. 


33:16.643 --> 33:19.746
She was born with a blood condition. 


33:19.747 --> 33:23.484
It was a real fight not to give her blood. 


33:23.483 --> 33:27.321
Her case went 
all the way to the European Court, 


33:27.322 --> 33:29.324
and we won the case. 


33:29.323 --> 33:33.928
There she is now, healthy and happy. 


33:33.928 --> 33:37.431
Experiences like these
in the HLC work


33:37.432 --> 33:40.000
have really touched my heart.


33:44.038 --> 33:48.000
Moses, thank you so much 
for those very encouraging experiences.


33:51.045 --> 33:54.682
Wasn’t this just 
an amazingly enjoyable occasion? 


33:54.682 --> 33:57.985
It’s been so thrilling, 
so faith strengthening 


33:57.985 --> 34:01.522
to get to know these brothers 
and sisters who have worked so hard, 


34:01.522 --> 34:04.925
who Jehovah has blessed 
to such a degree. 


34:04.925 --> 34:08.228
Really, we wish and hope 
that Jehovah blesses you 


34:08.228 --> 34:10.698
as you continue 
to work hard in his service 


34:10.698 --> 34:12.933
until the next time we get together 


34:12.933 --> 34:15.000
to get “the inside story.”


34:33.187 --> 34:36.000
Well, what did you think of the new feature?


34:46.467 --> 34:48.937
I’m sure we’ll be seeing 
more of that in the future. 


34:48.937 --> 34:50.605
We can certainly hope.


34:50.605 --> 34:53.273
Well, now it’s time 
for you to participate again. 


34:53.273 --> 34:57.578
If you can, would you please stand,
and we’ll sing song number 110, 


34:57.578 --> 37:24.008
which is entitled 
“The Joy of Jehovah,” song 110.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.948
Wow, Dad, 


00:16.948 --> 00:18.645
you really got a lot better!


00:18.645 --> 00:19.853
Yeah, he has. 


00:19.853 --> 00:21.395
Thankfully!


00:21.395 --> 00:26.562
Well, Jehovah has given me 
8,000 years to practice.


00:26.562 --> 00:28.979
Oh, look! 
They’re here!


00:28.978 --> 00:30.520
Wow!


00:30.520 --> 00:32.000
Whoa!


00:36.728 --> 00:38.398
What about you, Sophia? 


00:38.398 --> 00:41.186
What do you want to do in Paradise?


00:41.187 --> 00:42.687
Oh! 
I know. 


00:42.687 --> 00:45.229
She wants to have her own butterfly garden!


00:45.228 --> 00:48.000
That would be nice.


00:54.978 --> 00:57.103
But there are some people 


00:57.103 --> 01:01.000
I want to meet first.


01:08.145 --> 01:10.145
Aww, Sophia, 


01:10.145 --> 01:12.145
that’s going to be so beautiful. 


01:12.145 --> 01:14.145
What about you, Caleb?


01:14.145 --> 01:17.353
Well, I kind of just want 
to be with all of you.


01:17.353 --> 01:20.895
Aww.


01:20.895 --> 01:24.140
. . . and the monkeys.


01:24.140 --> 01:26.478
Oh, you love monkeys!


01:26.478 --> 01:29.478
It’s good to imagine ourselves in Paradise. 


01:29.478 --> 01:31.561
It helps us to “rejoice in the hope” 


01:31.562 --> 01:34.000
that Jehovah has given us.


01:35.040 --> 01:36.270
Look, Mom, 


01:36.270 --> 01:37.687
I’m rejoicing in the hope! 


01:37.687 --> 01:50.334
Wee!

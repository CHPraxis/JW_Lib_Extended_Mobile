00:05 She thought that she could win,  but there was no way.
00:08 Next year,  I’ll be the fastest kid in the entire school!
00:12 That’s ‘cause I’m not in your school.
00:15 Oh, please!  Remember last time
00:17 when I beat you in front  of the whole congregation?
00:25 Caleb, do you remember this story?
00:29 Oh, yeah,
00:30 that’s the Tower of Babel.
00:32 That’s right!
00:33 Why were these people  trying to build this tower?
00:36 So they could live there?
00:39 Actually,
00:40 it was because they thought  they were awesome
00:42 and wanted to show off.
00:45 But what did Jehovah think of that?
00:47 Oh, he didn’t like it.
00:49 That’s right.
00:51 He even confused their languages
00:53 so they would stop bragging.
00:55 But at school everyone brags!
00:58 I know.
00:59 Lots of people brag.
01:01 I have bragged too.
01:04 But that’s wrong.
01:06 When we brag or show off,
01:08 it’s like we are building
01:09 a tower for ourselves,
01:11 just like the Tower of Babel.
01:13 If I wanted to,
01:14 I could set a new world record
01:16 —no problem!
01:20 If you say so.
01:21 But I’m better at basketball than you.
01:25 I was just messing around,
01:27 but they say I’m a natural.
01:30 The higher up we try to put ourselves,
01:32 the more dangerous it gets.
01:34 Do you know why?
01:36 Because we’ll eventually fall?
01:39 Whoa, whoa.
01:43 Whoa!
01:44 Ooph!
01:45 Yes!
01:47 Also, 1 Peter 5:5
01:50 means that Jehovah  doesn’t want us acting like
01:52 we are better than everyone else.
01:54 Humble people don’t need to brag,
01:58 because Jehovah will make them
01:59 feel good about themselves
02:00 on the inside.

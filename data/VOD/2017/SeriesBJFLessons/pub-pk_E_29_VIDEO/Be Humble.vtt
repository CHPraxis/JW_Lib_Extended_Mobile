00:05.103 --> 00:08.603
She thought that she could win, 
but there was no way. 


00:08.603 --> 00:12.353
Next year, 
I’ll be the fastest kid in the entire school!


00:12.353 --> 00:15.645
That’s ‘cause I’m not in your school.


00:15.645 --> 00:17.645
Oh, please! 
Remember last time 


00:17.645 --> 00:20.000
when I beat you in front 
of the whole congregation?


00:25.145 --> 00:28.000
Caleb, do you remember this story?


00:29.562 --> 00:30.604
Oh, yeah, 


00:30.603 --> 00:32.270
that’s the Tower of Babel.


00:32.270 --> 00:33.228
That’s right! 


00:33.228 --> 00:36.353
Why were these people 
trying to build this tower?


00:36.353 --> 00:39.270
So they could live there?


00:39.270 --> 00:40.270
Actually, 


00:40.270 --> 00:42.812
it was because they thought 
they were awesome 


00:42.812 --> 00:45.395
and wanted to show off. 


00:45.395 --> 00:47.520
But what did Jehovah think of that?


00:47.520 --> 00:49.853
Oh, he didn’t like it.


00:49.853 --> 00:51.186
That’s right. 


00:51.187 --> 00:53.812
He even confused their languages 


00:53.812 --> 00:55.479
so they would stop bragging.


00:55.478 --> 00:58.145
But at school everyone brags!


00:58.145 --> 00:59.770
I know. 


00:59.770 --> 01:01.145
Lots of people brag. 


01:01.145 --> 01:04.187
I have bragged too. 


01:04.187 --> 01:06.562
But that’s wrong. 


01:06.562 --> 01:08.604
When we brag or show off, 


01:08.603 --> 01:09.895
it’s like we are building 


01:09.895 --> 01:11.395
a tower for ourselves, 


01:11.395 --> 01:13.520
just like the Tower of Babel.


01:13.520 --> 01:14.853
If I wanted to, 


01:14.853 --> 01:16.395
I could set a new world record


01:16.395 --> 01:18.000
—no problem!


01:20.020 --> 01:21.645
If you say so. 


01:21.645 --> 01:24.000
But I’m better at basketball than you.


01:25.520 --> 01:27.562
I was just messing around, 


01:27.562 --> 01:30.104
but they say I’m a natural.


01:30.103 --> 01:32.395
The higher up we try to put ourselves, 


01:32.395 --> 01:34.520
the more dangerous it gets. 


01:34.520 --> 01:36.645
Do you know why?


01:36.645 --> 01:39.145
Because we’ll eventually fall? 


01:39.145 --> 01:42.000
Whoa, whoa. 


01:43.145 --> 01:44.770
Whoa! 


01:44.770 --> 01:45.853
Ooph!


01:45.853 --> 01:47.395
Yes! 


01:47.395 --> 01:50.353
Also, 1 Peter 5:5 


01:50.353 --> 01:52.353
means that Jehovah 
doesn’t want us acting like 


01:52.353 --> 01:54.478
we are better than everyone else. 


01:54.478 --> 01:58.270
Humble people don’t need to brag, 


01:58.270 --> 01:59.437
because Jehovah will make them 


01:59.437 --> 02:00.979
feel good about themselves 


02:00.978 --> 02:08.416
on the inside.

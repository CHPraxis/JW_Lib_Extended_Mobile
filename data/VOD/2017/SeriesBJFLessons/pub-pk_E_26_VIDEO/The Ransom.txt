00:06 Thank you so much  for your visit.
00:10 See you later,  Sister Elsa.
00:19 Mom,
00:21 is Elsa going to die?
00:24 Ah, we don’t know yet.
00:28 Can’t Jehovah just fix her?
00:31 Oh, honey.  Oh.
00:35 He’s already done  something to help her.
00:38 Do you remember  who he sent?
00:41 Jesus?
00:43 But how does  that help her now?
00:48 Hmm,
00:50 do you remember how long
00:52 Adam was supposed to live?
00:54 Forever!
00:56 But then  he didn’t listen to Jehovah
00:58 and ruined everything.
01:00 Since we are  all Adam’s children,
01:03 that means  we also get sick, old,
01:07 and eventually die.
01:09 But what hope  did Jehovah give us?
01:11 He sent Jesus  to give his life
01:14 in place of the one  that Adam lost.
01:16 How could he do that?
01:19 Because he  was perfect like Adam,
01:21 but he obeyed Jehovah!
01:23 Yes!
01:25 Thanks to Jehovah
01:27 for giving us Jesus  as the ransom.
01:28 Now we all have the hope
01:30 of living forever in Paradise!
01:33 And when we are going  through tough times,
01:35 like right now,
01:36 that hope can get us through.
01:50 Elsa?
01:54 Sister Elsa!

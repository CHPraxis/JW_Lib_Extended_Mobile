00:01 Did Jesus explain to his disciples
00:03 how his perfect body came to be?
00:06 Did he take the time to do that?
00:08 We don’t know.
00:10 But what we do know is that how he used
00:13 that perfect body when he was on earth
00:16 has a profound effect  upon our relationship with Jehovah God.
00:20 When we meditate and think about that,
00:22 that’s what we want to focus on  in our discussion this morning.
00:25 But how did that body come about?
00:27 Let’s find out.
00:28 Let’s open our Bibles, please, to Luke chapter 1,
00:32 Luke chapter 1,  and we’re going to look at verse 31.
00:40 Now, the angel Gabriel,  in speaking to Mary, he says:
00:44 “Look! you will become pregnant
00:47 “and [you will] give birth to a son,
00:49 and you are to name him Jesus.”
00:51 ‘Pregnant, me?  I’m a virgin. How can that happen?’
00:54 Jehovah employed his holy spirit
00:57 in transferring the perfect life force  of his only-begotten Son
01:02 to the womb of Mary,
01:04 thus causing conception.
01:06 Jehovah would cancel out any imperfection
01:09 that would be passed on to the child,
01:12 thereby producing a genetic pattern
01:15 that was perfect from its start.
01:18 Imperfection was not going  to stop Jehovah’s purpose
01:21 from being accomplished.
01:24 He dealt with that;  he handled that.
01:27 Very interesting here, too,  in verse 35:
01:31 “In answer the angel said to her:
01:34 “‘Holy spirit will come upon you,
01:36 and power of the Most High  will overshadow you.’”
01:40 So again,  holy spirit is involved.
01:42 And in some manner,  Jehovah guaranteed that it would be a boy,
01:47 and then he assured that  that developing embryo would be shielded
01:51 from the taint of sin  and protected from any harmful force.
01:55 So there she has this baby boy.
01:59 She was a Jewish mother,  so no doubt Jesus would have had
02:02 some of the physical traits of Mary —his Jewish mother.
02:06 However, we need to remember
02:08 that he was not another personality;
02:11 he was not another person.
02:13 He was the only-begotten Son,
02:15 and he was able to identify himself  as such in due time.
02:20 But now imagine Mary  giving birth to this little baby,
02:25 and she’s holding  this little baby in her arms.
02:28 Now, how many mothers  have said to us when
02:31 that baby is born  and they’re holding that baby,
02:34 and they say:  “Look at my baby. It’s perfect.”
02:37 But Mary was right;  she got it right.
02:40 She was the only one that could say,  “My baby is perfect.”
02:44 She didn’t have to count the toes  and the fingers and so forth.
02:47 She got it.
02:48 But the thought is that
02:51 though she didn’t  fully understand all the details,
02:56 she’s holding this body
02:58 and it’s this body  that for thirty-three and a half years
03:03 is holding the blood  that’s going to be poured out
03:07 in behalf of mankind  as a ransom sacrifice.
03:10 But before that blood  was going to be poured out,
03:13 Jesus was going to use  that body in a very special way.
03:17 He used his fleshly body  to honor Jehovah God.
03:20 So again,  understanding how
03:23 he used that fleshly body  to honor Jehovah
03:26 has a profound effect  upon our relationship with Jehovah.
03:30 Let’s see how.
03:32 Let’s open our Bibles now  to 1 Peter chapter 4.
03:41 First Peter chapter 4,
03:45 we’re going to read verse 1:
03:49 “Since Christ suffered in the flesh  [suffered in the flesh],
03:54 “you too arm yourselves  with the same mental disposition;
03:58 “because the person  who has suffered in the flesh
04:01 has desisted from sins.”
04:03 Let’s think  about this for a moment.
04:05 Christ suffered in the flesh
04:07 —that fleshly body.
04:09 This is directly related  to the issue of sovereignty.
04:13 His blood paid the ransom.
04:17 But why did Christ suffer  in the flesh?
04:20 Because he chose to use his fleshly body  to honor Jehovah;
04:25 he chose to use his fleshly body  to defend Jehovah’s sovereignty;
04:29 he chose to use that fleshly body  to prove that Satan is a liar.
04:34 He suffered in the flesh.
04:36 On Nisan 14, 33 C.E.,
04:39 Jesus allowed himself  to be arrested by a mob;
04:43 he allowed himself  to be subjected to an illegal trial;
04:47 he allowed his back to be torn by rivets  and scourged through a scourging
04:51 and to be nailed —his hands and feet—to a pole.
04:54 He allowed that.
04:56 And this is why he said at John 10:17:
05:00 “This is why the Father loves me.”
05:05 ‘The Father loves me.
05:07 ‘Why?  Because I surrender my life.
05:11 ‘No man takes my life from me.
05:13 I surrender it of my own initiative.’
05:17 Now,  that’s the example he set for us.
05:20 Now,  let’s look at verse 1 again.
05:22 This time we see  that “b” part where it says:
05:26 “Because the person  who has suffered in the flesh.”
05:30 So who is that?  That’s you;
05:32 that’s me;  we’re the person.
05:34 We suffer in the flesh;  we desist from sins.
05:37 Verse 2:
05:39 “So that he [you, me] may live
05:41 “the remainder of his time in the flesh,
05:44 no more for the desires of men,  but for God’s will.”
05:50 The fact that Peter draws attention  to suffering in the flesh for you and me
05:54 —this is what we’re expected to do.
05:57 We’re imitating Jesus Christ  by doing that.
06:01 So here we are  in this very special week of activity.
06:03 We think deeply  upon the ransom sacrifice;
06:06 we think deeply  about how Jesus used his life.
06:10 And we have opportunity to do that.
06:13 For example, some ask,
06:15 ‘Why do we pass  the emblems on Memorial night?’
06:19 They say, ‘If in a large congregation  there are so many there,
06:22 ‘wouldn’t it be more practical
06:23 ‘if the servers just stood  at the end of the aisle?
06:26 ‘And if someone wanted  to partake of the emblems,
06:29 ‘they would just nod  or give a sign to the server
06:31 ‘and he would give them  to that person.
06:33 Look at the time we would save.’
06:35 But that’s not the pattern  in the Scriptures;
06:38 that’s not what Jesus did;
06:40 that’s not the procedure  that was instituted.
06:42 We’re following the Biblical pattern.
06:45 But in addition to that
06:47 —in the actual passing of the emblems—
06:50 what does that do?
06:51 That deepens our appreciation
06:54 as we see the bread passed;
06:56 as we see the wine passed.
06:58 We are able to understand  the sacred things
07:00 that are discussed  even more so that evening.
07:04 And we’re able to get involved.
07:06 Our feelings get involved.
07:08 That event burns into our memory.
07:12 So this Friday  as those emblems are being passed
07:15 —as the bread is being passed—
07:18 now you might say,  ‘But I’ve been to so many Memorials.’
07:20 And some in our family have been  to decades worth of Memorials.
07:26 But how about this Friday  we do something different?
07:29 We just—as that bread passes— we just think;
07:32 we just take a moment to reflect
07:35 on what that bread represents.
07:38 And we ask ourselves:
07:41 ‘Can I think of one way
07:44 ‘that I can use  my body, my mind,
07:48 ‘my energy
07:50 ‘to better worship Jehovah God?
07:53 ‘Is there one way  that I can do better?
07:56 ‘To what extent  am I slaving for others
08:00 ‘as Jesus Christ did?
08:02 ‘Like Jesus Christ,
08:05 ‘to what extent  am I pummeling my body
08:07 ‘and leading it as a slave
08:10 ‘even if it takes drastic measures
08:13 ‘—at times with self-control—
08:15 ‘to make sure  that I am giving an answer
08:19 to the one who is taunting  my heavenly Father?’
08:23 When we examine  the life of Jesus Christ,
08:26 it’s as if he said to the Devil,
08:28 it’s as if he declared:
08:31 ‘You want to attack my Father?
08:33 ‘You go through me.
08:35 ‘You’re going to go through me
08:37 ‘because I am Michael  (“Who is like God?”).
08:40 ‘No one attacks my God.
08:43 ‘I am the chief defender  of His sovereignty.
08:46 ‘I am the champion of my God.
08:49 ‘I am the chief vindicator of Him.
08:52 That’s who I am.’
08:54 And we take that same stance —that same posture.
08:57 Someone wants to attack  our heavenly Father?
09:00 ‘You want to attack  my heavenly Father, Devil?
09:02 ‘You go through me;  you go through me.
09:05 ‘And my integrity,  my obedience,
09:08 ‘my faithful course,  you know what it will do?
09:10 ‘It will embarrass you;
09:12 ‘it’s going to push you back;  it’s going to humiliate you;
09:15 ‘it’s going to disgrace you  because I am using my body
09:18 as Jesus Christ did  to honor my heavenly Father.’

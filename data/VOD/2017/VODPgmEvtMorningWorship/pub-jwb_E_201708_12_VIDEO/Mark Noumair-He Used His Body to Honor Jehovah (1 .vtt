00:01.217 --> 00:03.987
Did Jesus explain to his disciples 


00:03.987 --> 00:06.189
how his perfect body came to be? 


00:06.188 --> 00:08.190
Did he take the time to do that? 


00:08.190 --> 00:10.193
We don’t know. 


00:10.193 --> 00:13.530
But what we do know is that how he used 


00:13.530 --> 00:16.198
that perfect body when he was on earth 


00:16.198 --> 00:20.170
has a profound effect 
upon our relationship with Jehovah God. 


00:20.170 --> 00:22.172
When we meditate and think about that, 


00:22.172 --> 00:25.542
that’s what we want to focus on 
in our discussion this morning. 


00:25.542 --> 00:27.210
But how did that body come about? 


00:27.210 --> 00:28.210
Let’s find out.


00:28.210 --> 00:32.315
Let’s open our Bibles, please,
to Luke chapter 1, 


00:32.315 --> 00:37.000
Luke chapter 1, 
and we’re going to look at verse 31. 


00:40.823 --> 00:44.926
Now, the angel Gabriel, 
in speaking to Mary, he says: 


00:44.927 --> 00:47.130
“Look! you will become pregnant 


00:47.130 --> 00:49.332
“and [you will] give birth to a son, 


00:49.332 --> 00:51.534
and you are to name him Jesus.” 


00:51.533 --> 00:54.470
‘Pregnant, me? 
I’m a virgin. How can that happen?’ 


00:54.470 --> 00:57.640
Jehovah employed his holy spirit 


00:57.640 --> 01:02.378
in transferring the perfect life force 
of his only-begotten Son 


01:02.378 --> 01:04.380
to the womb of Mary, 


01:04.380 --> 01:06.515
thus causing conception. 


01:06.515 --> 01:09.452
Jehovah would cancel out any imperfection 


01:09.452 --> 01:12.422
that would be passed on to the child, 


01:12.422 --> 01:15.492
thereby producing a genetic pattern


01:15.492 --> 01:18.094
that was perfect from its start. 


01:18.093 --> 01:21.730
Imperfection was not going 
to stop Jehovah’s purpose 


01:21.730 --> 01:24.567
from being accomplished. 


01:24.567 --> 01:27.370
He dealt with that; 
he handled that.


01:27.370 --> 01:31.207
Very interesting here, too, 
in verse 35: 


01:31.207 --> 01:34.344
“In answer the angel said to her: 


01:34.343 --> 01:36.946
“‘Holy spirit will come upon you, 


01:36.947 --> 01:40.082
and power of the Most High 
will overshadow you.’” 


01:40.082 --> 01:42.519
So again, 
holy spirit is involved. 


01:42.518 --> 01:47.190
And in some manner, 
Jehovah guaranteed that it would be a boy, 


01:47.190 --> 01:51.393
and then he assured that 
that developing embryo would be shielded 


01:51.393 --> 01:55.898
from the taint of sin 
and protected from any harmful force. 


01:55.898 --> 01:59.135
So there she has this baby boy. 


01:59.135 --> 02:02.538
She was a Jewish mother, 
so no doubt Jesus would have had 


02:02.538 --> 02:06.308
some of the physical traits of Mary
—his Jewish mother. 


02:06.308 --> 02:08.945
However, we need to remember 


02:08.945 --> 02:11.313
that he was not another personality; 


02:11.313 --> 02:13.315
he was not another person. 


02:13.315 --> 02:15.918
He was the only-begotten Son, 


02:15.918 --> 02:20.556
and he was able to identify himself 
as such in due time. 


02:20.557 --> 02:25.562
But now imagine Mary 
giving birth to this little baby, 


02:25.562 --> 02:28.865
and she’s holding 
this little baby in her arms. 


02:28.865 --> 02:31.733
Now, how many mothers 
have said to us when 


02:31.733 --> 02:34.470
that baby is born 
and they’re holding that baby, 


02:34.470 --> 02:37.640
and they say: 
“Look at my baby. It’s perfect.” 


02:37.640 --> 02:40.743
But Mary was right; 
she got it right. 


02:40.743 --> 02:44.380
She was the only one that could say, 
“My baby is perfect.” 


02:44.380 --> 02:47.517
She didn’t have to count the toes 
and the fingers and so forth. 


02:47.517 --> 02:48.952
She got it. 


02:48.952 --> 02:51.520
But the thought is that 


02:51.520 --> 02:56.292
though she didn’t 
fully understand all the details, 


02:56.292 --> 02:58.729
she’s holding this body 


02:58.728 --> 03:03.065
and it’s this body 
that for thirty-three and a half years 


03:03.065 --> 03:07.037
is holding the blood 
that’s going to be poured out 


03:07.037 --> 03:10.307
in behalf of mankind 
as a ransom sacrifice. 


03:10.307 --> 03:13.844
But before that blood 
was going to be poured out, 


03:13.843 --> 03:17.480
Jesus was going to use 
that body in a very special way. 


03:17.480 --> 03:20.817
He used his fleshly body 
to honor Jehovah God. 


03:20.817 --> 03:23.554
So again, 
understanding how


03:23.553 --> 03:26.288
he used that fleshly body 
to honor Jehovah 


03:26.288 --> 03:30.260
has a profound effect 
upon our relationship with Jehovah. 


03:30.260 --> 03:32.062
Let’s see how.


03:32.062 --> 03:38.000
Let’s open our Bibles now 
to 1 Peter chapter 4. 


03:41.837 --> 03:44.000
First Peter chapter 4, 


03:45.942 --> 03:49.512
we’re going to read verse 1:


03:49.512 --> 03:54.517
“Since Christ suffered in the flesh 
[suffered in the flesh], 


03:54.517 --> 03:58.989
“you too arm yourselves 
with the same mental disposition; 


03:58.988 --> 04:01.523
“because the person 
who has suffered in the flesh 


04:01.523 --> 04:03.358
has desisted from sins.”


04:03.358 --> 04:05.361
Let’s think 
about this for a moment. 


04:05.362 --> 04:07.864
Christ suffered in the flesh


04:07.863 --> 04:09.898
—that fleshly body. 


04:09.898 --> 04:13.803
This is directly related 
to the issue of sovereignty. 


04:13.803 --> 04:17.040
His blood paid the ransom. 


04:17.040 --> 04:20.410
But why did Christ suffer 
in the flesh? 


04:20.410 --> 04:25.282
Because he chose to use his fleshly body 
to honor Jehovah; 


04:25.282 --> 04:29.752
he chose to use his fleshly body 
to defend Jehovah’s sovereignty; 


04:29.752 --> 04:34.290
he chose to use that fleshly body 
to prove that Satan is a liar. 


04:34.290 --> 04:36.392
He suffered in the flesh. 


04:36.392 --> 04:39.095
On Nisan 14, 33 C.E., 


04:39.095 --> 04:43.032
Jesus allowed himself 
to be arrested by a mob; 


04:43.032 --> 04:47.037
he allowed himself 
to be subjected to an illegal trial; 


04:47.037 --> 04:51.374
he allowed his back to be torn by rivets 
and scourged through a scourging 


04:51.373 --> 04:54.943
and to be nailed
—his hands and feet—to a pole. 


04:54.943 --> 04:56.945
He allowed that. 


04:56.945 --> 05:00.850
And this is why he said at John 10:17: 


05:00.850 --> 05:05.020
“This is why the Father loves me.” 


05:05.020 --> 05:07.757
‘The Father loves me. 


05:07.757 --> 05:11.060
‘Why? 
Because I surrender my life. 


05:11.060 --> 05:13.328
‘No man takes my life from me. 


05:13.328 --> 05:17.433
I surrender it of my own initiative.’ 


05:17.433 --> 05:20.235
Now, 
that’s the example he set for us.


05:20.235 --> 05:22.238
Now, 
let’s look at verse 1 again. 


05:22.238 --> 05:26.975
This time we see 
that “b” part where it says: 


05:26.975 --> 05:30.413
“Because the person 
who has suffered in the flesh.” 


05:30.413 --> 05:32.281
So who is that? 
That’s you; 


05:32.282 --> 05:34.350
that’s me; 
we’re the person. 


05:34.350 --> 05:37.253
We suffer in the flesh; 
we desist from sins. 


05:37.253 --> 05:39.155
Verse 2: 


05:39.155 --> 05:41.923
“So that he [you, me] may live 


05:41.923 --> 05:44.960
“the remainder of his time in the flesh, 


05:44.960 --> 05:48.000
no more for the desires of men, 
but for God’s will.” 


05:50.733 --> 05:54.903
The fact that Peter draws attention 
to suffering in the flesh for you and me


05:54.903 --> 05:57.873
—this is what we’re expected to do. 


05:57.873 --> 06:01.110
We’re imitating Jesus Christ 
by doing that.


06:01.110 --> 06:03.980
So here we are 
in this very special week of activity. 


06:03.980 --> 06:06.948
We think deeply 
upon the ransom sacrifice; 


06:06.948 --> 06:10.653
we think deeply 
about how Jesus used his life. 


06:10.653 --> 06:13.121
And we have opportunity to do that. 


06:13.122 --> 06:15.859
For example, some ask, 


06:15.858 --> 06:19.461
‘Why do we pass 
the emblems on Memorial night?’ 


06:19.462 --> 06:22.099
They say, ‘If in a large congregation 
there are so many there, 


06:22.098 --> 06:23.800
‘wouldn’t it be more practical 


06:23.800 --> 06:26.802
‘if the servers just stood 
at the end of the aisle? 


06:26.802 --> 06:29.105
‘And if someone wanted 
to partake of the emblems, 


06:29.105 --> 06:31.340
‘they would just nod 
or give a sign to the server 


06:31.340 --> 06:33.375
‘and he would give them 
to that person. 


06:33.375 --> 06:35.377
Look at the time we would save.’ 


06:35.377 --> 06:38.447
But that’s not the pattern 
in the Scriptures; 


06:38.447 --> 06:40.450
that’s not what Jesus did; 


06:40.450 --> 06:42.685
that’s not the procedure 
that was instituted. 


06:42.685 --> 06:45.320
We’re following the Biblical pattern.


06:45.320 --> 06:47.523
But in addition to that


06:47.523 --> 06:50.025
—in the actual passing of the emblems—


06:50.025 --> 06:51.927
what does that do? 


06:51.927 --> 06:54.030
That deepens our appreciation 


06:54.030 --> 06:56.365
as we see the bread passed; 


06:56.365 --> 06:58.100
as we see the wine passed. 


06:58.100 --> 07:00.937
We are able to understand 
the sacred things 


07:00.937 --> 07:04.007
that are discussed 
even more so that evening. 


07:04.007 --> 07:06.109
And we’re able to get involved. 


07:06.108 --> 07:08.643
Our feelings get involved. 


07:08.643 --> 07:11.000
That event burns into our memory.


07:12.013 --> 07:15.951
So this Friday 
as those emblems are being passed


07:15.952 --> 07:18.320
—as the bread is being passed—


07:18.320 --> 07:20.623
now you might say, 
‘But I’ve been to so many Memorials.’ 


07:20.623 --> 07:25.000
And some in our family have been 
to decades worth of Memorials. 


07:26.395 --> 07:29.332
But how about this Friday 
we do something different? 


07:29.332 --> 07:32.802
We just—as that bread passes—
we just think; 


07:32.802 --> 07:35.037
we just take a moment to reflect 


07:35.037 --> 07:38.507
on what that bread represents. 


07:38.507 --> 07:41.210
And we ask ourselves: 


07:41.210 --> 07:44.813
‘Can I think of one way 


07:44.813 --> 07:48.183
‘that I can use 
my body, my mind, 


07:48.183 --> 07:50.185
‘my energy 


07:50.185 --> 07:53.155
‘to better worship Jehovah God? 


07:53.155 --> 07:56.458
‘Is there one way 
that I can do better? 


07:56.458 --> 08:00.361
‘To what extent 
am I slaving for others 


08:00.362 --> 08:02.699
‘as Jesus Christ did? 


08:02.698 --> 08:05.033
‘Like Jesus Christ, 


08:05.033 --> 08:07.970
‘to what extent 
am I pummeling my body 


08:07.970 --> 08:10.205
‘and leading it as a slave 


08:10.205 --> 08:13.342
‘even if it takes drastic measures


08:13.342 --> 08:15.377
‘—at times with self-control—


08:15.377 --> 08:19.049
‘to make sure 
that I am giving an answer 


08:19.048 --> 08:23.518
to the one who is taunting 
my heavenly Father?’


08:23.518 --> 08:26.488
When we examine 
the life of Jesus Christ, 


08:26.488 --> 08:28.958
it’s as if he said to the Devil, 


08:28.958 --> 08:31.293
it’s as if he declared: 


08:31.293 --> 08:33.295
‘You want to attack my Father? 


08:33.295 --> 08:35.297
‘You go through me. 


08:35.297 --> 08:37.132
‘You’re going to go through me 


08:37.132 --> 08:40.002
‘because I am Michael 
(“Who is like God?”). 


08:40.002 --> 08:43.514
‘No one attacks my God. 


08:43.513 --> 08:46.941
‘I am the chief defender 
of His sovereignty. 


08:46.942 --> 08:49.612
‘I am the champion of my God. 


08:49.612 --> 08:52.080
‘I am the chief vindicator of Him. 


08:52.080 --> 08:54.083
That’s who I am.’ 


08:54.083 --> 08:57.886
And we take that same stance
—that same posture. 


08:57.887 --> 09:00.389
Someone wants to attack 
our heavenly Father? 


09:00.388 --> 09:02.925
‘You want to attack 
my heavenly Father, Devil? 


09:02.925 --> 09:05.427
‘You go through me; 
you go through me. 


09:05.427 --> 09:08.064
‘And my integrity, 
my obedience, 


09:08.063 --> 09:10.331
‘my faithful course, 
you know what it will do? 


09:10.332 --> 09:12.335
‘It will embarrass you; 


09:12.335 --> 09:15.270
‘it’s going to push you back; 
it’s going to humiliate you; 


09:15.270 --> 09:18.340
‘it’s going to disgrace you 
because I am using my body 


09:18.340 --> 09:28.768
as Jesus Christ did 
to honor my heavenly Father.’

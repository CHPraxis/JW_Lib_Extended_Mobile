00:01 None of us like to contemplate
00:04 being in a serious accident or receiving news
00:08 that we have a very serious illness
00:10 that may even be life threatening.
00:13 When the blood issue also arises,  at such times,
00:18 of course we’re all determined  that we’re going to keep our integrity.
00:23 But we also feel the need  for comfort and for support
00:28 so that we can remain faithful.
00:31 Now, Jehovah never promised  for this period of time
00:35 that we would receive miraculous healing.
00:38 But he did promise that we would receive  something very significant.
00:42 Would you open your Bibles with me?
00:44 Let’s look together at Psalm 41:3.
00:52 It says: “Jehovah will sustain him  on his sickbed;
00:56 during his sickness  you will completely change his bed.”
01:02 Well, now, The Watchtower, back in 2008,  the September 15 issue,
01:06 just made a nice little comment  on this verse.
01:09 It said:  “David did not expect Jehovah
01:11 “to perform  a miracle and remove [his] sickness.
01:15 “Rather, David felt certain  that Jehovah would ‘sustain him’
01:20 “—that is, give him support and strength
01:24 while he was lying on his sickbed.”
01:26 Well, that’s what Jehovah has promised.
01:29 He’s promised that he’s going to provide us  with the support and the strength
01:33 that we need so that we can keep our integrity.
01:37 Well, Hospital Information Services (HIS)  here in Brooklyn,
01:41 the Hospital Information Desks  at each of the branches,
01:44 and the Hospital Liaison Committees (HLC)
01:47 have been very powerful tools  in the hand of Jehovah
01:52 to provide this support and strength
01:55 when the blood issue arises.
01:57 Did you know that now worldwide
02:00 there are some 1,700 —that is 1,700—
02:04 Hospital Liaison Committees  with over 13,000 members?
02:11 This is not easy work.
02:13 The vast majority of these brothers  are not physicians;
02:18 they’re not connected  to the medical community in any way.
02:21 Often, they have to get up  in the middle of the night
02:24 to go to the hospital.
02:26 Sometimes they deal  with very confrontational situations.
02:30 Usually all of the situations  that they deal with are emotionally charged.
02:36 Their work is very seldom seen by others.
02:40 They are not in the spotlight.
02:42 Well, when we reflect on the work  of these wonderful brothers
02:47 who are willing to accomplish this work
02:51 of giving assistance and  support and help to our brothers,
02:55 we can’t help but think of this scripture  in Jeremiah chapter 23,
03:01 where Jehovah says—
03:03 Jeremiah 23:4:
03:07 “‘And I will raise up over them shepherds
03:10 “‘who will really shepherd them.
03:12 “‘They will no longer be afraid  or be terrified,
03:16 and none will be missing,’  declares Jehovah.”
03:20 Well, that’s exactly
03:22 what the Hospital Liaison Committee  brothers do.
03:26 They are wonderful shepherds  who are there to help the brothers
03:30 to have the information  and the assistance they need
03:33 so that they can maintain their integrity.
03:36 I recall one experience when I was working
03:38 with the Hospital Information Desk in Canada.
03:41 A sister in a northern Canadian city,
03:45 she had been very, very seriously injured.
03:47 She had to be airlifted to a larger center
03:52 where she would be able to receive  more intensive care.
03:55 A Hospital Liaison Committee member  was immediately notified;
04:00 he went to the hospital.
04:02 And so, as soon as the aircraft landed
04:04 and the sister was being taken off  and wheeled into the hospital,
04:08 there the brother was waiting in the hallway.
04:11 And so, when he approached her  lying on the stretcher,
04:15 the sister was trembling with fear.
04:18 Well, when he looked down at her,
04:21 she looked up and she said,  “Are you a doctor?”
04:24 And he said,  “No, I’m your brother.”
04:28 Well, immediately the sister
04:32 —this huge sigh of relief  because now there was someone
04:37 who could give her the practical help  that she so much needed.
04:41 Well, what are some of the ways
04:43 that this arrangement  does provide practical support?
04:47 Well, I’m not sure if you know this,
04:49 but at 89 branch offices around the world
04:53 —including the United States and Canada—
04:55 we have brothers who are on call
04:57 24 hours a day, seven days a week
05:00 to answer calls  from Hospital Liaison Committee members
05:04 and also from doctors
05:06 who request assistance
05:08 on how to treat Jehovah’s Witnesses  without the use of blood.
05:11 This is an amazing arrangement.
05:15 When I worked with HIS,
05:17 I recall many times  in the middle of the night,
05:19 we would receive calls  from a brother or a sister
05:22 or from an HLC or from a doctor
05:25 about someone who  was desperately in need of assistance.
05:28 And the organization  had provided such wonderful tools.
05:32 For example,  a database has been assembled
05:37 of literally thousands of medical articles
05:40 from respected medical journals.
05:43 Now these articles can be sent  to a doctor or to a medical team,
05:48 and they explain very specifically
05:51 what can be done to address a situation
05:54 without the use of a blood transfusion.
05:57 Often, when a doctor  receives an article like that
06:00 —he sees it’s from one of his peers,  it’s been published in a respected journal—
06:04 he is much more willing to cooperate.
06:07 And also, he sees  in a practical way what can be done.
06:12 But even better,  each Hospital Information Desk
06:16 maintains a list of consulting doctors.
06:19 Now, these are  very well-respected physicians
06:23 who are not afraid  to confer with other doctors
06:26 and explain to them how  even very complex, very difficult cases
06:31 can be managed without the use of blood.
06:34 I recall one time in the middle of the night,
06:37 we received a call about a sister  who had just given birth,
06:42 and she had lost  a significant amount of blood.
06:45 The doctor managing her case  was very interested in receiving help.
06:50 Well, we called  a very, very well-respected professor
06:55 of obstetrics and gyneocology  in Canada
06:57 who was always willing  to provide assistance.
07:00 Well, I started off the call by saying,
07:03 “I’m so sorry to call you so late at night.”
07:07 Well, the doctor said:  “Please don’t apologize, Mark.
07:11 I’m always happy to do anything  I can to help the sisters.”
07:15 Well, of course,  he was not a Witness himself.
07:19 But he viewed those dear ones  as his own sisters,
07:24 and he was willing to help them.
07:26 Well, such courageous and skilled physicians  all around the world
07:31 have done so much to help our brothers.
07:34 And the tools just keep on improving.
07:38 Many of you may know
07:40 that now we have a section  for medical professionals
07:44 on our jw.org website.
07:46 Now, I’ll reiterate:
07:48 This is not a site or an area  for Jehovah’s people;
07:52 it’s specifically designed  for medical professionals.
07:56 But that area,
07:58 although it’s only recently been established,
08:00 is already having a wonderful effect.
08:03 Let me relate this experience.
08:06 A sister wrote this into the branch.
08:08 She said: “Recently my husband took me  to the emergency room,
08:12 “and we discovered  I had a mass of some sort near my appendix
08:16 “and that a huge  and possibly messy surgery
08:19 “was needed to discover the problem.
08:21 “When I told the surgeon  that was assigned to me
08:23 “that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
08:26 “he became agitated when I reinforced
08:29 “my nonnegotiable stand.
08:31 “He never became rude or harsh,
08:33 “but I could tell that he was very troubled.
08:36 “My husband left  to make a phone call to the brothers.
08:40 “Five minutes later,  a resident came to tell me
08:43 “that the surgeon  had just gone to the jw.org website
08:47 “and was downloading information.
08:50 “We had never mentioned the website.
08:52 “How he knew or who told him,  we’ll never know.
08:55 “But ten minutes later,  he came back with copies of the information.
08:59 “He had read it,  he had marked the pages,
09:03 “and he went over everything  with my husband and me.
09:06 “Then he took my hand, and he smiled.
09:09 “He asked if I was ready,
09:11 “and he promised to do his very best for me.
09:14 “He said he too had made
09:16 “some nonnegotiable decisions  with God in his lifetime.
09:21 “He saw me about 12 hours after the surgery,
09:24 “and I teased him about being a trouble.
09:27 “He said, ‘No, it was extraordinary.’
09:31 “We know he meant what he had just learned
09:34 “about the Hospital Liaison Committee
09:36 and Jehovah’s provision  for information for His people.”
09:40 The sister concluded by saying,
09:43 “I have never felt  such a wave of peace from Jehovah
09:47 in all my years in the truth.”
09:49 Well, Jehovah did not promise us
09:53 miraculous healing at this time,
09:55 but he did promise  that he would provide us
09:58 with support and strength  when we are sick.
10:02 What a beautiful gift Jehovah  has given his people
10:06 through the fine work  of the Hospital Liaison Committees!
10:10 Truly, this has been  a strengthening aid for us
10:14 “to keep abstaining from . . . blood.”

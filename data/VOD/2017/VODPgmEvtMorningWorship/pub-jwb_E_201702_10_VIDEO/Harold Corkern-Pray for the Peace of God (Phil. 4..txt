00:01 Our text is focusing  on the powerful effect
00:04 that prayer can have on us
00:06 when it is true prayer,
00:09 genuine prayer.
00:12 Mere communication with God
00:15 is not necessarily prayer.
00:18 In Genesis  chapters 3 and 4,
00:21 after Adam had sinned,
00:23 he had dialogue with Jehovah,
00:25 but it could hardly  be viewed as prayer.
00:28 Why?
00:29 Because prayer involves trust,
00:32 respect, humility, devotion,
00:37 and a sense of dependence
00:39 on the one to whom  the prayer is directed.
00:41 Now, just to highlight  the importance of trust
00:45 and prayer’s effectiveness,
00:48 let’s open our Bibles  to Psalm 91,
00:51 and we’ll see the important quality  of trust highlighted.
00:54 Psalm 91,  we’ll read verses 1 and 2.
01:00 “Anyone dwelling in the secret place  of the Most High
01:04 will lodge under the shadow  of the Almighty.”
01:07 Well, we notice “the secret place,”
01:10 a place of spiritual security
01:13 where no one or no thing  can rob us of our faith in Jehovah
01:17 or our love for Jehovah.
01:19 And it’s secret because unbelievers  can’t understand it.
01:23 But now,  how do we get there?
01:26 Verse 2:  “I will say to Jehovah:
01:30 ‘You are my refuge  and my stronghold,
01:35 my God in whom I trust.’”
01:39 So the key of getting  into the secret place,
01:43 the key to getting  the peace of God,
01:46 is this humility  and trust in Jehovah.
01:50 And we notice  the expression here:
01:52 “You are my refuge  and my stronghold.”
01:55 In this context, not ours —while it’s true—
01:58 but it has to be personal.
02:00 And that’s the trust  that we have on an individual basis.
02:03 And how grateful we are  that we have Jehovah’s listening ear,
02:07 and he hears us
02:09 because of something  that David said.
02:11 We go to Psalm 69 this time,
02:14 and as we turn here,  we’d like to ask you to think,
02:17 “Have you ever felt,  to a reasonable degree,
02:21 the same way that David  expresses himself here?”
02:25 He’s going through  a very stressful time, overwhelmed,
02:29 and in verse 20 of Psalm 69,  he says:
02:33 “Reproach has broken my heart,
02:36 “and the wound is incurable.
02:39 “I was hoping for sympathy,  but there was none,
02:43 and for comforters,  but I found none.”
02:47 So at times,  our fellow believers
02:51 —our family members even,  close friends—
02:55 they may not be able to help us
02:57 the way we need to be helped.
02:59 And why is that?
03:01 Well, for one thing, they may be  very busy dealing with their own problems,
03:04 and they don’t have  the time to really notice.
03:07 Or the other factor is
03:09 that we all have things that differ  when it comes to causing us stress.
03:13 What is a real stress for one person  is not so hard for another.
03:17 And if they look on  and see someone
03:20 going through something  that they find easy,
03:22 perhaps the sympathy will be lacking.
03:25 But, nonetheless,  verse 33 of this same Psalm says:
03:29 “For Jehovah  is listening to the poor,
03:32 and he will not despise  his captive people.”
03:36 Now, in principle,  sometimes we may feel captive
03:40 to our circumstances
03:42 or to the feelings  that we’re experiencing,
03:44 to our emotions,  to what we are going through
03:46 —we feel trapped.
03:48 Other people may not understand
03:51 or may not be able to help us.
03:53 But notice the reassurance
03:56 in 2 Chronicles 6:29, 30.
04:01 This is the prayer of Solomon
04:03 at the time  of the dedication of the temple.
04:05 And in 2 Chronicles 6:29  he says:
04:10 “Whatever request for favor
04:12 “may be made by any man
04:14 “or by all your people Israel
04:17 “(for each one knows
04:19 “his own plague and his own pain)
04:23 when they spread out  their hands toward this house,”
04:26 so we’re unique.
04:28 Other people may not be able to do it.
04:29 Why?  Verse 30:
04:31 “Then may you hear from the heavens,
04:33 “your dwelling place,  and may you forgive;
04:35 “and reward each one  according to all his ways,
04:38 “for you know his heart
04:41 “(you alone truly know
04:44 the human heart).”
04:46 So even if our friends care,
04:49 even if they want to be helpful,
04:51 they cannot possibly see  the depth of what we’re feeling
04:56 or what we’re thinking  or how it’s affecting us,
04:59 but Jehovah does.
05:01 He sees right  to the heart of the matter,
05:04 and how reassuring that is.
05:06 So we trust him  because he really knows us.
05:12 But there’s something else  involved in this trust.
05:16 Matthew 6:33 says:
05:18 “Keep on, then, seeking first  the Kingdom and his righteousness,
05:22 and all these other things  will be added to you.”
05:26 Now, there’s personal trust
05:28 —trust that Jehovah  knows what I need
05:32 and that he’s going to,  as he always has, provide it.
05:37 But there can be a pitfall.
05:40 If a person  is naturally calm, confident,
05:44 perhaps has a natural ability,  family history that’s rich
05:49 —both emotionally,  maybe even financially—
05:54 all of these things  can make a person begin to feel,
05:57 ‘Yes, I trust in Jehovah,  but I can do this myself.’
06:02 You know, sometimes  we may hear this expression
06:05 when we hear of someone
06:07 that’s being transitioned  from one form of special service,
06:10 perhaps into  the regular pioneer work
06:12 or they have to leave Bethel  for good reasons,
06:14 and they have to go back  and get some secular work.
06:18 Have you ever heard this?
06:20 “They’re going to do fine
06:22 because they have marketable skills.”
06:26 Now,  that’s a good thing.
06:28 Perhaps those marketable skills  have been developed
06:30 in pursuing Kingdom interests,  and that’s fine.
06:32 But we have to be careful.
06:35 Will they be fine  because of their skills
06:39 or because of their continuing  to seek first the Kingdom
06:44 and they let Jehovah  be the one that provides for them?
06:48 And we’ll have to be careful too  when we use that expression
06:51 “They’ll have no problem;  they have marketable skills.”
06:54 What if someone doesn’t?
06:56 Well, Jehovah  takes care of them too.
06:59 Amos 7:14, 15,  Amos said:
07:02 ‘I wasn’t a prophet  or the son of a prophet.
07:05 I was a nipper of figs,  a very lowly herdsman, shepherd.’
07:10 But Jehovah took him,  used him, and provided for him.
07:14 So marketable skills  were not the key factor.
07:18 And so we keep that  in its proper perspective.
07:21 And finally,  in imitation of Jehovah,
07:25 when we try to help people,
07:27 we want to use the most powerful tool  we have to encourage them
07:30 and to help them deal  with their anxiety.
07:33 There was an experience  in the February 15, 1988, Watchtower
07:37 about Brother Arthur Winkler.
07:39 Now,  the Gestapo found him,
07:42 and they beat him  without mercy,
07:45 knocked out his teeth,  dislocated his jaw.
07:48 His whole body  was raw from the beating,
07:51 and they threw him in a dark cell.
07:53 At that moment,  Brother Winkler said,
07:56 “I was in desperate need  of spiritual food,
08:00 and I prayed to Jehovah.”
08:02 And then he talked to the guard  and asked him to help him.
08:06 The cell door opened  and a Bible was thrown in,
08:09 and he said:
08:11 “That daily enjoyment  of those pleasant words of truth
08:15 “were precious.
08:17 I felt myself  getting stronger spiritually.”
08:20 So, then,  when we go to help people,
08:23 the best thing we can do  in helping them cope is,
08:26 not with some  often-used phrase
08:29 or something that is  repeatable all the time,
08:32 but make sure it is the Bible.
08:35 They may feel captive,  imprisoned by their situation.
08:39 But an account from the Bible
08:42 —an account of a Bible character
08:44 that had gone through tough times  and came through—
08:46 those are the most meaningful things  to deal with it.
08:50 Perhaps
2 Corinthians 11:23-31,
08:54 where Paul reviewed all of those things that he went through,
08:58 and yet years later,  he wrote our day’s text for today,
09:01 saying Jehovah helped him  stay calm and assisted him.
09:04 So may these reminders  from the Scriptures
09:06 help us to cope and help others  to cope with anxieties.

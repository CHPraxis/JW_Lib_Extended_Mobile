00:01 The theme I would like to address
00:03 this morning is
00:04 “Guard Against Materialism.”
00:07 And I invite you to take
00:09 another look at our day’s text
00:10 at Matthew 6:24.
00:14 Here couched in the Sermon on the Mount,
00:17 Jesus addressed his disciples and the crowds
00:20 with an all-inclusive truth.
00:23 Notice how that verse begins:
00:25 “No one can slave for two masters.”
00:30 Are there any exceptions to that rule?
00:33 According to Jesus,  according to Jehovah God,
00:36 no—no exceptions.
00:39 But who are the two competing  and very different masters
00:44 that Jesus was referring to?
00:47 The end of the verse answers
00:49 where he refers to “God” and “Riches.”
00:53 Did you notice that “Riches”  is presented here in the Bible
00:58 with a capital “R” to begin?
01:03 Now, that’s interesting when we  notice Jesus’ other references to riches
01:08 in the New World Translation  where the “r” is not capitalized
01:12 —lowercase “riches.”
01:14 For example,  when Jesus refers later
01:16 to the deceptive power of riches
01:19 that can choke the word,  lowercase “r.”
01:22 Or when he referred  to unrighteous riches
01:26 that we need to use wisely,  lowercase “r.”
01:30 So why, here at Matthew 6:24
01:33 and in the parallel account  at Luke 16:13,
01:38 did the New World Bible  Translation Committee
01:41 choose to capitalize the “R”?
01:45 Well, the study edition  of the New World Translation helps us here.
01:50 It tells us at Matthew 6:24
01:53 that the Greek word used here  is traditionally translated “Mammon”
01:58 —that could also be rendered  as “Riches” or “Money.”
02:02 And then the comment adds this gem:
02:04 It says that in this verse
02:06 ‘“Riches” is personified as a master,
02:09 or a kind of false god.’
02:13 Well, we’ve seen that to be true, haven’t we?
02:15 For generations humans  have tended to elevate riches:
02:20 good old money, riches —lowercase “m” and lowercase “r.”
02:24 And they’ve elevated it  to be a god that has,
02:28 as our commenters commented on,  enslaved millions.
02:33 What was the teaching  Jesus was highlighting for his followers?
02:37 It’s that we —Christians—
02:39 cannot give God  the exclusive devotion that he deserves
02:43 and at the same time be devoted  to gathering up more material possessions.
02:49 That’s a very strong warning.
02:51 So that leads us  to two questions that we could consider
02:54 with the balance  of our time this morning:
02:56 What is materialism?
02:58 And how can you and I guard  against falling into that snare
03:02 of gathering up more riches
03:05 and making this our god?
03:09 Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary  offers this definition of materialism:
03:14 It’s “a preoccupation with [or a tendency to seek after]
03:18 “or stress upon material [things]
03:20 rather than intellectual  or spiritual things.”
03:23 But I found a definition  in the publications of the faithful slave
03:26 that I think is even better  for all of us in the context of Jesus’ words.
03:31 The 1978 Yearbook,  on page 9, expressed it this way:
03:36 “It has been said  that materialism is anything
03:39 “that stands between a person  and his worship of Jehovah.
03:43 “So it need not necessarily be  an expensive automobile,
03:47 “an ostentatious home  or a large bank account.
03:50 “It could be anything  that absorbs a person’s time and attention
03:55 so that he neglects  the worship due to Jehovah.”
03:59 Well, that’s the point, isn’t it,  that Jesus was trying
04:01 to stress for his followers?
04:03 Could materialism entrap any of us
04:06 who have chosen  to put Kingdom interests first
04:08 and have made  material sacrifices in order to do that?
04:14 Well, that question prompted me  to think of a faithful servant of Jehovah
04:18 outlined in the Bible book of Jeremiah —Baruch.
04:22 Open, please, to Jeremiah chapter 45.
04:26 Now, as we think  about the faithful servant Jeremiah
04:30 and his secretary, Baruch,
04:32 we can imagine that they  made considerable sacrifices
04:36 to serve the interests  of Jehovah’s people at that time.
04:42 Baruch had a special privilege of service,
04:45 as do most of us here today,
04:47 but something distracted him.
04:49 Notice, please,  the reading at Jeremiah 45:3.
04:55 Here Jehovah pinpointed  what Baruch had said,
05:00 perhaps only in his heart,  only in his own thoughts.
05:03 Verse 3:  “You have said:
05:05 “‘Woe to me, for Jehovah  has added grief to my pain!
05:10 I am weary from my groaning,  and I have found no resting-place.’”
05:15 Baruch was tired.
05:17 He’d been serving Jehovah faithfully,
05:20 but his assignment was difficult,  perhaps stressful.
05:24 And it was going to be 18 more years  until the foretold destruction would come.
05:29 But was it his service to Jehovah  that was really the problem?
05:33 Notice what Jehovah identified,  as we read verse 5:
05:37 “But you are seeking  great things for yourself.
05:41 Stop seeking such things.”
05:45 Those “great things”  could have been material things.
05:50 It could have been  that he was ensnared by materialism.
05:55 If that was the case,
05:57 Jehovah’s warning  to stop seeking such things was timely.
06:01 Later on in that same verse,  Baruch was reminded that his life
06:05 —not his possessions, not his things—
06:08 was going to be the spoil  that Jehovah was going to provide
06:11 at the upcoming destruction.
06:14 Well, how can we guard against falling  into the snare of materialism?
06:18 Like Baruch, we from time to time  need to take a long hard look
06:22 at our personal view  of money and personal things.
06:25 The September 2015 issue  of the Awake! magazine
06:28 posed some questions for self-examination.
06:31 Here are just a few of them:
06:33 “Am I attracted to get-rich-quick schemes?
06:36 “Do I find it difficult  to be generous with my money?
06:40 “Does money make me feel important?
06:42 “Am I always thinking about money?
06:45 “Is my attitude toward money
06:47 adversely affecting  my health and family life?”
06:51 You know, real-life experiences  among our brothers and sisters
06:55 prove that we all need  to be thinking seriously about this matter.
06:59 Alex, one of our brothers,  got caught up in trading in the stock market,
07:03 thinking he could soon quit his job  and enter the pioneer service.
07:07 He was well-motivated,
07:09 but he got caught in a vortex
07:11 of studying offers and market reports.
07:14 He used his savings  and money borrowed from brokers
07:17 to buy stocks that the analysts
07:20 had predicted would quickly rise in value.
07:24 Do you know how the story plays out for Alex?
07:27 Months passed, the stocks never rebounded.
07:31 Alex lost his savings  and ended up having to sell his home.
07:35 What a painful consequence
07:39 of being deceived by this cruel master —money.
07:44 Alex reflected on what took place,  and he said this:
07:48 “I caused my family great pain.
07:51 “I now know that anyone  who puts his trust in Satan’s system
07:55 will be profoundly disappointed.”
07:59 There was another experience  of a Sister Valentine from Jamaica
08:03 that caught my attention  when I was researching this point.
08:07 You may remember  the article that was published
08:09 in the January 1, 2006,  issue of The Watchtower,
08:12 “Bringing Up Eight Children in Jehovah’s Ways  Was a Challenge and a Joy.”
08:16 Our sister related an experience  that involved her view of material things.
08:20 Now, we keep in mind  that she was not well-to-do financially.
08:24 Imagine, a mother of eight —the husband has abandoned her—
08:28 she’s raising them to serve Jehovah.
08:31 But does the fact that we  may have a little, financially speaking,
08:35 mean that we’re immune  to the trap of materialism?
08:38 In 1988,  Hurricane Gilbert devastated the island.
08:42 She wrote this:
08:44 “We left our home  for shelter in a safer place.
08:47 “During a lull in the storm,  my son and I left the refuge area
08:51 “to survey the wreckage  that was once our home.
08:53 “While poking around in the debris,  I spotted something I wanted to save.
08:57 “Suddenly, winds were howling again,
09:00 but I still held on to what I had salvaged.”
09:03 Her son spoke up,  “Mom, put down the television.
09:06 Are you Lot’s wife?”
09:10 Our sister commented  that that comment from her son
09:14 caught her  and returned her to her senses.
09:16 She dropped the rain-soaked TV,  and they ran for safety.
09:21 Sister Valentine did a self-examination.
09:24 She thought about what took place  at that moment.
09:27 She says:  “I recall that I risked my life for a TV.”
09:32 But it warmed her heart  that her son had the spiritual insight
09:37 to provide her  a warning at the right time.
09:40 Well,  it’s a good lesson for all of us, isn’t it?
09:43 No matter  what our economic situation may be,
09:46 we need to view money as a skillful tool
09:50 and use it for that purpose,
09:52 but not allow it to rule or control us.
09:57 We do not want  to ‘stab ourselves all over with many pains.’

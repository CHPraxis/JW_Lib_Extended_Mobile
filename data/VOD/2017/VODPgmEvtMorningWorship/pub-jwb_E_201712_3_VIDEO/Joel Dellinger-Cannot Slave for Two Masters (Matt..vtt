00:01.083 --> 00:03.620
The theme I would like to address 


00:03.620 --> 00:04.853
this morning is 


00:04.853 --> 00:07.756
“Guard Against Materialism.” 


00:07.757 --> 00:09.259
And I invite you to take 


00:09.258 --> 00:10.793
another look at our day’s text 


00:10.793 --> 00:14.996
at Matthew 6:24. 


00:14.997 --> 00:17.134
Here couched in the Sermon on the Mount, 


00:17.133 --> 00:20.470
Jesus addressed his disciples and the crowds 


00:20.470 --> 00:23.038
with an all-inclusive truth. 


00:23.038 --> 00:25.341
Notice how that verse begins: 


00:25.342 --> 00:30.114
“No one can slave for two masters.” 


00:30.113 --> 00:33.816
Are there any exceptions to that rule? 


00:33.817 --> 00:36.685
According to Jesus, 
according to Jehovah God, 


00:36.685 --> 00:39.322
no—no exceptions. 


00:39.322 --> 00:44.327
But who are the two competing 
and very different masters 


00:44.327 --> 00:47.064
that Jesus was referring to? 


00:47.063 --> 00:49.565
The end of the verse answers 


00:49.565 --> 00:53.937
where he refers to “God” and “Riches.” 


00:53.937 --> 00:58.842
Did you notice that “Riches” 
is presented here in the Bible 


00:58.842 --> 01:03.045
with a capital “R” to begin? 


01:03.045 --> 01:08.050
Now, that’s interesting when we 
notice Jesus’ other references to riches 


01:08.050 --> 01:12.322
in the New World Translation 
where the “r” is not capitalized


01:12.322 --> 01:14.324
—lowercase “riches.” 


01:14.323 --> 01:16.893
For example, 
when Jesus refers later 


01:16.893 --> 01:19.728
to the deceptive power of riches 


01:19.728 --> 01:22.765
that can choke the word, 
lowercase “r.” 


01:22.765 --> 01:26.335
Or when he referred 
to unrighteous riches 


01:26.335 --> 01:30.340
that we need to use wisely, 
lowercase “r.” 


01:30.340 --> 01:33.943
So why, here at Matthew 6:24 


01:33.943 --> 01:38.180
and in the parallel account 
at Luke 16:13, 


01:38.180 --> 01:41.785
did the New World Bible 
Translation Committee 


01:41.785 --> 01:45.588
choose to capitalize the “R”? 


01:45.588 --> 01:50.058
Well, the study edition 
of the New World Translation helps us here. 


01:50.058 --> 01:53.563
It tells us at Matthew 6:24 


01:53.563 --> 01:58.266
that the Greek word used here 
is traditionally translated “Mammon”


01:58.267 --> 02:02.072
—that could also be rendered 
as “Riches” or “Money.” 


02:02.072 --> 02:04.507
And then the comment adds this gem: 


02:04.507 --> 02:06.509
It says that in this verse 


02:06.508 --> 02:09.911
‘“Riches” is personified as a master, 


02:09.912 --> 02:13.215
or a kind of false god.’ 


02:13.215 --> 02:15.552
Well, we’ve seen that to be true, haven’t we? 


02:15.552 --> 02:20.157
For generations humans 
have tended to elevate riches: 


02:20.157 --> 02:24.594
good old money, riches
—lowercase “m” and lowercase “r.” 


02:24.593 --> 02:28.731
And they’ve elevated it 
to be a god that has, 


02:28.732 --> 02:33.302
as our commenters commented on, 
enslaved millions. 


02:33.302 --> 02:37.774
What was the teaching 
Jesus was highlighting for his followers? 


02:37.773 --> 02:39.775
It’s that we
—Christians—


02:39.775 --> 02:43.713
cannot give God 
the exclusive devotion that he deserves 


02:43.713 --> 02:49.518
and at the same time be devoted 
to gathering up more material possessions. 


02:49.518 --> 02:51.720
That’s a very strong warning.


02:51.720 --> 02:54.690
So that leads us 
to two questions that we could consider 


02:54.690 --> 02:56.860
with the balance 
of our time this morning: 


02:56.860 --> 02:58.895
What is materialism? 


02:58.895 --> 03:02.598
And how can you and I guard 
against falling into that snare 


03:02.598 --> 03:05.668
of gathering up more riches 


03:05.668 --> 03:09.171
and making this our god? 


03:09.172 --> 03:14.177
Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary 
offers this definition of materialism: 


03:14.177 --> 03:18.314
It’s “a preoccupation with
[or a tendency to seek after]


03:18.313 --> 03:20.250
“or stress upon material [things] 


03:20.250 --> 03:23.252
rather than intellectual 
or spiritual things.” 


03:23.252 --> 03:26.990
But I found a definition 
in the publications of the faithful slave 


03:26.990 --> 03:31.727
that I think is even better 
for all of us in the context of Jesus’ words. 


03:31.727 --> 03:36.165
The 1978 Yearbook, 
on page 9, expressed it this way: 


03:36.165 --> 03:39.068
“It has been said 
that materialism is anything 


03:39.068 --> 03:43.271
“that stands between a person 
and his worship of Jehovah. 


03:43.272 --> 03:47.277
“So it need not necessarily be 
an expensive automobile, 


03:47.277 --> 03:50.514
“an ostentatious home 
or a large bank account. 


03:50.513 --> 03:55.116
“It could be anything 
that absorbs a person’s time and attention 


03:55.117 --> 03:59.022
so that he neglects 
the worship due to Jehovah.” 


03:59.022 --> 04:01.424
Well, that’s the point, isn’t it, 
that Jesus was trying 


04:01.423 --> 04:03.926
to stress for his followers?


04:03.927 --> 04:06.462
Could materialism entrap any of us 


04:06.462 --> 04:08.932
who have chosen 
to put Kingdom interests first 


04:08.932 --> 04:13.000
and have made 
material sacrifices in order to do that? 


04:14.703 --> 04:18.608
Well, that question prompted me 
to think of a faithful servant of Jehovah 


04:18.608 --> 04:22.245
outlined in the Bible book of Jeremiah
—Baruch. 


04:22.245 --> 04:26.848
Open, please, to Jeremiah chapter 45. 


04:26.848 --> 04:30.753
Now, as we think 
about the faithful servant Jeremiah 


04:30.753 --> 04:32.855
and his secretary, Baruch, 


04:32.855 --> 04:36.892
we can imagine that they 
made considerable sacrifices 


04:36.892 --> 04:41.000
to serve the interests 
of Jehovah’s people at that time. 


04:42.898 --> 04:45.266
Baruch had a special privilege of service, 


04:45.267 --> 04:47.670
as do most of us here today, 


04:47.670 --> 04:49.672
but something distracted him. 


04:49.672 --> 04:55.679
Notice, please, 
the reading at Jeremiah 45:3. 


04:55.678 --> 05:00.248
Here Jehovah pinpointed 
what Baruch had said, 


05:00.248 --> 05:03.686
perhaps only in his heart, 
only in his own thoughts. 


05:03.687 --> 05:05.722
Verse 3: 
“You have said: 


05:05.722 --> 05:10.292
“‘Woe to me, for Jehovah 
has added grief to my pain! 


05:10.292 --> 05:15.565
I am weary from my groaning, 
and I have found no resting-place.’” 


05:15.565 --> 05:17.567
Baruch was tired. 


05:17.567 --> 05:20.302
He’d been serving Jehovah faithfully, 


05:20.302 --> 05:24.174
but his assignment was difficult, 
perhaps stressful. 


05:24.173 --> 05:29.198
And it was going to be 18 more years 
until the foretold destruction would come. 


05:29.198 --> 05:33.281
But was it his service to Jehovah 
that was really the problem? 


05:33.282 --> 05:37.087
Notice what Jehovah identified, 
as we read verse 5: 


05:37.087 --> 05:41.124
“But you are seeking 
great things for yourself. 


05:41.123 --> 05:45.995
Stop seeking such things.”


05:45.995 --> 05:50.500
Those “great things” 
could have been material things. 


05:50.500 --> 05:55.505
It could have been 
that he was ensnared by materialism. 


05:55.505 --> 05:57.640
If that was the case, 


05:57.640 --> 06:01.777
Jehovah’s warning 
to stop seeking such things was timely. 


06:01.777 --> 06:05.280
Later on in that same verse, 
Baruch was reminded that his life


06:05.280 --> 06:08.517
—not his possessions, not his things—


06:08.517 --> 06:11.520
was going to be the spoil 
that Jehovah was going to provide 


06:11.520 --> 06:14.023
at the upcoming destruction. 


06:14.023 --> 06:18.326
Well, how can we guard against falling 
into the snare of materialism? 


06:18.327 --> 06:22.332
Like Baruch, we from time to time 
need to take a long hard look 


06:22.332 --> 06:25.334
at our personal view 
of money and personal things. 


06:25.333 --> 06:28.670
The September 2015 issue 
of the Awake! magazine 


06:28.670 --> 06:31.573
posed some questions for self-examination. 


06:31.573 --> 06:33.575
Here are just a few of them: 


06:33.575 --> 06:36.645
“Am I attracted to get-rich-quick schemes? 


06:36.645 --> 06:40.082
“Do I find it difficult 
to be generous with my money? 


06:40.082 --> 06:42.652
“Does money make me feel important? 


06:42.652 --> 06:45.254
“Am I always thinking about money? 


06:45.253 --> 06:47.390
“Is my attitude toward money 


06:47.390 --> 06:50.000
adversely affecting 
my health and family life?”


06:51.465 --> 06:55.130
You know, real-life experiences 
among our brothers and sisters 


06:55.130 --> 06:59.835
prove that we all need 
to be thinking seriously about this matter. 


06:59.835 --> 07:03.705
Alex, one of our brothers, 
got caught up in trading in the stock market, 


07:03.705 --> 07:07.410
thinking he could soon quit his job 
and enter the pioneer service. 


07:07.410 --> 07:09.412
He was well-motivated, 


07:09.412 --> 07:11.414
but he got caught in a vortex 


07:11.413 --> 07:14.350
of studying offers and market reports. 


07:14.350 --> 07:17.753
He used his savings 
and money borrowed from brokers 


07:17.753 --> 07:20.121
to buy stocks that the analysts 


07:20.122 --> 07:24.060
had predicted would quickly rise in value. 


07:24.060 --> 07:27.297
Do you know how the story plays out for Alex? 


07:27.297 --> 07:31.034
Months passed, the stocks never rebounded. 


07:31.033 --> 07:35.370
Alex lost his savings 
and ended up having to sell his home. 


07:35.370 --> 07:39.542
What a painful consequence 


07:39.542 --> 07:44.547
of being deceived by this cruel master
—money. 


07:44.547 --> 07:48.617
Alex reflected on what took place, 
and he said this: 


07:48.617 --> 07:51.254
“I caused my family great pain. 


07:51.253 --> 07:55.958
“I now know that anyone 
who puts his trust in Satan’s system 


07:55.958 --> 07:58.000
will be profoundly disappointed.”


07:59.895 --> 08:03.732
There was another experience 
of a Sister Valentine from Jamaica 


08:03.732 --> 08:07.069
that caught my attention 
when I was researching this point. 


08:07.068 --> 08:09.371
You may remember 
the article that was published 


08:09.372 --> 08:12.309
in the January 1, 2006, 
issue of The Watchtower, 


08:12.308 --> 08:16.711
“Bringing Up Eight Children in Jehovah’s Ways 
Was a Challenge and a Joy.” 


08:16.712 --> 08:20.750
Our sister related an experience 
that involved her view of material things. 


08:20.750 --> 08:24.220
Now, we keep in mind 
that she was not well-to-do financially. 


08:24.220 --> 08:28.457
Imagine, a mother of eight
—the husband has abandoned her—


08:28.457 --> 08:31.360
she’s raising them to serve Jehovah. 


08:31.360 --> 08:35.030
But does the fact that we 
may have a little, financially speaking, 


08:35.030 --> 08:38.567
mean that we’re immune 
to the trap of materialism? 


08:38.567 --> 08:42.372
In 1988, 
Hurricane Gilbert devastated the island. 


08:42.372 --> 08:44.374
She wrote this: 


08:44.373 --> 08:47.543
“We left our home 
for shelter in a safer place. 


08:47.543 --> 08:51.080
“During a lull in the storm, 
my son and I left the refuge area 


08:51.080 --> 08:53.448
“to survey the wreckage 
that was once our home. 


08:53.448 --> 08:57.520
“While poking around in the debris, 
I spotted something I wanted to save. 


08:57.520 --> 09:00.122
“Suddenly, winds were howling again, 


09:00.122 --> 09:03.225
but I still held on to what I had salvaged.” 


09:03.225 --> 09:06.828
Her son spoke up, 
“Mom, put down the television. 


09:06.828 --> 09:09.000
Are you Lot’s wife?” 


09:10.833 --> 09:14.003
Our sister commented 
that that comment from her son 


09:14.003 --> 09:16.671
caught her 
and returned her to her senses. 


09:16.672 --> 09:21.577
She dropped the rain-soaked TV, 
and they ran for safety. 


09:21.577 --> 09:24.614
Sister Valentine did a self-examination. 


09:24.613 --> 09:27.783
She thought about what took place 
at that moment. 


09:27.783 --> 09:32.788
She says: 
“I recall that I risked my life for a TV.” 


09:32.788 --> 09:37.626
But it warmed her heart 
that her son had the spiritual insight 


09:37.627 --> 09:40.529
to provide her 
a warning at the right time.


09:40.528 --> 09:43.098
Well, 
it’s a good lesson for all of us, isn’t it? 


09:43.098 --> 09:46.268
No matter 
what our economic situation may be, 


09:46.268 --> 09:50.038
we need to view money as a skillful tool


09:50.038 --> 09:52.608
and use it for that purpose,


09:52.608 --> 09:57.513
but not allow it to rule or control us.


09:57.513 --> 10:07.773
We do not want 
to ‘stab ourselves all over with many pains.’

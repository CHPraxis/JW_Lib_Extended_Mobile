00:01.417 --> 00:03.420
Our text for discussion today, 


00:03.420 --> 00:06.122
here at Matthew 6:33, 


00:06.122 --> 00:08.692
contains two parts. 


00:08.692 --> 00:12.129
The first part is what we have to do; 


00:12.128 --> 00:15.865
it says: 
“Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom 


00:15.865 --> 00:18.200
and his righteousness.” 


00:18.200 --> 00:21.805
The second part is what Jehovah will do: 


00:21.805 --> 00:25.975
“And all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


00:25.975 --> 00:29.112
We think carefully about these words. 


00:29.112 --> 00:33.484
Jesus actually was educating his disciples 


00:33.483 --> 00:37.286
to make a dramatic change 
in their lifestyle. 


00:37.287 --> 00:39.455
What do we mean by that? 


00:39.455 --> 00:41.958
Well, look at verse 31. 


00:41.958 --> 00:46.595
He says: “So never be anxious and say, 


00:46.595 --> 00:50.100
“‘What are we to eat?’ 
or, ‘What are we to drink?’ 


00:50.100 --> 00:52.435
or, ‘What are we to wear?’” 


00:52.435 --> 00:55.003
Did Jesus say never? 


00:55.003 --> 00:57.173
Yes! 


00:57.173 --> 00:59.875
But those are the things we normally do. 


00:59.875 --> 01:03.278
We are anxious about our existence, 


01:03.278 --> 01:07.683
and Jesus recognizes 
that most people are that way. 


01:07.683 --> 01:09.685
He says in verse 32: 


01:09.685 --> 01:11.888
“For all these are the things 


01:11.888 --> 01:15.258
the nations are eagerly pursuing.” 


01:15.258 --> 01:17.526
But then he says: 


01:17.527 --> 01:22.000
“Your heavenly Father knows 
that you need all these things.”


01:23.198 --> 01:25.235
Here in this chapter, 


01:25.235 --> 01:30.038
Jesus outlines a number 
of very important principles 


01:30.038 --> 01:34.676
that actually change the way we look at life 


01:34.677 --> 01:37.447
and the way we see our existence 


01:37.447 --> 01:39.682
in relationship to Jehovah God. 


01:39.682 --> 01:43.152
He puts service to Jehovah 


01:43.152 --> 01:45.189
in the first place, 


01:45.188 --> 01:48.090
regardless of our circumstances.


01:48.090 --> 01:50.727
Let us have a look 
at two of these principles. 


01:50.727 --> 01:54.364
The one that’s here 
 at Matthew 6:24, 


01:54.363 --> 01:56.398
he says: 


01:56.398 --> 02:00.736
“No one can slave for two masters; 


02:00.737 --> 02:04.174
“for either he will hate the one 
and love the other, 


02:04.173 --> 02:08.010
“or he will stick to the one 
and despise the other. 


02:08.010 --> 02:10.513
“You cannot slave 


02:10.513 --> 02:13.415
for God and for Riches.” 


02:13.415 --> 02:15.618
It is just not possible. 


02:15.618 --> 02:18.855
Some have tried, but they’ve failed. 


02:18.855 --> 02:23.627
Satan approached Jesus and said to him: 
‘I will give you riches. 


02:23.627 --> 02:27.397
I’ll give you all the kingdoms 
of the world and their glory.’ 


02:27.397 --> 02:30.234
Of course, Jesus refused. 
Why? 


02:30.233 --> 02:34.436
Because he knew 
there was a price attached to it. 


02:34.437 --> 02:36.439
What is the price? 


02:36.438 --> 02:38.440
Worship


02:38.440 --> 02:40.810
—divided worship—
which is impossible. 


02:40.810 --> 02:42.845
He knew that it is impossible 


02:42.845 --> 02:45.582
to worship both Jehovah and Riches. 


02:45.582 --> 02:49.119
In verse 21, Jesus says: 


02:49.118 --> 02:51.286
“For where your treasure is, 


02:51.287 --> 02:55.000
there your heart will be also.”


02:58.895 --> 03:03.667
The second principle is in verse 25: 


03:03.667 --> 03:07.204
“On this account I say to you: 


03:07.203 --> 03:11.173
“Stop being anxious about your lives 


03:11.173 --> 03:14.176
“as to what you will eat 
or what you will drink, 


03:14.177 --> 03:17.414
or about your bodies 
as to what you will wear.” 


03:17.413 --> 03:19.415
And here is the principle: 


03:19.415 --> 03:23.218
“Does not life mean more than food 


03:23.218 --> 03:26.000
and the body [more] than clothing?” 


03:27.157 --> 03:29.959
You can have a storehouse full of food; 


03:29.958 --> 03:33.395
if you don’t have life, you cannot eat it. 


03:33.395 --> 03:36.465
You can have a warehouse full of clothes; 


03:36.465 --> 03:39.000
but if there’s no body, you cannot wear it.


03:40.470 --> 03:45.375
Jesus illustrated this principle 
beautifully in Luke. 


03:45.375 --> 03:47.643
Turn to Luke 


03:47.643 --> 03:50.646
chapter 12 


03:50.647 --> 03:54.084
and from verse 16: 


03:54.083 --> 03:57.220
“With that he told them an illustration, 
saying: 


03:57.220 --> 04:00.088
“‘The land of a rich man produced well. 


04:00.088 --> 04:02.825
“‘So he began reasoning within himself, 


04:02.825 --> 04:06.828
“‘“What should I do now 
that I have nowhere to gather my crops?” 


04:06.828 --> 04:08.865
“‘Then he said, “I will do this:


04:08.865 --> 04:12.835
“‘“I will tear down my storehouses 
and build bigger ones, 


04:12.835 --> 04:17.073
“‘“and there I will gather 
all my grain and all my goods, 


04:17.073 --> 04:19.108
“‘“and I will say to myself: 


04:19.108 --> 04:22.178
“‘“‘You have many good things 
stored up for many years; 


04:22.178 --> 04:26.181
“‘“‘take it easy, eat, 
drink, enjoy yourself.’”


04:26.182 --> 04:28.584
“‘But God said to him, 


04:28.583 --> 04:31.020
“‘“Unreasonable one, 


04:31.020 --> 04:34.590
“‘“this night they are demanding 
your life from you. 


04:34.590 --> 04:38.560
“‘“Who, then, is to have 
the things you stored up?” 


04:38.560 --> 04:43.265
“‘So it goes with the man 
who stores up treasure for himself 


04:43.265 --> 04:47.837
but is not rich toward God.’” 


04:47.837 --> 04:51.340
Jesus didn’t say this man was dishonest 


04:51.340 --> 04:54.910
or that he’d never thought about God. 


04:54.910 --> 04:57.713
The mistake the man made was 


04:57.713 --> 05:00.115
that his priorities were wrong. 


05:00.115 --> 05:04.853
He focused primarily on amassing wealth. 


05:04.853 --> 05:08.156
He did not do what it says in verse 21. 


05:08.157 --> 05:11.094
He did not store up treasure for himself— 


05:11.093 --> 05:13.930
He ‘stored up treasure for himself,’ 


05:13.930 --> 05:17.033
but did not store up treasure 
with God in heaven. 


05:17.033 --> 05:19.901
He was “not rich toward God.” 


05:19.902 --> 05:22.572
And that is the key element, isn’t it? 


05:22.572 --> 05:25.240
Our service to Jehovah God, 


05:25.240 --> 05:27.543
our life for Jehovah, 


05:27.543 --> 05:29.545
that is the key element. 


05:29.545 --> 05:32.215
And as Jesus says in verse 15, 


05:32.215 --> 05:34.783
the second part of verse 15: 


05:34.783 --> 05:38.988
“Because even when a person 
has an abundance, 


05:38.988 --> 05:41.890
“his life does not result 


05:41.890 --> 05:43.860
from the things he possesses.”


05:43.860 --> 05:45.862
So these are 


05:45.862 --> 05:48.799
the two very important principles 
we’ve covered. 


05:48.798 --> 05:50.800
First of all, 


05:50.800 --> 05:53.737
make our service to God a priority 


05:53.737 --> 05:56.039
and not amassing wealth. 


05:56.038 --> 05:58.040
And the second one: 


05:58.040 --> 06:01.743
“Keep on, then, 
seeking first the Kingdom 


06:01.743 --> 06:03.780
“and [God’s] righteousness, 


06:03.780 --> 06:07.117
and all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


06:07.117 --> 06:10.252
We do not know precisely 
when the end will come, 


06:10.252 --> 06:14.757
but we want to keep on 
seeking first the Kingdom.


06:14.757 --> 06:18.862
Rather than putting our trust 
in the securities of this world, 


06:18.862 --> 06:23.032
we want to put our trust 
in our heavenly Father. 


06:23.032 --> 06:26.469
Jehovah gives everything; 


06:26.468 --> 06:29.838
he gives more than what we need. 


06:29.838 --> 06:33.375
In Ecclesiastes 5:19, 


06:33.375 --> 06:36.912
it summarizes this whole principle. 


06:36.912 --> 06:41.817
It establishes the truth
—the reality of the matter. 


06:41.817 --> 06:46.089
It says, Ecclesiastes 5:19: 


06:46.088 --> 06:50.993
“Also, when the true God 
gives a man riches 


06:50.993 --> 06:53.295
“and material possessions 


06:53.295 --> 06:57.167
“along with the ability to enjoy them, 


06:57.167 --> 07:00.069
“he should take his reward 


07:00.068 --> 07:02.705
“and rejoice in his hard work. 


07:02.705 --> 07:12.933
This is the gift of God.”

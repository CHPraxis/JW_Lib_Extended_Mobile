00:00 My theme for this little discussion is
00:04 “Husbands, Love Your Wife as Yourself.”
00:10 What did Jesus say
00:12 was the second greatest commandment?
00:14 Well, you’re familiar with it.
00:16 At Matthew 22:39,  he said:
00:19 “You must love  your neighbor as yourself.”
00:24 Now, what an excellent illustration
00:26 is contained in this second greatest commandment!
00:29 If you think about it,  we just naturally,
00:32 inherently, love ourselves,  don’t we?
00:34 And we show  love in many ways.
00:37 So Jesus is saying,
00:38 “Work hard to show the same love for others
00:42 you show for yourself.”
00:44 But, now, thinking of husbands
00:46 as addressed in our theme,
00:48 who is a husband’s closest neighbor?
00:51 Well, his wife.
00:53 So especially must a husband work hard
00:56 to show the love that he shows  for himself just naturally and then
00:59 to show that love for his wife.
01:01 Now, what are some specific ways
01:04 that husbands  just naturally love themselves?
01:07 Well,  let’s talk about five.
01:09 And undoubtedly you can think of many others
01:11 that could be discussed during this discussion.
01:14 But number one:
01:16 A husband feeds himself.
01:19 Ephesians 5:29 says in part:
01:24 “For no man ever hated his own body,
01:27 but he feeds . . . it.”
01:30 Well, what does loving our wife,  now, as ourself require?
01:34 Well, for one thing,  we certainly would make sure
01:38 we provide for the food  and for other material needs
01:41 that our wife has.
01:44 And regarding this,  I think of our brothers
01:46 in concentration camps  in Nazi Germany.
01:50 Food was very scarce.
01:52 But our brothers, even then,  from their meager food ration
01:56 would share food  with other brothers,
01:59 even, in some cases,  with worldly people.
02:02 Well, similarly,  a husband would do without himself,
02:05 if necessary, in order to provide  what his wife really needs.
02:10 But even more importantly,  an extended application,
02:14 he would make sure  that she is well-fed spiritually.
02:18 He must make sure  that she has opportunity
02:21 to benefit from periods  of personal study,
02:24 congregation meetings,  assemblies, conventions,
02:28 and family worship.
02:30 But now let’s talk  about a second way
02:32 that a husband  just naturally loves himself:
02:35 We cherish ourselves.
02:38 Ephesians 5:29 says in part:
02:42 “For no man ever hated his own body,
02:46 but he . . . cherishes it.”
02:48 Now,  what does cherish mean?
02:52 Well,  according to the dictionary,
02:54 it means to treat  with affection and tenderness,
02:57 treasure, value,  attach importance to.
03:02 See, because of this feeling  we have toward ourselves,
03:05 we try to get rest  when we’re sick or tired;
03:10 we try to be  with friends and loved ones;
03:13 we play games; we exercise;  we do things we enjoy.
03:16 Periodically,  we treat ourselves, don’t we,
03:20 because we cherish ourselves?
03:22 So, what does loving  our wife as ourself require?
03:26 Well, it certainly means more
03:28 than just being able  to put up with our mate.
03:30 It means cherishing her,
03:33 cultivating affection,  or fondness, for her.
03:38 Think of this:  At Proverbs 8:31,
03:42 it says that Jesus  in his prehuman existence
03:45 was fond of humans.
03:48 Now, don’t you think  that fondness he had for us
03:51 made it easier for him to come to the earth,
03:53 take the difficult assignment he took,
03:55 and even die for us  because he was fond of us?
03:58 Well, similarly,
04:00 if wives are cherished  by their husbands
04:04 —if husbands  are fond of their wives—
04:06 it’ll make it so much easier  to forgive them,
04:10 to even die for them,  if necessary, in the future.
04:14 But if we’re going to have  this proper feeling, like Jehovah,
04:18 we have to focus  on the good qualities of our wife, see,
04:23 not the flaws, the imperfections.
04:25 And as one  of the brothers commented on
04:28 (I love the thoughts  in The Watchtower comments):
04:31 “Love is best sensed  when it is expressed.
04:35 “How vital that marriage mates
04:37 “not allow the activities of daily life
04:40 to rob them of exchanging  expressions of affection!”
04:45 But now let’s get a third way
04:47 that husbands  just naturally love themselves:
04:50 We adorn ourselves.
04:53 First Timothy 2:9 speaks
04:55 of women “adorn[ing] themselves  in appropriate dress.”
05:00 Well, husbands  try to do the same thing.
05:02 And in adorning ourselves, we try to cover over
05:07 and minimize our flaws
05:10 and cover our bulges,  our blemishes.
05:13 We try to make ourselves  look as good as possible, don’t we?
05:16 Well, what does loving  our wife as ourself require?
05:20 For one thing, we certainly  wouldn’t shine a spotlight on her flaws.
05:24 We wouldn’t do this  in the presence of others.
05:27 We would try hard  not to even do it in our own mind.
05:31 Rather, we seek to cover over  minor sins and transgressions,
05:35 as encouraged at Proverbs 19:11,  where it says:
05:39 “It is beauty . . . to overlook an offense.”
05:43 So we work hard to adorn our wives
05:46 —make her look  as good as possible—
05:49 in the eyes of others,  even in our own mind.
05:52 Well, let’s get a fourth way
05:54 that husbands  just naturally love themselves:
05:57 We take steps to heal ourselves
06:00 when we’re sick or injured.
06:03 Mark 5:26
06:05 talks about a woman  who was very sick.
06:08 ‘She suffered at the hands  of many physicians;
06:10 ‘she spent all her resources;
06:11 she didn’t get any better;  she got worse.’
06:13 But the point is,
06:15 she was really trying hard  to heal herself.
06:18 Well, husbands  try to do the same thing.
06:20 So if we’re sick or injured,  we try to get extra rest,
06:23 we’ll buy medicine, we’ll take vitamins,
06:27 we’ll make an appointment  with the doctor,
06:30 we’ll pursue therapy.
06:32 See, we try to get well.
06:35 What does loving our wife  as ourself require then?
06:38 Well, we would certainly  do all within our power
06:40 if she’s sick or injured
06:42 to try to help her get well.
06:44 But even more importantly,
06:46 if she happens  to be ailing somewhat spiritually,
06:49 we would do everything  we can possibly do
06:52 to help her get well spiritually.
06:54 What would be something,  perhaps, we could do?
06:57 Well, Proverbs 12:18 says:
07:00 “The tongue of the wise is a healing”
07:03 —so the using of wise expressions.
07:07 Also, Proverbs 16:24:
07:09 “Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb,
07:11 “sweet to the soul
07:13 and a healing to the bones.”
07:16 So, “pleasant sayings,”  we would use these
07:19 to try to help her  get well spiritually.
07:23 But now here’s one more,  a fifth way
07:25 that husbands  just naturally love themselves:
07:28 We make allowances,
07:30 excuses,  if we make mistakes.
07:33 Husbands who make mistakes
07:36 are often heard blaming it
07:38 on their heredity
07:41 or maybe the environment,
07:43 their blood-sugar level,
07:46 how much sleep they got  or didn’t get the night before,
07:51 the weather, and so forth.
07:54 We tend to well understand  our own limitations, don’t we?
07:58 And we allow for that.
08:00 Well, what about  loving our wife as ourself?
08:03 We’d make the same allowances for her
08:05 —being positive,  imputing good motives to her.
08:09 If she speaks a little roughly  or acts a little thoughtlessly,
08:13 we’ll try to discern the feelings
08:16 behind the words or actions.
08:19 We’ll make allowance,  especially if we can discern
08:23 that she’s under some kind  of emotional pressure.
08:26 We’ll make that allowance for her  like we would for ourselves.
08:30 Well, there we have five ways
08:32 that we as husbands  show love for ourselves.
08:34 We feed, cherish, adorn,
08:39 try to heal ourselves;
08:41 and we make allowances, excuses,
08:44 when we make mistakes.
08:46 Let’s work hard  to show the same love
08:50 in those five areas  for our dear, beloved wives.
08:54 And I’m sure, as we said,  you can think of other ways
08:57 that husbands just naturally  love themselves.
09:00 But what a rich illustration Jesus gave!
09:03 And interestingly,  he took it even a step further.
09:06 He further expanded the illustration
09:09 at John 13:34.
09:12 You’re familiar with this, 13:34.
09:14 He said:  “I am giving you a new commandment,
09:18 “that you love one another;
09:20 “just as I have loved you,
09:23 you also love one another.”
09:27 So he’s saying that we should have
09:30 even deeper love for our brothers
09:32 —which would definitely  include our Christian wives—
09:35 a deeper love  than we have for ourselves.
09:37 And that deeper love  would move us to treat
09:40 our dear wives even better
09:44 than we treat ourselves.

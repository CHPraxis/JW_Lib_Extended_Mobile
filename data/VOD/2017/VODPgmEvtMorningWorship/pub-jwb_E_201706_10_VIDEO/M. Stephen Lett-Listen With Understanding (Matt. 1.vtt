00:01.650 --> 00:05.688
Sight, hearing, taste, 


00:05.688 --> 00:08.156
touch, smell: 


00:08.157 --> 00:09.592
Well, as you know, 


00:09.592 --> 00:12.162
those are the five primary senses 


00:12.162 --> 00:14.997
with which the Creator has endowed us. 


00:14.997 --> 00:17.700
But now, 
which one of these five 


00:17.700 --> 00:20.903
is perhaps related the closest 


00:20.903 --> 00:24.406
to our being able to gain 
the prize of everlasting life? 


00:24.407 --> 00:26.575
Well, is it not hearing?


00:26.575 --> 00:29.412
It’s interesting that throughout history, 


00:29.412 --> 00:33.584
the churches of Babylon the Great 
have put the main emphasis, 


00:33.583 --> 00:38.588
not on hearing, 
but on seeing or perhaps touching


00:38.588 --> 00:43.593
—seeing an image of their God, 
maybe touching or kissing that image. 


00:43.593 --> 00:48.096
But Jehovah has always put
the emphasis on hearing.


00:48.097 --> 00:50.400
“Hear, O Israel.” 


00:50.400 --> 00:52.735
“Give ear and listen.” 


00:52.735 --> 00:55.438
With commanding calls such as this, 


00:55.438 --> 00:57.640
the Israelites were summoned together 


00:57.640 --> 01:01.410
to hear Jehovah’s words read and explained.


01:01.410 --> 01:03.413
Well, similarly today, 


01:03.413 --> 01:05.415
we have many opportunities 


01:05.415 --> 01:08.652
to hear Jehovah’s words read and explained.


01:08.652 --> 01:10.687
But now, here’s a question: 


01:10.687 --> 01:13.890
Is it sufficient that we just hear 


01:13.890 --> 01:16.225
the sounds of Jehovah’s words? 


01:16.225 --> 01:18.327
Well, you know that’s not sufficient. 


01:18.327 --> 01:21.197
Here’s an experience that illustrates this. 


01:21.197 --> 01:24.800
Many years ago, 
I was working in service with a brother. 


01:24.800 --> 01:26.803
It was his turn to talk. 


01:26.803 --> 01:27.903
He was very nervous. 


01:27.903 --> 01:29.071
The lady came to the door. 


01:29.072 --> 01:30.240
He said, “How are you?” 


01:30.240 --> 01:32.042
She said, “Not very good.” 


01:32.042 --> 01:34.044
He said, “That’s good.” 


01:34.043 --> 01:37.113
And he proceeded with his presentation. 


01:37.113 --> 01:40.250
Well, he heard sounds 
coming out of her mouth, 


01:40.250 --> 01:44.787
but he didn’t hear 
so as to perceive what was said.


01:44.787 --> 01:46.924
Well, obviously,
Jehovah expects us to do


01:46.923 --> 01:50.726
a whole lot better than that 
when it comes to hearing his words. 


01:50.727 --> 01:55.064
At Matthew 13:16, 
today’s scripture text, 


01:55.063 --> 01:58.233
Jesus commended his disciples 
by saying: 


01:58.233 --> 02:02.705
“Happy are . . . 
your ears because they hear.” 


02:02.705 --> 02:04.707
Now, he wasn’t commending them 


02:04.707 --> 02:07.177
for just hearing 
sounds coming out of his mouth, 


02:07.177 --> 02:11.815
but he was commending them 
because they heard with understanding. 


02:11.815 --> 02:13.817
They grasped the meaning, 


02:13.817 --> 02:18.454
and then they were in a position 
to make application of what they had heard. 


02:18.453 --> 02:21.190
Well, do we want Jehovah and Jesus 


02:21.190 --> 02:24.560
to pronounce our ears happy? 


02:24.560 --> 02:27.330
Do we want figuratively happy ears? 


02:27.330 --> 02:29.332
We do, don’t we? 


02:29.332 --> 02:32.135
Well, then, we must listen
—like those disciples—


02:32.135 --> 02:34.803
in a way that we grasp the meaning 


02:34.803 --> 02:37.573
and are in a position to make application.


02:37.573 --> 02:40.410
Open up to Mark chapter 4, please. 


02:40.410 --> 02:43.478
And here’s an interesting scripture 
in this vein. 


02:43.478 --> 02:45.781
Notice the words of Jesus. 


02:45.782 --> 02:50.787
Mark chapter 4, 
beginning in verse 23, he said: 


02:50.787 --> 02:54.024
“Whoever has ears to listen, 


02:54.023 --> 02:56.025
“let him listen. 


02:56.025 --> 02:58.027
“He further said to them: 


02:58.027 --> 03:00.597
‘Pay attention to what you are hearing.’” 


03:00.597 --> 03:02.165
Now notice this: 


03:02.165 --> 03:04.533
“With the measure 
that you are measuring out, 


03:04.533 --> 03:06.768
“you will have it measured out to you, 


03:06.768 --> 03:09.771
yes, you will have more added to you.” 


03:09.772 --> 03:12.409
So notice, Jesus was saying 


03:12.408 --> 03:16.178
that if you measure out
little interest and attention,


03:16.178 --> 03:18.848
don’t expect to gain much. 


03:18.848 --> 03:21.016
In contrast, 
if you measure out 


03:21.017 --> 03:24.020
your full attention 
and interest to what I am saying, 


03:24.020 --> 03:29.025
then I will give you generously, 
even beyond your expectations. 


03:29.025 --> 03:31.293
Well, it works the same way today,
doesn’t it?


03:31.293 --> 03:35.965
We actually reap enlightenment 
in direct proportion 


03:35.965 --> 03:39.535
to how much interest 
and attention we measure out.


03:39.535 --> 03:41.537
Go to Hebrews chapter 2. 


03:41.537 --> 03:45.975
Here’s another scripture— 
very familiar scripture in this regard


03:45.975 --> 03:48.110
—Hebrews chapter 2, 


03:48.110 --> 03:52.282
and notice that we’re not 
to just pay casual attention 


03:52.282 --> 03:54.617
or even usual attention, 


03:54.617 --> 03:56.619
but notice how it’s worded. 


03:56.618 --> 03:58.688
Hebrews 2:1: 


03:58.688 --> 04:03.025
“That is why it is necessary for us to pay 


04:03.025 --> 04:06.362
“more than the usual attention 


04:06.362 --> 04:08.364
“to the things we have heard, 


04:08.363 --> 04:10.866
so that we never drift away.” 


04:10.867 --> 04:12.869
So it’s absolutely required 


04:12.868 --> 04:15.571
that if we’re not going to drift 
away from Jehovah or the truth, 


04:15.572 --> 04:19.575
we’ve got 
“to pay more than the usual attention.”


04:19.575 --> 04:21.777
Now, let’s illustrate this point. 


04:21.777 --> 04:23.780
I’d like you to imagine 


04:23.780 --> 04:26.615
that you’re trapped in a building 


04:26.615 --> 04:29.052
that is engulfed in fire. 


04:29.052 --> 04:32.389
A fireman makes his way to you, 
and he says: 


04:32.388 --> 04:36.258
“I only have time to tell you this once; 
I’ve got to go help other people. 


04:36.258 --> 04:38.861
“But there’s only one way to escape: 


04:38.862 --> 04:41.364
“You’ve got to go 
down the stairs very quickly. 


04:41.363 --> 04:43.031
“When you get to the bottom, 


04:43.032 --> 04:45.369
“drop down on your stomach 
and begin crawling. 


04:45.368 --> 04:47.570
“You have to stay 
within three feet of the floor 


04:47.570 --> 04:50.740
“because above that 
there are poisonous gases. 


04:50.740 --> 04:53.643
“Crawl, though, to the right, 


04:53.643 --> 04:57.380
“and you will see a small hallway
—a narrow hallway. 


04:57.380 --> 04:59.382
“Crawl through that hallway. 


04:59.382 --> 05:01.650
“When you get to the end, 
you’ll be in the lobby. 


05:01.650 --> 05:04.720
Stand up, turn left, 
run out the exit doors.” 


05:04.720 --> 05:08.725
Now, 
while those instructions were being given, 


05:08.725 --> 05:12.262
would you allow your mind to wander? 


05:12.262 --> 05:16.099
Would you be thinking: 
‘I wonder what I’ll have for supper tonight? 


05:16.098 --> 05:18.735
I wonder what will be on TV?’ 


05:18.735 --> 05:20.970
No, 
your attention would be riveted 


05:20.970 --> 05:25.542
because one missed detail 
could cost you your life. 


05:25.542 --> 05:28.244
And even after the fireman left,


05:28.243 --> 05:31.713
you probably would still hear
—ringing in your ears—


05:31.713 --> 05:34.716
his words as you 
reviewed them in your mind, see. 


05:34.717 --> 05:37.587
‘Down the stairs, 
crawl through the hallway, 


05:37.587 --> 05:41.324
go out the left of the lobby 
through the exit doors.’ 


05:41.323 --> 05:43.826
You’d be reviewing that information 


05:43.827 --> 05:47.997
with the idea that you 
were truly going to make application.


05:47.997 --> 05:50.367
Well, that’s how we want to listen. 


05:50.367 --> 05:53.770
And if you think about it, 
we’re in a similar situation, aren’t we? 


05:53.770 --> 05:57.040
Satan’s world is on fire around us 


05:57.040 --> 06:00.377
and very soon it’s going to totally burn up. 


06:00.377 --> 06:04.014
But Jehovah is giving us escape instructions. 


06:04.013 --> 06:07.483
In fact, at 2 Peter 3:12 
it says about this system 


06:07.483 --> 06:10.453
that it’s going to “be destroyed in flames 


06:10.453 --> 06:14.390
and the elements 
will melt in the intense heat!” 


06:14.390 --> 06:16.392
But we want to survive. 


06:16.392 --> 06:19.895
We don’t even slightly want 
to be like the idols 


06:19.895 --> 06:22.565
mentioned at Psalm 115:6 


06:22.565 --> 06:25.835
who ‘have ears but they don’t hear.’ 


06:25.835 --> 06:29.972
Or like the cobra mentioned at Psalm 58:4 


06:29.972 --> 06:32.242
“that stops up its ear” 


06:32.242 --> 06:35.344
and refuses to hear 
“the voice of [the] charmers.” 


06:35.343 --> 06:40.348
Or like the disobedient Israelites 
described at Isaiah 6:10 


06:40.348 --> 06:43.451
as having “unresponsive” ears. 


06:43.452 --> 06:48.024
Or those disobedient Israelites 
that are described at Jeremiah 6:10 


06:48.023 --> 06:52.828
in the literal Hebrew 
as having ‘uncircumcised ears.’ 


06:52.828 --> 06:56.498
We don’t even want to be 
like the Hebrew Christians 


06:56.498 --> 07:00.135
who were described at Hebrews 5:11 


07:00.135 --> 07:03.205
as being “dull in [their] hearing.”


07:03.205 --> 07:07.843
We want to do our very best 
to ‘uncover our ear.’ 


07:07.843 --> 07:09.845
Now, 
that’s an interesting expression 


07:09.845 --> 07:13.850
in the literal Hebrew at Job 33:16. 


07:13.850 --> 07:16.052
And, apparently, 
it comes from the fact 


07:16.052 --> 07:19.989
that the Orientals wore a headdress. 


07:19.988 --> 07:24.860
But to hear more clearly, 
they would partially remove that headdress 


07:24.860 --> 07:26.862
and uncover the ear. 


07:26.862 --> 07:29.099
Well, we want to do that ourselves. 


07:29.098 --> 07:33.301
We want to “incline [our] ear,” 
Psalm 78:1, 


07:33.302 --> 07:36.705
‘awaken our ear,’ 
‘open our ear,’ “give ear,” 


07:36.705 --> 07:39.542
as different verses in Isaiah say. 


07:39.542 --> 07:43.679
And all of that is pay attention 
with a view of making application 


07:43.678 --> 07:45.715
of what we have heard. 


07:45.715 --> 07:47.717
Now, if we do this


07:47.717 --> 07:51.720
—use our sense of hearing wisely 
as we’ve discussed—


07:51.720 --> 07:54.723
then we’ll be in a position to survive 


07:54.723 --> 07:59.595
the cataclysmic end 
of this system of things.


07:59.595 --> 08:04.233
As recorded at 2 Kings 21:12, 


08:04.233 --> 08:06.235
Jehovah said: 


08:06.235 --> 08:11.040
“Here I am bringing such a disaster 
on Jerusalem and Judah 


08:11.040 --> 08:13.508
“that it will make both ears 


08:13.508 --> 08:17.111
of anyone who hears about it tingle.” 


08:17.112 --> 08:18.780
Well, it’s true. 


08:18.780 --> 08:21.750
During the great tribulation, 
people of this world, 


08:21.750 --> 08:24.020
when they hear 
about the calamitous events 


08:24.020 --> 08:26.055
of the great tribulation, 


08:26.055 --> 08:28.723
undoubtedly both of their ears


08:28.723 --> 08:32.828
—figuratively for sure 
but perhaps even literally—


08:32.828 --> 08:34.596
will tingle. 


08:34.597 --> 08:37.267
But the ears of Jehovah’s people 


08:37.267 --> 08:39.335
will continue to be inclined 


08:39.335 --> 08:42.472
toward Jehovah’s directions 
that will come at that time, 


08:42.472 --> 08:45.174
such as found at Isaiah 26:20, 


08:45.173 --> 08:47.175
where Jehovah will say: 


08:47.175 --> 08:50.947
“Go, my people, enter your inner rooms, 


08:50.947 --> 08:53.349
“and shut your doors behind you. 


08:53.348 --> 08:58.353
Hide yourself for a brief moment 
until the wrath has passed by.”


08:58.353 --> 09:01.023
And as Jesus declared 


09:01.023 --> 09:03.893
the ears of his disciples happy, 


09:03.893 --> 09:07.596
Jehovah and Jesus will be able to declare 


09:07.597 --> 09:12.100
the ears of the surviving great crowd happy. 


09:12.100 --> 09:14.470
They will say to them: 


09:14.470 --> 09:25.065
“Happy are your . . . 
ears because they hear.”

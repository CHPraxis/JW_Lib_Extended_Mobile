00:01.752 --> 00:06.690
Jehovah God has the purpose 
of gathering His people 


00:06.690 --> 00:11.127
out of Satan’s world 
into His congregation. 


00:11.127 --> 00:16.032
Christ Jesus promised us 
that he would be with us 


00:16.032 --> 00:19.769
until the conclusion 
of this system of things. 


00:19.768 --> 00:24.006
When we see 
this huge organization worldwide, 


00:24.007 --> 00:28.144
we know that Jesus 
is fulfilling his promise 


00:28.143 --> 00:33.081
and Jehovah is executing 
His purposes in a wonderful way. 


00:33.082 --> 00:37.987
This huge organization 
has many services 


00:37.987 --> 00:40.724
or ministries 
associated with it. 


00:40.723 --> 00:44.393
It can only be accomplished 
by means of Jehovah. 


00:44.393 --> 00:48.000
He is the orchestrator 
of this organization.


00:49.465 --> 00:53.637
The apostle Paul, 
here in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, 


00:53.637 --> 00:56.072
explains in great detail 


00:56.072 --> 01:00.710
how Jehovah 
organizes His organization. 


01:00.710 --> 01:05.682
If we’d look at verse 14 
of 1 Corinthians chapter 12, 


01:05.682 --> 01:09.319
it says: 
“Indeed, the body is made up 


01:09.318 --> 01:12.621
not of one member 
but of many.” 


01:12.622 --> 01:17.294
So Paul is using the body, 
the human body, 


01:17.293 --> 01:21.196
as an analogy 
of the organization. 


01:21.197 --> 01:24.200
And it has many members. 


01:24.200 --> 01:29.172
Each individual member 
is assigned a ministry. 


01:29.172 --> 01:32.275
Let us read here 
verses 4 through 6. 


01:32.275 --> 01:35.678
It says: 
“Now there are different gifts, 


01:35.678 --> 01:38.046
“but there is the same spirit; 


01:38.047 --> 01:40.650
“and there are different ministries, 


01:40.650 --> 01:44.453
“and yet there is the same Lord; 


01:44.453 --> 01:47.790
“and there are different activities, 


01:47.790 --> 01:50.660
“and yet it is the same God 


01:50.660 --> 01:54.230
who performs them all in everyone.” 


01:54.230 --> 01:59.035
This reminds us that this organization 
does not belong to any man. 


01:59.035 --> 02:01.905
No human is putting it together; 


02:01.905 --> 02:04.240
no human is moving it along. 


02:04.240 --> 02:07.243
It is Jehovah God himself.


02:07.243 --> 02:10.346
And we are helped 
by Paul in this chapter 


02:10.347 --> 02:14.317
to understand 
our relationship to one another. 


02:14.317 --> 02:19.322
Let us read here 
verses 17 and 19 and 21. 


02:19.322 --> 02:23.527
It says, 
1 Corinthians 12:17: 


02:23.527 --> 02:27.030
“If the whole body were an eye, 


02:27.030 --> 02:29.898
“where would the sense of hearing be? 


02:29.898 --> 02:34.670
If it were all hearing, 
where would the sense of smell be?” 


02:34.670 --> 02:38.675
Nineteen: 
“If they were all the same member, 


02:38.675 --> 02:40.877
where would the body be?” 


02:40.877 --> 02:45.080
And 21: 
“The eye cannot say to the hand, 


02:45.080 --> 02:47.083
“‘I do not need you,’ 


02:47.083 --> 02:50.920
“or again, 
the head cannot say to the feet, 


02:50.920 --> 02:52.922
‘I do not need you.’” 


02:52.922 --> 02:55.825
We all understand 
we need each other. 


02:55.825 --> 02:59.162
We do different operations 
or ministries, 


02:59.162 --> 03:02.565
but we need each other 
very much. 


03:02.565 --> 03:06.035
And that’s why it says 
in verse 20: 


03:06.035 --> 03:10.940
“Now they are many members, 
yet one body.” 


03:10.940 --> 03:13.042
We are still one body. 


03:13.042 --> 03:16.045
We belong to the same congregation.


03:16.045 --> 03:19.615
Now, this brings us 
to the text for today in verse 22 


03:19.615 --> 03:23.218
where Paul says: 
“On the contrary, the members of the body 


03:23.218 --> 03:26.288
that seem to be weaker are necessary.” 


03:26.288 --> 03:29.525
So “weaker” in this context, 
what does it mean? 


03:29.525 --> 03:33.697
It does not refer 
that this member is deficient 


03:33.697 --> 03:35.865
or not able 
to do their work; 


03:35.865 --> 03:38.602
no, it just means 
that this member may be, 


03:38.602 --> 03:42.939
from a physical point of view, 
seem weaker.


03:42.938 --> 03:46.708
Maybe we have an older brother 


03:46.708 --> 03:49.311
suffering with some illness, 


03:49.312 --> 03:52.315
and he cannot do 
as much as he used to do. 


03:52.315 --> 03:56.652
Does it mean that 
he is not fulfilling his assignment 


03:56.652 --> 03:59.222
or that he does not fit 
into God’s arrangement 


03:59.222 --> 04:01.224
or that he 
is useless to Jehovah? 


04:01.223 --> 04:02.625
Not at all. 


04:02.625 --> 04:05.000
He may seem to be weaker, 


04:06.395 --> 04:08.765
but we understand 
how that works, 


04:08.765 --> 04:11.067
and we appreciate 
God’s arrangement. 


04:11.067 --> 04:13.135
Look what it says in verse 23: 


04:13.135 --> 04:15.137
“And the parts of the body 


04:15.137 --> 04:18.709
“that we think to be less honorable 


04:18.708 --> 04:21.710
“we surround with greater honor, 


04:21.710 --> 04:23.847
“so our unseemly parts 


04:23.847 --> 04:26.315
are treated with greater modesty.” 


04:26.315 --> 04:28.317
And this is God’s arrangement. 


04:28.317 --> 04:30.152
Verse 24 says: 


04:30.152 --> 04:33.555
“Whereas our attractive parts 
do not need anything. 


04:33.555 --> 04:38.560
“Nevertheless, 
God has so composed the body, 


04:38.560 --> 04:43.000
giving greater honor 
to the part that had a lack.”


04:45.133 --> 04:48.036
So there is no division 
in the body. 


04:48.037 --> 04:50.039
It cooperates. 


04:50.038 --> 04:54.010
You do not have members 
looking down on others 


04:54.010 --> 04:59.748
because of their inability 
or limited circumstances. 


04:59.748 --> 05:02.118
That’s why it says in verse 25: 


05:02.118 --> 05:05.888
“So that there should be 
no division in the body, 


05:05.888 --> 05:10.000
but its members should have 
mutual concern for one another.”


05:13.195 --> 05:15.197
How does this work? 


05:15.197 --> 05:19.869
How has Jehovah arranged 
and orchestrated this organization? 


05:19.868 --> 05:22.571
It’s beautifully described by Paul 


05:22.572 --> 05:26.000
in Ephesians 4:16. 


05:27.143 --> 05:31.746
Now in verse 15 here in Ephesians 4, 
Paul says: 


05:31.747 --> 05:35.485
“Let us by love grow up in all things 


05:35.485 --> 05:39.122
into him who is the head, Christ.” 


05:39.122 --> 05:41.457
Christ Jesus is the Head. 


05:41.457 --> 05:44.027
There’s no pyramid structure. 


05:44.027 --> 05:47.730
Christ said: 
“Your Leader is one.” 


05:47.730 --> 05:52.702
And then it says, from verse 16, 
the first part of verse 16, 


05:52.702 --> 05:55.905
it explains how Jehovah God 


05:55.905 --> 05:58.440
organizes his people. 


05:58.440 --> 06:00.910
It says: 
“From him,” from Christ, 


06:00.910 --> 06:05.915
“all the body 
is harmoniously joined together 


06:05.915 --> 06:08.183
“and made to cooperate 


06:08.183 --> 06:11.586
through every joint 
that gives what is needed.” 


06:11.587 --> 06:15.425
So it is harmoniously joined together. 


06:15.425 --> 06:17.427
It’s like the human hand. 


06:17.427 --> 06:20.329
The fingers are joined by the palm. 


06:20.328 --> 06:22.631
The palm is joined to the wrist. 


06:22.632 --> 06:26.602
There is a harmonious joining together, 


06:26.602 --> 06:30.407
and then it says here, 
they are made to cooperate. 


06:30.407 --> 06:33.409
So they have been designed 
to fit together, 


06:33.408 --> 06:35.478
to cooperate, 
to work together. 


06:35.478 --> 06:37.880
This is what Jehovah God does. 


06:37.880 --> 06:41.683
But then the second part of the verse 
shows what we need to do. 


06:41.683 --> 06:45.921
It says we need to give what is needed 
and then it says: 


06:45.922 --> 06:50.794
“When each respective member 
functions properly, 


06:50.793 --> 06:54.563
“this contributes 
to the growth of the body 


06:54.563 --> 06:58.333
as it builds itself up in love.” 


06:58.333 --> 07:01.603
So that is our function
—to give what is needed, 


07:01.603 --> 07:04.273
to do what is required.


07:04.273 --> 07:08.676
Jesus illustrated that 
so beautifully for us in John 13. 


07:08.677 --> 07:12.682
Remember the time when 
he washed the feet of the disciples. 


07:12.682 --> 07:16.185
We turn there to John 13, 


07:16.185 --> 07:19.000
and if we look 


07:22.258 --> 07:24.993
at verses 12 through 15, 


07:24.993 --> 07:27.028
Jesus explained what he did. 


07:27.028 --> 07:29.298
Then he explains the purpose of this. 


07:29.298 --> 07:32.468
It says: 
“When, now, he had washed their feet 


07:32.468 --> 07:35.638
“and had put 
his outer garments on, 


07:35.638 --> 07:39.808
“he again reclined at the table 
and said to them: 


07:39.808 --> 07:43.311
“‘Do you understand 
what I have done to you? 


07:43.312 --> 07:46.649
“‘You address me 
as “Teacher” and “Lord,” 


07:46.648 --> 07:49.085
“‘and you are correct, 
for I am such. 


07:49.085 --> 07:53.755
“‘Therefore, if I, the Lord and Teacher, 
washed your feet, 


07:53.755 --> 07:57.227
“‘you also should wash 
the feet of one another. 


07:57.227 --> 07:59.629
“‘For I set the pattern for you, 


07:59.628 --> 08:04.533
that just as I did to you, 
you should also do.’” 


08:04.533 --> 08:08.905
So imagine, here is Jesus, 
the Head of the congregation, 


08:08.905 --> 08:10.973
he got down on his knees 


08:10.973 --> 08:14.043
and washed the feet of his disciples, 


08:14.043 --> 08:17.180
and then he said 


08:17.180 --> 08:20.000
we must follow that example.


08:21.150 --> 08:24.820
So, what is the purpose 
of this arrangement? 


08:24.820 --> 08:28.992
Each of us fits 
into God’s arrangement. 


08:28.992 --> 08:33.162
All of us have a function, 
a beautiful function, 


08:33.162 --> 08:36.332
that is to serve one another


08:36.332 --> 08:38.734
—give what is needed. 


08:38.733 --> 08:41.636
As stated there in Ephesians 


08:41.637 --> 08:44.940
in the final part of verse 16, 
as we read: 


08:44.940 --> 08:48.777
“This contributes 
to the growth of the body 


08:48.777 --> 08:52.147
as it builds itself up in love.”


08:52.147 --> 08:55.317
So Jehovah has made 
this wonderful arrangement 


08:55.317 --> 08:57.754
of gathering his people together. 


08:57.753 --> 09:02.258
He will take this organization, 
this congregation of people, 


09:02.258 --> 09:05.828
through into 
the righteous new system of things 


09:05.828 --> 09:09.431
where we will experience 
wonderful blessings. 


09:09.432 --> 09:13.235
But right now, 
it is our opportunity to cooperate 


09:13.235 --> 09:16.605
and to work together 
in love and unity. 


09:16.605 --> 09:20.008
And that way, 
whether we are weaker or stronger 


09:20.008 --> 09:22.911
from a physical point of view 
does not matter, 


09:22.912 --> 09:33.674
we’re all part of the same body.

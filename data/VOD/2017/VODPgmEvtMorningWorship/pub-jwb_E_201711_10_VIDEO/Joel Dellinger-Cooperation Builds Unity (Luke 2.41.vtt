00:01.217 --> 00:04.020
A key factor that promotes unity


00:04.020 --> 00:05.355
among Jehovah’s people 


00:05.355 --> 00:07.090
is the fact that we receive 


00:07.090 --> 00:09.125
very clear direction 


00:09.125 --> 00:11.127
and regular reminders. 


00:11.127 --> 00:13.697
Just think about what we receive each month 


00:13.697 --> 00:15.299
from Jehovah’s organization. 


00:15.298 --> 00:19.335
Unfailingly, we receive 
a study edition of The Watchtower; 


00:19.335 --> 00:23.338
we receive a public edition 
of The Watchtower or Awake! magazine, 


00:23.338 --> 00:25.875
the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook, 


00:25.875 --> 00:29.912
and an hour-long program 
on JW Broadcasting. 


00:29.912 --> 00:32.982
Almost daily, we receive new articles, 


00:32.982 --> 00:37.987
news, and legal updates posted to jw.org. 


00:37.987 --> 00:41.457
Are you having a challenge 
keeping up with it all? 


00:41.457 --> 00:44.060
How good to have that button 
on the home page 


00:44.060 --> 00:47.997
of jw.org that’s entitled “See What’s New.” 


00:47.997 --> 00:52.502
Like a gourmet multicoursed meal, 


00:52.502 --> 00:55.839
these regular provisions 
from Jehovah’s organization 


00:55.838 --> 01:00.843
not only delight us 
but they keep us alive spiritually


01:00.843 --> 01:04.613
—energized to move on 
in our service to Jehovah.


01:04.613 --> 01:08.383
What about those of us 
who are entrusted with responsibility, 


01:08.383 --> 01:11.620
whether in the congregation 
or here at Bethel? 


01:11.620 --> 01:16.625
We are not lacking for clear direction 
and regular reminders. 


01:16.625 --> 01:18.962
You might find it interesting to learn 


01:18.962 --> 01:22.099
that during the 2016 calendar year, 


01:22.098 --> 01:26.601
headquarters prepared 80 letters of direction 


01:26.602 --> 01:29.439
that were sent to the brothers in the field


01:29.438 --> 01:31.875
—such as elders and circuit overseers. 


01:31.875 --> 01:35.812
For the benefit of the branch committees 
in 90 branch offices, 


01:35.812 --> 01:39.382
during that same time period, 
the six Governing Body committees 


01:39.382 --> 01:43.754
sent out 240 letters to help these brothers 


01:43.753 --> 01:46.923
carry out their work in a unified way. 


01:46.923 --> 01:50.760
And, of course, that’s in addition 
to the thousands of letters


01:50.760 --> 01:53.195
that are sent each month in reply 


01:53.195 --> 01:56.598
to the individual questions 
that come from the branches. 


01:56.598 --> 01:59.668
Such clear and timely direction 


01:59.668 --> 02:04.606
is a key factor that contributes 
to our unity as Jehovah’s people.


02:04.607 --> 02:07.810
But for a few minutes, 
let’s discuss a second factor 


02:07.810 --> 02:09.812
that strengthens our unity. 


02:09.812 --> 02:12.582
Our commenters all touched on this. 


02:12.582 --> 02:15.485
It’s our personal willingness 


02:15.485 --> 02:19.455
to cooperate with theocratic direction. 


02:19.455 --> 02:21.858
In this regard, I invite you 
to open up your Bible 


02:21.858 --> 02:25.000
to Hebrews 13:7. 


02:26.195 --> 02:28.732
Here we’d like to ask the question: 


02:28.732 --> 02:31.902
What type of relationship 


02:31.902 --> 02:34.770
does Jehovah want us to cultivate 


02:34.770 --> 02:38.173
with our overseers, 
with the hardworking elders? 


02:38.173 --> 02:41.776
Verse 7 in Hebrews chapter 13 says: 


02:41.777 --> 02:45.349
“Remember those 
who are taking the lead among you, 


02:45.348 --> 02:47.483
“who have spoken the word of God to you, 


02:47.483 --> 02:50.886
“and as you contemplate 
how their conduct turns out, 


02:50.887 --> 02:52.989
imitate their faith.” 


02:52.988 --> 02:57.493
Let’s focus 
on the first action word—remember. 


02:57.493 --> 03:00.696
To remember means to keep in mind 


03:00.697 --> 03:03.667
the good work an elder does. 


03:03.667 --> 03:07.837
Doing so will help us 
to cultivate warm feelings


03:07.837 --> 03:11.240
—feelings of love and appreciation 
for the elders. 


03:11.240 --> 03:13.843
A recent study edition 
of The Watchtower says 


03:13.843 --> 03:18.280
that the word “remember” 
could also be translated “mention.” 


03:18.280 --> 03:22.752
So our heartfelt interest 
in the elders taking the lead 


03:22.752 --> 03:27.757
moves us to mention them 
in our prayers to Jehovah. 


03:27.757 --> 03:29.992
Think about that relationship 


03:29.992 --> 03:33.630
that God encourages us 
to cultivate with our overseers. 


03:33.630 --> 03:38.500
What a contrast that is 
to the rebellious, contentious attitude 


03:38.500 --> 03:43.472
that many in the world have 
toward those in positions of authority.


03:43.472 --> 03:48.477
Notice in this same chapter, 
Hebrews chapter 13, what verse 17 adds. 


03:48.477 --> 03:51.880
We’re told: “Be obedient 


03:51.880 --> 03:55.318
“to those who are taking the lead
among you and be submissive, 


03:55.318 --> 03:59.855
“for they are keeping watch over you 
as those who will render an account, 


03:59.855 --> 04:03.760
“so that they may do this 
with joy and not with sighing, 


04:03.760 --> 04:07.463
for this would be damaging to you.” 


04:07.463 --> 04:12.201
Here we’re admonished 
to obey and be submissive. 


04:12.202 --> 04:15.805
Of course, obedience is easier 


04:15.805 --> 04:17.940
when we understand the direction given, 


04:17.940 --> 04:20.343
when it suits our personal preference. 


04:20.343 --> 04:24.746
But what if some theocratic direction 
we receive does not make sense, 


04:24.747 --> 04:29.752
takes us by surprise, 
or doesn’t suit us personally? 


04:29.752 --> 04:34.357
In such cases, the latter part 
of that verse comes into play 


04:34.357 --> 04:37.227
where we’re directed to be submissive. 


04:37.227 --> 04:39.162
Why? 


04:39.162 --> 04:42.099
As the verse highlights, 
because in the long run, 


04:42.098 --> 04:45.166
yielding to theocratic direction 


04:45.167 --> 04:48.270
is for our own good.


04:48.270 --> 04:52.375
Of course, this does not make 
following direction easy


04:52.375 --> 04:54.677
—knowing that it’s for our good. 


04:54.677 --> 04:57.614
To illustrate the challenge we face, 


04:57.613 --> 05:01.716
you might imagine yourself 
trekking in the wilderness 


05:01.717 --> 05:05.020
with the Israelites 
during that 40-year period. 


05:05.020 --> 05:09.058
Imagine that you and your family 
have been walking for some days, 


05:09.058 --> 05:13.696
and all of a sudden, 
the pillar of cloud stops. 


05:13.697 --> 05:18.669
You stop; you look around; 
you’re obedient to the direction. 


05:18.668 --> 05:22.271
But you do ask yourself, 
‘How long will we be here? 


05:22.272 --> 05:25.609
a day? a week? a few months?’ 


05:25.608 --> 05:30.613
You ask yourself, ‘Should we pack,
unpack all of our belongings now?’ 


05:30.613 --> 05:34.450
So at the beginning, you decide 
to unpack just a few things. 


05:34.450 --> 05:39.088
Then a few days go by, you get tired 
of hunting through all your belongings, 


05:39.088 --> 05:41.223
so you decide to unpack everything. 


05:41.223 --> 05:43.225
Guess what happens next? 


05:43.225 --> 05:46.728
The pillar of cloud 
starts lifting up and moving. 


05:46.728 --> 05:49.298
Now it’s time to start packing. 


05:49.298 --> 05:52.701
Is it easy to follow through 
on theocratic direction? 


05:52.702 --> 05:54.704
Not always.


05:54.703 --> 05:59.408
In this regard, notice how the Israelites 
responded to the movements 


05:59.408 --> 06:02.445
of Jehovah through that cloud. 


06:02.445 --> 06:04.913
In Numbers chapter 9, 


06:04.913 --> 06:08.183
please turn your attention to verse 17, 


06:08.183 --> 06:10.218
and then we’ll read verse 22. 


06:10.218 --> 06:13.856
Numbers 9:17 says: 


06:13.857 --> 06:16.925
“Whenever the cloud lifted from the tent, 


06:16.925 --> 06:19.295
“the Israelites would promptly depart, 


06:19.295 --> 06:21.663
“and in the place 
where the cloud would remain, 


06:21.663 --> 06:24.866
there is where the Israelites would encamp.” 


06:24.867 --> 06:29.872
Verse 22: “Whether it was two days, 
a month, or longer, 


06:29.872 --> 06:33.009
“as long as the cloud 
stayed over the tabernacle, 


06:33.008 --> 06:36.445
“the Israelites remained encamped 
and would not depart. 


06:36.445 --> 06:40.000
But when it lifted, they would depart.”


06:41.350 --> 06:45.353
Are you working to cultivate a similar spirit 


06:45.353 --> 06:48.758
toward theocratic direction? 


06:48.758 --> 06:53.763
The Bethel family sets 
an outstanding example in this regard. 


06:53.763 --> 06:55.765
When preparing these comments, 


06:55.765 --> 07:00.670
I couldn’t help but think of an overseer 
that I worked closely with at Brooklyn Bethel 


07:00.670 --> 07:04.773
who always carried in his pocket 
a pen and a notepad. 


07:04.773 --> 07:07.910
As soon as someone asked him 
to follow through on something, 


07:07.910 --> 07:11.247
out came the pen and notepad 
and he was making a note. 


07:11.247 --> 07:14.117
And in many cases
before the day was over, 


07:14.117 --> 07:17.787
he would have followed through 
on all those action items.


07:17.787 --> 07:22.792
The principle of Luke 16:10 
was true of this brother: 


07:22.792 --> 07:27.797
“The person faithful in what is least 
is faithful also in much.” 


07:27.797 --> 07:32.269
And as a result, it’s obvious 
that Jehovah’s organization 


07:32.268 --> 07:38.240
has been able to entrust this brother 
with many weighty responsibilities. 


07:38.240 --> 07:41.177
Well, that brother is not unique. 


07:41.177 --> 07:45.615
We have many brothers and sisters 
in the worldwide brotherhood 


07:45.615 --> 07:49.218
who demonstrate such an interest 
in following through 


07:49.218 --> 07:51.386
on theocratic direction.


07:51.387 --> 07:54.757
Recently, while visiting 
a branch office in Africa, 


07:54.757 --> 07:57.860
the overseer 
of the Local Design/Construction Department 


07:57.860 --> 08:02.298
told me that his department meets 
for 15 minutes three times a week 


08:02.298 --> 08:06.835
to read out loud a portion 
of the LDC department guidelines. 


08:06.835 --> 08:10.438
If you like mnemonics, that’s the DC50. 


08:10.438 --> 08:13.275
Why does he feel that’s necessary? 


08:13.275 --> 08:17.078
As he told me, he has found that a review 


08:17.078 --> 08:19.681
with the entire department, 
of the printed direction, 


08:19.682 --> 08:23.987
helps the whole department to be sure 
they’re on the same page


08:23.987 --> 08:26.822
—that they understand the direction clearly. 


08:26.822 --> 08:29.759
The regular review 
has also brought to their attention 


08:29.758 --> 08:33.261
points that they may have overlooked 
when they first read the guidelines 


08:33.262 --> 08:35.965
or that they now understand even better 


08:35.965 --> 08:38.533
in the light of changing circumstances. 


08:38.533 --> 08:42.103
Again, another heartwarming example 


08:42.103 --> 08:45.941
of willing cooperation 
and prompt follow-through.


08:45.942 --> 08:49.245
Well, what does this teach us today? 


08:49.245 --> 08:53.348
Today, we are being provided 
with an abundance 


08:53.348 --> 08:57.185
of clear direction and timely reminders. 


08:57.185 --> 09:01.223
Jehovah is leading us through the elders, 


09:01.223 --> 09:03.258
who are taking the lead among us. 


09:03.258 --> 09:06.028
His presence is as clear to us 


09:06.028 --> 09:08.563
as it was to the Israelites 
who were following 


09:08.563 --> 09:12.835
‘the pillar of cloud by day 
and the pillar of fire by night.’


09:12.835 --> 09:15.972
So as we finish up the final leg 


09:15.972 --> 09:18.174
of our wilderness journey, 


09:18.173 --> 09:21.876
may we all be resolved to cooperate fully 


09:21.877 --> 09:31.639
with any theocratic direction we’re given.

00:01.584 --> 00:05.655
If you’d open your Bibles to Romans 12:1,

00:05.655 --> 00:08.558
we’ll note that the apostle Paul,

00:08.558 --> 00:10.794
as has been commented on,

00:10.794 --> 00:15.165
talks about reasoning on matters.

00:15.165 --> 00:18.968
That’s Romans 12:1, it says:

00:18.968 --> 00:22.439
“Therefore, I appeal to you 
by the compassions of God, brothers,

00:22.439 --> 00:25.642
“to present your bodies 
as a living sacrifice,

00:25.642 --> 00:28.278
“holy and acceptable to God,

00:28.278 --> 00:32.949
a sacred service 
with your power of reason.”

00:33.616 --> 00:38.455
Ah, so Paul says reasoning has power to it.

00:39.289 --> 00:44.160
A synonym for power is influence.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.996
And so if you reason something out,

00:46.996 --> 00:51.334
you’ll be influenced to make 
the proper decision, basically.

00:51.334 --> 00:55.004
Now, he also introduced 
something else in our text today.

00:55.004 --> 00:55.805
Let’s go there.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.708
It’s 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:58.708 --> 01:01.711
and we’ll read verses 1 and 2:

01:05.115 --> 01:07.117
“However, brothers,

01:07.117 --> 01:09.853
“concerning the presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ

01:09.853 --> 01:12.088
“and our being gathered together to him,

01:12.088 --> 01:17.093
“we ask you not to be
quickly shaken from your reason

01:17.093 --> 01:22.132
“nor to be alarmed
either by an inspired statement

01:22.132 --> 01:27.137
“or by a spoken message
or by a letter appearing to be from us,

01:27.137 --> 01:31.141
to the effect
that the day of Jehovah is here.”

01:32.442 --> 01:35.578
So he introduces this aspect

01:35.578 --> 01:39.249
of being quickly shaken

01:39.249 --> 01:42.652
once you come to a conclusion on a matter

01:42.652 --> 01:45.021
after reasoning it out.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.791
Now, he says don’t be quickly shaken

01:47.791 --> 01:50.760
once you come to a conclusion of the matter

01:50.760 --> 01:54.063
as a result of reasoning the matter out.

01:54.063 --> 01:57.967
And that’s what he was telling 
the Thessalonica congregation here.

01:57.967 --> 02:01.337
In the first letter, 
he had talked about and warned them

02:01.337 --> 02:06.109
that Jehovah’s day was imminent 
and that it was coming,

02:06.109 --> 02:09.312
and as a result, 
some in the congregation went beyond that,

02:09.312 --> 02:11.347
saying that it was here.

02:11.347 --> 02:13.349
In fact, as verse 2 says,

02:13.349 --> 02:18.288
there apparently was even a letter 
that appeared to be from Paul

02:18.288 --> 02:22.058
and saying that it’s not that it’s coming

02:22.058 --> 02:24.861
—Jehovah’s day is here.

02:24.861 --> 02:28.665
And so some got sidetracked

02:28.665 --> 02:32.268
as a result of not thinking it through,

02:32.268 --> 02:34.437
and their faith was shaken, apparently.

02:34.437 --> 02:37.106
And then as you continue,

02:37.106 --> 02:40.910
Paul then helped them 
to reason further that no,

02:40.910 --> 02:45.381
there are other things 
that have to happen before Jehovah’s day.

02:46.616 --> 02:48.952
So we’d like to talk about this matter

02:48.952 --> 02:52.622
of quickly being shaken
—that is our faith.

02:53.523 --> 02:58.528
It’s important because we spend years

02:58.528 --> 03:01.097
developing a relationship with Jehovah God

03:01.097 --> 03:03.466
and developing a solid faith,

03:03.466 --> 03:06.002
and just this idea that Paul introduces

03:06.002 --> 03:09.439
that one’s faith can be quickly shaken

03:09.439 --> 03:12.108
is a rather disconcerting thought.

03:13.810 --> 03:15.912
It can happen to any of us, really.

03:15.912 --> 03:18.381
I just think about Judas Iscariot, right?

03:18.381 --> 03:22.852
John 6:64 says 
that from the beginning Jesus knew

03:22.852 --> 03:25.855
who was the one who would betray him
—from the beginning.

03:25.855 --> 03:27.857
From the beginning of what?

03:27.857 --> 03:28.992
The Insight book says:

03:28.992 --> 03:32.295
“‘From the beginning’ 
of when Judas started to go bad,

03:32.295 --> 03:36.466
started to give in to imperfection 
and sinful inclinations.”

03:36.466 --> 03:38.902
Well, how long did that process take?

03:38.902 --> 03:42.972
Well, it was less than a year 
from the time he was appointed as an apostle.

03:42.972 --> 03:47.644
Now, we know his appointment 
was no mistake.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.847
So within that short period of time,

03:50.847 --> 03:55.852
this man went from an apostle 
to an apostate.

03:55.852 --> 04:00.056
That’s why it’s such good counsel 
that Paul gave

04:00.056 --> 04:03.593
for us not to be quickly shaken

04:03.593 --> 04:08.598
from matters that we have established
as a result of good reasoning.

04:09.499 --> 04:13.703
Now, there are times 
that we’re more susceptible

04:13.703 --> 04:18.141
to our faith
being quickly shaken than others.

04:18.141 --> 04:21.311
And I’d like to talk 
about that for just a moment.

04:21.311 --> 04:24.314
What could some of those times be?

04:24.314 --> 04:28.551
Well, it could be 
when we’re going through stress,

04:28.551 --> 04:32.922
depression, or anxiety.

04:32.922 --> 04:37.427
The March 1, 2010, Watchtower, 
makes this comment:

04:37.427 --> 04:39.896
“Judgment may be clouded

04:39.896 --> 04:44.233
when one is under great emotional stress.”

04:44.233 --> 04:46.903
Now let me give you an example

04:46.903 --> 04:49.939
—hypothetical, but here’s an example—

04:49.939 --> 04:53.977
a brother has a deep relationship 
with his parents;

04:53.977 --> 04:56.980
his mother suddenly dies.

04:56.980 --> 05:01.117
This is a great emotional blow to him;

05:01.117 --> 05:05.989
he slips into a mild depression,

05:05.989 --> 05:09.525
and as a result, his personal study

05:09.525 --> 05:14.130
and his spiritual activities slow down.

05:14.130 --> 05:18.901
Then a short time later, 
a sibling is disfellowshipped.

05:20.136 --> 05:23.339
This crushes him; he can’t sleep.

05:24.307 --> 05:27.543
He wakes up; he gets to the computer;

05:28.945 --> 05:31.347
he turns it on,

05:31.347 --> 05:34.684
and he slips into watching
something inappropriate.

05:36.119 --> 05:38.121
Now, what’s just happened?

05:38.121 --> 05:41.591
Well, his good reasoning ability was shaken.

05:41.591 --> 05:46.262
It’s of note 
that the November 15, 1992, Watchtower,

05:46.262 --> 05:48.264
puts it this way:

05:48.264 --> 05:51.467
“Severe and prolonged mental depression

05:51.467 --> 05:53.703
“may have worn away

05:53.703 --> 05:58.041
“some of the person’s normally 
strong emotional fiber

05:58.041 --> 06:02.445
or may have made it extremely difficult 
to make wise decisions.”

06:02.445 --> 06:05.114
So, what could the brother have done?

06:05.114 --> 06:09.385
Well, when he first recognized 
this mild depression

06:09.385 --> 06:13.022
or slipping from the spiritual activities,

06:13.022 --> 06:17.693
it would have been good for him to get
someone to help him identify the cause.

06:17.693 --> 06:20.830
Now, what is another circumstance

06:20.830 --> 06:25.635
that could quickly shake our faith

06:25.635 --> 06:27.637
if we’re not on guard?

06:28.438 --> 06:31.307
Well, it has to do with the apostates.

06:32.842 --> 06:37.847
Now, there is something 
that the apostates are talking about

06:37.847 --> 06:40.283
and trying to put forward.

06:40.283 --> 06:45.054
The media has picked it up; 
others have also picked it up.

06:45.054 --> 06:47.356
And that is our Scriptural position

06:47.356 --> 06:50.026
of having a two-witnesses requirement

06:50.026 --> 06:53.062
for judicial action 
if there is no confession.

06:53.062 --> 06:55.898
Now, if you open your Bibles 
to Deuteronomy 19:15,

06:55.898 --> 06:58.968
our good reasoning is pretty solid on this.

06:58.968 --> 07:01.971
At Deuteronomy 19:15,

07:01.971 --> 07:06.642
the scripture is very, very clear.

07:06.642 --> 07:10.980
It says: 
“No single witness may convict another

07:10.980 --> 07:14.283
“for any error or any sin that he may commit.

07:14.283 --> 07:16.452
“On the testimony of two witnesses

07:16.452 --> 07:18.521
“or on the testimony of three witnesses

07:18.521 --> 07:20.523
the matter should be established.”

07:20.523 --> 07:22.191
It’s very clear, isn’t it?

07:22.191 --> 07:27.096
You cannot establish 
a judicial committee based on one witness.

07:27.096 --> 07:29.899
But now, listen, 
here’s what they say:

07:29.899 --> 07:32.168
“Well now, look, 
the Old Testament

07:32.168 --> 07:36.072
“also says that adulteresses 
should be stoned.

07:37.273 --> 07:39.909
“Now, since you’re not doing that,

07:39.909 --> 07:44.580
why do you stick 
to this two-witness rule?”

07:45.715 --> 07:49.952
You see, if you’re not careful, 
that can do some tricks on your mind

07:49.952 --> 07:52.588
because you have to think it through.

07:52.588 --> 07:54.657
Well, how might we do that?

07:54.657 --> 07:57.493
Well, we go to Matthew 18:16

07:57.493 --> 08:00.763
because obviously Christ Jesus

08:00.763 --> 08:03.099
established the Christian arrangement,

08:03.099 --> 08:05.101
and notice what he said.

08:05.101 --> 08:08.738
Matthew 18:16, he says:

08:08.738 --> 08:12.508
“But if he does not listen,
take along with you one or two more,

08:12.508 --> 08:16.779
“so that on the testimony
of two or three witnesses

08:16.779 --> 08:19.949
every matter may be established.”

08:19.949 --> 08:24.987
So Christ Jesus establishes the fact
that there has to be two witnesses.

08:24.987 --> 08:28.291
Now, it doesn’t mean 
that if there is only one witness

08:28.291 --> 08:30.293
that there are no consequences.

08:30.293 --> 08:32.595
There might be, 
depending upon the situation,

08:32.595 --> 08:35.865
but the Scriptures are very clear.

08:35.865 --> 08:39.101
Before a judicial committee can be convened,

08:39.101 --> 08:43.139
there has to be a confession 
or two witnesses,

08:43.139 --> 08:46.175
so we will never change

08:46.175 --> 08:49.579
our Scriptural position on that subject.

08:49.579 --> 08:54.483
Jehovah has given us the ability 
to reason things out, to think it through.

08:54.483 --> 08:56.485
So let’s do our part

08:56.485 --> 09:00.323
and not allow our faith
to be quickly shaken.

09:00.323 --> 09:03.726
Then we can have 
the confidence that Paul spoke of

09:03.726 --> 09:06.495
at 2 Thessalonians 3:5 when he said:

09:06.495 --> 09:10.166
“May the Lord continue to guide
your hearts successfully

09:10.166 --> 09:20.570
to the love of God
and to the endurance for the Christ.”

00:01.083 --> 00:02.585
“He was at ease 


00:02.585 --> 00:04.820
“with sophisticated intellectuals 


00:04.820 --> 00:07.323
“and with humble tentmakers. 


00:07.323 --> 00:10.693
“He was persuasive to Roman dignitaries 


00:10.693 --> 00:13.363
“and to Phrygian peasants. 


00:13.363 --> 00:16.565
“His writings were motivating 
to liberal Greeks 


00:16.565 --> 00:19.568
and to conservative Jews.” 


00:19.568 --> 00:24.140
That’s how the December 1, 2005, 
issue of The Watchtower 


00:24.140 --> 00:28.478
described the inspired writer 
of today’s text.


00:28.478 --> 00:32.015
Certainly, 
the apostle Paul was a master 


00:32.015 --> 00:36.518
of becoming 
“all things to people of all sorts.” 


00:36.518 --> 00:39.788
Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 20. 


00:39.788 --> 00:42.091
We’re going to read verse 21. 


00:42.092 --> 00:46.462
With these words, 
Paul describes his commission as an apostle. 


00:46.462 --> 00:49.565
As we read Acts 20:21, 


00:49.565 --> 00:52.268
notice the broad scope of his territory 


00:52.268 --> 00:57.940
and also the purpose of his ministry. 


00:57.940 --> 01:00.210
He said: 
“But I thoroughly bore witness 


01:00.210 --> 01:02.345
“both to Jews and to Greeks 


01:02.345 --> 01:04.980
“about repentance toward God 


01:04.980 --> 01:09.018
and faith in our Lord Jesus.”


01:09.018 --> 01:11.020
Like the apostle Paul, 


01:11.020 --> 01:15.792
we too have a commission 
to preach to people of all sorts. 


01:15.792 --> 01:20.730
But is it too much to ask us 
to imitate Paul’s example? 


01:20.730 --> 01:22.732
Think about it. 


01:22.732 --> 01:25.669
Paul had the advantage 
of being well-educated. 


01:25.668 --> 01:29.838
He was part of the privileged class 
of Roman citizens. 


01:29.838 --> 01:33.943
He held a powerful position as a Pharisee. 


01:33.943 --> 01:37.946
None of us have those qualifications. 


01:37.947 --> 01:40.684
But are these the things that qualified Paul 


01:40.683 --> 01:43.151
as a minister of the good news? 


01:43.152 --> 01:46.255
It’s true, 
his being a distinguished lawyer 


01:46.255 --> 01:50.727
no doubt helped him to defend 
and legally establish the good news. 


01:50.727 --> 01:52.729
But on the other hand, 


01:52.728 --> 01:57.700
Paul’s background created obstacles 
that he had to overcome. 


01:57.700 --> 02:02.705
Only then could he preach 
to people of all sorts.


02:02.705 --> 02:05.375
Paul was a Jewish Pharisee 


02:05.375 --> 02:09.045
and that name Pharisee 
means “Separated Ones.” 


02:09.045 --> 02:12.815
This may refer to the fact 
that the Pharisees 


02:12.815 --> 02:17.787
maintained a very strict separation 
from Gentiles. 


02:17.787 --> 02:22.159
Then Jehovah picked Paul to be an apostle. 


02:22.158 --> 02:24.160
And to whom? 


02:24.160 --> 02:25.928
To the Gentiles. 


02:25.928 --> 02:28.163
No doubt, 
Paul had to do a lot of soul-searching 


02:28.163 --> 02:30.500
to overcome his former prejudices 


02:30.500 --> 02:35.003
in order to carry out 
his commission to preach.


02:35.003 --> 02:38.273
Paul’s need to make major changes 


02:38.273 --> 02:42.311
reminds me of a man 
in North Carolina some years ago. 


02:42.312 --> 02:45.715
He served as the minister 
of a large Methodist church 


02:45.715 --> 02:48.083
for over 25 years; 


02:48.083 --> 02:50.453
then he came into the truth. 


02:50.453 --> 02:54.690
This man had preached hundreds, 
if not thousands, of sermons. 


02:54.690 --> 02:56.692
With such a background, 
you would think 


02:56.692 --> 03:00.197
that public speaking 
would be easy for him. 


03:00.197 --> 03:04.434
And yet, he said 
one of the hardest things he ever had to do 


03:04.433 --> 03:08.303
was to stand up in front 
of the congregation in the Kingdom Hall 


03:08.303 --> 03:11.406
and deliver a five-minute Bible reading. 


03:11.407 --> 03:14.277
No doubt, 
the apostle Paul’s example 


03:14.277 --> 03:18.280
was a source of encouragement 
to this humble brother.


03:18.280 --> 03:20.383
Truly, 
the Kingdom good news 


03:20.383 --> 03:24.253
is a message for all peoples. 


03:24.253 --> 03:27.956
But when it comes 
to preaching the good news, 


03:27.957 --> 03:30.427
unlike many baseball caps, 


03:30.427 --> 03:33.930
one size does not fit all. 


03:33.930 --> 03:36.132
Like Paul, to be effective, 


03:36.132 --> 03:40.670
we have to be adaptable in the way 
that we present the good news. 


03:40.670 --> 03:43.573
So let’s consider three key qualities 


03:43.573 --> 03:47.243
that helped to make Paul 
an effective minister. 


03:47.243 --> 03:49.311
Paul was attentive, 


03:49.312 --> 03:51.314
he was flexible, 


03:51.313 --> 03:53.448
and he was resourceful.


03:53.448 --> 03:56.818
Consider how he was attentive. 


03:56.818 --> 04:01.823
Paul understood the background 
and the beliefs of his audience. 


04:01.823 --> 04:04.526
Consider what happened when he was asked 


04:04.527 --> 04:08.699
to appear before King Agrippa II. 


04:08.698 --> 04:12.701
Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 26. 


04:12.702 --> 04:15.237
We’re going to read verses 2 and 3, 


04:15.237 --> 04:17.374
and we notice from these verses 


04:17.373 --> 04:22.111
that Paul first commended Agrippa 
on his being well-versed 


04:22.112 --> 04:26.115
in the background 
of the people he was ruling. 


04:26.115 --> 04:30.018
Acts 26:2,3, 
it says: 


04:30.018 --> 04:32.355
“Concerning all the things 
of which I am accused 


04:32.355 --> 04:34.357
“by the Jews, King Agrippa, 


04:34.357 --> 04:37.194
“I consider myself happy 
that it is before you 


04:37.193 --> 04:39.761
“I am to make my defense this day, 


04:39.762 --> 04:43.432
“especially because you are 
an expert on all the customs 


04:43.432 --> 04:46.935
“as well as the controversies 
among the Jews. 


04:46.935 --> 04:51.000
Therefore, 
I beg you to hear me patiently.” 


04:53.743 --> 04:57.580
Paul was not trying to flatter the king. 


04:57.580 --> 05:01.250
He was simply using 
his knowledge of his audience 


05:01.250 --> 05:06.755
to establish a common ground 
on which he could begin to preach.


05:06.755 --> 05:08.758
Paul was flexible. 


05:08.758 --> 05:11.093
Consider what happened 
when he and Barnabas 


05:11.093 --> 05:13.461
entered the city of Lystra to preach. 


05:13.462 --> 05:18.134
The account is recorded 
in Acts chapter 14. 


05:18.133 --> 05:20.503
The audience that they met there in Lystra 


05:20.503 --> 05:24.073
was totally different 
from that of King Agrippa 


05:24.073 --> 05:28.410
and the one hundred dignitaries 
who may have been in the group with him. 


05:28.410 --> 05:30.413
This crowd in Lystra 


05:30.413 --> 05:32.715
was made up of a less educated 


05:32.715 --> 05:36.118
and more superstitious part 


05:36.118 --> 05:38.353
of the population. 


05:38.353 --> 05:41.556
When they healed a man 
who had been lame from birth, 


05:41.557 --> 05:43.292
the crowd cried out: 


05:43.292 --> 05:46.029
“The gods have become 
like humans and have come down to us!” 


05:46.028 --> 05:50.433
They even wanted to offer up 
sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas. 


05:50.433 --> 05:54.936
Obviously, 
Paul could not reason with those people 


05:54.937 --> 05:58.107
on the basis of their superstitions. 


05:58.107 --> 06:01.177
Rather, 
he told the crowd that he and Barnabas 


06:01.177 --> 06:03.645
were imperfect humans just like them. 


06:03.645 --> 06:08.683
And then he turned 
their attention away from puny humans 


06:08.683 --> 06:13.688
and directed it 
to the grand creation and our living God, 


06:13.688 --> 06:16.458
the one “who made the heaven and the earth 


06:16.458 --> 06:20.195
and the sea and all the things in them.” 


06:20.195 --> 06:23.565
And that was enough to restrain the crowd 


06:23.565 --> 06:26.302
from offering those sacrifices.


06:26.302 --> 06:30.840
A third quality of Paul 
was that he was resourceful. 


06:30.840 --> 06:34.510
If Paul had had the Ministry School book 
back there in the first century, 


06:34.510 --> 06:39.348
we would probably say 
that he did well on point number 46, 


06:39.348 --> 06:43.618
“Illustrations From Familiar Situations.” 


06:43.618 --> 06:47.423
Paul used common, 
easily understood illustrations 


06:47.423 --> 06:52.361
to clarify complex spiritual matters. 


06:52.362 --> 06:56.465
For example, 
the Romans were familiar with slavery. 


06:56.465 --> 06:59.602
In fact, 
many recipients of his letter to the Romans 


06:59.602 --> 07:02.272
may have themselves been slaves. 


07:02.272 --> 07:07.277
So Paul used slavery to illustrate 
the great change in ownership 


07:07.277 --> 07:11.514
that had taken place 
when these individuals became Christians. 


07:11.513 --> 07:13.515
Romans 6:18 says: 


07:13.515 --> 07:16.652
“Yes, since you were set free from sin, 


07:16.652 --> 07:21.024
you became slaves to righteousness.”


07:21.023 --> 07:23.025
Our brothers around the world 


07:23.025 --> 07:26.562
are showing themselves 
to be attentive, flexible, 


07:26.562 --> 07:31.067
and resourceful as they preach 
to people of every background imaginable. 


07:31.067 --> 07:33.102
For example, 


07:33.102 --> 07:35.104
many people in the Far East are concerned 


07:35.103 --> 07:37.206
about things that affect them personally, 


07:37.207 --> 07:41.777
such as health, 
child training, and education. 


07:41.777 --> 07:44.514
So our brothers there 
effectively use those subjects 


07:44.513 --> 07:46.915
to begin conversations. 


07:46.915 --> 07:49.518
However, 
that may not work as well 


07:49.518 --> 07:51.786
in certain cities 
in the United States 


07:51.787 --> 07:54.757
where people may be 
more concerned with corruption, 


07:54.757 --> 07:58.327
traffic congestion, and crime. 


07:58.327 --> 08:03.032
But no matter what topic 
we use to introduce the truth, 


08:03.032 --> 08:05.869
to be effective Bible teachers, 


08:05.868 --> 08:10.438
it is important for us 
to remain positive and encouraging 


08:10.438 --> 08:14.010
and to stress the practical value 


08:14.010 --> 08:17.112
of applying Bible principles.


08:17.112 --> 08:19.682
With the help of God’s holy spirit, 


08:19.682 --> 08:21.884
the apostle Paul was able to overcome 


08:21.883 --> 08:24.420
personal obstacles and prejudices 


08:24.420 --> 08:28.157
to become 
an outstanding minister of the good news. 


08:28.157 --> 08:31.327
It’s true, 
we may not meet a Roman dignitary 


08:31.327 --> 08:35.064
or a Phrygian peasant 
as we go about our territory, 


08:35.063 --> 08:37.065
but with Jehovah’s help, 


08:37.065 --> 08:40.837
we can imitate Paul’s example 
of an effective minister 


08:40.837 --> 08:45.709
by being attentive, 
flexible, and resourceful. 


08:45.708 --> 08:48.076
Why do we make this effort? 


08:48.077 --> 08:53.082
We do it because we want 
to “become all things to people of all sorts, 


08:53.082 --> 09:03.877
so that [we] 
might by all possible means save some.”

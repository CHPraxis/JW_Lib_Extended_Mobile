00:01.017 --> 00:05.055
The text and comment in today’s 
Examining the Scriptures Daily 


00:05.055 --> 00:08.290
was taken from a 
Watchtower study article with the theme 


00:08.290 --> 00:11.695
“How Can We Maintain ‘a Waiting Attitude’?” 


00:11.695 --> 00:14.797
That’s a timely question 
for all of us to ponder 


00:14.797 --> 00:16.900
because as that Watchtower said: 


00:16.900 --> 00:19.702
“Impatience can be dangerous, 


00:19.702 --> 00:22.672
for it can cause us to behave rashly.”


00:22.672 --> 00:26.042
What’s the antidote to impatience? 


00:26.042 --> 00:28.244
Open, please, 
your Bible to the theme text 


00:28.243 --> 00:32.681
for that Watchtower study 
at Micah 7:7, 


00:32.682 --> 00:35.985
and let’s read Micah 7:7 together 


00:35.985 --> 00:39.455
and consider for a few moments 
how Micah’s good example 


00:39.455 --> 00:43.593
can help us to maintain a waiting attitude. 


00:43.593 --> 00:45.961
That text reads: 


00:45.962 --> 00:50.734
“But as for me, 
I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah. 


00:50.733 --> 00:53.001
I will show a waiting attitude.” 


00:53.002 --> 00:56.005
Or as the footnote says: 
“I will wait patiently 


00:56.005 --> 00:58.273
“for the God of my salvation. 


00:58.273 --> 01:01.010
My God will hear me.” 


01:01.010 --> 01:03.680
It’s beautiful 
that in just that one verse, 


01:03.680 --> 01:08.283
three times Micah refers 
to his God—our God—Jehovah. 


01:08.283 --> 01:11.553
And that’s a nice reminder 
that no matter what the situation is 


01:11.553 --> 01:15.525
that may cause us to have feelings 
of impatience or frustration, 


01:15.525 --> 01:19.628
whenever we put a problem 
or difficulty side by side 


01:19.628 --> 01:24.066
with our God, Jehovah, 
what happens to the situation? 


01:24.067 --> 01:28.505
It appears smaller
—manageable with his help. 


01:28.505 --> 01:33.108
We might conclude, as did Brother Karl Klein 
as published in his life story, 


01:33.108 --> 01:37.280
that ‘if Jehovah permits it, 
we can take it.’ 


01:37.280 --> 01:40.950
With Jehovah’s help, we can patiently endure 


01:40.950 --> 01:44.687
any trial, circumstance, or situation 


01:44.687 --> 01:49.425
as long as necessary without losing our joy. 


01:49.425 --> 01:51.693
Micah was confident of that.


01:51.693 --> 01:54.730
Look again at chapter 7 and verse 7. 


01:54.730 --> 01:58.668
By saying that he would 
“keep on the lookout for Jehovah,” 


01:58.668 --> 02:02.405
in effect, Micah was saying 
that he was determined


02:02.405 --> 02:06.977
to become like 
an active sentry on a watchtower. 


02:06.977 --> 02:09.079
So let’s try to picture that: 


02:09.078 --> 02:14.250
A wide-eyed watchman on high alert. 


02:14.250 --> 02:17.653
That was Micah, spiritually speaking. 


02:17.653 --> 02:20.021
He was determined not to get impatient 


02:20.022 --> 02:24.194
and not to get frustrated 
with things that he could not change. 


02:24.193 --> 02:28.096
Was it easy for Micah 
to maintain a waiting attitude? 


02:28.097 --> 02:30.099
Probably not. 


02:30.098 --> 02:34.470
Notice the context that reveals 
what circumstances were like 


02:34.470 --> 02:37.907
in Israel and in Judah 
in Micah’s time. 


02:37.907 --> 02:41.010
Notice as you consider 
some of the thoughts there 


02:41.010 --> 02:44.113
beginning in verse 2 
of Micah chapter 7. 


02:44.113 --> 02:48.518
He says: “The loyal one 
has perished from the earth.” 


02:48.518 --> 02:53.421
Verse 3: “Their hands 
are expert at doing what is bad.”


02:53.422 --> 02:57.694
Verse 4: “Their best one is like thorns, 


02:57.693 --> 03:01.865
their most upright one 
is worse than a thorn hedge.” 


03:01.865 --> 03:03.867
In fact, in verse 5, he says: 


03:03.867 --> 03:07.337
“Do not put faith in your companion 
or trust a close friend. 


03:07.337 --> 03:10.740
Guard what you say to the one 
who lies in your embrace.” 


03:10.740 --> 03:14.410
Verse 6: “For a son despises his father, 


03:14.410 --> 03:16.947
“a daughter rises up against her mother, 


03:16.947 --> 03:19.949
“and a daughter-in-law 
is against her mother-in-law; 


03:19.948 --> 03:23.753
a man’s enemies 
are the men of his household.” 


03:23.753 --> 03:27.956
Yes, times were difficult 
when Micah was alive. 


03:27.957 --> 03:30.394
During wicked King Ahaz’ rule, 


03:30.393 --> 03:32.828
the spiritual and moral conditions in Israel 


03:32.828 --> 03:35.831
deteriorated to an appalling state.


03:35.832 --> 03:39.902
Can you relate to Micah’s circumstances? 


03:39.902 --> 03:43.674
All of Jehovah’s people today 
experience a test of endurance, 


03:43.673 --> 03:47.376
a test of patience, 
because we’re living in a selfish world 


03:47.377 --> 03:49.379
where, according to the Scriptures,


03:49.378 --> 03:51.746
people are “unthankful, disloyal,” 


03:51.747 --> 03:53.850
they have “no natural affection.” 


03:53.850 --> 03:57.820
True Christians are 
“objects of hatred,” as Jesus foretold. 


03:57.820 --> 04:00.990
Some of our brothers 
and sisters experience 


04:00.990 --> 04:04.793
hatred and opposition 
at school and at work 


04:04.793 --> 04:06.628
nearly every day. 


04:06.628 --> 04:09.565
Sometimes that hatred 
is within the family, 


04:09.565 --> 04:11.800
from unbelieving family members.


04:11.800 --> 04:15.772
Think, too, about the hatred 
that our brothers and sisters 


04:15.772 --> 04:18.842
have experienced who are imprisoned. 


04:18.842 --> 04:23.680
I can’t help but think 
about the two sisters in Azerbaijan, 


04:23.680 --> 04:25.948
who we’re praying fervently for 


04:25.948 --> 04:29.018
because of their unjust persecution, 


04:29.018 --> 04:32.421
or 600 more in Eritrea, 


04:32.422 --> 04:37.194
Nagorno-Karabakh, Singapore, 
South Korea, and Turkmenistan. 


04:37.193 --> 04:41.998
Those are injustices 
that we long to see corrected. 


04:41.998 --> 04:45.535
We’d love to see 
those situations changed today! 


04:45.535 --> 04:47.670
But are we impatient? 


04:47.670 --> 04:50.840
No. 
We cultivate a waiting attitude.


04:50.840 --> 04:53.777
Added to these circumstances 
are the health problems 


04:53.777 --> 04:56.412
that many of our brothers 
and sisters are facing. 


04:56.412 --> 05:00.550
These too are tests of patience, 
tests of endurance. 


05:00.550 --> 05:02.885
Maybe you’re dealing with a health challenge 


05:02.885 --> 05:04.920
or a family member or a friend of yours 


05:04.920 --> 05:09.092
is battling one of these 
to a greater or lesser degree. 


05:09.092 --> 05:12.562
It made me think of the broadcast 
for this month, for December, 


05:12.562 --> 05:15.632
where we met 
Sabina Hernandez, in Panama, 


05:15.632 --> 05:18.567
who was born with a severe handicap.


05:18.567 --> 05:22.605
Since birth, her life 
has been anything but normal. 


05:22.605 --> 05:25.007
But what an encouragement she is! 


05:25.007 --> 05:27.010
She’s come to trust in Jehovah. 


05:27.010 --> 05:29.945
Like Micah, 
she’s developed a waiting attitude, 


05:29.945 --> 05:32.615
and this sister is doing her best 


05:32.615 --> 05:35.752
to serve Jehovah 
despite her health challenge. 


05:35.752 --> 05:39.289
She looks forward to the day 
when those circumstances will change, 


05:39.288 --> 05:41.323
and we do too. 


05:41.323 --> 05:43.491
We’d love to see it today, wouldn’t we?


05:43.492 --> 05:46.262
Of course, those problems will end, 


05:46.262 --> 05:49.765
and likely it will happen 
sooner than we think. 


05:49.765 --> 05:53.002
But whether the end of our circumstances 


05:53.002 --> 05:56.705
that are so difficult 
comes today or a little later, 


05:56.705 --> 06:00.208
what can Micah’s example teach us? 


06:00.208 --> 06:02.611
Well, think a little deeper about Micah. 


06:02.612 --> 06:04.647
Micah served faithfully 


06:04.647 --> 06:08.184
for some six decades, 
some sixty years. 


06:08.183 --> 06:12.355
He did live to see the fulfillment of some 
of Jehovah’s judgement messages. 


06:12.355 --> 06:16.292
He did see some good fruitage 
from his prophesying activity. 


06:16.292 --> 06:20.397
But did Micah live to see the fulfillment 
of all of Jehovah’s promises? 


06:20.397 --> 06:22.399
No. 


06:22.398 --> 06:24.566
So, what helped him to wait patiently, 


06:24.567 --> 06:27.804
to keep active, 
to be confident in Jehovah? 


06:27.803 --> 06:29.871
It was his absolute confidence 


06:29.872 --> 06:33.944
that Jehovah would in time 
fulfill all of His promises. 


06:33.943 --> 06:36.611
He trusted completely in Him.


06:36.612 --> 06:40.182
Well, by way of a reminder, 
what two practical steps 


06:40.182 --> 06:45.054
could we do or do more fully 
that will help us to cultivate 


06:45.053 --> 06:49.558
that same trusting, 
confident waiting attitude?


06:49.558 --> 06:54.000
The first is the text found 
at 1 Thessalonians 5:17; 


06:55.665 --> 06:59.568
let’s read that together, 
1 Thessalonians 5:17. 


06:59.568 --> 07:01.570
Perhaps you have it memorized. 


07:01.570 --> 07:05.040
It’s one of the easiest verses to do that
—two words. 


07:05.040 --> 07:07.042
What does it tell us to do? 


07:07.042 --> 07:09.679
“Pray constantly.” 


07:09.678 --> 07:14.550
We need to remember that prayer 
is real communication with God. 


07:14.550 --> 07:18.220
We can never be charged 
with talking too much to Jehovah. 


07:18.220 --> 07:21.257
When it comes 
to real communication with God, 


07:21.257 --> 07:24.427
The Watchtower cited this text and said: 


07:24.427 --> 07:28.230
“He is willing to listen endlessly 
to those who do his will.” 


07:28.230 --> 07:30.232
Let’s accept that invitation. 


07:30.232 --> 07:33.135
Let’s pray constantly
about the things that distress us. 


07:33.135 --> 07:37.072
Let’s cultivate the trust 
in him by praying specifically 


07:37.072 --> 07:39.609
about the things that we need help with.


07:39.608 --> 07:41.743
But what if we pray constantly 


07:41.743 --> 07:45.681
and we’re enduring a situation 
and the problem persists? 


07:45.682 --> 07:47.684
What then? 


07:47.683 --> 07:50.000
Notice Luke 11:9, please. 


07:51.553 --> 07:55.558
Jesus’ words give us 
every reason for confidence 


07:55.558 --> 07:57.793
when it says at Luke 11:9: 


07:57.793 --> 08:02.198
“So I say to you, keep on asking, 
and it will be given you; 


08:02.198 --> 08:04.300
“keep on seeking, 
and you will find; 


08:04.300 --> 08:08.137
keep on knocking, 
and it will be opened to you.” 


08:08.137 --> 08:11.674
Yes, we want to do 
whatever is in our power 


08:11.673 --> 08:13.708
to solve our problems, 


08:13.708 --> 08:17.246
having confidence that in time Jehovah 
will give us the solution 


08:17.247 --> 08:19.849
and until then he’ll help us endure.


08:19.848 --> 08:23.853
Remember what happens to a mountain 
when it’s put next to Jehovah. 


08:23.853 --> 08:26.188
It becomes a molehill. 


08:26.188 --> 08:29.825
We need to turn mountains into molehills 


08:29.825 --> 08:33.362
by throwing our concerns 
upon Jehovah in prayer. 


08:33.362 --> 08:36.165
Micah’s confidence was not misplaced. 


08:36.165 --> 08:39.402
Soon he’ll be back with us 
in the resurrection 


08:39.402 --> 08:42.339
to witness the fulfillment of all 
of Jehovah’s promises 


08:42.338 --> 08:44.440
that he patiently waited for. 


08:44.440 --> 08:48.077
So, like him, may we curb 
our natural feelings of impatience 


08:48.077 --> 08:58.339
by keeping wide awake in faith, 
always “on the lookout for Jehovah.”

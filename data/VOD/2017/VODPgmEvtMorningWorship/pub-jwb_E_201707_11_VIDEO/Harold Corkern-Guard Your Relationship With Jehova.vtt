00:01.117 --> 00:04.554
When Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians, 


00:04.553 --> 00:07.790
it was in the year 60-61 C.E., 


00:07.790 --> 00:11.260
just similar to the time 
that he wrote Ephesians, 


00:11.260 --> 00:13.363
which we talked about yesterday. 


00:13.363 --> 00:15.598
And he wrote for similar reasons


00:15.598 --> 00:18.801
—to protect his brothers 
from the immoral environment 


00:18.802 --> 00:20.970
that was around them
and to encourage them


00:20.970 --> 00:24.173
to fight against the weaknesses
of the flesh.


00:24.173 --> 00:27.643
So let’s open our Bibles 
to Colossians chapter 3, 


00:27.643 --> 00:30.646
and we’ll read verse 5 in its entirety. 


00:30.647 --> 00:33.684
Colossians 3:5: 


00:33.683 --> 00:35.918
“Deaden, therefore, your body members 


00:35.918 --> 00:40.723
“that are on the earth 
as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, 


00:40.723 --> 00:44.960
“uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, 


00:44.960 --> 00:49.065
and greediness, which is idolatry.” 


00:49.065 --> 00:53.470
And we’ve been told 
that these expressions 


00:53.470 --> 00:57.740
convey the idea 
of totally wiping out these desires. 


00:57.740 --> 01:00.643
When we sense them 
coming up in our heart and mind, 


01:00.643 --> 01:03.480
we slay them; 
we wipe them out. 


01:03.480 --> 01:07.717
And it’s very important 
because to fail to do that 


01:07.717 --> 01:11.955
puts us into all sorts 
of difficulties with Jehovah 


01:11.955 --> 01:16.192
and with others 
and causes problems for ourselves. 


01:16.192 --> 01:18.194
Look at verse 6: 


01:18.193 --> 01:22.098
“On account of those things 
the wrath of God is coming.” 


01:22.098 --> 01:25.501
So it affects our everlasting future 
as well, doesn’t it?


01:25.502 --> 01:28.070
One thing that is highlighted here 


01:28.070 --> 01:31.407
is how serious these desires can become. 


01:31.407 --> 01:34.477
They get bound up with greediness, 


01:34.477 --> 01:38.749
covetousness, which is idolatry. 


01:38.748 --> 01:41.750
And covetousness has been described 


01:41.750 --> 01:44.220
as something that is insatiable. 


01:44.220 --> 01:47.423
It’s always after something 
that it should not have 


01:47.423 --> 01:49.425
or it does not have the right to have. 


01:49.425 --> 01:53.930
It’s ruthless and self-seeking; 
it has been defined as that. 


01:53.930 --> 01:57.067
And a covetous person, 
or a greedy person, 


01:57.067 --> 02:00.570
makes the object of his desire so strong 


02:00.570 --> 02:04.907
that in essence it can become his god. 


02:04.907 --> 02:07.777
And that reminds us of the inspired words 


02:07.777 --> 02:09.912
at Philippians 3:18, 19, 


02:09.912 --> 02:12.715
where Paul used a similar expression 


02:12.715 --> 02:16.685
about those who used to be with him 
in the truth but no longer were, 


02:16.685 --> 02:19.522
and he was very sad about that. 


02:19.522 --> 02:21.524
And what happened to them? 


02:21.523 --> 02:24.060
Well, 
“their god [became] their belly,” 


02:24.060 --> 02:29.832
and their desires overwhelmed 
even their love for Jehovah.


02:29.832 --> 02:32.002
And it was back in 1978 


02:32.002 --> 02:36.205
that The Watchtower, 
in the April 1 issue, 


02:36.205 --> 02:40.075
said this about this quality of greed


02:40.075 --> 02:42.112
—covetousness—
and idolatry. 


02:42.112 --> 02:44.114
It said this: 


02:44.113 --> 02:46.781
‘If we become aware of a wrong desire 


02:46.782 --> 02:49.419
‘building up within ourselves, 


02:49.418 --> 02:51.420
‘we do well to call to mind 


02:51.420 --> 02:54.690
‘how precious 
our relationship with God is 


02:54.690 --> 02:57.793
‘and how senseless 
it would be to forfeit this 


02:57.793 --> 03:01.530
by making oneself an idolater.’ 


03:01.530 --> 03:03.933
So that’s a very serious thought, isn’t it? 


03:03.933 --> 03:07.903
That a person 
could actually start worshipping something 


03:07.903 --> 03:10.506
other than Jehovah. 


03:10.507 --> 03:14.377
And that was a very serious sin 


03:14.377 --> 03:17.880
even in ancient Israel, wasn’t it, 
this matter of idolatry? 


03:17.880 --> 03:20.148
It carried the death penalty.


03:20.148 --> 03:23.786
But, you know, another aspect 
of the Ten Commandments 


03:23.787 --> 03:25.989
that carried the death penalty 


03:25.988 --> 03:28.023
was adultery. 


03:28.023 --> 03:31.160
So, what is the similarity 


03:31.160 --> 03:34.130
between idolatry and the death penalty 


03:34.130 --> 03:37.433
and adultery and the death penalty? 


03:37.433 --> 03:40.270
Well, worshipping an idol, 


03:40.270 --> 03:43.940
a person would break 
his covenant with Jehovah. 


03:43.940 --> 03:46.308
And committing adultery, 


03:46.308 --> 03:49.811
he would break 
his covenant with his spouse. 


03:49.812 --> 03:52.682
So why would Jehovah 
feel so strongly about that? 


03:52.682 --> 03:55.752
Well, let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 33, 


03:55.752 --> 03:59.055
and we’ll look at the kind of person 


03:59.055 --> 04:02.658
Jehovah is when it comes to his word 


04:02.658 --> 04:05.060
and what he says. 


04:05.060 --> 04:08.898
Psalm 33, let’s read verse 4: 


04:08.898 --> 04:12.601
“For the word of Jehovah is upright, 


04:12.602 --> 04:16.905
and everything he does is trustworthy.” 


04:16.905 --> 04:19.008
And then look at verse 9: 


04:19.008 --> 04:22.645
“For he spoke, and it came to be; 


04:22.645 --> 04:25.915
he commanded, and it stood firm.” 


04:25.915 --> 04:27.917
So the psalmist is saying, 


04:27.917 --> 04:31.520
“When Jehovah says something, he means it.” 


04:31.520 --> 04:33.623
And so when a person says to Jehovah, 


04:33.623 --> 04:36.993
“I’m going to worship you exclusively” 
and he doesn’t, 


04:36.993 --> 04:39.195
it’s treachery. 


04:39.195 --> 04:41.863
It’s unlike God, Jehovah. 


04:41.863 --> 04:46.535
It’s like the Devil, 
who is a liar and untrustworthy. 


04:46.535 --> 04:48.603
So it adds weight, doesn’t it, 


04:48.603 --> 04:51.440
to our desire never to fall victim 


04:51.440 --> 04:55.043
to idolatry in any form?


04:55.043 --> 04:58.815
Now, our comments in The Watchtower 


04:58.815 --> 05:03.820
(which we’ll read a little bit later today 
in the actual printed comment) 


05:03.820 --> 05:06.722
do focus on this matter of marriage 


05:06.722 --> 05:10.360
and adultery and avoiding that, 
of course. 


05:10.360 --> 05:14.897
And what we’d like to do now 
is just take a few moments 


05:14.897 --> 05:17.867
and highlight some dangers 


05:17.867 --> 05:21.704
that could come up for married people 


05:21.703 --> 05:24.506
and see how that applies 


05:24.507 --> 05:29.512
to deadening, or slaying, 
those desires 


05:29.512 --> 05:31.514
right from the very beginning 


05:31.513 --> 05:34.950
so that they do not flourish 
and cause a problem.


05:34.950 --> 05:39.488
One of the principles 
that we can think about is Proverbs 22:3. 


05:39.488 --> 05:43.158
We see “the danger,” and we turn aside. 


05:43.158 --> 05:47.363
So, what are some things 
that we could see as a danger, 


05:47.363 --> 05:52.368
identify them, and slay them 
before they become a problem? 


05:52.368 --> 05:55.738
Well, obviously, what we look at, 


05:55.738 --> 05:58.140
listen to, and read 


05:58.140 --> 06:01.277
fills our mind with either good or bad, 


06:01.277 --> 06:04.414
so we avoid intake of bad things. 


06:04.413 --> 06:07.000
It only fuels bad desires. 


06:08.417 --> 06:13.422
But research has shown 
and our publications have often commented 


06:13.422 --> 06:17.060
that when a person gets involved in adultery, 


06:17.060 --> 06:22.065
it isn’t always just a sexual greed, 


06:22.065 --> 06:24.100
or the sexual desire, 


06:24.100 --> 06:28.772
that motivates him 
to go down that path in the first place 


06:28.772 --> 06:32.575
or her to go down 
that path the first time. 


06:32.575 --> 06:34.943
Well, what is it? 


06:34.943 --> 06:38.748
Well, what is the fundamental function 
of marriage? 


06:38.748 --> 06:40.750
It has often been said 


06:40.750 --> 06:43.218
that the fundamental function of marriage 


06:43.218 --> 06:48.000
is receiving and giving emotional support. 


06:49.125 --> 06:53.228
It’s a relationship 
where a person feels loved, 


06:53.228 --> 06:58.566
appreciated, wanted, 
and needed in a very special way. 


06:58.567 --> 07:02.605
And when a person begins 
to feel that that is missing, 


07:02.605 --> 07:06.375
then they begin looking for someone 
who can give them that


07:06.375 --> 07:11.480
—not necessarily right away 
sexual gratification. 


07:11.480 --> 07:13.515
And that’s why 


07:13.515 --> 07:19.522
the Awake! of January 8, ʹ86 Awake! said 


07:19.522 --> 07:22.725
that being a good listener 
“has the capacity 


07:22.725 --> 07:26.495
“for making the other person feel 
that he is especially valued 


07:26.495 --> 07:31.367
and what he is saying 
is of concern and significance” to him. 


07:31.367 --> 07:34.904
So it’s this relationship 
that needs to be guarded


07:34.903 --> 07:36.905
—the friendship. 


07:36.905 --> 07:40.208
And the 1994 Watchtower of July 15 


07:40.208 --> 07:42.211
added weight to this comment 


07:42.212 --> 07:46.549
when it quoted a divorce attorney, 
of all people. 


07:46.548 --> 07:51.153
And he said what was 
the single biggest reason couples break up. 


07:51.153 --> 07:54.490
And this is what he said, 
it was quoted in the magazine: 


07:54.490 --> 07:57.893
“The inability 
to talk honestly with each other, 


07:57.893 --> 08:01.696
bare their souls 
and treat each other as their best friend.” 


08:01.697 --> 08:03.867
That’s the main reason. 


08:03.867 --> 08:07.504
That can often lead 
to other physical contact. 


08:07.503 --> 08:11.000
But it often is not 
the one that gets it started.


08:12.542 --> 08:15.377
So now, what can we do to avoid that? 


08:15.377 --> 08:18.180
Well, we want to treasure our relationships. 


08:18.180 --> 08:20.917
And it reminds us 
of an experience that was given 


08:20.917 --> 08:24.887
in the August 15, 2012, Watchtower, 


08:24.887 --> 08:28.859
about an elder and pioneer named Daniel 


08:28.858 --> 08:31.293
and his wife, also pioneering. 


08:31.293 --> 08:33.930
He was very involved in the congregation


08:33.930 --> 08:36.232
—always took on assignments. 


08:36.232 --> 08:38.500
He had three Bible students
—men—


08:38.500 --> 08:40.770
who got baptized, 
but they needed a lot of help; 


08:40.770 --> 08:42.772
they were newly baptized. 


08:42.772 --> 08:44.774
He was busy with other assignments. 


08:44.773 --> 08:49.045
His wife spent a lot of time 
with these newly baptized brothers. 


08:49.045 --> 08:51.480
He was neglecting his wife. 


08:51.480 --> 08:54.650
She bonded emotionally 
with one of these brothers; 


08:54.650 --> 08:57.353
adultery was committed. 


08:57.353 --> 09:03.158
But Daniel said he bore 
a heavy responsibility in that respect. 


09:03.158 --> 09:06.295
In fact, 
at the end of the lessons learned, 


09:06.295 --> 09:08.297
he said this: 


09:08.297 --> 09:11.967
“There is much more to life 
than struggling to care for privileges 


09:11.967 --> 09:14.704
to the detriment of your own family.” 


09:14.703 --> 09:17.540
So a need for balance. 


09:17.540 --> 09:20.610
Pursuing Kingdom interests, of course


09:20.610 --> 09:24.480
—and an understanding wife or husband 
can understand and support that—


09:24.480 --> 09:26.482
but there is a balance. 


09:26.482 --> 09:31.000
And if it oversteps itself, 
then real problems can result.


09:32.220 --> 09:34.890
So we want to do all we can 


09:34.890 --> 09:38.860
to slay desires 
when we sense them in ourselves. 


09:38.860 --> 09:41.230
And it’s going to take earnest effort; 


09:41.230 --> 09:43.232
it’s going to take endurance 


09:43.232 --> 09:46.002
because as long as we’re 
in this imperfect state, 


09:46.002 --> 09:50.005
no one can say, 
“I am immune to any of those desires 


09:50.005 --> 09:52.207
that could crop up at different times.” 


09:52.207 --> 09:55.144
So our love for Jehovah, 
our love for our mates, 


09:55.143 --> 09:57.546
our love for our brothers 
prevents us 


09:57.547 --> 10:00.850
from going down 
the path of greediness and idolatry, 


10:00.850 --> 10:03.118
which only results in harm. 


10:03.118 --> 10:08.090
How grateful we are to be with brothers 
and sisters like you who love Jehovah, 


10:08.090 --> 10:10.660
love their marriage mates, 
love the brotherhood, 


10:10.660 --> 10:13.395
and do all they can 
to stay morally clean! 


10:13.395 --> 10:21.655
Keep it up with Jehovah’s help.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.255
Have you ever made a bad decision? 


00:05.255 --> 00:08.425
Maybe a better question would be, 


00:08.425 --> 00:13.028
Do you remember 
the last bad decision that you made? 


00:13.028 --> 00:16.700
Most of our decisions 


00:16.700 --> 00:19.202
don’t impact our lives greatly. 


00:19.202 --> 00:23.139
A young brother 
mentioned to me some time ago 


00:23.138 --> 00:25.208
when he looked at my tie, 


00:25.208 --> 00:28.711
“You have some work to do, Brother Hyatt.” 


00:28.712 --> 00:33.282
Well, maybe that was a bad decision.


00:33.282 --> 00:36.854
But some decisions 


00:36.853 --> 00:40.256
impact our sacred service 


00:40.257 --> 00:44.060
and our relationship with Jehovah, 


00:44.060 --> 00:47.397
and that’s highlighted in today’s text. 


00:47.397 --> 00:49.732
When viewed in their context, 


00:49.732 --> 00:53.470
we quickly discern 
that the words of today’s text 


00:53.470 --> 00:56.807
were not given as commendation 


00:56.807 --> 00:59.542
or even as reassurance 


00:59.542 --> 01:03.914
but were given 
in the context of corrective counsel. 


01:03.913 --> 01:06.681
Now, who was being counseled? 


01:06.682 --> 01:08.885
King Asa, 


01:08.885 --> 01:12.988
the great-great-grandson of King David, 


01:12.988 --> 01:17.260
the third king of the kingdom of Judah. 


01:17.260 --> 01:20.197
He ruled for 41 years, 


01:20.197 --> 01:23.232
and he has the distinction of being known 


01:23.232 --> 01:27.737
as one of the faithful kings of Judah. 


01:27.737 --> 01:32.209
So with that in mind, 
the question arises, 


01:32.208 --> 01:38.246
Why would a faithful king 
need corrective counsel? 


01:38.247 --> 01:41.217
To answer the question, 
let’s turn in our Bibles 


01:41.217 --> 01:44.887
to 2 Chronicles 16:7: 


01:44.887 --> 01:47.957
“At that time Hanani the seer 


01:47.957 --> 01:52.495
“came to King Asa of Judah 
and said to him: 


01:52.495 --> 01:57.500
“‘Because you relied on the king of Syria 


01:57.500 --> 02:02.505
and did not rely on Jehovah your God,’” 


02:02.505 --> 02:07.510
so there was the bottom line
—the root of the problem, 


02:07.510 --> 02:12.515
“‘the army of the king of Syria 
has escaped out of your hand.’” 


02:12.515 --> 02:16.452
And then Hanani reminds Asa 


02:16.452 --> 02:19.789
of an earlier event. 


02:19.788 --> 02:23.626
He asks: 
“Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans 


02:23.627 --> 02:28.297
“a very great army 
with many chariots and horsemen? 


02:28.297 --> 02:31.734
“But because you relied on Jehovah, 


02:31.733 --> 02:34.503
he gave them into your hand.” 


02:34.503 --> 02:38.541
Well, sometime earlier, 
Asa and the nation of Judah 


02:38.542 --> 02:43.079
were confronted 
by Zerah the Ethiopian 


02:43.078 --> 02:46.850
and 1,000,000 troops. 


02:46.850 --> 02:51.553
How did Asa handle that crisis? 


02:51.553 --> 02:56.058
Well, he humbly prayed to Jehovah 


02:56.058 --> 02:59.361
and put himself and the nation 
in Jehovah’s hands. 


02:59.362 --> 03:03.099
And Jehovah was favorably impressed 
with that approach, 


03:03.098 --> 03:07.000
and he gave Judah the victory.


03:08.203 --> 03:13.208
Now, in this case, 
when King Baasha came against Judah, 


03:13.208 --> 03:16.411
rather than relying on Jehovah, 


03:16.412 --> 03:21.217
Asa bribed Ben-hadad. 


03:21.217 --> 03:24.354
So it was Baasha who came from Israel. 


03:24.353 --> 03:27.090
He bribed King Ben-hadad, 


03:27.090 --> 03:29.692
and it seemed to be successful. 


03:29.692 --> 03:32.062
Ben-hadad came against Baasha; 


03:32.062 --> 03:34.197
Baasha withdrew from Judah. 


03:34.197 --> 03:36.900
All was well


03:36.900 --> 03:40.737
—except that Jehovah wasn’t pleased. 


03:40.737 --> 03:45.642
Asa left Jehovah out of the equation. 


03:45.642 --> 03:50.647
So with that in mind, 
in verse 9 we have the counsel, don’t we? 


03:50.647 --> 03:54.417
“For the eyes of Jehovah 
are roving about through all the earth 


03:54.417 --> 03:57.687
“to show his strength in behalf of those 


03:57.687 --> 04:00.857
“whose heart is complete toward him. 


04:00.857 --> 04:04.260
“You have acted foolishly in this matter; 


04:04.260 --> 04:07.897
from now on there will be wars against you.” 


04:07.897 --> 04:12.000
So there was the reminder and the counsel.


04:13.568 --> 04:17.573
Why when confronted with 1,000,000 


04:17.573 --> 04:20.910
did Asa depend on Jehovah? 


04:20.910 --> 04:24.880
But when confronted by King Baasha of Israel, 


04:24.880 --> 04:27.817
he depended on himself. 


04:27.817 --> 04:31.854
Isn’t it true that when we face a situation
—a problem—


04:31.853 --> 04:34.190
and a decision must be made 


04:34.190 --> 04:38.193
but the situation 
is so much bigger than we are, 


04:38.193 --> 04:40.430
we turn to Jehovah 


04:40.430 --> 04:42.465
and we beg for his help 


04:42.465 --> 04:46.102
and for solace 
and comfort and direction? 


04:46.102 --> 04:48.839
It may be a catastrophic illness 


04:48.838 --> 04:52.508
that we know isn’t going 
to be resolved in this system. 


04:52.508 --> 04:56.445
It could be the death 
of someone close to us. 


04:56.445 --> 05:01.150
Or perhaps a family member 
or close friend is disfellowshipped. 


05:01.150 --> 05:04.020
We have no control over the situation, 


05:04.020 --> 05:07.757
and we lean on Jehovah.


05:07.757 --> 05:12.229
But other decisions may seem 
to be more within our grasp


05:12.228 --> 05:16.165
—for example, 
the selection of a marriage mate 


05:16.165 --> 05:19.602
or the choice of a career. 


05:19.602 --> 05:24.174
Maybe we came to work here. 


05:24.173 --> 05:26.508
And to help with construction, 


05:26.508 --> 05:29.611
we might have sold 
our home and cut our ties. 


05:29.612 --> 05:33.449
And now a project is nearing completion, 


05:33.448 --> 05:35.551
and we have to make decisions. 


05:35.552 --> 05:38.354
Will we go back to where we came from? 


05:38.353 --> 05:41.423
We weren’t pioneering before we came. 


05:41.423 --> 05:45.428
But now after spending 
some time here at Bethel, 


05:45.428 --> 05:47.830
we’re thinking about spiritual goals. 


05:47.830 --> 05:49.998
Can we pioneer? 


05:49.998 --> 05:52.735
Should we stay in this country? 


05:52.735 --> 05:57.673
Is it possible 
we could move to another country?


05:57.673 --> 06:01.676
If we’re not careful 
as we make these decisions, 


06:01.677 --> 06:06.349
we could leave Jehovah 
out of the equation. 


06:06.348 --> 06:08.683
So here’s a question, 


06:08.683 --> 06:13.355
How do we include Jehovah in the equation? 


06:13.355 --> 06:16.758
Well, there are three things that we can do. 


06:16.758 --> 06:19.261
The first is research. 


06:19.262 --> 06:22.765
What does Jehovah tell us in his Word 


06:22.765 --> 06:27.370
that has application 
to the situation we’re facing? 


06:27.370 --> 06:30.840
What has “the faithful and discreet slave” 


06:30.840 --> 06:33.542
told us in the publications? 


06:33.542 --> 06:37.247
Has there been an article or some direction 


06:37.247 --> 06:40.249
that would be helpful to us?


06:40.248 --> 06:45.020
A second ingredient is that of prayer, 


06:45.020 --> 06:49.425
talking with Jehovah 
about the decision that we’re making. 


06:49.425 --> 06:51.827
And keeping in mind that we don’t expect 


06:51.827 --> 06:55.164
Jehovah to do our thinking for us, 


06:55.163 --> 06:58.901
but he will help us and direct us 


06:58.902 --> 07:02.639
so that we can make a good decision.


07:02.638 --> 07:06.541
And finally, 
here in the Bethel setting 


07:06.542 --> 07:08.544
and in the congregations, 


07:08.543 --> 07:13.481
we have a wealth 
of experienced, faithful brothers and sisters 


07:13.482 --> 07:17.120
who would be more than happy 


07:17.120 --> 07:22.158
to help us benefit 
from their experience in life. 


07:22.158 --> 07:24.760
So if we do these three things


07:24.760 --> 07:27.430
—our research, prayer, 


07:27.430 --> 07:31.233
and talk with experienced, faithful ones—


07:31.233 --> 07:34.503
then we can make a good decision. 


07:34.503 --> 07:36.705
Now, here’s the question, 


07:36.705 --> 07:40.042
What is a good decision? 


07:40.042 --> 07:43.847
Wouldn’t you agree 
that ultimately a good decision 


07:43.847 --> 07:46.682
is one that Jehovah can bless? 


07:46.682 --> 07:49.419
And often we have a number of options, 


07:49.418 --> 07:52.188
and it’s not necessarily a question 


07:52.188 --> 07:55.625
of making a wrong or right decision


07:55.625 --> 07:57.627
—but what decision. 


07:57.627 --> 08:01.864
What can we do that will enhance 
our relationship with Jehovah 


08:01.863 --> 08:05.033
and give him something to bless?


08:05.033 --> 08:08.470
Now, there’s one other point in the account 


08:08.470 --> 08:11.140
that can be very encouraging to us. 


08:11.140 --> 08:14.977
If you look back at 2 Chronicles 15 


08:14.977 --> 08:20.015
and the “b” portion of verse 17. 


08:20.015 --> 08:24.387
It says: 
“Nevertheless, Asa’s heart 


08:24.387 --> 08:28.724
was complete all his life.” 


08:28.723 --> 08:31.093
That’s interesting, isn’t it? 


08:31.093 --> 08:33.228
Now, in our text for today, 


08:33.228 --> 08:35.296
we’re told that Jehovah is searching 


08:35.297 --> 08:39.669
for “those whose heart 
is complete toward him.” 


08:39.668 --> 08:42.538
Ultimately, Jehovah viewed Asa 


08:42.538 --> 08:46.208
as one “whose heart [was] complete.” 


08:46.208 --> 08:50.580
It’s comforting to know 
that Jehovah did not measure the man 


08:50.580 --> 08:54.017
because of one faulty decision; 


08:54.017 --> 08:56.519
He looked at the whole picture. 


08:56.518 --> 08:59.455
And evidently, Asa’s good qualities 


08:59.455 --> 09:01.823
and his zeal for pure worship 


09:01.823 --> 09:06.828
outweighed the bad decision 
that he made in this case. 


09:06.828 --> 09:08.830
So when we make bad decisions


09:08.830 --> 09:11.100
—and we will from time to time—


09:11.100 --> 09:13.468
then we take comfort in knowing 


09:13.468 --> 09:16.538
that Jehovah will continue 
to work with us. 


09:16.538 --> 09:19.041
And ultimately, what we want 


09:19.042 --> 09:22.979
is for Jehovah 
to look at each of us and to say, 


09:22.978 --> 09:33.706
“His or her heart is complete with me.”

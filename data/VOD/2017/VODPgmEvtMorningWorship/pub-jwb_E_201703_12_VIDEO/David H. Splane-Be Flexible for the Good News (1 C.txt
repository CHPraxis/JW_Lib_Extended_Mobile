00:01 Now, when you think of it,
00:03 the apostle Paul was a very humble man.
00:06 He was flexible.
00:09 He says: “To the Jews I became as a Jew,”
00:12 and “to those under law  I became as under law.”
00:17 But there were limits to Paul’s flexibility,
00:20 and we’re going to talk  about that in just a few moments.
00:23 First of all, though,  when Paul came down to Jerusalem,
00:27 the elders explained that thousands of Jews  had become believers
00:32 and they were all zealous for the Law.
00:35 Now, they’d heard a rumor about Paul.
00:39 They’d heard the rumor  that Paul was telling the Jews
00:42 not to circumcise their children,
00:45 and the elders were worried about it.
00:47 They had a plan.
00:49 We read about that plan in Acts chapter 21,
00:53 if you would like to turn there,
00:56 Acts 21:23, 24.
01:06 Here’s their plan:  “So do what we tell you:
01:09 “We have four men  who have put themselves under a vow.
01:15 “Take these men with you
01:17 “and cleanse yourself ceremonially  together with them
01:21 “and take care of their expenses,
01:23 “so that they may have  their heads shaved.
01:26 “Then everyone will know  that there is nothing
01:29 “to the rumors  they were told about you,
01:31 “but that you are walking orderly
01:35 and you are also keeping the Law.”
01:42 Now, it says they have heard  a rumor about you,
01:46 that you were telling Jews  not to circumcise their children.
01:48 Paul was probably not telling Jews
01:51 not to circumcise their children.
01:54 As has already been mentioned,
01:57 Paul took Timothy and circumcised him
02:00 so as not to stumble the Jews.
02:02 Paul realized that there was nothing wrong
02:06 with circumcision per se.
02:08 It was when people  proclaimed that circumcision
02:11 was necessary in order to gain salvation  that the problem arose.
02:15 So this was a rumor.
02:17 But some brothers and sisters  were willing to believe a rumor
02:21 about a faithful brother  rather than to trust Paul.
02:25 Just as today, some believe  everything they read in the newspaper
02:29 and they don’t even ask any questions.
02:32 So now here’s the question:
02:35 What were they going to do about it?
02:37 The elders had a suggestion.
02:39 They said: “We have four men  who have put themselves under a vow.”
02:44 And they wanted Paul  to take these men to the temple
02:47 and pay their expenses.
02:49 Paul agreed.
02:51 Now, that took humility.
02:53 We all know how strongly Paul felt  about keeping the Law,
02:58 and yet Paul was willing  to see the bigger picture.
03:02 He had strong feelings,  but at the same time,
03:05 these Jews were probably new in the truth,
03:08 and Paul wanted to go as far as he could go
03:11 so as not to stumble those new in the truth.
03:15 Now the vow.  What was the vow?
03:18 Most scholars agree that the vow
03:21 was probably a Nazarite vow.
03:25 And if it was,  that was going to be tricky for Paul.
03:28 Because, you see, Nazarites  were required to offer a sin offering
03:33 when their vow came to a completion.
03:35 Now, Paul would never have agreed to that.
03:37 It would have showed—
03:38 It would have shown disrespect  for the sacrifice of Christ.
03:42 So Paul and those four men  were going to have to be very careful
03:45 about how far they would go  in the completion of this vow.
03:50 And we can be sure  that they would never do anything
03:52 that would go against their conscience.
03:55 Now, we can see that on this occasion
03:58 Paul went a long way
04:00 so as not to stumble the Jews.
04:03 But on another occasion,
04:05 he refused to cater to the Jews.
04:08 We read about that in Galatians chapter 2.
04:11 Let’s turn there.
04:15 Galatians chapter 2,
04:21 and we’ll read verses 11-14.
04:26 Galatians 2:11-14:
04:30 “However, when Cephas came to Antioch,
04:33 “I resisted him face-to-face,
04:35 “because he was clearly in the wrong.
04:38 “For before certain men from James arrived,
04:42 “he used to eat with people of the nations;
04:44 “but when they arrived, he stopped doing this  and separated himself,
04:48 “fearing those of the circumcised class.
04:51 “The rest of the Jews also joined him
04:54 “in putting on this pretense,
04:56 “so that even Barnabas  was led along with them in their pretense.
05:00 “But when I saw  that they were not walking in step
05:02 “with the truth of the good news,
05:04 “I said to Cephas before them all:
05:07 “‘If you, though you are a Jew,  live as the nations do and not as Jews do,
05:11 how can you compel people of the nations  to live according to Jewish practice?’”
05:16 So we see what was happening here.
05:19 Up till the time when men from James
05:23 came down to Antioch,
05:25 Peter and Barnabas  and the other Jewish Christians
05:29 were happily eating with the Gentiles.
05:32 But now men from James came down,
05:34 and suddenly Peter
05:37 starts to separate himself from the Gentiles.
05:39 And, following his lead,
05:42 other Jewish Christians  begin doing the same thing.
05:46 Now, who was probably new in the truth?
05:50 In this case,  it was probably the Gentile Christians.
05:53 In Acts 21, it was probably  the Jews who were newer in the truth
05:57 and Paul didn’t want to stumble the Jews.
05:59 But at this point, Paul could not be  all things to all people.
06:03 He couldn’t please the Jews;
06:06 he couldn’t please the men from James  and also please the Gentiles.
06:11 He was either going to have to stumble
06:13 —if you will— the men from James,
06:15 or he was going  to have to stumble the Gentiles.
06:18 He had to make a choice.
06:20 And so Paul made his choice.
06:22 And what did he do about it?
06:24 He followed the advice
06:27 that he recorded  in this same book of Galatians.
06:30 Can you think of what that was?
06:34 Galatians chapter 6
06:36 —what is it saying?
06:39 “If a man takes a false step  before he is aware of it.”
06:43 What did Paul say about Peter?
06:45 He was not walking in step  with the good news.
06:49 So Peter was taking a false step.
06:52 “You who have spiritual qualifications,”  that would be Paul,
06:56 “try to readjust such a man  in a spirit of mildness.”
07:01 And that’s what the apostle Paul did.
07:04 Now, we love to pick on Peter.
07:08 But let’s give the poor man a break.
07:10 Let’s give him credit  for what he was doing right.
07:14 This was Antioch.
07:16 Now, what do we know about Antioch?
07:18 It was in Antioch when the whole matter
07:22 of keeping the Law blew up  in the first place.
07:25 And who was it  who were stirring things up in Antioch?
07:29 It was men from Jerusalem
07:31 —men from James.
07:34 Now, up until this point
07:36 —Peter and Barnabas and the others— they’re happily eating with the Gentiles
07:39 until men from Jerusalem come down
07:43 and start stirring up trouble.
07:46 You kind of think  that if they’d stayed home once in a while
07:49 there would have been a lot less trouble  in the Christian congregation.
07:52 So Peter was doing the right thing
07:56 up until the men from James came down.
08:00 Now, Peter knew  how critical men from James could be
08:04 —or men from Jerusalem could be.
08:07 You might say,  he’d seen that movie before
08:10 in 36 C.E.,
08:12 just after the conversion of Cornelius.
08:15 Notice a detail at Acts 11:2, 3,
08:22 and this might help us  to at least understand Peter’s concern,
08:26 and perhaps misguided effort,
08:29 not to stumble the men from James.
08:31 Acts 11:2, 3:
08:34 “So when Peter came up to Jerusalem,”
08:37 this is in 33 C.E.,
08:40 “the supporters of circumcision  began to criticize him, saying:
08:44 “‘You went into the house of men  who were not circumcised
08:47 and ate with them.’”
08:52 Well, Peter knew how sensitive Jews were
08:55 about eating with the Gentiles,
08:57 but he was moved by the fear of man.
09:00 And the apostle Paul did right
09:03 to reprove him because, after all,
09:07 he was going to have to make a choice:
09:09 You stumble the Jews  or you stumble the Gentiles.
09:13 The lesson to take away:
09:16 There are times  when you can’t please everyone.
09:19 There are times when you  cannot be all things to all people.
09:24 Our young people have to realize that.
09:27 You have to take a stand for what is right
09:29 and let the chips fall where they may.
09:32 Now, you have to appreciate the wisdom
09:35 that Jesus used in selecting Paul
09:37 as an apostle to the nations.
09:40 A note to the elders:
09:42 Paul was flexible.
09:44 He didn’t insist on his own ideas
09:47 even when he felt strongly about a matter,
09:49 and he didn’t create unnecessary issues.
09:53 Paul looked at the big picture.
09:56 What a marvelous example for us.
09:59 And we can say that humble Paul
10:01 was the right man for the job.
